            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, hauing at length finiſhed the Tranſlation of this French Treatiſe of Morall Philoſophy, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the rather to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to your Worſhips fauour, bicauſe your ſelfe did firſt commend it vnto me for the varietie of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſayings and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wherewith it is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And ſurely I perſwade my ſelfe, that howſoeuer for want of a skillfull Tranſlator it hath loſt much of that grace, which otherwiſe it might haue had, yet by reaſon of the matter it ſelfe, &amp; good diſpoſition obſerued through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole booke, it will be of ſome account with ſo many as preferre the ſoundnes of ſubſtance before the ſwelling froth of curious phraſes. True it is, that many words vſed by the Author, and retained by me, are almoſt the ſame with the originall toongs from whence they were deriued, and peraduenture will ſound harſh at the firſt in their eares that neuer heard them before; but if
<pb facs="tcp:8689:3"/>
they will haue patience a while, and let them paſſe to and fro vpon the file of their teeth, no doubt but in ſhort time they will be as ſmooth as other Greeke and Latine words which now are taken for meere Engliſh. I might heere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge reaſons to prooue the neceſſitie of retaining ſuch words in tranſlating: namely, that many of them are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names and words of Arte, that as all occupations and handicrafts haue their ſeuerall names of inſtruments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their ſcience, ſo is it with Philoſophy, and with euery part thereof: but I make no doubt of finding the Reader fauourable in this point, conſidering that it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the enriching of our owne language, and hath beene practiſed by the learned of all nations that haue gone before vs, as is euident to ſuch as are skilfull in the toongs. Concerning the profite of this booke, I referre the Reader either to the title thereof, which promiſeth no more (in my opinion) than is performed with aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the bodie of the ſame, or elſe to the Authors Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Reader, wherein he ſetteth downe a ſummarie of that doctrine, which is afterward handeled more at large. Wherein howſoeuer he hath very excellently beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe, and (as I am perſwaded) gone farre beyond thoſe that haue handled the ſame matter before him, yet conſidering each mans infirmitie to be ſuch, that he attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to perfection in any worke, neither ſpeaketh all things that are to be ſpoken of the ſame thing, nor yet is free from error in thoſe things which he ſpeaketh or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, I exhort all that ſhall peruſe this Treatiſe following, ſo farre onely to approoue euery ſentence and example of life, as it may be prooued out of the records of holie Scripture. Moreouer, as many as are deſirous to be bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the reading of this booke, they muſt thinke ſeriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly vpon that ende vnto which this Author had regard when he penned it, which was the ſame that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had <note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Eth. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>in writing his Ethicks or booke of Manners: namely, <hi>the practiſe of vertue in life, and not the bare knowledge and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation thereof in braine.</hi> And, leaſt any man ſhould haue that
<pb facs="tcp:8689:3"/>
opinion of theſe Morall precepts, which all men haue of <hi>Platoes</hi> Common-wealth, or of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Felicitie, of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> Orator, or of <hi>Moores</hi> Vtopia, that they containe in them rather an <hi>Idaea</hi> of good life, than ſuch a platforme as may be drawne from contemplation into action, he hath ioined works with words, practiſe with precept, and the fruits of rare examples with the faire flowers of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall inſtructions. But many are ſo farre from concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any ſuch excellencie in them, that ſo ſoone as they heare the name of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> they thinke they haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe to condemne as hurtfull, all the writings of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> alleadging that ſentence of S. <hi>Paule: Beware least there be any man that ſpoile you through Philoſophy:</hi> not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Apoſtle doth in the very next wordes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound himſelfe, and ſheweth that he meaneth nothing els but the deceitfull concluſions of mans reaſon, diſagreeing from the doctrine of Chriſt reuealed vnto vs in his word. I grant that the word of God is onely perfect, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it an abſolute rule both of pietie towards God, and humanitie towards men, but it followeth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we may not vſe the benefit of humane precepts, or tread in the ſteps of heathen men, ſo farre foorth as their learning and liues diſſent not from the truth of holy Scriptures. Will any man refuſe pearles bicauſe they are offered him in baſe veſſels? Or not vſe a light bicauſe it is not put into a ſiluer candleſticke? And ſhall we paſſe ouer without profite, ſo many good precepts and woorthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of learned men, bicauſe they proceede from the twilight of naturall knowledge, and not from the cleere ſunne-ſhine of the word of God? Let vs rather harken to S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his ſecond booke of Chriſtian doctrine, where he hath theſe words agreeing very fitly to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>As for thoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that are called Philoſophers, if they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de doct. chr. cap. <hi>40.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>haue vttred any truth agreeable to our faith &amp; doctrine (eſpecially the Platonists) we are not onely not to feare it, but rather to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it from them as from vniust poſſeſſors thereof. For as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians had not onely idols and heauy burdens, which the people of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8689:4"/>
               <hi>Iſraell were to detest and flye from, but alſo veſſels and ornaments of gold, ſiluer and raiment, which that people at their departure out of Egypt challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged couertly to themſelues for better vſes, although not of their owne authoritie, but by the commandement of God, &amp;c. So the doctrine of the Gentiles hath not onely counterfet and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious forgeries and heauy packs of needeles labour, which euery one of vs departing from their ſocietie vnder our Captaine Christ, ought to detest and ſhun: but alſo liberall Arts meete to ſet foorth the truth by, and certaine profitable precepts of manners, yea ſome true points concerning the worſhip of one onely God.</hi> What their knowledge was concerning themſelues, and their dutie one towards another, the whole Treatiſe following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth at large, vnto which I had rather referre you, than vſe any needeles repetition in this place. And as for that other point concerning the knowledge of one only God, it is moſt certaine, that from the light of Nature holpen with induſtrie, ſtudie, and education, (according to the wiſedome and diſpenſation of God) many notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions proceeded from ſundry of them, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> him ſelfe ſheweth by a long diſcourſe in his eight booke <hi>De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitate</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>8.</hi> de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. Dei, cap. <hi>6. 7. 8.</hi> &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>Dei,</hi> where among other he alleadgeth theſe out of <hi>Plato: That God is a ſpirite, and of a farre more excellent nature than the ſoule of man, or any other ſpirite whatſoeuer: that God is one and the ſame, and alwaies like vnto himſelfe: that God is the light of our minds, wherby we attaine to all our knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: that no man is therefore bleſſed and happy, bicauſe he hath abundance of wealth, honor, ſtrength beautie, or of any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall thing, nor yet for any gift of the mind, but bicauſe he enioyeth God the ſoueraigne Good.</hi> How diuinely doth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> write of God, and of his fatherly prouidence, in his tractate <hi>De Mundo</hi> dedicated to <hi>Alexander?</hi> I know that many with force of reaſon carying them thereunto, haue vehemently ſuſpected, that this peece of worke came neuer out of his ſhop. Which although it be granted for true, yet the book it ſelfe doth euidently declare, that the Author thereof was a meere heathen man, and directed onely by his pure Naturals when he wrote it: which being ſufficient to ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:8689:4"/>
how farre the darkenes of nature doth comprehend the light and knowledge of heauenly things, is as much as I <note place="margin">Aristotle de Mundo.</note>require. This treatiſe being wholy occupied in theſe two principall points: namely, in the deſcription of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall frame of the world, and in the declaration of the nature of God the workemaiſter thereof, I will briefly ſet before you the ſumme of the laſt part, which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher painteth out vnto vs very notably in liuely and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colours. Firſt he acknowledgeth, <hi>that all things are of God, that they conſiſt and haue their being by his power, that no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoeuer is able to continue, if it be not maintained and preſerued by him.</hi> And in ſetting out the manner of working whereby this mightie power of God is forceable in the gouernment of all things, he goeth beyond the common reach of naturall men, affirming, that although God be preſent euery where, yet not by any bodily or locall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as the common receiued opinion then was, <hi>That all things whatſoeuer we perceiue by ſight, hearing, or any other ſenſe, were full of Gods,</hi> and as <hi>Seruetus</hi> blaſphemouſly taught of late yeeres, <hi>That God was an eſſentiall part of euery creature,</hi> but that he gouerneth all things <hi>by his power and vertue,</hi> whereby he effecteth whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Againe, as he ſubſcribeth to the almightie power and prouidence of God in the being and rule of all things, ſo he laboureth to make knowne the great wiſedome of God by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the excellent courſe of nature, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine without inconſtancie, beautifull without blemiſh, &amp; diuers without diſorder. For what can be more certaine than the ordinarie courſe of the Sunne, Moone, &amp; Starres, which haue continued in their appointed race from time to time, and from one age vnto another? What greater certaintie than that which to our comfort appeereth in the mutuall turnes and returnes of times and ſeaſons, of Sommer and Winter, Spring and Autumne, day &amp; night? In regard of which conſtant continuance of the irreuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order appointed by God in this whole frame, the world is called by the Hebrewes <hi>gnolam:</hi> and in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

To conclude, there is a iustice that is neuer ſeparated from God, which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger of al tranſgreſſions committed againſt the law of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euery one muſt be well instructed that would be partaker of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicitie and happines.</hi> Now iudge, I pray you, whether a Chriſtian may not with profit enter into this ſchoole of nature, and reape commoditie by this little light of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge, which as it ſerued to make them without excuſe that were endued therewith, bicauſe they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, did not glorifie him as god, neither were thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but became vaine in their imaginations: ſo it is to be feared, that thoſe ſelfe ſame men ſhal riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs that profeſſe Chriſtianitie, and condemne vs in that great and terrible day. For how many of vs want that knowledge of the eternall power, diuinitie, &amp; prouidence of God, which was in <hi>Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle,</hi> &amp; others, endued onely with the light of nature, whereby they were led from the view of the creatures, to the conſideration of the inuiſible things of God?

thoſe ciuill apparant and halfe vertues of the Heathen, &amp;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>6.</hi> Strommat.</note> may therefore be ſent backe to learne holines of <hi>Socrates,</hi> iuſtice and innocencie of <hi>Aristides,</hi> charitie of <hi>Cymon,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right dealing of <hi>Phocion,</hi> fidelitie in perfourming promiſes of <hi>Regulus,</hi> moderation of <hi>Camillus,</hi> parſimonie of <hi>Curius,</hi> grauitie of <hi>Cato,</hi> &amp; what not of Heathen men, whoſe ſight in theſe thinges was better at midnight, than ours is at mid-day. But my meaning is not to approoue that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphal tradition of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>as the Lawe was a ſchoole-maiſter to the Iewes to leade them to Chriſt: ſo Philoſophy was to the Grecians to bring them to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now, although this erronious doctrine be as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to truth, as darkenes is to light, and as hel is to heauen, yet did <hi>Andradius</hi> defend it in a booke ſet foorth by him at their inſtigation (as himſelfe proteſteth) who were of greateſt authoritie in the late Tridentine Councell. Doth not the Lorde by the mouth of <hi>Eſay</hi> tell vs, that there is no light in them that haue not recourſe to the Lawe and to the teſtimonie, and ſpeake not according to his word? <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. 20.

Howe then dare anie profeſſing Chriſtianitie, affirme, that <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers by the light of nature, and knowledge of Philoſophie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the direction of the written word of God were made partakers of the righteouſnes that commeth by faith,</hi> and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of eternall happines? But to let this blaſphemous mouth paſſe, let vs make that account of the writings of men which they deſerue, and reape that commoditie by them, which we may without preiudice to the written word. For my meaning is not in commending <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> to giue greater credite vnto it, or further to allow the vſe thereof, than may ſtand with the maieſtie of the holy and ſacred Scripture, which being the Miſtres of all humane arts and diſciplines, vſeth them as hir handmaids to ſerue and obeie hir. Therefore as it is vnſeemly for a maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to go before hir Miſtres, to ſpeake before ſhe be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto, or to vſe three words for hir one, eſpecially in
<pb facs="tcp:8689:6"/>
companie where ſeruice and modeſtie is moſt required: ſo it beſeemeth not the ambaſſadors of Gods word (vnto whom indeed the knowledge of toongs and humane arts is a ſingular helpe) to vſe theſe gifts otherwiſe than as handmaids in their ſtudies and meditations to ſetue the Scripture to the more plaine and pure expoſition of it, ſeeing they are ſent to edifie others, and not to ſet our themſelues. Now when they ſtuffe a great part of their ſpeech with poeticall philoſophicall ſayings and examples (as alſo they are woont to alledge Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine ſentences to draw men into admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their great learning) they ſet the Miſtres behind, and giue the firſt and chiefeſt place vnto the handmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. Is not this <hi>To make the croſſe of Christ of none effect?</hi> I. <hi>Cor.</hi> I. 17. To vſe that kind of preaching that ſtandeth in the inticing ſpeech of mans wiſedome; and not in plaine euidence and power, is it not <hi>to build faith vpon the wiſedom of men, and not vpon the power of God?</hi> I. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. 5. If diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of matter and forme be vnſeemely, how vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is it in ſpirituall doctrine to vſe a carnal and humane kind of teaching, I. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13? to alay the ſtrength of the word of Chriſt with the wateriſh ſayings &amp; fables of men? to put vpon the naked and glorious face of God the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly clokes of <hi>Poets &amp; Philoſophers?</hi> When the Lorde hath ſanctified, not the corruptible ſeede of the ſayings of men, but the incorruptible ſeede of his owne moſt holy worde to the begetting of faith, are not theſe new begetters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to bring in another way of regeneration? When Gods will is to haue his children nouriſhed with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and vnmingled milke of his worde, dare man vſe the infuſion of water, to the weakening of them whome he ought to confirme? When the King hath appointed for his ſonnes and daughters the pureſt and fineſt wheate, ſhall the Steward, as if they were ſwine, prouide Acornes for them?

               </gap>uinely, exhorteth kings to loue and to ſeeke after wiſdome, that they may raigne vpon earth rightcouſly, and in heauen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally. And truly from wiſedome and philoſophie, as from a liuely fountaine, floweth the gift of gouerning by good lawes and good example, of defending by proweſſe, and of nouriſhing by wiſedome and prouidence, which are the bands of all perfection requiſite in an excellent and abſolute prince, that deſireth to gouerne his kingdome according to pietie and iuſtice. Theſe three great and excellent gifts depending of God, as euerie other grace doth, one of thoſe meanes whereby he vſeth moſt commonly to inrich them that haue the raines of worldly gouernment in their hand, is to imprint in their harts a loue and deſire of learning and ſciences. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot ſo perfectly vnderſtand them, by reaſon of their great and burden ſome charge, as priuate men may, who quietly enioying the fruit and benefit of their kings labors, addict themſelues to no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, their maieſties are ſo much the more pricked forward to loue, to inquire after, and to honor ſuch their ſubiects, as are beſt able to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eies thoſe vertuous and learned inſtructions that are drawen out of the fountains of arts and diſciplines. This mooued <hi>Antigonus king</hi> of Macedonia to write thus to <hi>Zeno</hi> the philoſopher: <hi>I am aſſured that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell thee in the goods and fauour of fortune, and in the renowne of ſuch things, but I know withall, that thou art far aboue me, and goest beyond me in that true felicitie, which conſisteth in the knowledge and diſcipline of ſtudies. Therefore I deſire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly that thou wouldest come vnto me: wherein I pray thee denie me not, that I may enioie thy conuerſation and companie, as well for mine owne profit, as for the profit of all the Macedonians my ſubjects. For he that instructeth a prince, doth alſo profit as many as are vnder his charge.</hi> This ſelfſame loue of knowledge was the cauſe, that all the feſtiuall ornaments of that great louer of vertue <hi>Ptolomie Philadelphus</hi> king of Egypt, were graue queſtions as well of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<pb facs="tcp:8689:9"/>
as of phloſophic, which he propounded to be handled and concluded by thoſe learned men, whom he ordinarily maintained in his traine. Sir, the example of theſe two noble kings ſhining wholy in you, who greatly loue and fauour learning, and the profeſſors thereof, and open the gate of that holie and vertuous diſcipline, which was ſo much cheriſhed by ancient men, that they might daily be inſtructed the better in the dutie of their charges, doth promiſe to your good ſubjects and vaſſals, that by the grace of God they ſhall ſee vnder your raigne, the euill of thoſe ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter effects defaced, which haue iſſued from theſe long troubles and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill wars. Whereof all men haue conceiued a more certaine hope, bicauſe they ſee, that you labor with a holie zeale and good affection, to reſtore pietie and iuſtice to their former ſtrength and beautie, which were in a maner buried in France: and that you haue gloriouſly crowned that worke, which that great king <hi>Francis</hi> your grandfather did happily begin, to the end that arts and ſciences might flouriſh in this kingdome. The diner of that prince of famous memorie, was a ſecond table of <hi>Salomon,</hi> vnto which reſorted from euerie nation ſuch as were beſt learned, that they might reape profit and inſtruction. Yours, Sir, being compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with thoſe, who in your preſence daily diſcourſe of, and heare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed many graue and goodly matters, ſeemeth to be a ſchoole erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to teach men that are born to vertue. And for my ſelfe, hauing ſo good hap during the aſſemblie of your Eſtates at Blois, as to be made partaker of the fruit gathered thereof, it came in my mind to offer vnto your Maieſtie a diſh of diuers fruits, which I gathered in a Platonicall garden or orchard, otherwiſe called an ACADEMIE, where I was not long ſince with certaine yoong Gentlemen of Aniou my companions, diſcourſing togither of the inſtitution in good maners, and of the means how all eſtates and conditions may liue well and happily. And although a thouſand thoughts came then into my mind to hinder my purpoſe, as the ſmall authoritie, which youth may or ought to haue in counſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ancient men: the greatnes of the matter ſubject, propounded to be handled by yeeres of ſo ſmall experience: the forgetfulnes of the beſt foundations of their diſcourſes, which for want of a rich and happie memorie might be in me: my iudgement not ſound ynough, and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion vnfit to ſet them downe in good order: briefly, the conſideration of your naturall diſpoſition and rare vertue, and of the learning which you receiue both by reading good authors, and by your familiar commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with learned and great perſonages that are neere about your Maieſtie (whereby I ſeemed to oppoſe the light of an obſcure day, full of clouds and darknes, to the bright beames of a very cleere ſhining ſunne, and to take in hand, as we ſay, to teach <hi>Minerua)</hi> I ſay all theſe reaſons being but of too great waight to make me change my opinon, yet calling to mind manie goodlie and graue ſentences taken out of ſundry Greeke and Latine Philoſophers, as alſo the woorthie examples of the liues of ancient Sages and famous men, wherewith theſe diſcourſes were inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, which might in delighting your noble mind renew your memorie
<pb facs="tcp:8689:10"/>
with thoſe notable ſayings in the praiſe of vertue and diſpraiſe of vice, which you alwaies loued to heave: and conſidering alſo that the bounty of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> that great Monarke of the Perſians was reuiued in you, who receiued with a cheerfull countenance a preſent of water of a poore laborer, when he had no need of it, thinking it to be as great an act of magnanimitie to take in good part, and to receiue cheerfully ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents offered with a hartie and good affection, as to giue great things li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, I ouercame whatſoeuer would haue ſtaied me in mine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. For I aſſured my ſelfe thus much of your bountifull &amp; roiall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (which I craue in moſt humble maner) that you would meaſure the gift and offer of this my ſmall labor, not according to the deſert thereof, or by the perſon of one of your baſeſt ſeruants and ſubjects, who preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in vnto you, but according to the excellencie of thoſe things, which you ſhall ſee handled in this Academie, and according to the ſeruiceable and moſt affectionate deſire, wherewith I dedicate and conſecrate both goods and life to your ſeruice. I beſeeth God, Sir, to preſerue your Maieſtie in great proſperitie, increaſe of honor, and continuance of a long and happie life. At Barre in the moneth of Februarie, 1577.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE PHILOSOPHERS teach vs by their writings, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth better ſhew it vnto vs, that to couet and deſire is proper to the ſoule, and that from thence all the affections and deſires of men proceede, which draw them hither and thither diuerſly, that they may attaine to that thing, which they thinke is able to lead them to the enioying of ſome good, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may line a contented and happie life. Which felicitie, the most part of men, through a falſe opinion, or ignorance rather of that which is good, and by following the inclination of their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature, do ſeeke and labor to finde in humane and earthlie things, as in riches, glorie, honor, and pleaſure. But for a ſmuch as the enioying of theſe things doth not bring with it ſufficient cauſe of contentation, they perceiue themſelues alwaies depriued of the end of their deſires, and are constrained to wander all their life time beyond all bounds and meaſure, according to the raſhnes and inconstancie of their lusts. And although they reioice for a little while at euerie new change, yet preſently they loath the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing, which not long before they earnestly deſired. Their owne estate alwaies ſeemeth vnto them to be woorst, and euerie preſent condition of life, to be burdenſome. From one estate they ſeeke after another, ſo that now they withdraw themſelues from the ſeruice of princes, and miſlike publike charges, and by and by they blame the priuate life, labouring that they may be imploied. They forſake one countrie to go and dwell in another, and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they deſire to returne againe into their former waies. They that haue neither wiues nor children, ſeeke and wiſh for them, and when they haue them, they deſire oftentimes nothing more than to be rid of them: and ſoone after ye ſhall ſee them married againe. Haue they heaped vp great ſtore of wealth, and increaſed their reuenues by halfe ſo much more? they deſire notwithstanding to make it altogither as much. The ſoldier ſeeketh to be a captain: from a captaine to be maister of the campe: from maister of the
<pb facs="tcp:8689:11"/>
campe to be lieutenant to the king: then he would gladly make himſelfe king. The ſeelie Priest would be a Curate: from a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Biſhop: from a Biſhoppe, Cardinall: from a Cardinall, Pope: and then would commaund Kings and ſoueraigne Princes. Kings are not contented to raigne ouer their owne ſubiects, but bende themſelues alwaies to enlarge their limits, to make themſelues (if they can) the onely Monarchs. Briefly, all men whoſe harts are ſet vpon worldly goods, when they are come to this estate of life, they would attaine to that: and being come thereunto, ſome other neae deſire carieth them farther, ſo that this miſchiefe of continuall, vncertaine, and vnſatiable lustes and deſires doth more and more kindle in them, vntill in the ende death cut off the thred of their inconstant, and neuer contented life. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, bicauſe the alteration of an Estate and condition of life plucketh not out of the mind that, which preſſeth and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it: namely, the ignorance of things, and imperfection of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But they, who through the ſtudie of wiſedome are furniſhed with skill and vnderstanding, and know that all humane and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things are vncertaine, deceitfull, ſlipperie, and ſo many allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto men to drawe them into a downe-fall and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they I ſay, doe laie a farre better and more certaine founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their chiefe <hi>Good,</hi> contentation, and felicitie. For they are ſo farre off from being caried away, as worldlings are, with the deſire of greatnes, riches, and pleaſure, that they rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire leſſe than they haue, contemne them, and ſo vſe them as though they had them not. And deliuering their ſoules by the grace of God, from all thoſe perturbations, which beſiege them in the priſon of their bodies, they lift vp their wiſhes and deſires, yea they refer al the endsof their intents &amp; actions to this only marke, to be vnited and ioined to the last end of their ſoueraigne <hi>Good,</hi> which is the full &amp; whole fruition of the eſſence of God, that their holy affections might be at once fulfilled and ſatisfied, by enioying that diuine light, through a moſt happie &amp; immortal life, when they ſhal be vncloathed of this body of death, &amp; of all concupiſcences &amp; paſſions, &amp; reioice in ſuch a felicitie, as neither eie hath ſeene, nor eare heard, nor euer entred into the hart of man. Moreouer we ought to know, if we haue neuer ſo litle iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; reaſon, that in al worldly things how great &amp; goodly ſoeuer they ſeeme to our carnall
<pb facs="tcp:8689:11"/>
eies &amp; ſences, there is ſuch a mixture of bitternes &amp; diſlike ioined with the fruition of them, that if we could diuide the euil from that which of the ignorant ſort is called good, &amp; weigh them one against another, there is no doubt but the bad part would eaſily weigh down what goodnes ſoeuer could be found amongſt them. But how ſhal we call that good, which is ſo mingled with euill, which oftentimes hurteth more than it profiteth, and which being poſſeſſed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, cannot yet keepe the poſſeſſor thereof from being wretched and miſerable? What contentation can a man find therein, ſeeing that ſuch a Good commonly ſlippeth away as ſoone as it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and alwaies worketh an vnſatiable deſire thereof? What feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie ſhall we expect and looke for in the fruition of that thing, which waxeth old and periſheth, and which men are alwaies afraid to looſe? Now I pray you, who can doubt iustly, but that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and nature of riches, of glorie, of honour and pleaſure is ſuch? Whereupon we muſt conclude, that man can finde no goodnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation or happines, in any thing that is earthly and mortall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, who knoweth not ſufficiently the poore estate of mans life, which in the fairest of his race commeth to nothing in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eie, ſo that all his bodily ſhewe and brightnes turneth ſuddenly into putrefaction? Who doth not try more than he would, how full his life is of ſharpe griefes, and pricking miſeries, and how it is aſſaulted with continuall troubles? With how many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing cares doth it abound, and what griping griefes doe purſue it? Briefly, as a wiſe Grecian ſaid, hauing but the bare name of life, it is in effect and truth a continuall paine. And truly that thing hath no beeing in deede, which changeth without ceaſing, as the nature of man doth, which neuer continueth in the ſame estate, no not the least moment that is. I would gladly aske of thee who readest this, or doeſt meane to reade it, what day, or what hower thou haſt paſſed, or now paſſest ouer, ſince thou hadst any iudgement or knowledge, wherein thy body hath not felt ſome griefe, or thy hart ſome paſſion? As there is no ſea without tempest, warre without danger, or iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without trauell: ſo there is no life without griefe, nor calling without enuie or care: neither did I euer ſee or know that man, who hath had no cauſe to be grieued, or to complaine. Doth not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daily teach vs, that no man liuing can make choiſe of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate void of all trouble, or flie one inconuenience, but that he is in
<pb facs="tcp:8689:12"/>
danger to fall into another? Is it not alſo most certaine, that a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ioy or proſperitie, is but a fore-warning or ſigne of ſome griefe &amp; heauie calamitie at hand? But what? Shall we for all this think man ſo miſerable, that ſailing all his life time in ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, he cannot poſſibly attaine to any ſafe hauen against the rage of them? Shall we in ſuch ſort depriue him, (during the time of his being in this world) of all <hi>Good,</hi> contentation and happines, as if there were no meanes to auoid, or at leaſtwiſe to mollifie the miſhaps and miſeries of mankind, that he faint not vnder the heauy burden of them? Wherefore then do wiſe men by ſo many learned writings inuite vs diligently to ſeeke after, and with a burning zeale to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace holy vertue, ſaying, that by hir alone a man may liue happily and contentedly in euery calling, and may enioy therein the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne <hi>Good,</hi> through the tranquillitie and reſt of his ſoule, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of perturbations by Philoſophy? Was it in vaine and fruitles, that an infinite number of famous perſonages, whom Histories, the mother of antiquitie ſet before our eies, imploied ſo great trauell, paſſed infinite watchings, for ſooke and contemned riches, pleaſures, honors, and worldly commodities, to get and treaſure vp vertue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And why do we, after their example, deſpiſe all theſe things, and ſpend that which we account moſt pretious, I meane time, that we may be adorned and cloathed with vertue, if it cannot make vs hit that marke, which euery one ſo much deſireth and ſeeketh after with ſuch great paine and labour, namely, that they may enioy ſome chiefe <hi>Good</hi> in this world, and lead thereby a contented and happy life? Be not ouertaken (friendly Reader) with this ſmal difficultie, which perhaps might cauſe a groſſe and feeble head not well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in wiſedome, to ſtagger and depart out of the right way. Now, although the heauenly word onely hath the perfect and ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of wiſedome, bicauſe he is that eternall wiſedome it ſelfe, yet man being his workmanſhip, &amp; aided with his grace must not leaue of to ſeeke for, &amp; to require earnestly of him that gift of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; participation of the ſecrets of that incomprehenſible truth, (ſo farre foorth as he may and ſhall be neceſſary for him) that his ſoule thereby may obtaine hir permanent and lasting happines. Moreouer, albeit our ſoueraigne &amp; chiefe <hi>Good,</hi> our perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation and abſolute felicitie be onely in heauen in the enioying of that diuine light, yet we must not in the meane while, (albeit we
<pb facs="tcp:8689:12"/>
cannot fully poſſeſſe that) leaue of to ſeeke without ceaſing, or giue ouer in any ſort to keepe and follow that good and infallible way of vertue, which cauſing vs to paſſe ouer quietly, and to ſustaine with ioy of ſpirite the miſeries of mankind, and appeaſing the perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our ſoules, from whence proceed all the euils that torment vs, and making them void of all damnable effects, will teach vs to lead a pleaſant, peaceable &amp; quiet life, &amp; to effect all things woorthy &amp; beſeeming this certaine hope, that we ſhal one day (by the grace of God) be framed a new in that eternal, moſt happy, &amp; contented life. Let vs therefore account this world, and all the riches thereof, as a thing belonging to an other, as a ſtraunger and nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to thoſe men, who beyng regenerated by the ſpirite of grace haue profited well in the ſchoole of wiſedome. Let vs not ſeeke for friendſhippe vpon earth: let vs not couete after riches, glory, honour and pleaſure, which none but fooles doe extoll, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and wonder at. Wee are not of this worlde, but ſtraungers onely therein, and therefore let vs ſet all worldly things behinde vs, and account them vnwoorthie the care of our immortall ſoules, if we meane not to periſh with the worlde by ioyning our ſelues there-unto. Let vs forſake it, I ſay forſake it boldly how precious ſoeuer it bee, that we may aboundantly treaſure vp that great, <note place="margin">This commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of vertue is chiefly to be vnderſtood of faith the roote of all good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note>ſweete and durable wealth, I meane vertue, which is honoured, loued, and deſired for it ſelfe onely, which is the true and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome medicine for diſeaſed ſoules, the rest of the mynde oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with care, the cauſe (by the will of GOD) of that chiefe <hi>Good</hi> wherein the principall ende of the ſoule conſisteth, and the onely aſſured guide which leadeth to the Hauen ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of euery one, namelie, the contentation of minde. Which thing this preſent Academie doth not onely ſet before our eyes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth ſaue and keepe vs beyng already entered into this Hauen of ſafetie, agaynst all tempestes, if wee will our ſelues, and not ſpare our labour to reape profite of thoſe learned and wiſe instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are here giuen vnto vs by the preceptes of doctrine, and examples of the lyues of auncient, vertuous, and famous men. For first of all wee ſhall learne hereby to know our ſelues, and the ende of our beyng. Secondly, wee ſhall bee instructed in good maners, and taught how we may liue well and happily in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery estate and condition of lyfe whatſoeuer. Yea we ſhall finde
<pb facs="tcp:8689:13"/>
in the baſest and lowest estate, which of the ignorant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of people is oftentimes called miſerable, as much ioy and happineſſe, as a Monarch can be partaker of in the fruition of his greatneſſe, yea much more than he, if he bee wicked: bicauſe vice in all Estates maketh the poſſeſſour thereof wretched, and contrarywiſe, Vertue maketh euery condition of life happy. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer wee ſhall ſee in this Academie, that euery one louyng and fearing GOD may obtaine this inestimable <hi>Good</hi> of vertue, and thereby remayne a Conquerour ouer the perturbations of his ſoule, which breede all his miſerie, remembring this poynt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, ſo farre foorth as the fraile nature of man, ayded by the Author of all goodneſſe can attayne to this perfection. Wee ſhall learne here how we ought to gouerne our ſelues wiſely and dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in all humane actions and affaires, and in all charges and places whatſoeuer, either publique or priuate whereunto we ſhall be called. We may note here cauſe of the ſubuerſion and ruine of many Empires, Estates and Common-wealths, and of the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſhew and glory of infinite others: as alſo the cauſe of the wretchedneſſe and destruction of a great number of men, and what hath lift vp others, and crowned them with honour and immortall prayſe. We ſhall bee taught here the gouernement of a houſe and familie, the maner of the education and instruction of children, the mutuall duetie of married couples, of brethren, of masters and ſeruauntes, how to commaund, and how to obey. We ſhall ſee here the order and establiſhment of policies and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorities: what is the duetie of the Heads of them, of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Gouernours of nations, as alſo what the duetie of their ſubiectes is. Briefly, both great and ſmall may drawe out from hence the doctrine and knowledge of thoſe things which are most neceſſarie for the gouernement of a houſe, and of a Common-wealth, with ſufficient instruction how to frame their life and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the moulde and paterne of true and holy vertue, and how by meanes thereof, (the grace of GOD woorking in them) they may runne the race of their dayes in ioy, happineſſe, rest and tranquillitie of ſpirite, and that in the middest of greatest aduerſities, which the vncertaintie and continuall chaunge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things may bring vpon them. Nowe bicauſe the ſequele compounded of the ſundrie treatiſes and diſcourſes of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy,
<pb facs="tcp:8689:13"/>
will ſufficiently instruct thee in all things aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as it promiſeth in the fore-front and title thereof, I will not dilate this matter any farther, but only deſire of thee (Reader) patiently to heare theſe Academicall ſtudents, from the first of their diſcourſes vnto the last. Their intent was only (as thou maieſt vnderstand more at large in the entrance of their aſſembly) to teach themſelues, and next euery one according to their abilitie, the institution of good maners, and rule of good lining, for all ordinarie and common estates and conditions of life in our French Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, to the ende that euery member of this politike body (brought thus low with euils, and beaten with tempestuous ſtormes) might ſomewhat helpe and profite it by their counſels and instructions. And this thou mayest do (friendly Reader) if thou takest payns to read well, to vnderstand better, and (which is best of all) to follow the precepts, instructions and examples, which thou ſhalt find here: as alſo, if thou bringest hither a good will and cheerefull diſpoſition, voyd of all malicious enuy, which at this day is commonly practiſed by most men of this our age (who like to malicious Cenſorers) bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie themſelues rather in ſeeking out what to bite at, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in other mens workes, than to draw out, and to commend that which is good, or to aſſay to make them better. Beſides, thou ſhalt haue ſomewhat to commend in the order of theſe diſcourſes, and in the maner of teaching which is in them. For after the handling of that knowledge which is eſpecially neceſſary for man, all thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues follow which he ought to imbrace, and thoſe vices which he is to ſhun. Next, he is instructed in that which concerneth houſe-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: then in that which hath reſpect to estates and policies, &amp; last of all how he may die well, after he hath liued well. As for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of teaching, which is diligently obſerued by theſe Academikes, thou ſhalt ſee that first they prayſe that vertue, or diſprayſe that vice which they propound to themſelues to diſcourſe vpon, that they may mooue and frame mens minds as well to hate the one as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the other. Then they define that wherof they diſcourſe, that the end of the preſent ſubiect may be better knowen. Afterward, they giue precepts to find out the means wherby to attaine to that which is <hi>Good,</hi> and to eſchew the euil. Lastly, they adde examples, which are liuely reaſons, and of great waight to mooue men with delight to embrace vertue and to flie vice. Now if thou thinkest that too
<pb facs="tcp:8689:14"/>

Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it may well be, that that which thou findest not ſufficiently fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in one place may be learned in another, if thou lookest vnto the end. Moreouer they who are here named, and who mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine alwayes the name of diſciples, neuer purpoſed or preſumed to ſet downe reſolutions, or to appoint lawes which are neceſſarily to be kept, and may not be changed in any wiſe by thoſe that are cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, according to the occurrence &amp; benefit of the estate of this Monarchie, but grounding their counſels and instructions vpon the ſoundest and most approoued opinion of the writings of learned men, both of auncient and late times, and vpon ſuch as drew neereſt to the infallible rule of the holy ſcriptures according to the ſmall meaſure of graces giuen them from aboue, they haue left to euery one (following therein the ancient ſchoole of the Academikes) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to compare the motiues of the one ſide, with the reaſons on the other, that the truth of all things might be diligently ſearched out and inquired after, that none through any head-strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit ſhould be wedded to priuate opinions: and that afterward choiſe might be made of the best, and of ſuch as are most certain, therby to order and rule all intents and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to referre them to the perpetuall glory of that great Lord of Hierarchies, who is the onely cauſe and chiefe fountain of all <hi>Good,</hi> contentation, and happineſſe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen GOD by his infinite and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable goodnes, beholding with a fatherly, bountifull, and pitifull eie our poore France (which moſt cruel againſt it ſelfe, ſeemed to run amain moſt furiouſly to throw it ſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the center of ſome bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe gulfe) had ſent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the wiſhed-for newes of peace in the midſt of ciuill and domeſticall armies, (which a man might ſay were of purpoſe prepared for the finall ouerthrow of this French Monarchie, that hath floriſhed ſo long time) ſparing by his heauenlie grace and fauor, and that in deſpite of them, the bloud of thoſe men, who held foorth their right hand to cut off the left, among manie, who touched with the loue of their countrie, and with true zeale to pietie, reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at this ſo well liking and healthfull newes, fower yong gentlemen of Aniou, who came togither to ſerue their Prince, and to ſacrifice their liues, if need required, for the welfare and ſafetie of the Common wealth, were none of the laſt that ſought out one another, and met togither to teſtifie ech to other (as their mutuall kindred and ſworne frendſhip did inuite them) the ioy, which filled their ſouls, ariſing of ſo happie and vnlooked for ſucceſſe and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affaires: to the end alſo that they might giue glorie and praiſe to him, who for the benefit of his, knoweth wel how to take order euen in thoſe things, which according to the iudgement of men are deſperate and paſt recouery. And that which gaue them greater occaſion to reioice for this peace, and ſo diligently to ſeeke out one another was this, bicauſe contratie to hope, they ſaw the meanes offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8689:16"/>
them to returne home, and to continue an exerciſe that greatly pleaſed them, which not long before the laſt fal of France into troubles they had happily begun. Now to let you (readers) vnderſtand what this exerciſe was, theſe fower gentlemen being of kin, and neere neighbors, and in a maner of one age, were by the care and prudence of their fathers brought vp and nouriſhed togither from their yoong yeeres in the ſtudie of good letters, in the houſe of an ancient wiſe gentleman of great calling, who was the principall ſtocke and roote of theſe fruitfull buds. This man by reaſon of his manifold experience, and long abode in ſtrange countries, knew that the common cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of French youth, of it ſelfe inclined to pleaſure, proceeded chiefly from the ouer great licence, and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue libertie granted vnto them in the Vniuerſities of this Realme, as well through the fault and negligence of the gouernors and tutors in them, as alſo bicauſe of the euill gouernment of the townes at this day. He knew alſo that they were no leſſe abuſed, who thinking to auoide this dangerous downe-fall at home, did ſend their children to ſtudie abroad amongſt ſtrangers, where the traffike and merchandiſe of miſchiefs is more common and eaſie to be made, bicauſe they feare not that newes will preſently, or ſo ſpeedily be caried to their parents, as if they were neere vnto them. Oh how well woorthie of eternall praiſe is the prudence of this gentleman, bringing to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <hi>Eteocles</hi> one of the moſt noble Ephories of Lacedemonia, who freely anſwered <hi>Antipater</hi> asking fiftie pledges, that he would not giue him children, leaſt if they were brought vp farre from their fathers, they ſhould change the ancient cuſtome of liuing vſed in their owne countrie, and become vicious: but of olde men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he would giue him double the number, if he would haue them. Wherevpon being threatened by this king, if he ſpeedily ſent him not of the youth: we care not (quoth he) for threatenings. For if thou command vs to do things that are more greeuous than death, we will rather chooſe death: ſo carefull were the men of old time, that the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8689:16"/>
and trimming of theſe yoong plants ſhould not be out of their preſence. But let vs go on with our matter. This good and notable old man hauing ſpent the greater part of his yeeres in the ſeruice of two kings, and of his country, and for many good cauſes withdrawen himſelfe to his houſe, thought that to content his mind, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies delighted in honeſt and vertuous things, he could not bring greater profit to the Monarchie of France, than to lay open a way and meane to preſerue and keepe youth from ſuch a pernicious and cancred corruption, by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe for example to all fathers, and ſhewing them the way to haue a more carefull eie in the inſtruction of their children, and not ſo lightly to commit them to the diſcipline of vices, by the hands of mercenarie and hired ſtrangers. And this was begun vpon theſe fower yoong gentlemen, whom he tooke to his owne houſe, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their parents, offering himſelfe to the vttermoſt of his power, to helpe their gentle nature, which appeered in them woorthie their anceſtors, by training it vp, firſt in the feare of God, as being the beginning of al wiſedome: ſecondly, in humane learning and knowledge, which are neceſſarie helps to liue well and happily, to the benefit of the ſocietie of men. To this end, after that he himſelfe had ſhewed them the firſt grounds of true wiſedome, and of al things neceſſarie for their ſaluation, according to the meaſure of grace giuen him from aboue, and as their age could conceiue them, he labored earneſtly to haue in his houſe ſome man of great learning, and wel reported of for his good life and conuerſation, vnto whom he committed the inſtruction of this yoong Nobilitie. Who behaued himſelfe ſo wel in his charge, that not greatly ſtaying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the long degrees of learning, which being ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and vſuall in our French Colledges, are often more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious (beſides loſſe of time) than profitable to youth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had indifferently taught his ſchollers the Latine toong, and ſome ſmackering of the Greeke, he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the chiefe part and portion of their ſtudies the morall philoſophie of aucient Sages and wiſe men, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8689:17"/>
with the vnderſtanding, &amp; ſearching out of hiſtories, which are the light of life: therein following the intent and will both of him that ſet him on worke, and alſo of the parents of this Nobilitie, who deſired to ſee their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not great Orators, ſuttle Logitians, learned Lawi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or curious Mathematicians, but onely ſufficiently taught in the doctrine of good liuing, following the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſteps of vertue, by the knowledge of things paſt from the firſt ages vntill this preſent: that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all to the glorie of the diuine maieſtie, and to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and vtilitie as well of themſelues as of their country. And yet in the meane while theſe noble &amp; toward youths were not depriued of other exerciſes meete for them, which (as the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) are very profitable for this age, and helpe much to quicken the ſpirits of yoong men, and to make their bodies which are weake by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more ſtrong and apt to ſuſtaine trauell: as namely, to ride horſes, to run at the ring, to fight at barriers, to applie themſelues to all kind of weapons, and to followe the chace of beaſts. All which exerciſes this wiſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Knight did intermingle with their earneſt ſtudies by way of recreation, himſelfe ſtanding them in ſteade of a maiſter. For in ſuch exerciſes he was as fully furniſhed as is to be wiſhed in a man of valure and actiuitie, inſomuch that he was more expert than many of our time, who make no other profeſſion. Now this ſchoole hauing been continued for the ſpace of ſixe or ſeauen yeeres, to the great profit of this nobilitie of Aniou, the fower fathers on a day tooke their iournie to viſite this good old man, and to ſee their children. And after the vſuall welcome, which is betweene kinſfolks and friends, they diſcourſed togither of the corruption, which then was in all eſtates of France, wherevpon they foreſawe (as they ſaid) ſome great ſtorme at hand, if euerie one did not put to his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand for the correction and reformation of them, but chiefly the ſecular power authoriſed of God for this purpoſe. They alledged for witnes of their ſaying many examples of ancient eſtates, common-wealths and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8689:17"/>
which were fallen from the height of glorie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie into a generall ſubuerſion and ouerthrow, by reaſon of vices raigning in them vnpuniſhed. And thus continuing their ſpeech from one thing to another, they fell in talke of the corrupt maners that might particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be noted in all, and thoſe maintained by authoritie and with commendation, inſomuch that both great and ſmal endeuored to diſguiſe vice with the name of vertue. In fine they were of opinion to heare their children diſcourſe heervpon, that they might know and iudge, whether they had profited ſo wel in the inſtitution of good maners (the rule of good life) by folowing of vertue, and by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of hiſtories (the patterne of the time paſt for the better ordering of the time preſent) as their maiſter, who was preſent at the diſcourſes of theſe ancient gentlemen, did aſſure them, by intermingling the praiſes of his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the midſt of their graue talke, and vaunting that they were well armed to reſiſt the corruption of this age. For truly vertue purchaſed and gotten by practiſe, is of no leſſe power againſt all contagion of wickednes, than preſeruatiues well compounded are of force in a plague time to preſerue in good helth the inhabitants of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and as heeretofore that famous phyſicion <hi>Hippocrates</hi> preſerued his citie of Coos from a mortalitie that was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall throughout all Grecia, by counſelling his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to kindle many fires in all publike places, to the end thereby to purifie the aire: euen ſo whoſoeuer hath his ſoule poſſeſſed, and his hart well armed with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and power of vertue, he ſhal eſcape the dangers of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and eſchew all contagion of euill maners. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the intent and deſire of our good old men, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſmall skil in the Latine tong, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to haue their children diſcourſe in their owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall toong, of all matters that might ſerue for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reformation of euerie eſtate and calling, in ſuch order and method, as themſelues with their foreſaid mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould thinke beſt. For this purpoſe they had two howers in the morning granted vnto them, wherein they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8689:18"/>
ſhould be heard, and as much after dinner, which was to each of them one hower in a day to ſpeake in. You may gheſſe (gentle readers) whether this liuely youth did not beſtow the reſt of the day, yea oftentimes the whole night vpon the well ſtudying of that which they purpoſed to handle, and with what cheerfulnes of hart, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mind they preſented themſelues before the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable preſence of their fathers, who were ſo greatly deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in hearing them, that for the moſt part in ſtead of fower howers a day before mentioned, they beſtowed ſixe or eight. For after they had heard the two firſt diſcourſe one morning, they had not the patience to refer the reſt of that matter vnto the afternoone, when the other twain of their children ſhould be heard, but commonly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them preſently to enter the liſts, and to proceed, as being iealous ouer their glorie in regard of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. In this commendable maner of paſſing their time they continued certaine daies. But the ſudden and ſorrowfull newes of the laſt frantike returne of France into ciuill war brake vp their happie aſſemblie, to the end that theſe noble youths, betaking themſelues to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice due to their prince, and to the welfare and ſafetie of their countrie, might make triall of their firſt feates of armes, wherein they wanted neither readines, nor valure of hart, which being naturally in them was alſo increaſed by the knowledge of philoſophie. The ſtudie whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) to a ſeparation of the ſoule from the bodie, ſtandeth wiſe men in ſtead of an exerciſe to die without feare, when dutie requireth it, and cauſeth them to eſteeme of death, as of the cauſe of the true and perfect good of the ſoule. For which reaſon, <hi>Socrates, Xenophon, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitas, Thucidides, Thales, Epaminondas,</hi> and a million of other famous men, learned philoſophers, and hiſtoriographers hauing charge of armies, neuer doubted, or feared in any ſort to offer themſelues cheerfully vnto all perils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, when the queſtion and contention was for publike benefit and ſafetie, and in a iuſt war, without which a wiſe man neuer ought to fight. Yea I dare boldly ſay, that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8689:18"/>
greateſt, and moſt famous exploits of warfare, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued for the moſt part by them and their like. Which ſerued well for a ſpurre to our yoong Angeuins to cauſe them to vndertake this iournie with ioy and cheerfulnes of ſpirit, being reſolued to follow with all their might the examples of ſuch great and notable perſonages, as hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the treaſurie of time, did call to their remembrance. When they were in the campe, each of them according to his particular affection ranged himſelfe vnder ſundry cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of great Lords and good captaines. But, as we ſaid in the beginning, after news of the peace proclaimed, which was ſo greatly looked for, and deſired of all good men, they labored foorthwith to meete togither, knowing that their ioint-returne would be acceptable to their friends, eſpecially to that good olde-man by whome they were brought vp. Moreouer they deliberated with themſelues as ſoone as they were arriued at the old mans houſe, to giue their fathers to vnderſtand thereof, to the end they might be certified from them, whether it were their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to haue them reiterate and continue in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the morall diſcourſes begun by them, as we learned before, that they might bee refreſhed with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their ſtudies, and thereby alſo keepe faſt for euer thoſe good inſtructions, which by the daily trauell of ſo manie yeeres they had drawen out of the fountaine of learning and knowledge. As it was deuiſed by them, the execution therof followed, ſo that all theſe good old-men being aſſembled togither, taking vp their firſt order, and conferring anew of the ſame matters, daily met in a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king place couered ouer in the midſt with a goodly green Arbour, alotting for this exerciſe from eight to ten in the morning, and from two to fower in the afternoone. Thus they continued this exerciſe for the ſpace of three whole weekes, which make eighteene daies works, beſides the three Saboth daies, ſet apart by them, that they might reſt and ceaſe from their ſtudies, and attend the better to the chiefe point of that holie daies inſtitution, which is to the contemplation, and conſideration of the works of God,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8689:19"/>
of his law, and of his praiſes. During which time it was my good hap to be one of the companie when they began their diſcourſes, at which I ſo greatly woondred, that I thought them worthie to be publiſhed abroad, as well to enrich our French toong with an infinit number of graue ſentences, and ſpeeches worthie to be remembred, being drawen out of the fountaine of Greeke and Latine arts and diſciplines, through the incredible labour of theſe youths, louers of vertue, as alſo to awake and ſtirre vp by their example all the Nobilitie with a ielouſie and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of glorie, gotten by the ſame vertue. For onely vertue is able to guide and conduct gentlemen to honor, for the obtaining whereof (as they ſay) they contend and fight ſo often, and can alſo reſtore them to the fruition of their firſt rights of authoritie, and goodlie priuileges, whereby (as we read of the ancient Romans) ſuch as were moſt worthie amongſt the Nobilitie were choſen to attend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe three things: namely, to the ſeruice of God, which is to gouerne, as the ſcripture ſpeaketh: ſecondly to the adminiſtration of lawes and iuſtice, which is the piller of kingdoms: and laſtly to the tuition and defence of the Common-wealth by armes, which is the aſſurance therof againſt all practiſes and aſſaults of the enimie. Of which three excellent adminiſtrations, neceſſarie for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing and maintenance of all eſtates and common-wealths, the moſt part of our Nobilitie retaineth the laſt onely, which likewiſe they ſeeme to deſpiſe in a maner, ſubmitting to their great ſhame, by reaſon of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and weltring in delights and pleaſure, their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, honor, goods, and life, to the opinion and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe whom nature and right had ſubiected to them. But marke how we deuiſed to proceed in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes: to wit, that three of vs one after another ſhould vtter ſome ſentence or memorable ſaying, in the praiſe of that vertue, or diſpraiſe
of that vice, whereof we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to ſpeake, and that the fourth ſhould make a whole diſcourſe of that matter. Which being ended, he ſhould begin the firſt propoſition of the ſecond treatiſe, and two
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8689:19"/>
others ſhould followe him therein: then the laſt ſhould make the ſecond whole diſcourſe for that morning. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the afternoone, the ſame partie was to lay open that matter, which was to be intreated of, and two others continuing it, one of thoſe, who in the morning did onely propound, ſhould diſcourſe in his turne: and then giuing vnto his companions new matter ſubiect, he which as yet had not diſcourſed at all, was to handle it, and ſo to make an end for that day. And thus all fower of vs followed the ſame order daily, vntil euerie one in his courſe had intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to appointment, both by the precepts of doctrine, as alſo by the examples of the liues of ancient Sages and famous men, of all things neceſſarie for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of maners, and happie life of all eſtates and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in this French Monarchie. But bicauſe I knowe not whether, in naming my companions by their proper names, ſuppoſing therby to honor them, as in deede they deſerue it, I ſhould diſpleaſe them, (which thing I would not ſo much as thinke) I haue determined to do as they that play on a Theater, who vnder borrowed masks and diſguiſed apparell, do repreſent the true perſonages of thoſe whom they haue vndertaken to bring on the ſtage. I will therefore call them by names very agreeable to their skill and nature: the firſt, ASER, which ſignifieth <hi>Felicity:</hi> the ſecond, AMANA, which is as much to ſay as <hi>Truth:</hi> the third, ARAM, which noteth vnto vs <hi>Highnes:</hi> and to agree with them as well in name, as in education and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior, I will name my ſelfe ACHITOB, which is all one with <hi>Brother of goodnes.</hi> Further more I will call and honor the proceeding and finiſhing of our ſundrie treatiſes and diſcourſes with this goodlie and excellent title of <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> which was the ancient &amp; renowmed ſchoole amongſt the Greeke Philoſophers, who were the firſt that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and that place where <hi>Plato, Xenophon, Polemon, Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates,</hi> and many other excellent perſonages, afterward called Academiks, did propound &amp; diſcourſe of al things meet for the inſtruction and teaching of wiſedome: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we purpoſed to followe them to our power, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele

                     <note place="margin">To knowo our ſelues is true wiſedome.</note> Truely yee haue reaſon (companions) to begin our happie aſſembly with that knowledge, which we ought to haue of our ſelues, as being the ſtorehouſe of all wiſdome, and beginning of ſaluation: wherof we may haue an aſſured teſtimonie from that father of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie <hi>Socrates,</hi> who beholding the firſt precept written at Delphos in that temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which was ſo renowmed throughout Graecia, namely, <hi>Know thy ſelfe,</hi> was foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with driuen into a very deepe cogitation, and being rapt with contemplation of ſpirit, he began from that time forward to doubt and to inquire of himſelfe. Wherupon contemning that way, which all the Philoſophers of his time, who buſied themſelues about nothing, but onely in finding out the cauſes of naturall things, and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8689:21"/>
curiouſly of them, he gaue himſelfe wholie to the <note place="margin">The ſoule is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man.</note>knowledge of himſelfe, I meane of his ſoule, which he maintained to be in deed man, and by diſputuation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the ſoueraigne good thereof, and of vertue. By which meanes the gate of wiſedome was opened vnto him, wherein he profited in ſuch ſort, that according to <note place="margin">Socrates was called the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie.</note>the oracle at Delphos, he was called of all men the wiſe, the iuſt, the prince of Philoſophers, and father of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie. And ſurely out of his ſayings, which being more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine than humane, were written by his diſciples, all other Philoſophers haue drawne their knowledge. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> another excellent man, minding to giue out in ſpeech that he had done ſome notable act, woorthy of himſelfe, ſaid: I haue ſought my ſelfe. Which beginning truely is verie necaſſarie for man, as being a guide to leade him to the true knowledge of God, which is a heauenly gifte of God, and peculiar to his. And this is learnedly taught vs by the ſame <hi>Socrates,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>that the dutie of a wiſe man is to ſeeke out the reaſons of things, that in the ende he may finde that diuine reaſon wherby they were made: and hauing found it, may worſhip and ſerue it, that afterward he may enioy it, and</hi>

                     <hi>reape profite thereby.</hi> Moreouer he addeth, <hi>that the perfect knowledge of ones ſelfe, which conſiſteth in the ſoule, is in ſuch ſort ioined with the knowledge of God, that the one without the other cannot be ſincere and perfect.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon, <hi>Plato,</hi> his diſciple, who for the excellencie of his writings was <note place="margin">Wherin the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note>ſurnamed the <hi>Diuins,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the perfect dutie of man is, firſt to know his owne nature: then to contemplate the diuine nature: and last of all to beſtow his labour in thoſe things, which may be moſt beneficiall to all men.</hi> Ignorance of a mans ſelfe (ſaith <note place="margin">Ignorance of our ſelues the cauſe of much euill.</note>
                     <hi>Lactantius)</hi> and the want of knowledge wherefore and to what end he is borne, is the cauſe of error, of euill, of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the right way to follow the crooked, of wandring out of the plaine way to walke in the ragged and vnee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen way, or vpon a dangerous and ſlipperie mountaine: and laſtly, of forſaking the light to walke in darknes. Now if we account it a ſhamefull thing to be ignorant of thoſe things which belong to the life of man, ſurely the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8689:21"/>
not knowing of our ſelues is much more diſhoneſt. Let vs then conſider what man is, according to that meane knowledge, which by the grace of God we are endued withal, not ſtaying in thoſe curious definitions, which the Philoſophers haue made. Man is a creature made of God <note place="margin">What man is. Gen. 1. Col. 3.</note>after his owne image, iuſt, holy, good and right by nature, and compounded of ſoule and body. I ſay of ſoule, which was inſpired of God with ſpirite and life, and of a perfect naturall bodie, framed of the earth by the ſame power of God. In this ſort man had his beeing of the eternal work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of the whole world, of whom he was created by his incomprehenſible goodnes, to be made partaker of his immortalitie and permanent felicitie, for this onely ende to ſet foorth the glorie of his Creator, and to ſpeake <note place="margin">The ende of mans being.</note>and do thoſe things that are agreeable vnto him, through the acknowledgement of his benefits. From which ende man being fallen of his own free wil through ingratitude and diſobedience, was bereaued of all thoſe ornaments, which he had receiued before of God, and in ſteede of righteouſnes and holines, all iniquitie, filthines and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes entred into him: wherby he was made the ſlaue of ſinne and of death, from whence all thoſe miſeries had their beginning, wherewith the life of man is ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. His ſoule alſo, was wrapped with infinite hurtfull paſſions, and perturbations, which worke in it a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſquietnes, and his body became ſubiect to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable trauailes, and violent vntowardnes. Of which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption the ancient Philoſophers had great and aſſured knowledge, but the firſt and true cauſe therof, which was ſinne, and the voluntarie fall of man, with his reſtoring vnto grace by the vnſpeakeable goodnes and mercie of his Creator, from whence he was fallen, were alwaies hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from them, (as we ſhall ſee anon) as alſo from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of men, who liuing holily according to the world neuer had the perfect knowledge of God in his eternall ſonne. As for any good thing whatſoeuer they vttered, or found out, it came through earneſtnes of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, by diſcourſing and conſidering in the reaſonable part
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8689:22"/>
of their ſoule, of thoſe things which offred themſelues to their minde. But foraſmuch as they were not wholy ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in euery part of reaſon, and yet had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the heauenly word Ieſus Chriſt, they vttered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things contrarie one to another: and in the midſt of their great and woonderfull skill (according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, <hi>who hideth his ſecrets from the prudent and reueleth them to babes)</hi> they had a continuall troubled ſpirit, wandring here and there aſwell in the ſeeking out of themſelues and of the cauſes of naturall things, as of thoſe things which are aboue nature. And truely, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of man, naturally ingraffed in his hart, which ſo farre foorth as he is man, and according to his habilitie and <note place="margin">There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon in man.</note>maner of life he imitateth and followeth, is diuers from that which by ſpeciall grace from aboue commeth to the elect, accompanieth them, and helpeth them in all their actions. This is full of faith, and of vndeceaueable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of eternal promiſes: the other, weake, troubled and woonderfully hindred, wherin a man can neuer haue any certaine reſolution. This is that which cauſed <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who was <hi>Platoes</hi> diſciple, and prince of the Peripatetike ſchoole, to ſay, that the more knowledge a man hath, the greater occaſion of doubting was offred. Neither can we
<note place="margin">Heraclitus wept continually.</note> iudge otherwiſe but that the ſame reaſon of trouble and doubting mooued the aboue named <hi>Heraclitus</hi> that great Philoſopher, to ſpend his life in continuall weeping, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he alleageth wiſely, that it was for the compaſſion he had of mans nature, both for that the life of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in nothing but in miſeries, as alſo becauſe all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wherein they exerciſed themſelues, ſeemed vnto him to be woorthy of great commiſeration and pitie: namely, ſeeing that they being farre wide of iuſtice, did yet through too greedie deſire make themſelues ſlaues <note place="margin">Democritus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies laughed.</note>vnto all couetouſnes and vainglorie. This alſo was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of inconſtancie and wauering in <hi>Democritus,</hi> who neuer came abroad amongſt men, but he laughed vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably at all their works and deeds. Howbeit herein he ſaid truely, that the life of man was vanitie and follie, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8689:22"/>
that all their luſtes and deſires were fonde, and woorthy to be laughed at. But ſuch extremities of laughter and weeping are not ſeemely in him, who is well inſtructed in the ſtudie of Philoſophie, and in the certaine knowledge <note place="margin">The iudgement of Philoſophers concerning the nature of man.</note>of himſelfe: which thing theſe Philoſophers ſo earneſtly laboured to attaine vnto, as we ſhall ſee anon, after we haue learned what other ancient men haue thought of the nature and ſtate of man. What other thing (ſaith <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus)</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pindarus.</note>is man, than the ſhadow of a dreame in ones ſleepe? Whereby he ſheweth the vanitie of man by an excellent manner of ſpeaking, verie ſignificantly vttering his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For what thing is leſſe than a dreame, yea than the ſhadow of a dreame? <hi>Homer</hi> hauing compared mortall <note place="margin">Homer.</note>creatures together, both in reſpect of their continuance, as of the maintenance of their life, crieth out, that of all thoſe which walke on the earth and draw breath, there is not one more miſerable than man. <hi>Timon</hi> the Athenian <note place="margin">Timon.</note>deteſting much more than al theſe the imbecility of mans nature, vſed and imploied all his skill to perſwade his countrimen to abridge and ſhorten the courſe of their ſo miſerable life, and to haſten their end, by hanging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon gibbets, which he had cauſed to be ſet vp in great number, in a fielde that he bought for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, vnto whoſe perſwaſions many gaue place. <hi>Plinie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing <note place="margin">Plinie.</note>the great miſeries wherewith man commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this world, and the manifold labors wherin he liueth, ſaide, that it were good for a man not to be borne at all, or elſe ſo ſoone as he is borne, to die. It was a cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <note place="margin">The cuſtome of the Scythians.</note>the Scythians to weepe at the birth of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to reioice, and make a ſolemne feaſt at the death of their parents. Now as the opinions of theſe philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers heere named by vs, who being deſtitute of the light of God, and of true religion had no other foundation but their owne humane and weake diſcourſes, are to be reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for incloſing all mankind in ſuch a vile and abiect eſtate, ſo on the other ſide we muſt take heed, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into that preſumptuous opinion of many others, who endeuour to lead man to the conſideration of his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8689:23"/>
dignitie and excellencie, as being endewed with infinite graces. For they perſuade him, that through the quicknes of his vnderſtanding, he may mount vp to the perfect knowledge of the greateſt ſecrets of God and nature, and that by the only ſtudie of philoſophie, he may of himſelfe, following his owne nature become maiſter of all euill paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and perturbations, and attaine to a rare and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme kinde of vertue, which is void of thoſe affections: that being thus exempted and freed from all vice, he may lead a moſt happy and perfect life. This did the Stoike phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers <note place="margin">The preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion of the Stoiks.</note>with one conſent maintaine and teach, ſaying: Whoſoeuer receiued their doctrine, if in the morning he were very wicked, in the euening he ſhould become a very good man: &amp; if he laid himſelfe downe to ſleepe, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, vicious &amp; poore, the next morning he ſhould ariſe wiſe, vertuous, rich, happie and iuſt. <hi>Zeno, Seneca, Diogenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chryſippus,</hi> and infinite mo, otherwiſe endewed with moſt fruitful doctrine, as we ſhall vnderſtand heerafter, were of this opinion. Inſomuch that <hi>Chryſippus</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Dion</hi> the chiefeſt man for knowledge in Syracuſa, was no leſſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous than his god <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to whom they attributed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diuinitie. <hi>Seneca</hi> alſo boaſted that he had receiued life by the benefit of God, but to liue wel, from himſelfe. Thus whileſt they granted to mans power ſuch an excellent and diuine diſpoſition, they lift him vp in a vaine preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in pride and truſt in himſelfe, and in his owne vertue, which in the end cannot but be the cauſe of his vtter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. We therefore holding the meane betweene theſe two contrarie opinions (as the perfection and goodnes of all things conſiſteth in mediocritie) and continuing to ſpeake of man as we haue alreadie begun, do ſay, that the knowledge of himſelfe is very neceſſarie for him, and that <note place="margin">The end of the knowledge of our ſelues.</note>hauing perfectly attained therunto, he hath cauſe both to be humbled greatly, as alſo to glorie and reioice. Firſt to humble himſelfe through the ſence and feeling of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, peruerſnes &amp; corruption, in which reſpect he ought to hate and be diſpleaſed with himſelfe, bicauſe he behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his deſtruction and condemnation ingrauen in his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8689:23"/>
conſcience. Secondly, he is to glorie in the knowledge of God, which inſeparably followeth the other, after he hath learned this, that in the mercie of God he may recouer that which is wanting in himſelfe, hauing once beene made and faſhioned of God, who is altogither pure, wiſe, true, good and almightie, to the end he might be partaker of his glorie. For the obtaining heerof, he had giuen vnto him from the beginning (as truſtie guides) godlines, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and religion: godlines, to the end he might knowe thereby, that he had God for his father: holines, to yeeld vnto him continuall glorie and praiſe: and religion, to keepe him in a continuall meditation of his grace and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and to ſerue him for an indiſſoluble bond to knit him to his Creator, who threatened him with death, if he did the contrarie. But our firſt father through ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <note place="margin">The wilfull fall of man.</note>and diſobedience, forſaking thoſe heauenlie guides to follow his owne free-will, depriued himſelfe and all his poſteritie of that promiſe of eternall life, that was made vnto him. Whereupon being dead to his firſt life, which was moſt happie and innocent, through his offence and peruerſnes of his ſin, he began from that time forward to liue a mortall life, ſo that his bodie and ſoule became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to infinite miſeries and damnable infirmities, which draw vpon them the condemnation of eternall death. Notwithſtanding God, whoſe goodnes and mercie are endles, reeſtabliſhed and aſſured the ſucceſſion of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall inheritance vnto thoſe, whom it pleaſed him by <note place="margin">The reſtoring of man.</note>grace to make dead to ſin and aliue to himſelfe, through the ſatiſfaction of his wrath made by the innocencie of his eternall ſonne, purging them in his bloud, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto them by him the gates of heauen, after he hath renewed them in righteouſnes, holines and innocencie, that they may follow after godlines and religion. And knowing that man ſo fraile and weake, might eaſily fall downe vnder the heauie burden of thoſe miſeries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, whereunto the corruption of his nature made him ſubiect, and wherein by reaſon of hereditarie ſinne he ſhould remaine during this mortall life, as alſo that thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8689:24"/>
furious and continuall paſſions, which are mingled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his ſoule, being ioined to the common infirmities of his bodie, would be of too great force to throwe him againe headlong into deſtruction, this infinite mercie of God appointed, that from the beginning there ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine <note place="margin">All men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue ſome loue and liking of the truth.</note>in the ſpirite of man a little ſparke of light, which driueth him to a naturall loue of the truth, and to a deſire to inquire after it, yea which pricketh and prouoketh him not to ſleepe altogither in his vices. This weake inſtinct being awaked ſtirred vp, holpen and diſpoſed by the pure grace, vertue and power of the author of all goodnes, <note place="margin">Effects of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>draweth and moueth a Chriſtian, regenerated by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt (after knowledge of himſelfe, and hatred of that which is in him) to ſeeke after and to couet with a ſpeciall hartie deſire, that goodnes and righteouſnes whereof he is void, and that glorious libertie of which he depriued himſelfe. Furthermore, the ſame heauenlie grace bleſſing this holie deſire of the man regenerate, cauſeth him to draw out of the doctrine of holie ſcriptures that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he may, if not heale perfectly his wicked inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet at the leaſt containe and repreſſe them in ſuch ſort, that they breake not out into any damnable execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He teacheth him alſo to receiue the infirmities of his fleſh as fatherly chaſtiſements for his ſin, and as neceſſarie means to exerciſe him, and to keepe him in awe. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the vpſhot and perfection of all happines and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in this world, he inſtructeth him how he may lead a quiet and peaceable life in beholding the woonderfull works of the diuinitie, which he is to adore and honour, and in the amendement and correction of his maners na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally corrupted, by ſquaring them after the patterne of vertue, that ſo he may be made worthie and fit to gouerne humane affaires, for the profit of manie: and at length at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">The perfection of a wiſe mans life.</note>to the perfection of a wiſe man, by ioining togither the actiue life with the contemplatiue in the certaine hope and expectation of a ſecond, immortall and moſt bleſſed life.

                     <p>With a good will my companions, and firſt I <note place="margin">The definition of a bodie.</note>will begin at the definition of a body. A body (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſay, ſpeaking generally of all things that haue bodies) is that which may be deuided and meaſured after three ſorts, in length, in breadth, and in deapth. Or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to others, a bodie is a maſſe or lump, which, aſmuch as lieth in it, reſiſteth touching, and occupieth a place. A body (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> is that which being in his proper place is neither heauie nor light, but being in a ſtrange place firſt inclineth ſomewhat, then is driuen and caried for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward either with heauines or lightnes. Hereupon, both he and other Philoſophers diſcourſe, learnedly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly of the particular nature of al bodies, of the earth, of the fire, of the aire, of the water, and of all other both ſimple and compound bodies, and of their contrarie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But ſeeing all thoſe diſcourſes are at this preſent without the compaſſe of our Academy, let vs ſimplie with more profite, and that according to the ſcripture, define the body, which we haue vndertaken to handle. We ſay <note place="margin">Gen. 6. Rom. 8. Gal. 5. The works of the fleſh.</note>then, that the body is fleſh, that euery affection of the fleſh
is deadly, and that the works therof are vncleannes, pride, fornication, enmity, debate, wrath, contention, enuy, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, gluttonie and ſuch like: and therfore that the bodie is made of mortall matter, of as ſmall continuance as a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8689:25"/>
veſſell of earth, ſinning without ceaſing, and endeuoring that that which is ſhut vp within it, ſhould pleaſe it. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we ought not to neglect and contemne the woonderfull frame of this heauenly plant, as <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it, ſaying, that the roote thereof is in the head drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen: ſeeing, as in a little world, we may behold <note place="margin">Man is a little world.</note>therein the excellencie of the woonderful works of God, and that in ſo great meaſure, that the wiſeſt and moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent men could neuer ſet them foorth ſufficiently. And if we cal to minde how by his almightie power he framed him at the firſt of a peece of earth, we ſhall not neede to <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>ſtand long heere to inquire and ſearch out, how he could be ingendred and faſhioned in his mothers wombe, how he receaued nouriſhment and life, and laſtly, how he came into the light. As for example, how the ſixe firſt daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Of the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of man.</note>his conception, he is nothing but milke: the nine fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, blood: twelue daies after, fleſh: and howe in the eighteene next enſuing, he is faſhioned, at what time the fruite beginneth to liue, and to haue ſence, which is the fiue and fortieth day after he was conceaued. Theſe are ſecrets of nature, which may ſeeme as incomprehenſible, and beyond the capacitie of man, as his firſt creation. For what greater maruell can there be, than that of a little drop of mans ſeed there ſhould be engendred bones, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, vaines, arteries, ſimilar and inſtrumentall partes, skinne and fleſh, and that all theſe ſhould be framed in that kinde, figure, and ſimilitude, which we daily ſee in men, who are all created after that maner? What neede we then to make an anatomy of all the chiefeſt partes of the body of man, when as the conſideration of the leaſt of them, which peraduenture may be found to be moſt neceſſarie, will ſuffice to rauiſh vs with admiration? What <note place="margin">Of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the bodie, and of all the parts thereof.</note>ſuperfluous thing can be noted in the bodie? What ſmall parcell is there, which the nobleſt part may want conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, and which is not partaker of euerie euill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof? What thing is there in the whole nature thereof, which doth not ſatisfie that dutie verie profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, whereunto it is borne and appointed, which moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8689:26"/>
not of it ſelfe, which either doth, ſuffereth or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of it ſelfe otherwiſe than is moſt expedient and meet for it owne benefite, and for the reſt of the frame of man? The progreſſe and growth thereof from day to day, from houre to houre, and that of all the parts together of this principall worke at one inſtant, euen from the firſt houre of his being vntil his whole perfection, are they not more heauenly than humane things? What is more woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnder the cope of heauen, than the coniunction and ſubiection of the naturall ſences vnto the bodie, I meane, of the ſight, ſmelling, hearing, taſte and touching, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> the common ſence, which is as it were a generall receptacle, conceaueth al outward things? What an excellent propertie in man is it, to voide from him a profitable ſuperfluitie of his nouriſhment, from whence the cauſe of the preſeruation of mankinde proceedeth? <note place="margin">Great ſecrets of nature.</note>The articulate and diſtinct voice, proper to him onely, is it not woorthy of great maruell? What greater ſecret of nature could rauiſh the minde of man more with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than amongſt the infinite multitude of men in the world, to conſider the variety of their geſtures, and diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their countenances, that hauing al but one and the ſame forme, yet not one almoſt reſembleth another? And when in ſo great varietie, two are found reſembling in all points one another, as we read of ſome, euen of ſundry nations, who haue been taken indifferently one for the other, is it not a ſtranger matter? How maruellous is it, that all men hauing a toong wherewith they ſpeake and ſing, yet we ſeldome ſee that the ſpeaking and ſinging of <note place="margin">The diuerſitie of mens voices and writings.</note>one reſembleth the ſpeech and tune of another, wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it commeth to paſſe, that friends and familiars often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acknowledge and vnderſtand one another by their ſpeech and voice before they ſee ech other? Who will not admire this great ſecret in the hand of man, that a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand writers may write the ſame thing, with the ſame inke and like pen, and that with three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie letters, which haue each his owne figure and ſhape, and yet the writings ſhall not reſemble one another ſo, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8689:26"/>
that euery writing may be knowne by his hand that wrote it? Briefely, what is there in the whole body of man, that is not full of rare beautie? This is ſufficient for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, now let vs come to the ſoule, which is much <note place="margin">The ſoule is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Or elſe, according to others, it is the light of the ſubſtance, and in perpetuall motion. They diui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diuerſely, and make many parts therof. The ſoule (as <note place="margin">The diuiſion of the ſoule.</note>
                        <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſaid) is compounded of vnderſtanding, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, opinion and ſence, from which things all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Arts proceed, and of which man is called reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that is, apt to diſcourſe by reaſon. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that <note place="margin">Plato maketh ſixe parts of the ſoule.</note>there are three vertues in the ſoule belonging to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderſtanding, which for this cauſe are called
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8689:27"/>
cognitiue or knowing vertues: namely, reaſon, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and phantaſie. Vnto which three others are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable appertaining to appetite: namely Will, whoſe office is to deſire that which vnderſtanding and reaſon propound vnto it: Choler or Anger, which followeth that, that reaſon and phantaſie offer vnto it: and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, which apprehendeth whatſoeuer phantaſie and<note place="margin">Ariſtotle diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it in two parts.</note> ſence obiect vnto it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh another diſtinction of the ſoule, ſaying, that one part of it is voide of reaſon in it ſelfe, and yet may be guided by reaſon: and that the other part is of it ſelfe partaker of reaſon. And in another place this Philoſopher ſaith, that there are three thinges from whence humane actions proceed, namely ſence, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and appetite. Many others both ancient and late writers make foure parts of the ſoule: Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">Foure parts of the ſoule.</note> reaſon, anger &amp; deſire. The vnderſtanding lifteth the ſoule vp to heauen to the contemplation of diuine &amp; intellectual things. Reaſon guideth the ſoule by prudence in all her functions. Anger is ruled and moderated by the vertue of magnanimitic: and deſire is gouerned by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. Of theſe a very harmonicall Iuſtice is framed, which giueth to euerie part of the ſoule that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto it. But the moſt ſenſible, common and true opinion, which the wiſeſt amongſt the Philoſophers had<note place="margin">The beſt diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule.</note> of the ſoule, is that which diuideth it into two parts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnder which all the reſt are compriſed: the one being ſpiritual and intelligible, where the diſcourſe of reaſon is: the other brutiſh, which is the ſenſuall will, of it ſelfe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and diſordred, where all motions contrarie to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all euill deſires haue their dwelling. Amongſt all the philoſophical diſcourſes of the ſoule, written by theſe great perſonages, this error is verie great, when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſuch a ſtrength and power to reaſon (which they ſay is reſident in the ſoule as a lampe to guide the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and as a queene to moderate the will) as that by it alone a man may wel and iuſtly gouerne himſelfe. Now although we know that this reaſon of man is of it ſelfe, wholy depraued &amp; corrupted, yet we may ſay wel enough,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8689:27"/>
that the ſoule, which is ſpirit and life cannot be diuided, being immortall: bicauſe whatſoeuer is diuided, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and parteth a ſunder, and whatſoeuer is diſſolued, periſheth. Neuertheles it may be ſaid to be compounded and made ſubiect (during the coniunction thereof with<note place="margin">The ſoule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diuided but is made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to two parts.</note> the body) to theſe two principall parts, <hi>of vnderstanding and will.</hi> The vnderſtanding ſerueth to conceaue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all things propounded vnto vs, and to diſcerne and iudge what we ought, either to approoue and allow, or what to refuſe and reiect. The will is that which execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and bringeth to effect, whatſoeuer the vnderſtanding iudgeth to be good, and contrariwiſe flieth from that, which it reprooueth and condemneth. And herein we agree with the Philoſophers, that the vnderſtanding, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we comprehend the ſence, is as the gouernour and captaine of the ſoule, and that the will dependeth of it. But withall we ſay, that both the one and the other are ſo corrupted and altered from their nature, (the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being obſcured and dimmed with the clouds of darknes, by reaſon of the firſt mans ſinne deſcended vpon<note place="margin">Both parts of the ſoule are corrupted.</note> all his poſteritie through hereditarie and naturall filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the will in ſuch ſort corrupted by this diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo weakened and made feeble to all goodnes) that if there be none other guide comming from aboue to teach the vnderſtanding, and to direct and leade the will, I meane, regeneration by the ſpirite of God, both of them cannot but do euill, drawing the ſoule with them to vtter ruine and perdition, by cauſing her to conſent to the law of her members, which are the bodie and fleſh, ful<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> of ignorance, of obſcure darknes, of frowardnes, miſerie, calamitie, ignominie, ſhame, death, and condemnation. Notwithſtanding, if in the corruptible, heauie and groſſe lumpe of the bodie, within which the ſoule is contained, we found matter of praiſe and of the contemplation of heauenly things, what ſhal we ſay of that which is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,<note place="margin">The properties of the ſoule.</note> which in a moment in hir diſcourſes and cogitations, goeth through the whole heauen, compaſſeth the earth about, ſaileth all ouer the ſea, without which the body

mooueth not at all, and all the beautie thereof turneth ſuddainly into putrefaction? This onely can make a man happie both in this and in the other life, by reaſon of the treaſures of wiſedome, the vnderſtanding whereof is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto it: yea this is the onely inſtrument whereby a man may behold the diuine nature. This is inuiſible, and cannot be perceiued by any naturall ſence: this is contemplatiue and actiue at one and the ſame time: this beholdeth vniuerſall things, and practiſeth particulars,<note place="margin">The actions of the ſoule.</note> vnderſtanding the one, and feeling the other.

Briefely, to conclude our preſent ſpeech, we may well ſay that the ſoule is ſo great and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine a thing, that it is a verie hard matter to comprehend it by reaſon, but altogither incomprehenſible by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſence: and that all mans felicitie, as well preſent as to come, dependeth of the ſoule, when, being regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as hath been ſaid) and made free and voide of al wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perturbations (as neere as the nature of man can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch<note place="margin">The true delight of the ſenſe.</note> to perfection) her humane contentation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is onely in vertue, and in the hope and certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a more ſound and perfect vertue, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing and changing of this mortall life into that which is<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 4.</note> immortall and moſt bleſſed: as S. <hi>Paule</hi> exhorteth vs hereunto, ſaying, Let vs reioice in the Lord: both bicauſe<note place="margin">Luke. 10. 20.</note> our names are written in heauen (as Chriſt ſaith) and that our modeſty, meeknes and goodnes may be knowne to all men. Moreouer let vs learne that in the woonderfull compoſition, coniunction and diſpoſition of the ſoule &amp; bodie, there is matter whereby to draw man greatly to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8689:28"/>
the conſideration of the chiefe ende, for which he was firſt placed in the world, namely to glorifie his Creator in godlines, holines and religion. He ought therefore both to ſerue him with all the parts of his body, not abuſing<note place="margin">How a man ought to vſe both body and ſoule.</note> them in any ſort, but keeping them pure and cleane, to be made members of the glorious body of his eternall Sonne in the reſurrection, and alſo to praiſe and glorifie him with all the gifts and graces of his ſoule, not defiling it with vncleannes and vice, that ſhe may, by the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace, returne vnto the full fruition of that moſt happy eſſence and nature from whence ſhe had her being. In the meane while let vs learne that as the bodie vſeth many inſtruments wherof it is compounded, and which are proper vnto it, ſo the ſoule, being much more noble, excellent and diuine ought to vſe the bodie and all the parts therof: and that the ſoule is the organ and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God whereby he worketh in vs, and lifteth vs vp to the contemplation of his diuine nature.</p>

                  <p>Truly this is no vaine ſpeculation, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to man: as alſo for a man to know, that he is as it were tied in this world to all vncertaine things, which he, being mortall by nature, cannot any way ſhun and auoid, without the helpe of God. He which is in health expecteth ſicknes: he that is ſicke, health. Doth any one deſire in his mind any thing? Before he enioyeth it, his deſire is often changed into another. In a word, no man abideth ſtill in one and the ſame eſtate. And therfore <hi>Plato</hi>

                  <p>The change which this diuine philoſopher meant (if I be not deceiued) hath relation principally to the conditions of the ſoule, which, being filled with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <note place="margin">Pleaſure and griefe the cauſe of paſſions.</note>perturbations, faſtened in the midſt of it with the naile of pleaſure and griefe, is carried away with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and vncertaintie into a ſtreame of troubleſome paſſions, which if they be not cut off and maiſtred by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, draw a man into vtter deſtruction.

                  <p>Amongſt the innumerable euils, which the deſire of pleaſure and feare of griefe, ingrauen in the moſt ſecret parts of our ſoule by our firſt corruption, bring to man, this is the greateſt and moſt pernitious, that they make ſenſible things more euident and plaine vnto him than things intelligible, and conſtraine the vnderſtanding to iudge more by paſſion than by reaſon. For vſing, through the ſence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> pleaſure or trauell, to attend to the erronious, vncertaine, and mutable nature of the bodie, as to that which is ſubſiſting and ſubiect to ſight, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth blind, and looſeth all knowledge of that which truly is and ſubſiſteth, namely, of the light of the ſoule, which is diuine and immortall. Moreouer, applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholie to the ſenſuall and vnreaſonable will, which is that part of the ſoule that proceedeth of the corruption thereof, he laboureth with all his might to quench and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8689:29"/>
choke that weake inſtinct of the ſoule, which aſpireth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true Good, from whence ſhe perceiueth hir ſelfe to haue fallen. And this he doth with ſuch force and power, that if God ſtrengthen not the ſoule, and reaſon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine guide, accompanie hir not, without doubt ſhe yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ſuch mightie enimies: and then (as we haue ſaid) ſtaying himſelfe wholy in things ſubiect to ſight, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth too carefull and curious in ſeeking to decke that, <note place="margin">Manis more carefull of his body then of his ſoule.</note>which belongeth to the bodie: but as for the ſoule (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all humane felicitie dependeth) bicauſe ſhe is inuiſible, and not ſeene of him, it is the leſt of his cares to furniſh hir with that which ſhe ſeeketh and deſireth, and which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for hir. Wherupon in the end it commeth to paſſe that the leſt ouerthwarts and diſcommodities of his fleſh ſeeme very greeuous and burthenſome to a man, but as for the incurable diſeaſes, which ouerwhelme his ſoule, he doth not ſo much as feele them. Now to the end we may vnderſtand more particularly that which is heer propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs, we will handle in order, and as briefly as we may (this matter being very large) the diſeaſes and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the bodie and ſoule, with the remedie which we are to deſire and ſeeke after. And firſt we will ſpeake a word of the diſeaſes of the bodie, next of the naturall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie paſſions thereof, albeit we will intreat of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoule, as of our chiefe matter ſubiect. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the maladies and euill diſpoſitions of the bodie, one <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> one <hi>Galen,</hi> nay infinite others skilfull in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, are not able to deſcribe them exactly, much leſſe preſcribe certaine and ſure remedies. But ſeeing it is not my purpoſe or profeſſion to ſtay long heere, neither yet neceſſarily belonging to the cauſe of our aſſemblie, I will content my ſelfe to ſpeake theſe few words by the way, <note place="margin">The ende, cauſe, and remedie of bodily diſeaſes.</note>that we ought to take euerie bodily infirmitie as a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſtiſement of our ſins, and as a neceſſarie meane to awaken vs, to warne vs of our dutie, and to keep vs in awe. Beſides, one principall cauſe of all bodilie diſeaſes procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ordinarily from vices, which are the proper inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of man, and with which we defile our ſelues conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8689:30"/>
Therefore if we heale our ſoules, we may cure our ſelues of the moſt of them: and as for others, which come by defect of nature, or by ſome other hidden cauſe, we haue the counſell and helpe of phyſicions, whom willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Naturall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note>and diligently we ſeeke after. There are beſides theſe, certaine naturall and neceſſarie paſſions in the body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging vnto it, euen from the firſt creation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which are not to be condemned, neither can be taken away, but with the aboliſhing of mans nature: as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of drinking, eating, ſleeping, &amp; ſuch like, which onlie by the direction of reaſon are to be freed from all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie. But it ſtandeth otherwiſe with the diſeaſes and paſſions of the ſoule, deriued from our firſt corruption, and driuen forward by ſinne, being plentifull and rich, which without compariſon are far more dangerous than thoſe of the bodie, more hard to be perceiued &amp; knowen, more headſtrong and vneaſie to cure, and which is worſe, man is very ſlothfull in ſeeking out a remedie for them. And for the moſt part thinking that he hath found ſome remedie, through want of skill and ignorance he falleth into a worſe eſtate than he was in before, and as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, from a gentle ague into a peſtilent and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">The definition of paſſion.</note>feuer. But firſt we will generally define this word, <hi>Paſſion,</hi> according to the opinion of thoſe philoſophers, who were endewed with greateſt light. Paſſion is euerie naturall and actuall motion in the ſoule. This motion is of two ſorts: the one weake, good and holie, aſpiring and reioicing in that which is truly good: the other verie ſtrong, euill and pernitious, coueting with a diſordered deſire, and delighting with an immoderate ioy in a good falſly ſo imagined. The matter of theſe motions are opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, affections, and inclinations, which being conſidered in their owne nature, are through ſinne wicked and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt throughout the ſoule, yea the bloſſome and roote of them proceed from our owne ſubſtance, to the end (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) that no man ſhould thinke God to be the cauſe of euill. Now albeit theſe paſſions thus defined by the philoſophers are many in number, yet drawing neerer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8689:30"/>
to the truth we may comprehend and diuide them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two principall kinds. The firſt kind ſhall be that which <note place="margin">The diuiſion of paſſions.</note>we beleeue by faith: the other according to our opinions and affections. Vnder the firſt we comprehend that which euerie one beleeueth, thinketh, and deſireth concerning diuine and heauenlie things, as of true righteouſnes, of the immortalitie of the ſecond life, and of the iudgement to come. Vnder opinions and affections is comprehended whatſoeuer reſpecteth and concerneth earthlie things, this life, maners, gouernment of a houſhold, of a common wealth, and generally al humane inclinations and actions. As touching that which we beleeue by faith, we are led thereunto, and ſtirred by the weake inſtinct and feeling of <note place="margin">All men haue naturally a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of happines.</note>the diuine nature imprinted in euery ſoule, which after a ſort mooueth man to aſpire vnto, and to deſire the true and ſouereigne good, and which, being more power-full, and of greater efficacy in ſome than in others, cauſeth the better ſort to delight alſo in the ſame good. Neuertheles it is proper to euery mans vnderſtanding, not to hold a <note place="margin">No man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can finde out the right way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines.</note>ſtedfaſt and ſure way in ſeeking out the truth, but to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der aſide into diuers errors (as a blind man that walketh in darknes) and to fill it ſelfe rather with lies, and with a continuall deſire and curioſitie of new, vnprofitable, and ſuperfluous things, than to content it ſelfe ſimplie with the truth, inſomuch that finally it miſſeth of all. But to the <note place="margin">The word of God ſheweth vs the right way to happines.</note>end we be not of this number, we ought to hold faſt the infallible rule of the holie ſcriptures: which gift we are to aske, hope, wait, and ſeeke for in the onely grace and mercie of that Spirit which indighteth them, and to looke for the full opening of theſe treaſures in the ſecond and eternall life. As for the ſecond kind of our paſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called perturbations according to the philoſophers from whence all the euils and miſeries of mankinde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and whereof we minde chiefely to ſpeake, they are but affections and inclinations, which come from our will, corrupted by the prouocations and allurements of <note place="margin">Of the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the ſoule.</note>the fleſh, and which wholy reſiſt the diuine nature of the reaſonable part of the ſoule, faſtening it to the bodie (as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8689:31"/>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) with the naile of pleaſure. Which paſſions the mind of man commonly beholdeth cleerly enough, when it applieth it ſelfe thereunto, if it be not altogither peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and depraued: yea by the grace and helpe of God, the mind is able to confirme it ſelfe againſt any paſſion through the diſcourſe of reaſon before it be in force, and during the vehemencie thereof, to fortifie it ſelfe againſt <note place="margin">The ſcope of our paſſions.</note>it. And although the paſſion be contrarie to reaſon, and haue (for hir onely ſcope) pleaſure, and the feare of griefe, which can preuaile greatly with man, yet reaſon by the meanes of Gods grace, can both eaſily conſtraine, maiſter and compell all paſſions in ſuch ſort, that they ſhall take no effect, and alſo bring to paſſe, that whatſoeuer is raſhly deſired, ſhall be ouercome by the diſcourſe of prudent counſell. And for this cauſe we ſay, that the firſt motions are not in our power, but that the euent and iſſue of them is in ſome ſort. Likewiſe reaſon doth not wholie quench and extinguiſh all paſſions, which cannot poſſibly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the nature of man, but repelleth and hath the vpper hand of them, as the precepts of doctrine, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite examples of the liues of ancient heathen and pagan <note place="margin">The ancient heathen may riſe vp in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt many Chriſtians in theſe daies.</note>philoſophers do learnedly teach vs. Which thing as it ought to cauſe many at this day to be aſhamed, who vaunt themſelues of the name of Chriſtians, ſo it condemneth them in a fault not to be excuſed before the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, bicauſe thoſe men, being deſtitute of the perfect knowledge of God, which they ſay they haue, far excelled and ſurpaſſed them in the bridling, ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and killing of ſo many peſtiferous paſſions as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the ſoule about, as we may handle elſewhere, and ſee examples thereof worthie of eternall remembrance, when we ſhall diſcourſe particularly of vertues and vices. In the meane while we may learne of <hi>Cicero</hi> (the father of Latine eloquence, whoſe skill in ioining philoſophie with the art of Rhetorike, was excellent, and who, in my iudgement, handleth this our preſent matter more profitably than any other of the ancients) that all the aboue named euill paſſions are perturbations, which if they be not maiſtered
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8689:31"/>
by reaſon, depriue man of the ſoueraigne good of the <note place="margin">The originall, nature and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations.</note>ſoule, which conſiſteth in the tranquillitie therof. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he ſaith, that through ignorance &amp; baſenes of minde, they proceed onely of the opinion of good or euill, either preſent or to come, which we imagine to be in the vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and tranſitorie things of the world, and which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied vnſeparably either with good or euill. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of good things, we are caried away with a vehement deſire or coueting of them, beſides an immoderate ioy in them: in regard of euil things, we are oppreſſed with feare and ſorrow. And theſe are the foure ſprings of all vices &amp; <note place="margin">All perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnder theſe foure heads, Deſire, Ioy, Feare, Griefe.</note>ſins wherein men plunge themſelues during this life, and vnder which all perturbations are comprehended, which fill the ſoule with endleſſe trouble and diſquietnes, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing man to liue alwaies vncontented, and to finde euery preſent kinde of life burthenſome, and ſo to ſeeke after and to deſire another. But as fearefull men, (ſaith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tark,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">An excellent compariſon.</note>that excellent philoſopher, &amp; ſchoolemaſter to that good <hi>Traian)</hi> and they that are at ſea, ſubiect to caſting, thinking they ſhalbe better in one place than in another, go from the ſterne to the ſtem, then to the bottom of the ſhip, afterward to the higheſt part, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence go into the skiph, and in the end returne into the ſhip, without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of their euil, becauſe they carrie alwaies about with them both feare &amp; griefe: ſo the alteration of life, &amp; of worldly conditions and eſtates into others, doth not purge, but rather increaſe the perturbations &amp; diſeaſes of the ſoule, if firſt the cauſe of them, I meane ignorance of <note place="margin">The cauſe of the diſeaſes of the ſoule.</note>things, &amp; the imperfection of reaſon, be not taken out of it. Theſe are the miſchiefes, which trouble both rich and poore: theſe are the miſeries, which wait vpon great and final, bond and free, yoong &amp; old. Thus is the ſpirit of ſick perſons vexed, and that continually. One while the wife is troubleſome, the phyſition vnskilfull, the bed vneaſie, the friend that viſiteth importunate, he which viſiteth not, proud: but being once healed, they finde that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was irkſom vnto them before, now pleaſeth them. But that which health doth to the diſeaſed body, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8689:32"/>
                     <note place="margin">Reaſon is the medicine of the ſoule.</note> ſame thing reaſon worketh in the ſoule of a prudent man, by curing the paſſions and perturbations thereof, and by cauſing him to reſt ioyfull and contented, in what eſtate and condition ſoeuer he be. Let vs note moreouer, (which we touched in the beginning of this preſent diſcourſe) that all theſe paſſions of the ſoule are much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than thoſe of the bodie, bicauſe the moſt hurtfull paſſions of the bodie, are firſt ingendred of thoſe in the ſoule. For the bodie yeeldeth it ſelfe ready to ſerue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, appetites, and pleaſures of the ſoule, which being ouercome and in the power of fleſhly prouocations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth in the end deſtruction to them both. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, the ſoule being ruled by reaſon, reſiſteth mightilie all corporall paſſions, and is nothing at all, or verie little made partaker of their euill diſpoſitions: whereas on the other ſide the bodie is conſtrained to alter and change with euery infirmitie of the ſoule. If the minde be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, what cheerefulnes can be ſeene in the face? The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the bodie hinder not the ſoule from effecting all good &amp; vertuous actions: yea many haue brought forth the fruits of wiſe philoſophers and great captaines, when they were vexed with diſeaſes, which they could neuer do, at leaſt verie few of them, that were corrupted and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">A ſound ſoule correcteth the naughtines of the bodie.</note>in ſoule. And therfore <hi>Democritus</hi> ſaid very well, that it was much more conuenient and meet for a man to haue care of his ſoule, than of his bodie. For if the ſoule be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhe correcteth the naughtines of the body, whereas the ſtrength &amp; diſpoſition of the body without the vſe of reaſon, hurteth both the ſoule and it ſelfe. Moreouer, that the paſſions of the ſoule are harder to be perceiued and knowne, and conſequently more vneaſie to be cured, who doth not eaſily feele it, being greeued but in the leaſt part of his bodie? yea what griefe doth not of it ſelfe ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeere, either by ſome inflammation, or by the colour of the viſage, or by ſome other outward ſhew? But how many do we fee, whoſe ſoules are extreemly ſicke, ſpoiled and corrupted with vice, and yet being depriued of all feeling they thinke themſelues to be the ſoundeſt men in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8689:32"/>
the world? And that they are headſtrong and vneaſie to <note place="margin">The paſſions of the ſoule are headſtrong and hard to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>be cured, we may know by this, that the body is in the end ſo farforth obedient, that if reaſon be vrgent vpon it, ſhe forceth euen the naturall paſſions of hunger, thirſt and ſleepe, &amp; findeth out beſides a thouſand remedies to help it ſelf. But when the paſſions of the ſoule haue once beene grounded and rooted within it, without reſiſtance they haue ſuch pearcing pricks, that oftentimes they preſſe &amp; ouerwhelme all reaſon, which is their onely medicine and preſeruatiue. And yet to fill vp the meaſure of all miſerie, ſuch is the froward nature of man, that he is much more ſlothfull to ſeeke out this remedy of the ſoule, than that of the bodie, as we touched in the beginning of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe. Moreouer, the iudgement of reaſon being oftentimes diſeaſed within him, is the cauſe, that when he thinketh to finde health, he encreaſeth his euill, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into thoſe inconueniences, which he deſired moſt of all to eſchew. Example hereof we haue in thoſe, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The paſſions of men commonly bring foorth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects contrarie to their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note>led onely with a deſire of glory and honor, obtaine nothing by their dooings, if we conſider them well, but ſhame and diſhonor. The like may be ſaid of all the other diſeaſes of the ſoule, which commonly are accompanied and followed with effects contrary to their endes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. What remaineth then, ſeeing we perceiue the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to be great, which follow al the perturbations of the ſoule, but that, knowing it to be more eaſie not to receiue them, than to driue them out being receiued, we preuent them, and hinder them from taking liuely roote within our ſoules, by making reaſon (which, as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> ſaith, is <note place="margin">Reaſon, is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome inſpired from heauen.</note>a diuine guide, and wiſedome inſpired from aboue) ſo ſtrong and powerfull, that it may be able, by the grace of God, to reſiſt al the aſſaults of vnbrideled deſires, and the froward affections of this fleſh? But behold yet a better <note place="margin">A remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt paſſions.</note>and more certaine remedie: namely, that being aſſured, that all perturbations are but opinions drawne from our will, through a iudgement corrupted with the affections of this fleſh, we labor by good and ſound reaſons to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and confound theſe falſe and erronious opinions,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8689:33"/>
perſwading our ſelues that whatſoeuer we imagine to be good or euill in the world (which is the cauſe that our minds are depriued of their reſt and quietnes) is indeede neither good nor euill, and ſo conſequently, that it ought not in any ſort to breed paſſions within vs. Hereof the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele of our diſcourſes ſhall (by the helpe of God) giue vs to vnderſtand more at large, and furniſh vs with exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of pernicious effects, which proceed from all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſoule. We will here by the way note their force, hauing learned out of Hiſtories, that they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſet vpon the harts of men in ſuch violent maner, that ſome <hi>through deſire, ſome for ioy: thoſe by feare, others by</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Examples of death by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great ioy.</note>
                     <hi>griefe</hi> haue ended their liues. <hi>Diagoras</hi> the Rhodian, and <hi>Chilon</hi> hearing that their children had wonne the price at the games of Olympus, felt ſuch a motion in them of the <note place="margin">Herennus died for feare.</note>ſpleene, that they were ſtifled with laughter. <hi>Herennus</hi> the Sicilian, as he was led priſoner, for being a copartner in <note place="margin">Plautius through griefe.</note>the conſpiracie of <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed, &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the feare of his iudgement to come, that he fell downe ſtrke dead at the entrie of the priſon. <hi>Plautius</hi> the Numidian looking vpon his dead wife tooke it ſo to hart; that caſting himſelfe vpon the dead body, he aroſe no more, but was there ſtifled with ſorrow. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme deſire or coueting, there is nothing that ſo greatly mooueth or carieth away the minds of men, or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neerer to their deſtruction, than this fooliſh paſſion <note place="margin">The effects of deſire.</note>indangereth their life. <hi>Galeace</hi> of Mantua ſaying often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a damſell of Pauia whom he courted and made loue to, that he would ſuffer a thouſand deaths for hir ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, if it were poſſible, was in ieſt commanded by hir to caſt himſelf into the riuer: which he preſently performed, &amp; was drowned. But we ſhal alleadge more fitly ſuch teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the fond effects of deſire, and of all the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the ſoule, when we diſcourſe more particularly of euery vice that proceedeth from them. In the meane time I would gladly aske this queſtion of him, that is moſt ignorant, vicious, and carnall, whether he will not grant vertue to be a good of the ſoule. There is none ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8689:33"/>
whoſe conſcience would not compell him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame. And yet no man is caried away with too <note place="margin">Vertue is alwais without exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue paſſion.</note>great a deſire of vertue, neither doth any reioice therein too exceſſiuely, after he hath obtained it. Likewiſe there is none that feareth ſo vehemently, leaſt he cannot obtaine hir, as that the feare thereof driueth the ſoule out of his place and reſt. For no man can fall into this feare, leaſt he ſhould not becom vertuous, except he be very deſirous to be ſo indeed: and none can haue this deſire, except reaſon, guided with heauenly light, and doing her dutie in him, had wrought the ſame: but reaſon thus qualified muſt needs be an enimy to all perturbations. Thus we ſee that no man, through feare of not being vertuous, is ouertaken with perturbations. The like may be ſaide of ſorrow. For albeit a man be greeued bicauſe he is not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, yet his minde is not exceſſiuely diſquieted, ſeeing this deſire is neuer in him, but when reaſon commandeth according to hir diuine nature, by cauſing vs to knowe our ſelues. Whereby we perceiue that perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neuer ariſe in vs for that which is the true good of the ſoule, but onely for that which fooles do falſely call good, and which the philoſophers call the goods of the bodie and of fortune. But theſe being naturally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect <note place="margin">The nature of worldly goods.</note>to corruption, and, as we haue alreadie ſaid, inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly accompanied with vehement deſire, vnbrideled ioy, feare and griefe, (as we ſhall ſee more at large when we handle them hereafter) are vnwoorthy to be cared for by the immortall ſoule neither may or ought they to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led goods bicauſe they are poſſeſſed, much leſſe euils, when they are wanting. If we be thus perſwaded, we ſhall be maſters ouer all perturbations, not eſteeming that which is mortall and fraile, woorthy to be either wiſhed for, or delighted in. Hereof it will come to paſſe, that our ſoule and ſpirit ſhall be quiet, and reaſon, which knoweth how diſcerne good from euill, wil deale with vs as a good husbandman, and vine dreſſer dealeth with his tree and vine, when he cutteth off the dead branches and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table twigs, to the end that all noiſome ſap and moiſture
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8689:34"/>
may be taken away. And thus ſhall we be taught to deſire and do that, which we ought, and euery contrarie inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be weakened, not taking effects, and the ſoule ſhall fulfill hir dutie, in commanding abſolutely ouer all the prouocations of the fleſh, and in quenching them ſo foone as they do appeere. For as they that haue healthful <note place="margin">A wiſe ſoule go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note>bodies, (ſaith <hi>Epictetus)</hi> eaſily indure both cold and heate: ſo they that haue a ſtaied and ſetled ſoule, haue the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer anger, griefe, ioy, and all their other affections. <note place="margin">What it is to liue happilie.</note>Then ſhall we liue happily, not being terrified with any feare, nor vexing our ſpirits with any longing or tedious deſires, nor being tormented with any luſtes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordred affections, and laſtly, not ſuffering our ſelues (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunken with ſugred poiſon) to be ouer come and bound vnder the yoke of pleaſure. This ſhall we learne by the ſtudie of Philoſophie, which is a certaine remedie, and a ſound medicine for euery vice and paſſion, and is able to inrich and cloath vs with reaſon, which is ſuch a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, perfect and profitable ornament.</p>

meditate vpon heauenlie things, and thereupon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the ſcope of their intents, deſires and wils.

Which excellent opinions of theſe two phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are comprehended vnder this onely word of practiſing philoſophie, and that art, which giueth vs the precepts thereof, is called philoſophie, whoſe worke and effect (as <hi>Seneca, Neroes</hi> ſchoolmaiſter ſaid very well) is to find out, and to knowe the truth both of diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <note place="margin">The worke of philoſophie.</note>things.

                  <p>Philoſophie cannot ſufficiently be praiſed, ſeeing that whoſoeuer obeieth hir may paſſe his daies without tediouſnes. For the true ſcope thereof is to ſeeke <note place="margin">The proper end and ſcope of Philoſophie.</note>to glorifie God in his woonderfull works, and to teach a man how to liue well, and to helpe his neighbor. Which perfection cannot be attained vnto without a ſpeciall and heauenlie grace, and that after the knowledge of the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from whence all goodnes commeth. And this hath beene the cauſe, as I thinke, why ſo many great philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, knowing certainly wherein the true and perfect fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of man liuing in this world conſiſted, namely, in the tranquillitie of the ſoule, and labouring continually to

                  <p>That which preſently offereth it ſelfe to bee handled, requireth truely a farre better ſpirit than mine. Notwithſtanding, that I ſeeme not to ſhun thoſe liſts, into which we entered willingly, I purpoſe according to my weake iudgement, to tell you firſt what philoſophie is, what good commeth vnto vs by it, the meanes to learne it, and to profit thereby, how a man may know he hath it, and how he muſt ſhew foorth the fruits thereof: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how we ought to contemne all things that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, after the example of ſome ancient Sages, whom<note place="margin">The definition of philoſophie.</note> we will alledge. Philoſophie is a loue or deſire of wiſedom. Or otherwiſe, it is a profeſſion, ſtudie, and exerciſe of that wiſedome, which is the knowledge of diuine and humane things, and which properly belongeth to him, who onely is ſufficient of himſelfe, and is wiſedome it ſelfe, namely, to God. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was the firſt that gaue the name to philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, which being diuided as well by him, as by other<note place="margin">The di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Diuine,</hi> and <hi>Naturall.</hi> As touching the diuine part, it is that higheſt and moſt vnchangeable knowledge, whereunto we muſt wholy refer the end of our being, and the ſcope
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8689:35"/>
of all our purpoſes, ſtudies, and actions, namely, to be able to know and to glorifie the Creator and preſeruer of the whole world. Of this eternall knowledge, which <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> called <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> we ſay with <hi>Iustin,</hi> who was both a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and a martyr, that all louers of Chriſtian faith ought to endeuor not to be ignorant, no not of any point<note place="margin">How we muſt behaue out ſelues in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our the ſecrets of God.</note> belonging to the knowledge and perfect keeping of God his commandements, but eſpecially they muſt haue in ſingular recommendation his ſeruice and true worſhip. As touching the abſolute and perfect knowledge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie myſteries, they ought to deſire the vnderſtanding of them ſo far foorth as they are able, and according to the gift and meaſure of graces, which ſhall be giuen them from aboue. But if the eie of their ſoule dazell in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them, it ſhall be ſufficient to honor and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them with due reuerence, and to beleeue them ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, knowing that mans vnderſtanding is not able to attaine to the exquiſite knowledge of ſo high myſteries. Naturall philoſophie conſiſteth chiefly in the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks,<note place="margin">Of naturall phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</note> which are diuided into many parts and particular ſciences, of which the moſt of them ſeeme to manie not greatly neceſſarie, as that which intreateth of the nature of the heauens, of the ſunne, of the moone, of their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, meaſures, &amp; of the naturall cauſes of al things.

But the ſubiect of our Academie will not ſuffer vs to handle all theſe ſciences at this preſent. I will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8689:36"/>
ſay thus much onely by the way, that we ought ſo to rule and direct the profeſſion of all naturall philoſophie, that<note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet we muſt aboue all things beware, that we fall not into that curſe of the prophet, which he denounceth againſt thoſe, who being deſtitute of Gods grace by reaſon of their ſinnes, giue themſelues to ſoothſaying, and to ſeeke<note place="margin">Againſt ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, magitians and birth-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers.</note> after ſorcerers, magitians, and calculators of natiuities, which things we ſee are too common amongſt vs: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he is iudged as it were miſerable, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Horoſcope, from whence ſo many abuſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations, and curſed charmes haue proceeded by little and little. Let vs ſhun ſuch vaine knowledge, proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels<note place="margin">The iſſue of all things is to be referred to the prouidence of God.</note> and Atheiſts, and refer our euents and iſſues (which albeit we knew before, yet could we not aſſure our ſelues that we ſhould auoid them) to the onely prouidence and direction of God. It remaineth now to intreate of the other part of philoſophie, called Morall. Of this, I thinke<note place="margin">Of morall phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</note> 
                     <hi>Socrates</hi> the wiſe man meant to ſpeake, when he ſaid, that philoſophie conſiſted not in learning manie things, or in medling with many arts, but in the perfect knowledge of iuſtice, prudence, and of all other morall vertues. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further, that this philoſophie worketh two things in our mind, the one in purging it as well of perturbations, as of falſe opinions, and the other, in cauſing it to returne into the right way by reaſons and exhortations drawen from earthly and ſenſible formes to ſuch as are ſpirituall, which are incloſed within our ſoules, that by them we<note place="margin">God the Idea of all good.</note> may be led to God, the Idea and paterne of all good. This is that morall philoſophie, which we haue vndertaken to handle in all our diſcourſes, and which is ſo neceſſarie for the life of man. For as the vntamed horſe by reaſon of his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8689:36"/>
ouer-great wildnes is not profitable for any thing: ſo he that is drawen away by his affections (which philoſophie onely can moderate) is vnprofitable and vnworthie of all companie, and of all gouernment either publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate. It is philoſophie that teacheth vs the doctrine of<note place="margin">The benefit that commeth by philoſophie.</note> good life, and cauſeth vs to know our miſeries, and the meanes whereby we may be deliuered from them. She it is that frameth in our vnderſtanding the iudgement of reaſon, and learneth vs to lead a life agreeable to doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: ſhewing vnto vs what true honeſtie is, what perfect beautie, and what in truth and in deed is profitable. She repreſſeth all euil paſſions and perturbations of the ſoule, appeaſeth the vnſatiable deſires therof, deliuereth it from all feare, and from all earthlie carefulnes, filling it with tranquillitie, conſtancie, aſſurance, magnanimitie, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie. She purgeth pride, preſumption, ambition, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, reuenge, couetouſnes, iniuſtice, and in a word, ſhe it is, that (by the meanes of reaſon guided by the heauenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which teacheth vs reaſon, and giueth it vnto vs for a law) frameth all the maners and behauior of man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the paterne of vertue, by ingraffing it in his ſetled ſoule, as his onely permanent good, and by cauſing him to do that willingly, which others (as <hi>Xenocrates</hi> ſaid) do by compulſion, and for feare of lawes. We are by philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie inſtructed at large in that dutie and obedience, which we owe to our parents, ſuperiors, and lawes: and taught how much we ought to loue and honor one another, our wiues, our children, our brethren, yea al thoſe that are not of our bloud. She it is (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> that containeth the diſcipline of vertue, of dutie, and of good life: ſhe is alſo<note place="margin">Philoſophie is the art of life.</note> the art and miſtreſſe of life. Briefly, by philoſophie we are taught that perfection, which concerneth all the actions and dealings of men, euen from thoſe who are placed in the gouernment of monarchies, kingdomes, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, cities, and nations, vnto the leſt that liueth vnder them. For ſhe teacheth the one ſort how to command well, and the other to obey well, and to maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpright in euerie eſtate and condition of life, in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8689:37"/>
alteration either of proſperitie or of aduerſitie, yea euen to ſhew themſelues conſtant in contrarie things, by ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pleaſure &amp; ſuſtaining griefe, by deſpiſing glorie and enduring contempt. And to this effect, one of the wiſe Hebrew interpreters, being demanded by <hi>Ptolemie Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What it is to play the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.</note>king of Egypt, what it was to exerciſe philoſophie, anſwered, that it was to reaſon well and directly, to reape great profit by all things that happen, not to be carried away by luſt, to contemn all vanities proceeding of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, and to be guided in euery action by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mediocritie. Now ſeeing it is out of queſtion that the fruit and commoditie of morall philoſophie is ſuch and ſo great, let vs in the next place conſider where and <note place="margin">Where and how philoſophie is learned.</note>how we may learne it, that we may put it in practiſe. There is nothing more true than this, that it dependeth in ſuch ſort of the former, which we called contemplatiue and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, or rather is ſo ioined vnto it, that without this, it can neuer but be vnperfect in man, ſeeing the feare and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is the beginning and perfection of all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <note place="margin">True philoſophy is to be found in the word of God.</note>Moreouer, it is ſo well and perfectly taught vs in the word of God, that nothing more may be added or deſired. Neuertheles the doctrine ioined with examples, which we may draw out of hiſtories, and from the liues of wiſe men, by things that haue beene done in deed, is of great force and efficacie in the ſoule to draw and moue it with delight to ſeeke to reſemble them. For when as man, naturally deſirous of glorie and immortalitie, ſhall ſee, that philoſophers and vertuous men, who were ſo much commended and renowmed, are as it were reuiued againe in theſe daies, after ſo many ages paſt, he will be thereby awakened and pricked forward by this ielouſie of glorie, which by nature is in him, to deſire and bring to paſſe all great matters woorthie to be remembred, to the end he may deſerue the like praiſe and commendation. Therfore we ſhall reape no ſmall profit heereby, yea it will be vnto vs as an entrie to a happie and holie life, and as a guide to ſacred contemplations, if we earneſtly imbrace and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our ſelues in the reading and ſtudie of good authors,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8689:37"/>
who teach vs the precepts of good life: to whom (as <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the great ſaid, ſpeaking of his maiſter <hi>Aristotle)</hi> we <note place="margin">How much we owe to good authors.</note>find our ſelues no leſſe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; beholding, if we through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taſte their doctrine, than to our owne fathers (without offence vnto them be it ſpoken) of whom we haue onely our life and being. But bicauſe the excellencie &amp; highnes of this part of philoſophie, called morall (which is for the correction of life and maners) is ſuch and ſo great, that the ſound and perfect knowledge therof is very hard, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that good beginnings in all great matters are alwaies the difficulteſt part of them, we muſt lay a good ground of our enterpriſe, if we meane to attaine thereunto, and then aſcend vpward from one degree to another. The <note place="margin">The chiefe foundation of al philoſophie.</note>chiefeſt and moſt neceſſarie foundation muſt be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and feruent loue of the truth, and of eternall things, ioined with the ſeparation of lies, and of the deſire of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things far from vs. Secondly, theſe particulars are <note place="margin">Neceſſarie points for a philoſopher.</note>(as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) very neceſſarie for vs: a liuely and ſharpe wit, a nature apt to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation, likewiſe graue, prompt, hardie to execute, and prouident of publike commoditie. But aboue all things the knowledge of the true God is infinitely neceſſarie for him that will be a philoſopher, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that, as all things without the enioying of their vſe and goodnes, are poſſeſſed without profit: ſo to haue knowledge of arts and ſciences without the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the true God, is friuolous and vnprofitable. Yea no man can do any thing that good is, whether it be in priuate or publike affaires, if by reaſon he knoweth not what that is, which ought to be called good. But in this thing we ſhall be well inſtructed (God willing) by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele of our diſcourſes. Thirdly, we muſt continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing the ſtudie of this morall knowledge, as <hi>Cicero</hi> the father of eloquence doth familiarly teach vs, ſaying, <note place="margin">We muſt learne alwaies.</note>that in our ſtudies we are to vſe ſome intermiſſion onely, for the recreation both of bodie and mind in all honeſt ſort, but we muſt neuer leaue and forſake them altogither. Neither ought theſe intermiſſions to be of any long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, bicauſe vice alwaies watcheth to ouer-run vs ſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8689:38"/>
ſoone as we let our ſelues looſe vnto idlenes, to the end to ſtir vs vp through the intiſements of the fleſh, to followe <note place="margin">Againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and ſelfe liking.</note>our naturall imperfections. Much leſſe ought we, through preſumption of our ſelues, and confidence in our owne vertue and ſufficiencie, altogither to forſake the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſtudie, as they do, who thinke themſelues ſuch great doctors, that nothing may be added to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Of theſe men we may truly ſay, that they neuer had the true knowledge of this morall philoſophie, wherein the more we profit, the more we ſhall deſire to learne: and whether we be yoong or old (as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid) we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies find what to learne, and be occaſioned to diminiſh all vaine opinion of our ſelues, ſeeing this is one of the moſt notable effects thereof, to purge all pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. <note place="margin">A fit compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</note>For as thoſe veſſels (ſaith <hi>Plutarke)</hi> wherin we put liquor, do let out the void aire according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that which goeth in: ſo when the ſoule filleth it ſelfe with certaine and true goods, vanitie voideth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth place.

We ſee then how we muſt be the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8689:38"/>
diſciples of philoſophie all our life time. Now as there is nothing, wherin a maſter builder reioiceth ſo much, after he hath laid a good foundation of ſome great worke, as to ſee the progreſſe and proceeding thereof: ſo after we haue laid our firſt happie reſolution (as is ſaid) of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the knowledge of philoſophie, and haue taſted of the firſt principles of hir holeſome fruits, it will turne to our great contentation, and occaſion of proceeding, when we ſee and perceiue that we profite and amende by this ſtudie. This will appeare vnto vs by the conſideration <note place="margin">How we may know whether we profit in philoſophie.</note>of our preſent works and actions, being compared with the former, and by the diminiſhing and qualifiying of our wicked paſſions and naturall inclinations, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this ſcience will vndoubtedly worke in vs. For as we take it for a good ſigne when a diſeaſe remooueth into ſome parts of leaſt account: ſo when our vices are changed into more meeke and ſoft paſſions, it putteth vs in hope that we ſhall wholy deface them afterwarde. The right and perfect way hereunto is to enter deepely into our ſelues, and to take a perfect and ſound knowledge of our naturall, hurtfull and moſt vehement inclinations by comparing one with another. Next, as a good and expert Phiſition before he dealeth with dangerous diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth <note place="margin">A good way to ouercome great faults.</note>with gentle preparatiues, we are firſt to correct leſſer faults, that after we may the eaſier ouercome the greateſt. For it is certaine, that by ſuch an exerciſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of keeping our ſelues from things that are after a ſort excuſable, yea that are permitted and lawfull, it will be farre more eaſie for vs afterward to amend &amp; abſtaine from vnlawfull things. After we haue thus reformed our ſelues, we ſhall wholy forſake ſmall imperfections (which will be eaſie for vs to do) and make no more reckoning of little offences, as thoſe which we ſhall auoid altogither. From thence we ſhall come to conſider and to diſcouer better the nature and cauſe of our greater and more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſſions, together with their vglines and deformitie. Then labouring to diminiſh their force by eſchewing pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the cauſes of them, and by cutting oft one branch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8689:39"/>
now, and then another, we ſhall in the end woonder to ſee how reaſon perfecteth in vs hir office of commanding ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ouer all the perturbations of our ſoule, I meane ſo farre foorth as humane frailtie aided by God, can (as I <note place="margin">When we may be called Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</note>ſaid before) attaine to perfection. Then may we truely call our ſelues Philoſophers, when by our owne example we make it knowne, that the life of man at all times, in al pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in all paſſions, and generally in all affaires receiueth the vſe of Philoſophie. Now after we haue well profited through ſo great diligence &amp; watchfulnes, through ſuch induſtry of minde and continuall ſtudie, I meane after we are become better than we were before, by reaſon of the tranquillitie of our ſoules purged from perturbations, we muſt be carefull that this our commoditie redound alſo to others, as the commandement of God and natural du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie binde vs thereunto. Then (I ſay) we ſhall haue attained <note place="margin">The perfection of Philoſophie.</note>to the perfection of this goodly knowledge, when we are ſeruiceable to our neighbors, brethren and countrimen, not of vaine glory, or for terreſtriall riches, but for the loue of vertue onely, which of it ſelfe is a goodly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for it ſelfe, being ioined with a happy expectation of heauen. But let vs note farther for the laſt point of our diſcourſe, (whereof I haue already briefely ſpoken) that one of the ſureſt meanes, which we can take to come to a true knowledge of Philoſophie, is, not to eſteeme at all, but rather to contemne whatſoeuer is ſubiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is in the power of variable fortune, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers vſe to ſpeake: namely, vainglory, worldly wealth, and other earthly goods, foraſmuch as the deſire of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, keeping and increaſing them is that which carrieth vs away moſt, and which hindreth euery other good and <note place="margin">The contempt of worldly goods neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</note>vertuous inclination. Therefore let vs freely forſake all ſuch things, let vs withdraw our mindes from all by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts, and diſpiſe all earthly diſcommodities: yea let vs patiently ſuſtaine all greefe, that we may yeelde our ſelues wholy to the ſtudie of Philoſophie, which is the <note place="margin">Crates.</note>cauſe of ſo many good things. <hi>Crates</hi> the Theban forſooke his patrimonie of eight talents (which according to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8689:39"/>
common computation amounteth to foure thouſand, eight hundred crownes) that being deliuered from the <note place="margin">Notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of loue to Philoſophie.</note>care of houſ-keeping, and of guiding his goods, he might follow the ſtudie of philoſophie with greater libertie. <note place="margin">Anaxagoras.</note>
                     <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> for the ſame cauſe ſuffered his lands to lie waſte, and after long ſtudie returning to his houſe, and finding it altogether fallen into ruine and deſolation, he ſaid, if theſe things had not periſhed, I had periſhed: as if he had ſaid, that he ſhould neuer haue gotten the treaſure of knowledge, which was the ornament of his minde, if he had giuen himſelfe to gaine and to gather goods. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Democritus.</note>
                     <hi>Abderita,</hi> being verie rich (as may be gathered by the feaſt which his father made to that innumerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of <hi>Xerxes</hi> who came into Graecia, which conſiſted, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, of more than two millions of fighting men) gaue all his patrimonie to his countrey, reſeruing to himſelfe but a little ſome of money to liue withall, that he might haue the more leaſure to ſtudie philoſophie, for <note place="margin">Euclide.</note>which cauſe he went to dwell at Athens. <hi>Euclide,</hi> of the towne of Megara, being verie deſirous to heare <hi>Socrates</hi> dwelling at Athens, betweene which two cities the warre was ſo cruel, that no Citizen of the one citie durſt be ſeen in the other, without ineuitable danger of death if he were knowne, had notwithſtanding ſo great loue to wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that although he were an Ethnick, and doubted of a ſecond life, yet he preferred the deſire of knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the care of his life, and being apparailed like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, went once in two daies to Athens and abode there all night to heare <hi>Socrates,</hi> who commonly ſpent the moſt part thereof in diſcourſing of wiſedome, and then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe about the break of the day. Now to conclude our preſent treatiſe, we will hold this, that onely philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie can giue vs certaine knowledge, &amp; teach vs how we <note place="margin">Philoſophie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacheth vs to know our chiefe good.</note>may inioy in this life our onely &amp; ſoueraign good, which is the reſt and tranquillitie of our ſoules. Yea ſhe is vnto vs in ſtead of a guide to lead vs to the eternall fruition of our ſupreame and euerabiding good, which is promiſed, and purchaſed by the blood of the immaculate Lamb in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8689:40"/>
that ſecond and moſt happie life. And, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the mouth of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that they onely ſhal attaine to the kingdom of heauen with God, who end their daies in this life purged by philoſophie, ſo ſhall it be by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable loue of this eternall wiſedome, that we ſhall be purged, clenſed and ſaued. Yea through the expectation of this bleſſed felicitie we may a great deale more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than did all thoſe great and ancient philoſophers, lead a contented, ioyfull and quiet life, void of all perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and feare, for aſmuch as they knew the iuſtice of God onely, and not his mercy, which is aſſured vnto vs in his beloued ſonne. Moreouer they were ignorant (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their philoſophie) of the chiefe point of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, namely of the beginning of all things and of their <note place="margin">The true cauſe of ioy and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie in a Chriſtian ſoule.</note>end, which the word of God teacheth vs together with the truth of that permanent happines of the ſoule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had but a ſhadow in their life. Heerof our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe hath left good and ſure pledges in the depth of our harts, ſaying that he gaue and left his peace with vs, his peace (I ſay) in our ſoules, and not with the world. Therefore it appeereth ſufficiently, that nothing is ſo much to be deſired, whether we regard profite to our ſelues, or ſeruice to the whole bodie and ſocietie of our brethren and countrimen, as the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of philoſophie, which is the knowledge of life, and the true medicine and til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of the ſoule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all vertue is taught vs.</p>

                  <p>The diſputation concerning the good of man hath indeed alwaies been great amongſt the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo that as well their diuers opinions, as their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would ſtay vs heere with too long a diſcourſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing they are vnneceſſarie for vs, who ſeeke onely to be inſtructed in the truth. Now that we may attaine heerunto, and to the perfect vnderſtanding of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is heere propounded vnto vs, we will heere ſet downe this Maxime, or principle, confeſſed of al the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt ancient philoſophers, and agreeable to that truth, which is taught vs in the holie ſcriptures, that <hi>There</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Two ſorts of goods.</note> 
                     <hi>are two ſorts of goods, the one which is the last end, the other is the meanes to attaine thereunto.</hi> The firſt is the ſouereigne, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, moſt perfect, and eternall good, which we expect and hope for in the immortalitie of the ſecond life, when we ſhall enioy that true and abſolute felicitie, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eie hath euer ſeene, nor eare heard, neither hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred<note place="margin">Vertue is the effect of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> at any time into the hart of man. That which we call the meanes whereby we come to the firſt is vertue onely, whereof we are now to ſpeake, and which is the proper effect of our regeneration by the ſpirit of God dwelling in vs. Firſt then let vs conſider what vertue is, alſo the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, ſountaine, incomparable excellencie, and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force thereof, with thoſe woonderfull effects which it worketh in him that poſſeſſeth hir: wherein alſo we will ſee ſome notable examples of ancient men. Vertue (as the<note place="margin">The definition of vertue.</note> philoſophers ſay) is a diſpoſition and power of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable part of the ſoule, which bringeth into order and decencie the vnreſonable part, by cauſing it to propound a conuenient end to it own affections and paſſions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſoule abideth in a comely and decent habit, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which ought to be done, according to reaſon.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8689:41"/>
But to ſpeake more briefly, Vertue is a proportion and vprightnes of life in all points agreeable to reaſon. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion thereof is altogither like to that of philoſophie. For they are ſo linked togither, that it is all one to be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to be a philoſopher, the one being the matter and ſubſtance of the other. Vertue therefore is diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Contemplatiue</hi> and into <hi>Morall.</hi> The eternall Wiſedome by the operation of his ſpirit, guideth and lifteth vp the contemplatiue vertue to hir proper end, which is that happie and immutable knowledge, that concerneth the maieſtie of God. This did <hi>Socrates</hi> call <hi>Religion,</hi> and the greateſt vertue, ſaying further, that the contempt thereof brought vpon men a curſed ignorance, and that no man ought to perſuade himſelfe, that he could finde amongſt<note place="margin">Socrates called religion the greateſt vertue.</note> the race of men any greater vertue than religion and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards God, whoſe honor is the foundation of euerie good worke, which if it be ouerthrowne, the other parts are as ſoone diſperſed as the peeces of a ruinous building. Yea religion is not onely the head of iuſtice and vertue, but alſo is as it were the ſoule to giue vigor and ſtrength vnto it. From this ſupreme ſcience floweth prudence,<note place="margin">The dutie of prudence.</note> which is a worke thereof, appointed to gouerne, rule, and moderate by the meanes of morall vertue, the paſſions and affections of the vnreaſonable part of the ſoule in all mediocritie, by cutting off all exceſſe and defect of thoſe paſſions, and by moderating them between too little and too much, thereby to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>epe men from erring. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſhe holdeth a man within the limits of prowes and valure, leaſt he ſhould caſt away himſelfe through raſhnes or cowardlines: ſhe cauſeth him wiſely to vſe liberalitie, bicauſe he ſhould not be ſpoiled by couetouſnes, or fall into prodigalitie. And that he ſhould not be caſt downe too much in aduerſitie, nor lift vp beyond meaſure in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, ſhe keepeth him vpright and conſtant both in the one and in the other. Thus doth vertue generally teach a man, by following the reaſon of true prudence, to rule all his inclinations and actions as well for his owne priuate good, as for the profit and vtilitie of humane ſocietie.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8689:42"/>
Whereby it appeereth ſufficiently vnto vs, that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation<note place="margin">The foundation and ſpring of all vertue.</note> of all vertue is that diuine reaſon, which floweth into our ſoules from the free goodnes of our God, and which taketh liuely roote by care, ſtudie, and diligence, when the ſelfe-ſame grace bleſſeth our labour. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this we can do nothing, ſo that all our meditations and purpoſes to liue vprightly, continently, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately become vaine and friuolous before his maieſtie. In this maner, of that excellent reaſon and wiſedome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the eternall wiſedome enricheth vs, that we might know good and euill, prudence is ingendred, which is moſt neceſſarie for the gouernment of earthlie things (whereof we will intreat heerafter) and whereby man is enriched with morall vertue, as with an infallible rule of all his works and actions, to the end that fully enioying<note place="margin">Wherein hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane happines conſiſteth.</note> humane felicitie, which conſiſteth in good maners, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and conditions of the ſoule, he may bring foorth the fruits and effects thereof to the profit of many. We ſay then, that all vertue conſiſteth in mediocritie, as vice doth in exceſſe or in defect, in regard wherof ſhe is in the midſt, albeit in reſpect of hir ſelfe, I meane of hir perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute excellencie ſhe is extreme, and ſtandeth not in need of any increaſe or diminution. Now as all the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoule are called vices and paſſions, ſo all their contraries, which ſerue for remedies vnto them, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vertues. And although vertue be alwaies one, ſo that he which hartily imbraceth one part of it is deſirous of them all, yet may ſhe be called by diuers names, euen by ſo many, as there is alwaies in euery good action ſome particular vertue, that maketh it eminent, and to be ſeene aboue others. Moreouer, according to the diuers ſubiects wherein ſhe is, ſhe bringeth foorth diuers effects, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hir ſelfe in ſome ſort to the maners, conditions, and naturall inclinations of thoſe which poſſeſſe hir. Heereof it commeth, that ſome are more apt and conſtant in ſome<note place="margin">The gifts and graces of God are diuers in men.</note> one vertue than others are (for all can not do all things) and that one practiſeth it after one faſhion, and an other otherwiſe. Now it followeth, that I handle heereafter
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8689:42"/>
diſtinctly and in order, the pluralitie of vertues, with their ſeuerall properties. But in the meane while, to ſpeake generally of this pretious and ineſtimable riches, I meane of vertue, and of the great, worthie, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects, which ſhe bringeth forth in men, firſt, ſhe is the<note place="margin">The excellencie and propertie of vertue.</note> onely proper and true good of the ſoule, that can not by any accident be violently taken and caried away. She alone maketh hir poſſeſſor happie, cauſing him to finde euery kinde of life that is ſweet, pleaſant, and acceptable, contained in hir. Vertue alone, is the onely matter of reſt and tranquillitie in the mind, being by reaſon purged of feare, of trouble, of worldly deſire and ioy. Of this liuely fountaine ſpake <hi>Democritus,</hi> when he ſaid that ioy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered in mens harts, of the mediocritie of pleaſure, and of a moderate and temperate harmonie of life. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (ſaid <hi>Thales)</hi> is the profitableſt thing in the world, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Euerie thing is made profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble through vertue.</note> it maketh all other things profitable, by cauſing men to vſe them well. Yea we may ſay further, that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts and riches remaine vnprofitable and hurtfull, without the ornament of vertue. <hi>Cicero</hi> prooueth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodlie reaſons, that onely vertue is of it ſelfe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cauſe men to liue well and happily. And ſurely eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and vertuous man of what calling ſoeuer he be, is ſo happie, if he haue grace to know it, that he need not to wiſh for any thing with paſſion or trauell in this life, but rather is content of himſelfe in regard of men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth the care of worldly things, not iudging any thing euil, which neceſſitie of nature, or rather the ordinance of God bringeth vpon him. And where miſeries are doubled, there vertue ſheweth hir effects moſt wonderfully, giuing vs therby to vnderſtand, that ſhe conſiſteth in ſuch things as are moſt rare and difficult. For which cauſe hir ſtrength<note place="margin">Vertue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a palme tree.</note> is compared to the date tree, which the more it is pulled downe, the more it returneth vpward: ſo when vertue is moſt oppreſſed of hir enimies ſhe ſhineth moſt gloriouſly. Onely vertue appeareth woonderfull to the minde that is cloathed therewith, and keepeth it from coueting that which others commonly worſhip, namely, great callings,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8689:43"/>
riches, pleaſures and glory. She deſpiſeth the praiſe &amp; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of men, wherunto ſo many others make themſelues <note place="margin">The reward of vertue in the life to come is of the free mercie of God.</note>ſlaues, &amp; remaineth alwais free in hir ſelfe, &amp; free to euery one, without any other hope of reward, then to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, &amp; to effect things meete tobe rewarded eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the next life by the liberalitie of God. If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare worldly goods with vertue (calling that good which vſurpeth that name, &amp; is ſubiect to corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) firſt, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thoſe which the philoſophers cal the goods of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, &amp; namely nobility, wherin at this men ſtay ſo much, what is it but a good of our anceſtors? Riches are eaſily loſt, yea cauſeth the poſſeſſor of them to be ſooner loſt: &amp; as for the glorie of the greateſt, yea of al principalitie, it is <note place="margin">Compariſon of worldly goods with vertue.</note>no leſſe vncertaine. Concerning the goods of the bodie, beauty &amp; comelines is but a flower of ſmall continuance: helth, which is ſo precious, ſoon changeth: ſtrength is loſt by infinit inconueniences. Al bodily pleaſure is vnperfect, &amp; followed of perturbations. But vertue is that onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine &amp; immortall qualitie in vs, which, (as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> ſaith) <note place="margin">Nothing hath power ouer vertue.</note>is a ſtable &amp; ſure poſſeſſion both to the liuing and to the dead: ouer which neither fortune, ſlander, ſicknes, old-age nor aduerſitie haue any power: and as for length of time, which diminiſheth all things, it alwaies addeth ſomewhat to vertue, &amp; encreaſeth it. All the other goods aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, are from without a man, working oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their poſſeſſors, &amp; commonly coming to thoſe that are leaſt woorthy of them. Onely vertue is the proper inheritance of the ſoule, worketh the hapines therof, and maketh a man alwaies worthy of true glory &amp; praiſe, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to be honored &amp; eſteemed euen of his enimies. In a word it cannot (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) be vttered how much <note place="margin">Vertue cannot be valued.</note>vertue ſurmounteth all other things in glorie &amp; excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. And if all other goods of men (ſaith <hi>Socrates)</hi> were laid by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues they would amount in value but to one mote in reſpect of the price of vertue. <hi>Plato</hi> his diſciple ſaith, that the difference of vertue compared with other goods, is ſo great, that if they were put into one skale of the balance, &amp; vertue into the other, this would aſcend vp to heauen,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8689:43"/>
and the other would touch the earth. Moreouer, he wrote foure &amp; fiftie books or dialogues, which did all intreat of vertue, out of which men may reape infinite profite, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially out of thoſe that intreat of a common-wealth, or of lawes. In theſe books that he might not ſeeme vngratefull <note place="margin">Why Plato in his works brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in Socrates ſpeaking.</note>towarde his maſter <hi>Socrates,</hi> who would neuer write any thing, he bringeth him in rehearſing that, which at other times he had heard him ſpeake. <hi>Stilpo</hi> the philoſopher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his citie of Megara when it was taken &amp; ſpoiled by <hi>Demetrius</hi> king of Macedonia, who fauouring him, asked if he had loſt any thing that was his, made this anſwer: No ſir (quoth he) for war cannot ſpoile vertue. And indeede this is that riches wherwith we ought to furniſh our ſelues which can ſwim with vs in a ſhipwrack, and which cauſed <note place="margin">Wherein the happines and greatnes of a king conſiſteth.</note>
                     <hi>Socrates</hi> to anſwere thus to one, who asked him what his opinion was of the great king, whether he did not thinke him very happy; I cannot tell (quoth he) how he is proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of knowledge &amp; vertue. Who may iuſtly doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertue alone is able to make a man happie, ſeeing it doth not onely make him wiſe, prudent, iuſt &amp; good, both in his doings &amp; ſayings, but alſo commonly procureth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him honor, glorie and authoritie? It was through hir <note place="margin">What it was that procured to Alexander the ſurname of Great.</note>meanes, that <hi>Alexander</hi> deſerued the ſurname of <hi>Great,</hi> by that experience which ſhe gaue him in warre, by his liberalitie in riches, by his temperance in all his ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous magnificence, by his hardines and conſtancy in fight, by his continency in affections, by his bountie and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie in victorie, and by all other vertues, wherein he ſurpaſſed all that liued in his time. Yea the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme of his vertues procured a greater number of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, countries and men to ſubmit themſelues willingly vnto him without bloweſtriking, than did the power of his armie. Wherein this ſentence of <hi>Socrates</hi> is found true, <hi>that whole troupes of ſouldiers, and heapes of riches, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained oftentimes to obey vertue.</hi> What ſaid <hi>Darius,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narche of the Perſians, when he vnderſtoode both what continencie <hi>Alexander</hi> his enimie had vſed towards his wife, who being exceeding beautifull was taken priſoner
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8689:44"/>
by him, and what humanitie he ſhewed afterward in hir funerals when ſhe was dead? The Perſians (quoth he) neede not be diſcouraged, neither thinke themſelues cowards and effeminate becauſe they were vanquiſhed of ſuch an aduerſarie. Neither do I demand any victorie of the gods, but to ſurmount <hi>Alexander</hi> in bountifulnes. And if it be ſo that I muſt fall, I beſeech them to ſuffer none but him to ſit in the royall throne and ſeat of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Will we haue teſtimonies of the inuicible force of vertue, and of hir powerfull and praiſewoorthy effects in moſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and vntoward matters? Hiſtories declare vnto vs, that amongſt all the vertuous acts, which procured praiſe and renowme to the men of old time, thoſe were the notableſt &amp; moſt commended, which they ſhewed foorth <note place="margin">Examples of the force and effects of vertue, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.</note>at ſuch time as fortune ſeemed to haue wholy beaten them downe. <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> generall captaine of the Thebans, who deliuered them from the bondage of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <note place="margin">Pelopidas.</note>is more praiſed and eſteemed for the great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vertue, which he ſhewed being priſoner in the hands of <hi>Alexander</hi> the tyrannous king of the Phereans, then for all his victories gotten before. For at that time his vertue was ſo farre from yeelding any iot to his calamitie, that contrariwiſe with an vnſpeakeable conſtancie he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the inhabitants of the towne, that came to viſite him, exhorting them to be of good courage, ſeeing the houre was come, wherin the tyrant ſhould be at once pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his wickednes. And one day he ſent him word, that he was deſtitute of all iudgement and reaſon, in that he vexed his poore citizens, &amp; cauſed them to die in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments who neuer offended him, and in the meane time ſuffered him to liue in reſt, of whom he could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that eſcaping his hands he would be reuenged of him. The tyrant maruelling at his great courage, asked why he made ſuch great haſte to die. To this end (quoth he) that thou being yet more hated of God and men than <note place="margin">Philocles.</note>thou art, mighteſt the ſooner be deſtroied. <hi>Philocles,</hi> one of the moſt famous Athenian captaines of his time (who cauſed this law to be made, that the right thombe of all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8689:44"/>
priſoners taken in war from that time forward ſhould be cut off, that they might not handle a pike any more, but yet might ſerue to rowe with an oare) being taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with three thouſand Atheniens in one battell, which <hi>Lyſander</hi> admirall of the Lacedemonians obtained againſt him, and al of them being condemned to die, was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Lyſander</hi> what paine he iudged himſelfe worthie of for counſelling his country-men to ſo wicked and cruell a thing. To whom he made this onely anſwere with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable vertue, <hi>Accuſe not thoſe who haue no iudge to hear</hi> &amp; <note place="margin">A moſt conſtant death.</note>
                     <hi>know their cauſe.</hi> But ſeeing the gods haue ſhewed thee this fauour to be conqueror, deale with vs as we would haue done with thee, if we had ouercome thee. Which being ſaid, he went to waſh and bath himſelfe, and then putting on a rich cloke as if he ſhould haue gone to ſome feaſt, he offered himſelfe firſt to the ſlaughter, ſhewing the way of true conſtancie to his fellow citizens. <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, <note place="margin">Anaxarchus.</note>being taken priſoner by the commandement of <hi>Nero,</hi> that he might know of him, who were the authors of a conſpiracie that was made againſt his eſtate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led towards him for the ſame cauſe, he bit his toong in <note place="margin">A woonderfull magnanimitie.</note>ſunder with his teeth, and did ſpit it in his face, knowing well that otherwiſe the tyrant would haue compelled him by all ſorts of tortures and torments to reueale &amp; diſcloſe them. <hi>Zeno</hi> miſſing his purpoſe, which was to haue killed the tyrant <hi>Demylus,</hi> did aſmuch to him. But what is more terrible than death? Notwithſtanding when did vertue better ſhew hir greatnes and power, then when death la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured moſt to ouerthrow hir, as being reſolued of that ſaying of <hi>Cicero,</hi> that all wiſe men die willingly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care, <note place="margin">A wiſe man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth willingly.</note>but that the vnwiſe &amp; ignorant are at their wits ende for feare of death? If many, who haue not knowne the true and perfect immortalitie of the ſoule, and ſome, onely led with a deſire of praiſe &amp; worldly glorie, others touched with duty and kindled with a loue towards their countrey, haue ſhewed the increaſe of their vertue in the horrors and pangs of death, what ought they to do, who expect certainely an euerlaſting life? <hi>Phocion,</hi> after he had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8689:45"/>
beene choſen generall captaine of the Athenians foure and fortie times, and done infinite ſeruices to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, being at length through certaine parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges and diuiſions ouercome with the weakeſt ſide which he had mainetained, and being condemned to drinke poiſon, was demaunded before he dranke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had no more to ſaye. Whereupon ſpeaking to his ſonne, he ſaide, I commaunde thee to beare the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians no rancor and malice for my death. And a little before this ſpeech, beholding one of thoſe that were condemned to die with him, to vexe himſelfe through impatiencie, what meaneſt thou poore man, <note place="margin">The feare of death doth not aſtoniſh the vertuous.</note>(quoth he to him) doeſt thou not thinke thy ſelfe happie that thou maiſt die with <hi>Phocion?</hi> The feare and appreheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of death doth aſtoniſh, as we commonly ſay, the ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, but not the moſt vertuous. For they know (as <hi>Plautus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Callicratides.</note>ſaith) that he dieth not, who for vertues ſake is put to death. <hi>Callicratides,</hi> Generall of the Lacedemonians, being readie to giue battell to his enimies, the ſoothſaier, after ſacrifice done to the gods ſaid vnto him, that the intrals of the ſacrifices promiſed victorie to the armie, but death to the captaine. Whereunto he anſwered as one without all feare; although he beleeued it as an oracle from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <hi>Sparta conſisteth not in one man.</hi> For when I ſhal be dead my countrie ſhall be nothing leſſened, but if I recule now and draw backe, the reputation thereof will be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whereupon ſubſtituting in his place <hi>Cleander,</hi> as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in his office, he gaue battell, wherein it happened vnto him as the ſoothſaier had told him. If we deſire infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſuch examples, hiſtories are ful of them, euen of thoſe who loued rather to kill themſelues (which a Chriſtian neuer ought to do, but onely to ſuffer death patiently, if it be offered vnto him) than to commit any thing vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie their vertue. <hi>Themistocles</hi> being vniuſtly baniſhed <note place="margin">Themiſtocles loue to his countrie.</note>from Athens, retired to the king of Perſia, whoſe great fauour and benefits receiued, cauſed to ſay to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>We had beene vndone, if we had not beene vndone:</hi> as alſo to promiſe, that he would imploy himſelfe in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8689:45"/>
Notwithſtanding when he ſaw the war begun againe betweene this king and the Athenians, wherein he was offered a great charge, he choſe rather to haſten his death by a poiſon which he tooke, than to ſeeme to be pricked or prouoked with malice againſt his vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countrie-men, leaſt thereby he ſhould obſcure and blot the glorie of ſo many goodly exploites, triumphes, and victories, which he had obtained. Nowe if death can not ſtoppe the courſe of vertue, how much leſſe can any other weaker. accident do it? Old-age, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth <note place="margin">Age hath no power ouer vertue. <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi>
                     </note>and conſumeth all the ſtrength of the bodie, coulde not weaken the great vertue of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> king of Lacedemonia, who being fower-ſcore yeeres of age, and ſeeing the glorie of his countrie brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by that victorie, which the Thebanes had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him, withdrewe himſelfe into the ſeruice of a king of Egypt, and tooke the charge of a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnder him, that through the good ſeruice he ſhould do him, he might deſerue (whereof he aſſured himſelfe) to haue ſuccour of him for his owne countrey affaires. Enuie (ſaith <hi>Thucidides)</hi> is heard to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and followeth great eſtates and potentates. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glorie and riches, are but firebrandes to kindle it. Notwithſtanding the excellencie of vertue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times triumpheth ouer it, ſo that the enuious are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſpeake well of vertuous men. We ſee then cleerely, and haue better experience thereof in our ſelues if we be decked with vertue, that ſhe is of an inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible force, and that all things are tamed by hir. For who can doubt that through hir, great empires, monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, commonwealths, eſtats and cities haue much more floriſhed, than through force and might of armes? The <note place="margin">Vertue cauſeth kingdoms to floriſh.</note>ſequele of our diſcourſes ſhall furniſh vs with examples hereof. Now to conclude our preſent matter, knowing that vertue deſerueth ſo great praiſe in regarde of hir fruits, and of hir woonderfull great effects, we ſay, that <note place="margin">Vertue is the onely honeſt, profitable, and pleaſant good.</note>ſhe is the onely good both for honeſtie, profite and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, between which there is ſuch a coniunction, that they

cannot be ſeperated one from another, (as hereafter we may intreat more at large) ſo that the ſeuering of theſe three things to attribute them to other earthly and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing goods, is the fountaine of all vice, deceit, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. If then, trouble, loſſe, hazard or danger are to be found in the practiſe and exerciſe of this holie and ſacred vertue (as euen the greateſt worldly happines is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſed with euill and difficultie) ought we not to diſpiſe all ſuch things, yea death it ſelfe for that happie recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which is aſſured vnto vs, not onely of immortall glorie and praiſe (which the men of old time promiſed to themſelues) but alſo of life euerlaſting, whereof the moſt of them were ignorant? Let vs not be like to a little child (for he that is a child in minde differeth nothing from a childe in age) who ſeeing a trifle wherewith he plaieth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his hand, caſteth away for anger that which he holdeth in his other hand, although it be ſome daintie thing and good to eate. But let vs with feruent zeale and burning affection, alwaies imbrace this ſo precious and chaſte beautie, I meane vertue, which alone filleth the life of man, with true, ſound and perfect contentation. Let all things come behinde vertue, after the example of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent and ancient perſonages, who ought to make vs bluſh for ſhame, when we conſider, that the care of <note place="margin">Anacharſis for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that he might the better obtaine vertue.</note>earthly goods hath the firſt place amongſt vs. <hi>Anacharſis</hi> a Barbarian, being led with the onely loue of vertue, left the kingdome of Scythia to his yoonger brother, &amp; went into Graecia, where he profited ſo well with <hi>Solon,</hi> that he deſerued to be placed in the number of the ſeauen Sages. <note place="margin">Three things neceſſarie for the obtaining of vertue.</note>Now if three things (after we haue asked them of him who only can and will giue them vnto vs) meete togither in vs, namely, <hi>Nature, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>

                  <p>I haue alwaies learned of wiſe men, that this ſaying of an ancient man is moſt true, That there is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times more paine in doing euill, than in well doing: <note place="margin">Vice is like a dropſie.</note>and that vice hath the ſame effect in the ſoule, which the dropſie hath in the bodie. For both of them do plant in man a continuall deſire of that which breedeth his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt bane. Whereupon moſt miſerably he ſeeketh after his owne perdition and ruine with paine and trauell, wheras he might paſſe through felicitie in this life, into that life which is eternall and moſt happie. One chiefe occaſion heerof, as I thinke, may be attributed to the ignorance of euill. For what wicked man is ſo dull of vnderſtanding, that, if he knew certainly what vice were, would not with all his might ſeparate himſelfe as farre from it, as for the time he drew neere vnto it? By a ſtronger reaſon it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he which truly knoweth it, before it be growen <note place="margin">When we begin to hate vice.</note>to a habit within him, wil ſhun it more diligently: bicauſe we begin then to hate vices (as <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith) when by reaſon we vnderſtand what ſhame and harme commeth of them. Therefore it muſt needs be very profitable for vs to vtter heerin that, which we haue learned by the ſtudie of philoſophie, and that briefly for this preſent, hoping heerafter to intreate more particularly of the principall parts of vice. Firſt we will define it, then conſider the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious effects thereof in the ſoule, and the fruits which it bringeth with it: thirdly, declare how it neuer eſcapeth vnpuniſhed: and laſtly, ſhew how we muſt fortifie our

Vice is an inequalitie and <note place="margin">The definition of vice.</note>iarring of maners, proceeding from mans naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to pleaſures and naughtie deſires. This inclination not being reined with the bit of reaſon, guided by the ſpirit of grace, nor ruled by the wiſe declarations thereof, cauſeth a man by little and little to giue ouer himſelfe to all wicked paſſions (the end of one being the beginning of another) whereby he becommeth moſt vnhappie, yea more wild and ſauage than any brute beaſt. <hi>Chryſippus</hi> a Stoike philoſopher, called vice the proper eſſence of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happines. And ſurely it is a very perfect workmaiſter of wretchednes, diſpoſing and framing men to all kinde of miſchiefe and miſerie. For after it hath once taken hold of the ſoule, it will neuer forſake it vntill it hath wholie bruſed, ouerwhelmed, and deſtroied it, filling it daily with <note place="margin">The effects of vice.</note>perturbations and new paſſions, with voluptuouſnes, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor, enmities, reuenge, murders, anguiſh, feare, fruitleſſe repentance, ambition, couetouſnes, and with all other luſts, which are incurable diſeaſes of the ſoule, after they haue once taken roote therein. For the more they waxe, the more they will grow, vice being (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) of an <note place="margin">Vice is of an endles ſtocke.</note>infinite and endles race. And therefore the aboue named <hi>Chryſippus</hi> ſaid not without reaſon, that to auoid ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an enimie, and one that ought to be ſo odious vnto <note place="margin">Although we are to hate vice with a perfect hatred, yet we muſt not kill our ſelues to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Beſides, they had ſo great power ouer themſelues, that in the midſt of torments they were able to ſtay their voice altogither: inſomuch that one would haue either iudged them to be ſenſeleſſe, or els think that in ſeeing them he did not ſee them. But vice alwaies diſcouereth it ſelfe, and euery where appeereth <note place="margin">Nothing more hurtfull than vice.</note>ſhamefull, infamous, and hurtfull. <hi>Thales</hi> called vice the hurtfulleſt thing in the world, bicauſe that where it is, it marreth and deſtroieth all. Moreouer, it maketh thoſe things, which otherwiſe ſeeme honorable and magnifical, lothſome and vnpleaſant, when it is mingled with them: yea it appeereth ſo much the more infamons, as the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie <note place="margin">Vice ioined with authoritie is more hurtfull.</note>and authoritie whereunto it is ioined is greater, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then it diſcouereth better what pernitious and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable effects it hath. For taking a ſwift courſe by the high way of power, and driuing forward euery wicked affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to execution, it cauſeth choler to be turned preſently into murder, loue into adulterie, couetouſnes into confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſo in other paſſions. But as the vices of the greater ſort are more dangerous, ſo no doubt, ſhame and diſhonor are likewiſe doubled vpon them, bicauſe they are better ſeene and noted, whereby they become more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and contemptible to euery one. Beſides, their reward lieth at their gate in great meaſure, which will not be long from them. For to whom more is giuen, of him more ſhall <note place="margin">A good leſſon for great men.</note>be required. And I pray you what greater cauſe of ſhame and bluſhing can that man haue, who being borne to command men of all eſtates and conditions, doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe obey ſuch vile and abiect things, as are ſenſualitie, ignorance, concupiſcence, &amp; other like paſſions wrought by vice, which being without reaſon, are made to obey and to be ruled by reaſon? Neither are we more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed than the greater ſort when we follow after ſuch things, bicauſe we are but of meane and ſmall calling. For euery one is borne to command himſelfe, whereunto our chiefe ſtudie and labour ought to tend. We haue further to note diligently, that vice is not onely hurtfull to him that is infected therewith, but alſo that it vſeth him as a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8689:48"/>
miniſter and inſtrument to corrupt and ſpoile others. For <note place="margin">The propertie of the wicked.</note>you ſhall neuer ſee any wicked man, that laboureth not to make others like himſelfe: which if he cannot do, yet he will ſo thinke of them, and ſeeke to perſuade all others, that they are ſuch, or rather worſe than himſelfe. Wherby it is eaſie ynough to iudge, that this is that, which vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and deſtroieth communalties and Commonwealths, townes and cities, when the gouernors and magiſtrates of them are miniſters of vices. The change of monarchies, eſtates, and kingdoms proceeded alwaies of vice. <hi>Roboam</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The alteration of kingdoms commeth of vice.</note>through want of prudence, <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> through intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancy and luxuriouſnes, the laſt French king of the race of <hi>Clouis</hi> through retchleſnes, <hi>Perſes</hi> of Macedonia tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough raſhnes, with infinite others, whoſe examples we ſhall ſee heerafter, loſt their kingdoms through vices. But that we may yet haue greater occaſion to hate and ſhun this horrible monſter of nature, let vs know that vice cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticeth it ſelfe. Which is not done onely by mans law, out of which the mightier ſort (as <hi>Anacharſis</hi> ſaid) eſcape as great flies that breake through the ſpiders web, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment <note place="margin">Offences are neuer without paine.</note>alſo of which may oftentimes be auoided for a time, but euen the paine followeth the offence ſo neere, that it is equall vnto it both for age and time. For from that very inſtant wherein wickednes is committed, ſhe frameth for and of hir ſelfe hir owne torment, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſuffer the paine of hir miſchieuous deede through the remorſe thereof. This is that worme that continually gnaweth the conſcience of a malefactor, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his miſerable life with ſhame and confuſion, with frights, perturbations, anguiſh, and continuall diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, euen to his very dreames, ſo that all his life time he is deſtitute of all tranquillitie and reſt of ſpirit, wherein on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humane felicitie conſiſteth. And therefore one of the Hebrew interpreters well and truly anſwered king <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> who asked him how he might be in reſt when he drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Let pietie (quoth this wiſe man vnto him) be the <note place="margin">How a man may haue continuall quietnes.</note>ſcope of all thy ſayings and doings. For by applying al thy diſcourſes and works to excellent things, whether thou
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8689:49"/>
ſleepeſt or wakeſt, thou ſhalt haue quiet reſt in regard of thy ſelfe. Truly that man feareth nothing, whoſe ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from all notorious crimes, followeth the will of God, who directeth all counſels to good. But (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) there is nothing that maketh a man ſo fearefull, as the remembrance of his life paſſed in ſhame. Yea preſently <note place="margin">The force of conſcience in the wicked.</note>after the offence (ſaith <hi>Iustin Martyr)</hi> the conſcience of a wicked man is vnto him in ſtead of an accuſer, a witnes, a iudge, and a hangman. This is that, which the ſcripture <note place="margin">Leuit. 26. 36.</note>teacheth vs in Leuiticus, ſaying, that the wicked ſhal trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the fall of the leafe of a tree, &amp; that they ſhall be as if their life hung by a thread. We ought to be perſuaded that this violence of mans conſcience commeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, who cauſeth his enimies to feele his iudgement and furie in ſuch ſort, that they cannot abide it, but are conſtrained to condemne themſelues. And if our hart condemne vs, God is greater than our hart. Now although the word ſhould wholie faile in this, yet we haue the teſtimonie of nature imprinted with ſuch characters in our harts, that it did euen compell the ancient poets to finde out and to faigne <hi>Furies,</hi> as reuengers of our ſins, which are nothing elſe but the torments of euill conſciences. This is that <note place="margin">Eſay. 66. 24.</note>worme wherof <hi>Eſaie</hi> ſpeaketh, which dieth not, but gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Examples of tormented con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in the wicked.</note>and deuoureth them without ceaſing. <hi>Caligula,</hi> a moſt cruell Emperor, neuer had ſecure and quiet reſt, but being terrified and in feare, awoke often, as one that was vexed and caried headlong with wonderfull paſſions. <hi>Nero,</hi> after he had killed his mother, confeſſed that whileſt he ſlept, he was troubled by hir, and tormented with <hi>Furies,</hi> that burned him with flaming torches. Let vs not then ſuppoſe <note place="margin">A wiſe man is aſhamed to attend before himſelfe.</note>that, although a wicked act may be hidden and kept cloſe from men, therefore the torment is the leſſe, (which a wiſe man neuer thinketh of, knowing that he ought to be in more reuerence of himſelfe than of others) but rather more greeuous within vs, not for the only feare of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhame or puniſhment, but for the apprehenſion of the iuſt iudgement of God, from whom nothing is hid. He purſueth the wicked hard at the heeles for the moſt part,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8689:49"/>
and knoweth how to take vengeance of their iniquitie in due time. And if he defer the puniſhment, it ſerueth but to <note place="margin">Why God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon the wicked.</note>aggrauate their condemnation ſo much the more vpon their heads, and to make the puniſhment more horrible, whereof we ought to ſtand in greater feare, than of any bodily paine, bicauſe the dolor thereof abideth for euer. He that would go about to repeate heer ſeuerally al thoſe vices wherewith men may be infected, and wherein we ſee them commonly wallow, ſhould find their number very great, yea infinite. But (as <hi>Democritus</hi> ſaid) let vs onely lay open that which is within vs, and we ſhal find there a heap and conſerue of many, diuers, and different euils, which haue their originall beginning from thence. For as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes follow bodies, ſo paſſions and vices follow ſoules. Heerafter we may diſcourſe more particularly of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of them, and of their proper and peculiar effects, with that iuſt puniſhment, which commonly followed them. In the meane time we may learne this, that if cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome be of ſo great force, that (as we ſay) it ouercommeth nature, it is chiefly to be ſeene in vice and diſſolutenes, which is a gulfe wherein a man may very eaſily caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">Cuſtome in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note>headlong, but it is a very difficult matter, yea vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to withdraw himſelfe againe. And (as a wiſe Romane ſaid) moſt horrible and execrable offences through vſe and cuſtome are made ſmall faults, and are commonly practiſed. For it is the propertie of vice to be head-ſtrong and contentious, ſeeking to defend it ſelfe by reaſons, which, although they be altogither vaine and friuolous, yet of great waight in regard of the weake fleſh of man, which eaſily ſuffereth it ſelfe to be bound vnder the yoke of ſinne. Therefore we are to take good heed, that we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not our ſelues to be ſurpriſed by ſo dangerous an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, nor giue him any acceſſe or entrance into vs: I mean that he ſhould not dwell in vs (for otherwiſe we know that perfect righteouſnes is in God onely) but rather let vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe <note place="margin">How we ſhould fortifie our ſelues againſt vice.</note>all thoſe things that are contrarie to vice, accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our ſelues in ſuch ſort to maiſter our common and ſmall imperfections (which are but too abundant in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8689:50"/>
iuſteſt men) that they take no effect, howſoeuer of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they may ſeeme excuſable. By this meanes we ſhall labor euermore to make choiſe of the beſt in all indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t things: which will ſtand vs in ſtead of a ſure rampire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tyrannicall raigne of this enimie to vertue. We read of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that he accuſtomed himſelfe to abſtain from crueltie and iniuſtice euen towards brute beaſts, by <note place="margin">The humanitie of Pythagoras euen towards brute beaſts.</note>requeſting fowlers, after they had taken birds to let them flie againe. And when he came amongſt fiſher-men he bought their draughts, and after cauſed all the fiſh to be caſt againe into the ſea. Moreouer, he forbad all his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to kill a tame beaſt at any time. After his example let vs abſtaine from all things that may procure vice, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuffer ſuch ſpeeches as theſe to paſſe from vs: <hi>What good will this do if that be wanting? Now I will deale in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, another time I will do better.</hi> Oh how ſlipperie are ſuch waies, how eaſily doth vice glide away like a ſtreame vnder <note place="margin">An excellent compariſon tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs not to ſuffer any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull thing.</note>ſuch pretences? For as a wedge maketh but a ſmal cleft in the beginning, yet afterward the rift being greater ſunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth al in peeces: ſo the ſufferance of vnlawful things how ſmall ſoeuer it be, leadeth men by little &amp; little to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable licentiouſnes. Moreouer, who can aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of tomorrow, yea of a quarter of an hower? The ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Apollo</hi> anſwered thoſe of Cyrrha, that if they would liue in peace among themſelues, they ſhould make conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall war with their neighbors ſtrangers. So, that we may paſſe the courſe of our ſhort daies in peace, reſt and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie of ſpirit, and that we fall not into the cruell paw of this aduerſarie to all goodnes, we muſt daily fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">We muſt neuer harken to the heralds of vice.</note>him, and neuer giue eare to his heralds and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of peace, which are pleaſures, neglect of dutie, and ſuch other baits, which he preſenteth to vs, to deceiue and beguile vs withal. It is moſt certaine, that vice putteth <note place="margin">How vice decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth men.</note>on a viſard, and goeth diſguiſed and couered with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewes that belong onely to vertue, and chalengeth falſely vnto it ſelfe thoſe goods, which indeed and truth man ought to deſire. And being thus clothed, with the helpe of corruptible pleaſures that lightly paſſe away, it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8689:50"/>
yoketh baſe minded men, whoſe care is onely ſet vpon the deſire of earthly things, which it ſetteth before their eies as their felicitie, impudently imputing to vertue all thoſe euils that are in it ſelfe. But they that haue ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in philoſophy through the knowledge of that which is good, and of ſuch things as are truly faire and beautiful, neuer harken to ſuch hurtfull allurements, but rather do <note place="margin">The prudence of the ſerpent.</note>as the ſerpent doth, that ſtoppeth hir eares with hir taile, to the end ſhe may not heare the charmes and ſorceries of the inchanter. But if through the neglect of all good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, we giue place amongſt vs neuer ſo little to the baits of vice, they may eaſily in the end (as thornes and thiſtles growing neere to good ſeed, do oftentimes choke it) darken all that good inſtinct of nature that ſhall be in vs. <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynike, walking one day through that <note place="margin">Why Diogenes asked his almes of images.</note>ſtreet in Athens, wherein there were many images of ſuch ancient men, as had beſt deſerued of the Common-welth, asked his almes of them all one after another. Whereat ſome maruelling and demanding of him the cauſe why: I learne (quoth he to them) to take deniall patiently: euen ſo when we can ſo far command our ſelues, as to ſhun all vaine &amp; vnprofitable buſines, wherin this age delighteth, and which ſerue but for allurements and baits to nicenes and pleaſures, let vs not be aſhamed not to follow them, but rather let vs ſay, that we learne to contemne that which is contemptible, and to make choice (according to that ancient precept of <hi>Pythagoras)</hi> of the beſt kind of life that is, to the end, that cuſtome may by little and little make it eaſie and pleaſant vnto vs. To conclude therefore our preſent matter, we ſay that vice, being inſeparably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a thouſand miſeries, and with vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and exceeding miſchiefs, which draw man into vtter ruine and eternall perdition, may be truly called the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euill of the ſoule, as that which of it ſelfe is able and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make him vnhappy, who receineth it for a gheſt. And as ſuch a hurtfull thing, we ought to hate and to flie from it, by the meanes of vertue that is contrarie vnto it, labouring by all meanes to haue our ſoules pure and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8689:51"/>
cleane from all wicked deeds, wils, and counſels, and our maners vndefiled, not being troubled or infected with any euill perturbation, wherewith vice alwaies aboundeth and is rich.</p>

                  <p>Whatſoeuer is profitable, not onely for a houſe and familie, for a citie and nation, but generally for all mankinde, may well be accounted deere, precious and woonderful, &amp; as ſo excellent a thing ought to be bought with all that a man hath: eſpecially if it be the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all happines and felicitie, and the efficient cauſe of prudence, which is an excellent guide for mens actions to make them woorthy of an immortality. What can one deſire more than profite, pleaſure and honor, which are thoſe things wherewith all men are commonly led? The treaſure of Arabia and India may well bring ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to man, but yet alwaies vnperfect: ſeeing all riches is of it ſelfe blind, &amp; bringeth no light to the ſoule, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth hir brightnes from the ſoule when it is framed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8689:52"/>
according to vertue. Great and proud armies may by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table victories procure to themſelues renowm and glory, but blame woorthy: a title of honor, but forced and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, if their enterpriſes are not grounded vpon equitie &amp; iuſtice. The marchant ſailing on large and terrible ſeas, may reape profite by his trafficke, but bought with the perill of his life, and hazard of his certaine patrimonie. Neither can this be done, except he haue firſt laide a good ground of his voiage vpon a ſure diſcourſe of reaſon, and vpon the direction of a good and wiſe pilot. Now of all theſe things, thus poore of themſelues, and begging all their ornaments elſe where, what certain ioy, true honor, or great profite may a man chalenge to himſelfe and not rather looke for a ſodaine change of them into a woorſe eſtate than they were in before, through the inconſtancie and vncertaintie of mans nature? Where then ſhall we ſeeke for theſe great and rare properties, to finde that which of it ſelfe will be vnto vs profitable, pleaſant, and <note place="margin">The benefits which come by knowledge.</note>honorable altogither, and that not for an inſtant, but for euer? Truely in ſcience or knowledge, which firſt is able to mollifie mans nature, being before ſauage and wilde, and to make it capable of reaſon: ſecondly, frameth and ſetleth his iudgement, that he may paſſe the courſe of his daies in al tranquillitie of minde to the profite of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: laſtly, cauſeth him to die in honor, with certaine aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of eternall life and happines. It is knowledge that maketh man prudent, (for doctrine bringeth foorth pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) <note place="margin">The proper worke of the ſpirit of man.</note>and worketh vnſpeakable pleaſure in his ſoule. For the ſearching out of the truth is the proper worke and perfection of the ſpirite, neither doth any delight come neere to that which a man taketh in learning. It is ſcience which guideth mens iudgements, whereby their chiefeſt deliberations and counſailes are executed, aſwell in feats of war, as in the eſtabliſhment and preſeruation of lawes, kingdoms, monarchies, commonwealths, cities and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: likewiſe in the regiment and gouernment of all worldlie affaires, either generall or particular, which are well or ill guided, according as he that manageth or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth

illuſion of ſome dreame; in reſpect of a true, certaine and permanent life. Surely theſe philoſophicall ſpeculations are not vaine and friuolous, but very neceſſarie to lead vs to that happie end of our being, which we ſeeke for. For if we be well inſtructed concerning the great and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place and condition, which the ſoule enioieth aboue the bodie, as well in hir immortall generation, as in hir contemplation and action, as alſo that of hir happines dependeth (as before we handled it) the felicitie of the whole frame of man, will we not apply all our principall care, ſtudie and diligence in prouiding ſuch things for hir as ſhe deſireth, and which are meet and healthfull for hir? But we haue further (thanks be giuen to the author of all good) a ſecond &amp; more perfect vnderſtanding of the ſoul, than had all theſe notable heathen men, both in reſpect of the bleſſed immortalitie and alſo of the cauſe thereof. We know alſo that ſo long as ſhe is detained in this mortall priſon of the bodie, &amp; that we are become new creatures <note place="margin">The ſoule is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into the ſpirit and the fleſh.</note>by the grace of God, ſhe is diuided into theſe two partes, the ſpirit and the fleſh, betweene which there is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual combat. Yea the fleſh continually offereth to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit a thouſand temptations, to delight it withall. For the bodie and fleſh conſiſting of mortall and corruptible matter, are but a lumpe of ſinne, and full of wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <note place="margin">The ſpirit of the godlie both by creation and regeneration is enimie to vice.</note>whereas the ſpirit of it ſelfe vertuous and good, and of an immortall eſſence, is of it owne nature enimie to vice and iniquitie: ſo that being ruled and guided by the ſpirite of God, it loueth and deſireth eternall happines, and reioiceth in iuſtice, puritie and holines. And yet the ſoule is not ſo freed from the ſlauerie of ſinne, but that there remaineth in hir many ſteps of the earthly man, ſo that ſhe alwaies carieth about with hir the relickes of the <note place="margin">The fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the fleſh.</note>fleſh, whereby hir libertie is ſo much diminiſhed. This is that fight whereof the true children of God haue dailie experience, when they are lifted vpward by the ſpirit, and by the fleſh turned downeward: by the ſpirit they bend with an ardent deſire towards immortalitie, by the fleſh they are caried aſtray into the way of death: by the ſpirit
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8689:58"/>
they thinke to liue iuſtly, by the fleſh they are ſtirred fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to iniquitie: by the ſpirit they contemne the world, by the fleſh they deſire wordly delights. But in the ende the grace of God cauſeth the ſpirit to remaine ſuperiour, <note place="margin">Rom. 8 7.</note>ſo that his children walke not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit. Whereas if we be left of God to <note place="margin">What we are being left to our ſelves.</note>our owne corrupt and peruerſe nature, we haue not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtrength to reſiſt the temptations of this wicked fleſh, but in ſteade of commanding it, we obey it with ſhame and confuſion. And then accuſtoming our ſelues to ſinne, and to conſent to the deſires of the fleſh, the diuine part of the ſoule is ſo weakened, that ſhe hath no more ſtrength or feeling of hir eſſence, which is enimie to vice, but hauing forſaken God, he forſaketh hir, and giueth hir ouer into the power of carnal deſires. So that by this long dwelling in ſinne, being as it were altogither dead, ſhe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no more counſaile of reaſon, but followeth after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable vices, and ſuch as are againſt nature. But on the contrarie ſide being guided by the grace of God, after we haue laboured by faſting, watching and praier, to reſiſt the vnpure deſires of the fleſh, al the concupiſcences ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wil at length be ſo tamed and forced, that the ſoule ſhal execute hir office in commanding ouer them abſolutely, and in choaking them ſo ſoone as they ſhall ſpring vp. Therefore it commeth from the ſpirit, that we aſpire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to our laſt and ſoueraign good, that with a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler deſire of hart, and with all our affection we ſtudie to ſeeke and finde it out, euen with teares and ſighes, by reaſon of thoſe continuall impediments, which the fleſh laieth before vs in following our courſe. Moreouer the ſpirit cauſeth vs to imploy all our might in the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule from the bodie, and in diſpiſing pleaſure, ambition, vainglorie and riches, that we may offer an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable preſent, by yeelding vnto him the ſoul, which he hath giuen vs. Which thing cannot be done (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> but by keeping it, as much as may be, purged &amp; cleanſed from earthly ſpots, that ſhe may be knowne and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged aboue amongſt hir companions, conſidering that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8689:59"/>
no defiled thing ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen. In this diſcourſe of the ſoule and of the ſpirit thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled, I thinke we may here ſet downe ſome ſpecial dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, although vndoubtedly the one is taken indifferently for the other, without any abſurditie,<note place="margin">The difference betweene the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and the ſpirit.</note> yea they are one and the ſame thing. The difference may be made in this ſort, if we ſay, that the ſoule is common to all things that haue life, as we vſe to ſay, that all beaſts are animated, and haue ſenſitiue ſoules: but that the ſpirite, which is immortall, and capable of reaſon &amp; knowledge, is proper and peculiar to man onely. And it ſeemeth that <hi>Sophocles</hi> would teach vs this diſtinction, when he ſaith, that <hi>The ſpirit is the ſame thing to the ſoule, which the eie is to the bodie. Socrates</hi> alſo putting a difference betweene the ſoule and the ſpirit, ſaide, that as eucrie ſeditious man is to be baniſhed out of a well gouerned citie, ſo a ſpirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to all miſchiefe is to be remooued from that ſoule, which we would ſaue. Or elſe we may ſay otherwiſe (not diuiding any thing) that the ſpirit is the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall<note place="margin">The three parts of the ſpirit.</note> part of the ſoule, wherein the <hi>Minde, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the memorie are contained,</hi> which are moſt neceſſary for the direction of all good and vertuous actions, and which ſtand in need of preſeruation, nouriſhing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and therfore they are ſaid, (not without reaſon) to increaſe &amp; decreaſe in the minde of man. The minde is as a white paper, wherein as a man groweth in age &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he writeth his cogitations and thoughts, which the ſtudie of letters and learning do affoord him. Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is framed by the knowledge of reaſon, and laſtly<note place="margin">Of Memorie.</note> memorie followeth &amp; preſerueth it, being the mother of the muſes, and the treaſorie of knowledge. <hi>Plutark</hi> calleth it the hearing of deafe things, and the ſight of the blinde. There is nothing, that ſerueth ſo much to beget and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue learning and knowledge, as memorie doth, whereof we haue many examples among the ancients. We reade<note place="margin">Mithridates.</note> of <hi>Mithridates</hi> king of Pontus, who was a great enimie to the Romaines, that he had vnder his dominion two &amp; twentie nations, ſpeaking diuers languages, all which he

learned and anſwered their ambaſſadours in their owne toongs. Which thing he could neuer haue comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without an excellent and happy memorie, which alſo was the cauſe, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> knew perſonally and could name all his countrimen, by their proper names. The emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the 11. ſpake the Greeke, Latin, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,<note place="margin">Frederick.</note> Arabian, Morisko, Almaigne, Italian and French toong.

                     <note place="margin">Genuſbey.</note> named <hi>Genuſbey,</hi> borne in Corfou, endued with the richeſt memorie that euer was.

Whereby we ſee that he was endued with an excellent and quicke ſpirite, apt to conceiue, and with a firme memorie, able to retaine them altogither: and this may be ſeene in many. But the<note place="margin">From whence iudgement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth.</note> perfection of theſe two great gifts of nature, is a good &amp; ſound iudgement, proceeding from pondering, and from a firme diſcourſe of reaſon lightned by the ſpirit of God, and by the ſame ſpirit purged from error, illuſion, and all vaine opinion, which are vſuall in man, and hinder him from iudging aright of the truth. But to continue our ſpeech of the woonderfull effects of memorie ſo much eſteemed of <hi>Plato,</hi> that he writeth, that we ſhuld leaue of to be men, &amp; become like to the gods, if our memory could retaine and keepe ſo much as the eies can read and ſee. We muſt not here forget to make mention of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iulius Caeſar.</note> that great monarke, of whom Hiſtoriographers report, that at one time he cauſed his Secretaries to write vnto foure ſeuerall perſons of ſundry matters, and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes he would indight a letter to one of his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, read in a booke, and heare another ſpeake all at one time. <hi>Seneca</hi> rehearſed two thouſand ſundry names, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> onely heard them pronounced before, beginning at the laſt and continuing to the firſt.

Nowe bicauſe one of you (my companions) touched this, that they which haue a ready and quick wit, commonly want memorie, &amp; that they which hardly learne, retaine and keepe better that which they haue learned, I will giue you this reaſon with <hi>Plutark,</hi> that hardnes of belecfe ſeemeth to be the cauſe<note place="margin">Reaſons why quick eſt wits haue woor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>wiſe</note> why men comprehend ſlowly. For it is very euident, that to learne, is to receiue ſome impreſſion: whereupon it followeth, that they which reſiſt leaſt, are ſuch as ſooneſt beleeue. And therefore youth is eaſier to be perſwaded than old folks, ſick than ſound, women than men: and generally the weaker that thing is, which diſcourſeth and doubteth, the eaſier may a man put and adde vnto it, what he will, as likewiſe the ſelfe ſame thing is ſooner loſt and let ſlip away. Some others (as <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> ſaith) haue rendred this reaſon of the quicknes or ſlownes of mans wit, ſaying, that it commeth of the good or immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate mixture &amp; temperature of the elements, of which our bodies are compounded and framed, and of the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie and proportion of the organicall or iuſtrumentall parts ioyned togither in him. And ſurely theſe ſeeme to giue the true reaſon therof. For we ſee many, who in their beginning and firſt age ſhew that they haue a prompt and ſharp wit, but when they come to old age are changed, &amp; become ſlow and dul to conceiue. Which is a great token and argument that a good or bad complexion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the body, is the cauſe of ſuch a diſpoſition, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in quicknes or ſlownes of ſpirit, as the difference of yeeres doth affoord them. Beſides, doe we not perceiue, that they which haue the head ouergreat and ill fanored, whom we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly call great blockheads, (bicauſe there
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8689:60"/>
is not an equall ſymmetry and moderate proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that and the other parts of the bodie) are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnapt to conceiue, and to bring foorth any ſenſible and wittie thing? But the reſolution of al this ſpeech ſhall be, that all gifts of the ſpirit are from aboue, &amp; that amongſt<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> all ſorts of men, there are ſome found, that are prompt &amp; wittie to comprehend great and diuine things, by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace and fauour, which God hath beſtowed vpon them. Some by the gift of the holie Ghoſt haue wiſedom, others knowledge and vnderſtanding of things, and all giuen to euerie one for the profiting both of himſelfe and of his neighbor. Knowing therefore by this preſent diſcourſe, according to the weakenes of our iudgement, the creation and nature of the ſpirit, which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and moſt noble part of vs, and that whereof depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and proceedeth all our happines, reſt and felicitie, let vs be carefull and diligent to ſearch it out, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide ſuch things as it deſireth of vs, as helps to that effect, beſtowing all our care, labour and ſtudie, to adorne and deck it with righteouſnes and holines, according to the holie deſire therof, wherin conſiſteth life and peace. And let vs beware that we ſeeke not to feede it with ſtrange meats, which may make it ſorrowfull, and with which our fleſh aboundeth to hir death and deſtruction. But morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> all the deadly deſires and affections thereof, let vs labour not to walke any more according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit, and let vs know that all weariſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and tediouſnes which troubleth the tranquillitie and reſt thereof, proceedcth from the want of experience in affaires, from the want of good diſcourſing, grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a reſolute and ſetled iudgement, and from the want of skill fitly to apply our ſelues to preſent occaſions. And this is that which troubleth all ſorts and conditions of life, as well rich as poore. But the way to preſerue the ſpirite in reſt and quietnes, is to nouriſh and exerciſe it in the ſtudie of wiſedome, where it learneth reaſon, which of it ſelfe can cure it of all ſorrow, anguiſh and greefe through wiſe diſcourſing, and worke in it a like inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

For all which things he asketh nothing of vs but loue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, teſtified by honor, reuerence, and ſeruice according to his holie ordinance, euery one after the meaſure of gifts and graces, which he hath from aboue: knowing that more is to be required of him to whom more is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <note place="margin">Obedience to Gods law is the mother of all vertues.</note>This obedience being grounded vpon that rule of perfect righteouſnes, which is giuen vnto vs in the law of God, is the mother and preſeruer of all vertues, yea the <note place="margin">What our dutie towards our neighbour is.</note>beginning and roote of al goodnes. The other part of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which reſpecteth our neighbor, and whereof we are chiefly to intreat in this our Academie, is nothing but charity &amp; loue of our like, as of our ſelues, which is greatly recommended vnto vs in the ſcripture, as being very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit vnto ſalúation. This is that dutie, whereby we are bound not to do any thing againſt publike lawes, equitie, and profit, but to be alwaies conſtant in the perfect exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and vſe of vertue, by doing honeſt and ſeemely things for their owne ſakes, and not of neceſſitie and conſtraint.

We are not onely borne (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> for our ſelues, but our countrie, parents, and friends both will and ought to reape ſome commoditie by our birth. For whatſoeuer is vpon earth was created for men, and they for themſelues, <note place="margin">Man created for man.</note>that one might aide and helpe another. So that if we will follow nature, we muſt imploy our goods, trauell, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, and whatſoeuer elſe is in our power, in the behalfe of common commoditie, and in the preſeruation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſocietie: yea, that man liueth moſt happily, who, as little as may be, liueth to himſelfe. And on the other ſide, no man liueth more diſorderedly, than he that liueth to himſelfe, and thinketh on nothing but his owne profit. This is that dutie, which requireth that for the ſafetie of our parents, friends and countrie, we ſhould offer our ſelues to all perils, not reſpecting our owne profit or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. Neither ought we to eſteeme any thing iuſt and <note place="margin">Profit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

So that if any man be perſwaded, that the rule of honeſtie and profit is not one and the ſame, he will neuer be without fraud or wickednes. For thinking thus with himſelfe, this indeed is honeſt, but that is profitable for me, he will not feare to breake and rent a ſunder all equitie ordained and appointed either by diuine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes. And this diuiſion is the fountaine of all vice, falſhood, and miſchiefe. A good man (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> may not ſlander, ſteale, or lie for his owne commoditie. Is there any thing then in this world of ſo great value, any treaſure ſo pretious, that ought to cauſe vs to looſe the name of vertuous and iuſt? We ought rather to turne profit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards honeſtie, and that in ſuch ſort, that howſoeuer the words ſeeme to differ one from another, yet we ſhould make them but one thing. Moreouer, the ſame diuine phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaith, that the true beautie of the ſoule, which is honeſtie, is nothing elſe but the brightnes of that perfect and chiefe good that appeereth in thoſe things, which may be knowen by the eies, eares, and mind, whereby it is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8689:63"/>
cauſed to returne towards the Idea and paterne of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Wherby this excellent man meaneth no other thing, than to giue vs to vnderſtand, that whatſoeuer goodnes and honeſtie is in vs, commeth from God, as from the fountaine thereof, vnto which by the ſame vertue it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth, leading the ſoule with it to liue eternally. Beſides, from him and by him commeth the beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of our good works: yea it is he that maketh vs to go forward according to true dutie, which conſiſteth in <note place="margin">Two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in euerie good worke.</note>theſe two points: firſt, that the intention and end of our actions be rightly framed: ſecondly, that the like meanes to attaine to that end be found out. For theſe two things may agree or diſagree one from another, as we ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the end well propounded, and yet men erre in the meanes to attaine vnto it: and contrariwiſe, it falleth out oftentimes, that the meanes are good, and the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, bad. So that it is from this liuely and euer-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountaine, which is the cauſe of al good, from whence we are to looke for the perfect knowledge of our dutie, and the ends and meanes whereby to execute it, to the glorie of God, and to the good and profit of our like. And from this generall vertue, and fountaine of honeſtie and <note place="margin">Fower riuers iſſue out of the fountaine of dutie.</note>dutie, fower riuers iſſue and ſpring, called morall vertues: namely, <hi>Prudence,</hi> which is as a guide to the reſt, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is profitable for it ſelfe, for others, and for the common-wealth: <hi>Temperance,</hi> the miſtres of modeſtie, chaſtitie, ſobrietie, and vigilancie, and of all order and mediocritie in all things: <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which maketh a man conſtant, patient, couragious, hardie, and readie to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe high, great, profitable, and holie things: and <hi>Iustice,</hi> which is the bond and preſeruation of humane ſocietie, by giuing to euery one that which belongeth vnto him, by keeping faith in things promiſed, by ſuccoring gladly the afflicted, and by helping euery one according as abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſerueth. Which vertues are the true and certain goods of the ſoule, whereby all actions are directed according to dutie, as we ſhall ſpeake particularly thereof heerafter. In the meane while let vs enter into the examples of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8689:63"/>
and ſee how exactly and inuiolably they obſerued all points of dutie, chooſing rather to ſacrifice their liues, than to infringe, and breake any of them, much more contemning all other weaker occaſions, wherwith lewd and baſe-minded people ſuffer themſelues to be eaſily corrupted. And firſt, touching the firſt point of dutie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally <note place="margin">Examples of the zeale of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of there god.</note>imprinted in the ſoules of the greateſt infidels, which is to acknowledge ſome diuinitie, with what zeale (although inconſiderate and raſh) did the ancient hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and pagans preciſely obſerue their paganiſme, euen to the ſacrificing and cheerfull offering vp of their owne children to their gods, as we read of the Carthaginians? What ſay I, their children? yea oftentimes themſelues, whereof <hi>Calanus</hi> an Indian Gymnoſophiſt ſerueth for a <note place="margin">Calanus.</note>witnes, who ſeeing himſelfe old, after he had offered ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the gods, bad <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great farewell, with whom he came to Babylon, and tooke his leaue alſo of all his other friends. Then lying along (according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of his countrie) vpon a little pile of wood, which he had prepared for that purpoſe, he cauſed fire to be put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and ſo burned himſelfe for a burnt-offering to his gods, not ſtirring at all, but continuing with ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull conſtancie, that <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was preſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelfe to be vanquiſhed of him in greatnes of hart, and magnanimitie of courage. Who will not admire the ſtrict obſeruation of the ancient religion of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Graecians, and Romans, mooued with a deſire of yeelding the dutie of their being to the honor of a diuine nature? But for ſhortnes ſake, and not to wander farre from the ſubiect of our aſſemblie, I paſſe it ouer with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Heere I will onely alledge one notable example of the Iewes, who were more zealous profeſſors of their law, <note place="margin">The zeale of the Iewes to their law.</note>than euer were any people. <hi>Caius</hi> a Romane emperor, ſent <hi>Petronius</hi> into Syria with commandement to make war with the Iewes, if they would not receiue his image into their temple. Which when they refuſed to do, <hi>Petronius</hi> ſaid vnto them, that then belike they would fight againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not weighing his wealth, or their owne weakenes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8689:64"/>
and vnabilitie. We will not fight (quoth they) but had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die than turne from the lawes of our God. And foorthwith caſting themſelues on the ground, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their throtes, they ſaid, that they were readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the blow. In this eſtate (as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> reporteth it) they remained for the ſpace of fortie daies, letting ſlip the time which then was, of ſowing their grounds. Which cauſed <hi>Petronius</hi> to defer the execution of his charge, and to ſend the declaration of theſe things vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe death rid <note place="margin">Of the loue which a man oweth to his countrie.</note>the Iewes out of danger. Now we are to conſider with what burning affection the ancients imbraced common benefit and ſafetie, ſeeking to profit all men, according to the true dutie of a good man, but eſpecially their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in whoſe ſeruice they thought it great happines to loſe their liues. For truly beſides the ſweet affection, which nature hath imprinted in our harts towards our countrie, and the conformitie of humors, which commonly is found in our bodies with that heauenly aire wher we haue our firſt breathing, which ſeemeth to be a mutual and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall obligation, the reaſon of all humane right, and the religion of diuine equitie, beſides the dutie of conſcience, bind all perſons to ſerue the publike wealth of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, to the vttermoſt of their power: and that ſo much the rather, bicauſe that vnder it, the life, honor, and goods of euery particular man are comprehended. This reaſon <note place="margin">Cato of Vtica.</note>cauſed <hi>Cato</hi> of Vtica, a Conſul and noble Romane, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one of his friends, who was come to giue him thanks for defending him in iudgement from a falſe accuſation, that he was to thanke the Common-wealth, for whoſe loue onely he did, ſpake, and counſelled all things. This alſo made him to vndertake the ſute for the office of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buneſhip of the people, that he might reſiſt the faction of <note place="margin">In what caſe a good man may ſue for an office.</note>
                     <hi>Pompey,</hi> by whom he ſaw <hi>Metellus</hi> ſet on worke to ſue and ſeeke for the ſame office, for the aſſurance of his affaires and ſtrengthening of his league. Now is the time (quoth <hi>Cato</hi> to his friends) wherein I muſt imploy and beſtow the power of ſuch an office, and of ſo great authoritie, as a ſtrong medicine, in time conuenient, and vpon neceſſarie
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8689:64"/>
cauſes, and either ouercome, or die honorably in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of common libertie. So likewiſe he oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as much as he could, againſt all nouelties and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affaires betweene <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey.</hi> And when the ſelfeſame <hi>Pompey,</hi> being deſirous to win him to himſelfe, ſought to bring it to paſſe by alliance, and thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded two of his neeces in marriage, one for himſelfe, and the other for his ſonne: <hi>Cato,</hi> without any longer deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, anſwered him preſently (as being netled) that caried backe the meſſage, that he ſhould returne to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and tell him, that <hi>Cato</hi> was not to be taken by the meanes of women. Which was not bicauſe he would not haue him eſteem greatly of his friendſhip, which he ſhould alwaies find in him to be more ſure and certaine than any alliance by marriage, ſo that he onely ſought after and did things honeſt and iuſt, but at this time he would not giue hoſtages at <hi>Pompeies</hi> pleaſure againſt the Common-welth. Afterward the affaires of Rome being brought to ſuch neceſſitie through corruption of monie, and by vnlawfull and forceable meanes in procuring publike places of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, many Senators being of opinion, that <hi>Pompey</hi> was to be choſen ſole and onely Conſul, <hi>Cato</hi> alſo was of the ſame mind, ſaying, that men ought to chooſe a leſſe euill to meete with and to redreſſe greater miſchiefs: and that it were better willingly to bring in a kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, than to defer it ſo long, vntill the iſſue of preſent ſeditions ſhould by force and conſtraint eſtabliſh one. And it may be (quoth he) that <hi>Pompey</hi> will haue a longing deſire to preſerue the Common-wealth, when he ſhall ſee, that it is ſo liberally and freely committed to his fidelitie. This election being approoued and ratified, <hi>Pompey</hi> ſent to ſeeke <hi>Cato,</hi> and hauing hartily thanked him for that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which he had done him, requeſted him to be a daily aſſiſtant and Councellor vnto him in his office. To whom this graue man made anſwere, that he did neuer oppoſe himſelfe heeretofore againſt him for any ill will he bare him, neither gaue this laſt counſell for any good he meant towards him, but all for the good and profit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8689:65"/>
And as touching his priuate and particular affaires, he ſaid, he would giue him the beſt counſell he could, whenſoeuer he asked his aduiſe: but for publike matters, he would alwaies ſpeake what he thought were beſt, although he neuer asked him any thing. Thus did <hi>Cato</hi> behaue himſelfe al his life time as a good citizen, and as an vpright and iuſt man, free in ſpeaking for the truth, and altogither void of corruption. <hi>Metellus</hi> a Senator of Rome left vs a notable teſtimonie, that he eſteemed of <hi>Dutie,</hi> as of a ſacred and inuiolable thing, when he would not ſweare to the people to obſerue and keepe that, which was to be ordained and eſtabliſhed concerning a law put vp by one of the Tribunes againſt all right and equitie, notwithſtanding that the Conſul with the reſt of the Senators through conſtraint and feare, which they had of the people, had ſworne vnto it, and giuen their <note place="margin">Metellus.</note>promiſe. Then <hi>Metellus</hi> departing from the aſſemblie, ſaid, that it was too eaſie a matter to do ill, as alſo a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing to do well where no danger is, but to do well when perill is certaine and ſure, that was the proper dutie of an honorable and vertuous man. For this cauſe being baniſhed, and making light account of the matter, he vſed theſe or the like ſpeeches: When things ſhall be amended, the people repenting them of their error, will cal me back againe: but if the affaires continue ſtill in the ſame ſtate, wherein they now are, it will be beſt for a man to keepe <note place="margin">Lycurgus.</note>himſelfe a farre of. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> after his lawes were giuen to the Lacedemonians fained that he had ſome thing elſe whereof to take counſell with <hi>Apollo</hi> concerning their eſtate, and therefore at his departure from Lacedaemon to go to Delphos, he cauſed his citizens to ſweare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that they would keepe his lawes inuiolably vntill his returne, either dead or aliue. This done he went to the ile of Candie, where he remained in perpetuall and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie baniſhment, and commanded that after his death, the aſhes of his bodie, being burnt ſhould be caſt into the wind, that by this meanes the Lacedaemonians might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be abſolued of their oth, but that his countrie might
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8689:65"/>
alwaies receiue the fruit of his labors, for deſire whereof he had freely forſaken it altogither. <hi>Marcus Otho</hi> the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <note place="margin">Marcus Otho.</note>hath left behind him a more woonderfull example of the great loue he bare towards his countrie, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit whereof he died willingly. For after he had loſt a battell againſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itellius</hi> and <hi>Cecinna,</hi> fighting for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he was ſolicited by the reſt of his armie, which was yet of great ſtrength, to trie fortune once againe, and to vſe them and their perſons as long as they had one drop of blood, and life in their bodies. And at the ſame time a ſimple ſoldier, hauing his ſword in his hand, ſpake thus vnto him: Know, O <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that all my companions are <note place="margin">The couragious mind of a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</note>determined to die thus for thy ſake, and therewithall he ſlue himſelfe before him. Then <hi>Otho</hi> caſting his eies all about, ſpake vnto them in this ſort: I account this day more happie to me (Companions) than that other where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye did chooſe and pronounce me your emperor, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you ſo wel affected in my behalfe, and receiuing ſuch honor from you with ſo great a demonſtration of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And if I haue been worthie to hold the empire of Rome by your election, I muſt now ſhew it, in not ſparing my life for the good and ſafetie of my countrie. I knowe well that the victorie is not yet wholie mine enimies: and I haue receiued newes of ſuch and ſuch forces (which he named particularly vnto them) that are readie to ioine with vs. The Senate is on our ſide, and the wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our enimies are in our hands. But what? This war <note place="margin">A notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample againſt ciuill war.</note>is not againſt a <hi>Hannibal,</hi> or a <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> or againſt the Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians, that we ſhould fight for the poſſeſſion of Italie, but it is againſt the Romans themſelues: ſo that in this warre both the conqueror and conquered ſhall offend and hurt their countrie, bicauſe, whatſoeuer ſerueth for the benefit of him that ouercommeth, turneth to the dammage of the Common-wealth. Beleeue me, I know better how to die than to raigne, eſpecially conſidering that I ſhall not ſo much profit the Romans, although in the end I ſhould remaine the ſtronger, as now I can by ſacrificing my life for the peace, vnion, and concord of my countrimen. This
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8689:66"/>
done, he tooke order for the Senators and others of his armie to retire and ſaue themſelues: and ſaid to a nephew of his whom he had adopted, I command thee my ſonne, as the laſt admonition which I can giue thee, not to forget altogither, nor yet to print it too much in thy memorie, that thou haſt had an vnkle, who was emperor. Then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him downe to reſt, the next morning very early he tooke his ſword, and turning the point thereof with both his hands againſt his ſtomacke, he fell vpon the top of it, without ſhewing any other token or feeling of griefe, and ſo died, being onely ſeuen and thirtie yeeres of age. <hi>Codrus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Codrus.</note>king of Athens did no leſſe for his countrie. For hauing vnderſtood, that the Oracle had promiſed and aſſured the victorie to the Thracians, who were enimies to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, if they ſaued their king aliue, he went into their campe diſguiſed like a handicrafts man, and ſlue one of their men, whereupon he was preſently ſlaine of others, not being knowen what he was. And thus were the Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians depriued of the hope of victorie, which before they accounted certaine, and in a maner gotten of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <note place="margin">M.

                     <hi>Marcus Curtius</hi> a knight of Rome, who being Conſul wan a notable battell againſt the Cymbrians, threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe headlong into a deepe gulfe, which was made in the midſt of Rome by an earthquake, and which had greatly dammaged the citie. The reaſon moouing him ſo to do was, bicauſe the Soothſaiers had giuen out, that the gods would not be pacified and appeaſed towards the citie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gulfe had ſwalowed a man on liue. <hi>Curtius</hi> being deſirous to procure the benefit and eaſe of the Common-wealth, would ſerue himſelfe for this ſacrifice. And ſo it came to paſſe: for preſently this gulfe cloſed vp to the great aſtoniſhment of all the people. How ſhal we thinke that theſe, and ſo many others, as hiſtories ſet before our eies, who haue freely offered their liues for the ſafetie of many, and choſe rather to vndertake any danger, than to turne aſide in any thing from that which they knew to be the dutie of a good man, how (I ſay) ſhall we thinke that they would haue fainted or yeelded through the entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  <p>O how learnedly hath <hi>Socrates</hi> taught vs to know and marke this true and heauenly Prudence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the loue and feare of the higheſt, from that earthlie Prudence, which is full of darknes, when he ſaith, <note place="margin">What prunence is.</note>that <hi>Prudence is the generall vertue, the princeſſe and guide of morall vertues, and that wherein the knowledge of our ſouereigne good, and of the end of our being conſisteth,</hi> as alſo the choice of thoſe waies wherby we may come vnto it.

                  <p>All the life of men expreſſing a worthie end of their being, conſiſteth in contemplation and action. For knowing that the thoughts of all mortall men are vnſtable, and their inuentions vncertaine, bicauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and the affections thereof oppreſſe the ſoule, and caſt downe the ſpirit loden with care, they lift vp their harts towards the brightnes of the eternall light, who of his meere grace prepareth their ſoules, lighteneth their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and directeth their paths to the knowledge of that true and perfect Idea of Good, from whence Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence floweth, that ſhe may gouerne their actions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will, and to the profit of humane ſocietie. <note place="margin">The effects of the vertue of prudence.</note>Therefore it is from knowledge and reaſon gotten in the ſtudie of wiſedome by the grace of God, from whence the vertue of Prudence proceedeth, which is that rule of all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8689:67"/>
the actions of man, whereby through good and ſage ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice he diſcerneth and chooſeth good from bad, that which is profitable from the contrarie, to the end he may ſhun the one and practiſe the other. This is that which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> ſaith, that the office of Prudence conſiſteth in skill to conſult and to chooſe, to the end to execute that which vertue commandeth, namely, Honeſtie and decencie, and that for no other reſpect than for the loue thereof. And <note place="margin">The difference betweene ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and prudence.</note>therfore wiſe men haue put a difference betweene <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Science</hi> is a dead knowledge of things, which of it ſelfe cannot change the will in ſuch ſort, that it may imbrace and follow the knowen good, or auoid the euill: which is euident in wicked men endued with knowledge. But Prudence is a beame proceeding from that true ſunne, which doth not only illuminate and lighten the vnderſtanding, but alſo warmeth and kindleth the affection. This vertue (ſaith <hi>Bias</hi> one of the Sages of <note place="margin">Prudence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the ſight.</note>Graecia) is amongſt the reſt of the vertues, as the ſight is amongſt the fiue ſenſes of mans bodie: thereby giuing vs to vnderſtand, that as the eie, of al the other ſenſes is moſt beautifull, ſubtill, and pearcing, ſo the vertue of Prudence by hir quicke and cleere light directeth and conducteth al vertues in their good and commendable operations. It is by hir that man is alwaies clothed with a milde and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led diſpoſition, whereof he ſtandeth no leſſe in need, than a ſhip floating on the ſea doth of the preſence of a pilot, that he may prudently vndertake, &amp; wiſely execute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he knoweth to be good, after mature deliberation, and conſideration of all the circumſtances of the fact. Morall philoſophers attributed three eies to this vertue <note place="margin">Prudence hath three eies.</note>of Prudence, namely, Memorie, Vnderſtanding, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence: which three things <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth the parts of Prudence. With the firſt ſhe beholdeth the time paſt: with the ſecond, the time preſent: with the third, the time to come. Moreouer, a prudent and wiſe man, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of things paſt: and of that which hath followed ſince, iudgeth of that, which in the like caſe may fall out in the time following. And after long deliberation, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8689:68"/>
the times, waigheth the dangers, and knoweth the occaſions: and then, yeelding now and then to the times, but alwaies to neceſſitie, ſo it be not againſt dutie, he boldly ſetteth his hand to the worke. For this cauſe <hi>Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſaid, that a prudent man ought to remember things paſt, to vſe things preſent, and to foreſee things to come. A prudent man (ſaith <hi>Demosthenes)</hi> accounteth it a point of follie to ſay when a thing is com to paſſe, <hi>Who would haue thought it could haue beene?</hi> Now Prudence is apparant in him that poſſeſſeth hir, firſt by the rule and gouernment of his perſon, whether it be in things within him, as in his maners and conditions, or in outward things concerning his bodie, as in ſobrietie of diet, comely intertainment, good houſe-keeping, commendable vſe of his ſubſtance and riches. Of which perfections and other praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie effects, that flow from Prudence vnder the name of ſundrie vertues, we are to intreat particularly heerafter, as alſo how a prudent man being adorned with them may firſt become a good Oeconomiſt, that is, a gouernor and father of a familie, and after attaine to that great vertue of politicall knowledge, which is the art of skilfull gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; ruling a multitude of men. And then although he doubt not, but that it is an act of Prudence to know what is good and profitable for the Common-wealth, yet that he may knowe howe to execute that office with a perfect and abſolute vertue, he ſeeketh for all occaſions to profit the ſame, and vnto what place of authoritie ſoeuer he be <note place="margin">The praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy effects of prudence.</note>called, he alwaies ſheweth foorth dutifull effects of a good man. He neuer giueth or taketh but good counſel, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vttereth the ſame freely. He is able (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> to diſcerne the good from the bad. He helpeth innocencie, and correcteth malice. He is not aſtoniſhed for any feare, nor altereth his mind for diſpraiſe or commendation: he is not diſcouraged through violence or falſe accuſations, neither is preſſed downe with ſorrow, or puffed vp with proſperitie. And as one not ignorant of the vncertaintie of worldly things, he abideth conſtant in all changes, and like to himſelfe, knowing how to chooſe the leſſe euill in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8689:68"/>
all inconueniences, as the better. He ſheweth himſelfe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in all things. He is maiſter of his pleaſures, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to command himſelfe. He can reape profit by moſt ſiniſter accidents, yea by his greateſt enimies, and yet hurt them not. The conuerſation of the prudent is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies healthfull and profitable. His quips, his laughters, his ſports are not without ſome fruit, hauing in them a certaine power to correct and moue thoſe that do amiſſe. He beleeueth not (ſaith <hi>Heraclitus)</hi> any thing lightly, but is a ſeuere examiner of the truth. To be ſhort, Prudence cauſeth a man to refer all his actions both priuate and publike to the beſt end, which is, to ſerue God, and to profit his neighbor. This did <hi>Socrates</hi> teach very well, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that All the deſires and inclinations of our ſoule gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by prudence tende to happines. Wherin we may note <note place="margin">The coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the vertues.</note>the indiſſoluble coniunction of all the morall vertues, of which no one can be had perfectly, but with hir compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, albeit ech of them haue hir particular &amp; proper du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But prudence is eſpecially neceſſarie in them all, as it will yet better appeere in the further handling therof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the effects hereunder mentioned of this firſt vertue being narrowly conſidered, may giue vs ſufficient proofe thereof. Now to incite and ſtir vs vp to imbrace it with greater zeale and affection, and to ſeeke after all meanes of obtaining it, either by good inſtruction, or by long vſe of things, let vs call to mind certaine examples of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, thereby to marke what woonderful fruits this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Prudence hath brought foorth in them. If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the heroicall facts of the worthieſt captaines and generals of armies that euer were, we ſhall finde that they brought them to paſſe more by prudence, than by any other force and meane. Which thing <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and firſt Monarke of the Graecians knowing very well, whenſoeuer any ſpeech or compariſon was made before him of Vertue or Science, he alwaies had this verſe of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> in his mouth: <hi>In counſell wiſe, and valiant in the fight:</hi> as if he would haue ſaid, that of all vertues Prudence was moſt prince-like, and that proweſſe was practiſed by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8689:69"/>
meanes thereof. And indeed he being richly endued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, vndertooke the conqueſt of the Perſian empire, yea of all the world, when he had but thirtie thouſand foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <note place="margin">Of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</note>and fower thouſand horſemen, with monie and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals to furniſh them onely for thirtie daies. But what? The meanes wherunto he truſted was Prudence, followed of Patience, Valure and Temperancie, wherewith the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of philoſophy had furniſhed him for his voiage. In this iourney he did not onely in two battailes ouerthrowe <hi>Darius</hi> monarke of the Perſians, who had aboue twelue hundred thouſand men, but alſo brought vnder ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fifteene ſundry nations, and tooke fiue thouſand ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and townes, and laboured to put in reall execution &amp; practiſe that forme of gouernment of eſtate, which was ſo greatly eſteemed of <hi>Zeno</hi> the Stoick philoſopher, &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in effect to this end, that all men generally might liue togither, not being diuided by townes, peoples and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor ſeparated by particuler lawes, rightes &amp; cuſtomes, but that we ſhould take all men for our countrimen and fellow citizens: that as there is but one world, ſo there might be but one kinde of life. Thus did this prudent and vertuous monarck giue out that he was ſent from heauen to be a common refourmer, gouernour, and reconcilour of the whole world, ſo that he imploied all his might to reduce and bring to ciuilitie barbarous kings, to plant Graecian cities, that they might liue ciuilly amongſt the vntamed and ſauage nations, and eſtabliſhed euery where lawes and a peaceable kinde of life, euen amongſt vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled people, who neuer heard word ſpoken either of peace or lawes. Thoſe whom he could not aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by perſwaſion of reaſon, he conſtrained by force of armes, ſo that he cauſed them all to drinke as ye would ſay, in the ſame cup of loue &amp; friendſhip, by intermingling their liues, maners, mariages and faſhions of liuing. He commanded that al men liuing ſhould account the whole habitable earth for their country, and his campe, for their caſtle and tower of defence, and that all good men ſhould be of kin one to another, and the wicked onely ſtrangers.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8689:69"/>
Moreouer, he willed, that the Graecian and Barbarian ſhould no more be diſtinguied by their garments, but that the Graecian ſhould be knowne and diſcerned by vertue, and the Barbarian by vice, accounting all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men Graecians, and all vicious men Barbarians. Therefore <hi>Plutark</hi> ſaid very well, that they who were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and brought vnder his yoke were a great deale more happie than thoſe that eſcaped his power, bicauſe theſe men had none to cauſe them to leaue of from liuing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerablic, and the other were compelled by the conqueror to liue happily. Whereby he deſerued no leſſe the name of a great philoſopher, than did <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates</hi> and others, who although they wrote nothing, yet were ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for their maner of life, and for that which they ſpake, did and taught. In all which things <hi>Alexander</hi> approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next vnto them, went alſo beyond them in this, that they taught men of good vnderſtandings, namely ſuch as were Graecians as well as themſelues, and that without great paine and trauell: but this monark ſuſtaining infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite labor, and cheerefully ſheading his bloud did change into a better eſtate, and reformed the rude maners of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſauage people, euen of ſuch as were brutiſh by nature. Now let vs ſpeake of <hi>Caeſar</hi> the firſt Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Was it not prudence eſpecially that prepared <note place="margin">Of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Pulius Caeſar.</note>the way for him to ſo mightie an empire, firſt by reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> two of the greateſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Senators, by whoſe fauor he obtained afterwardes the dignitie of Conſulſhip? When he was placed therin, being deſirous to win the good wil of the people &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was alreadie well vnder propped of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, he preſerred many lawes in their behalfe. Beſides he was very ſumptuous and popular, if euer any Romaine was, not ſparing any coſt vpon plaies, turneies, feaſtes, largeſſes, and other baits to curry fauor with the meaner ſort of the people, and to gaine the honor and credire of a man that is gratious and charitable towards the poore. And when he was ſent to take vpon him the gouernment of the Gaules, he warred there ten yeeres, being guided
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8689:70"/>
by an vnſpeakable prudence, that was accompanied with diligence and forecaſt: ſo that by vſing all occaſions wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; to purpoſe, he ſubdued there three hundred ſundry nations, tooke eight hundred townes &amp; in manie battels diſcomfited three millions of men. The commentaries which he wrote himſelfe, declare ſufficiently that his own vertue wrought more exploits than all his armie. Of this alſo he gaue proofe enough in the beginning of the ciuill warre betweene him and <hi>Pompey,</hi> wherein he vſed ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that comming out of Fraunce he made himſelfe maiſter of all Italy in threeſcore daies, without any effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of bloud, and droue away his enimy. And <hi>Cicero,</hi> who (as ſome ſay) conſpired his death, in an epiſtle calleth him <note place="margin">Caeſar noted two faults in Pompey.</note>a monſter of prudence and of incredible diligence. Was it not prudence whereby he noted two faults in <hi>Pompey,</hi> which after were the cauſe of his ouerthrow? The firſt in an incounter of their armies, wherein <hi>Caeſar</hi> being at that time the weaker had the woorſt. And when he perceiued that his enimy purſued him not, but retired to his campe, he ſaid. The victorie this day was in the power of our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but their captaine could not perceiue it. The other fault which he noted was at the battel of Pharſalia, where <hi>Pompey</hi> was quite ouerthrowne, becauſe he charged his ſouldiers being ranged in battell to ſtand ſtill in their places, and ſo to attend their enimies. Then <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaide, that in ſo dooing <hi>Pompey</hi> tooke from his ſouldiers the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie and violence of giuing the onſet, which is as a ſpurre vnto them in their race, beſides the heate of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which this ſpeedie running forward worketh in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We ſee then how neceſſarie this vertue of prudence is in <note place="margin">Ageſilaus.</note>feats of warre, which cauſed <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> king of Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, after great loſſes ſuſtained by the violence of <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,</hi> the generall captaine of the Thebanes, to ſay to his men, that they ſhould not greatly care for the multitude of their enimies, but bend all their force againſt <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> onely, bicauſe none but wiſe &amp; prudent men were valiant, and the onely cauſe of victorie. And therefore if they could beate him downe, they ſhould vndoubtedly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8689:70"/>
haue the reſt at their deuotion. As indeed it came to paſſe in that battell which they fought togither, wherein the Lacedemonians halfe diſcomfited, one of thoſe that fled being purſued by <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> turned back and ſlew him: <note place="margin">The loſſe of a capt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke of a common-wealth ſaith, that if a man woulde do notable acts woorthy of perfect praiſe in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the common-wealth, he muſt haue prudence and iuſtice, followed of power and fortune. But we may further ſay, that onely prudence hath ſet aloft and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many great eſtates from ruine and ſubuerſion. The Athenians being diuided and banded into three contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">The prudence of Solon.</note>parts and factions, <hi>Solon</hi> being very prudent and wiſe, would not ioine himſelfe to any of them, but kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe indifferent to all, practiſing &amp; ſpeaking whatſoeuer he could deuiſe to ioine &amp; reconcile them togither again. Wherein he behaued himſelfe ſo well, that being choſen by them all for the onely paciſier and reformer of their eſtate, he placed it in greater glorie than euer it was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by his prudent and wiſe lawes which were receiued <note place="margin">The prudence of Lycurgus.</note>as inuiolable. The prudence of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the reformer and lawmaker of the Lacedemonians, was the cauſe of the maintenance of their eſtate aboue fiue hundred yeeres, ſo that it was the chiefeſt in all Graecia both for glorie and excellencie of gouernment, from whence they fell not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as they wholy neglected thoſe goodly ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and lawes which he left them. A prudent man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies gineth good counſalle, and vttereth the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being alſo a good and willing helpe to innocencie. <hi>Phocion</hi> ſpeaking his minde one day in the counſell cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">Phocion.</note>of the Athenians, againſt the enterpriſing of a certain war, and ſeeing that his aduiſe ſo greatly diſpleaſed them, that they would not giue him leaue to vtter his minde, he ſpake freely vnto them in this maner: Ye may perad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

(O Athenians) force me to do that which ought not to be done, but ye can not conſtraine me to ſpeake any thing contrary to my opinion that ought not to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or counſailed. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> knowing the innocencie of a poore woman drawne into iudgement with danger of being ouerthrowne, ſaued hir by his great prudence. <note place="margin">The prudence of Demoſthenes in defending the innocencie of a poore woman.</note>For two ſtrangers hauing giuen hir a good ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to keepe with this condition, that ſhe ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to the one except the other were alſo preſent, within a while after one of them came very ſorrowfull fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that his companion was dead, and bringing ſome counterfeit token therof with him. Wherupon he ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded this poore woman, who ment ſimply plainely, that ſhe reſtored the monie to him. Afterwards the other came, &amp; demanding the money alſo, brought this woman before a iudge, who being without hope of eſcaping, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthencs</hi> anſwered for hir, that ſhe offred to giue him the money ſo that he brought his fellow, bicauſe, as himſelfe confeſſed, ſhe ought not to giue it to the one without the <note place="margin">How a prudent man may reape benefit by his enimies, and by miſhaps.</note>other. The profite which a prudent man draweth from his enimies is in this, that he knoweth and taketh them for ſpies, for enuiers at his life, and ioint-labourers with him for honor and glory: wherupon he is the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that his dooings may be blameles. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Diogenes</hi> anſwered wiſely to one, who demanded how he might be auenged on his enimie: By making thy ſelfe (quoth he) a vertuous and good man.

                     <hi>Caeſar,</hi> told him, that he did put <hi>Caeſars</hi> yoke vpon his own necke, which then he perceiued not, but that ſhortly it would weigh heauy vpon him, and then ſhould he finde himſelfe taken and tied. A prudent man is not amaſed through feare either of blame or of falſe accuſation, but alwaies goeth with his head vpright, truſting to his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and to his owne vertue. <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of many things by the Tribunes of the people, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing to the crimes laid againſt him, but onely ſaide thus: In ſuch a day as this is, ſirs, I ouercame both <note place="margin">The prudence of Scipio in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to an vniuſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Carthage and Hannibal, and therefore I am now going to the Capitoll to ſacrifice to <hi>Iupiter</hi> the beſt and greateſt God, and to giue him thanks for the victory. In the meane while if any man long to proceed againſt me in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let him do it. After he had ſo ſaid, he went towards the Capitoll, being followed of his friends, and of the greater part of the Senators. When the people ſaw this, they likewiſe accompanied him, ſo that in ſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him, they cauſed him in a maner to triumph a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Emilius Scaurus</hi> being alſo accuſed of a certaine <note place="margin">Emilius Scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note>crime by <hi>Varius,</hi> made this onely anſwer: O ye Romanes, <hi>

By this wiſe and couragious anſwere he made the accuſation of no effect, bicauſe his honeſtie was well knowen to euery one. The conuerſation, aſſemblies, laughters, quips, and paſtimes of prudent men are neuer without ſome profit. <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>Conuiuium,</hi> that is, a feaſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth of the laſt end of mens actions, and of the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne and chiefe good of man, but yet in very familiar ſpeeches, by certaine examples, and pleaſant fictions, and deuiſes fit for the time and place, and not with ſerious and graue words, as he vſeth to do in his other writings. Moreouer, learned deuiſes are the ſports and delights of <note place="margin">The ſports of prudent men.</note>wiſe men, who account all other paſtimes vaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming them, and as hinderances and lets rather of their pleaſure, than occaſions of any recreation.

they can in their ſerious diſcourſes intermingle ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt paſtimes, but yet not altogither without profit. As <hi>Plato</hi> in his foreſaid feaſt interlaceth certaine comicall ſpeeches of loue, how beit all the reſt of the ſupper there was nothing but wiſe diſcourſes of philoſophie. A Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian <note place="margin">Pleaſant ſayings ful of doctrine.</note>being asked of a certaine matter by an other, anſwered cleane contrarie to the truth. And when the other told him that he lied, behold (quoth he againe) what a foole thou art to aske me that, which thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt well ynough. <hi>Diogenes</hi> in a great aſſemblie of people, purpoſely going backward, and ſeeing that euery one laughed at him, asked them alowd if they were not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to mocke him for going backward when he walked, whereas they did ſo all their life time. And as <hi>Aristippus</hi> on a time beheld him waſhing of coleworts for his ſupper, he ſaid vnto him: If thou didſt know <hi>(Diogenes)</hi> how to obey kings, and to ſeeke them out, thou wouldeſt not waſh coleworts. And thou <hi>Aristippus</hi> (quoth he) if thou kneweſt how to waſh coleworts, thou wouldeſt not ſerue kings, but liue at libertie. What profitable doctrine may a man draw out of theſe philoſophicall diſports and ieſts? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">A prudent man doth not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightly beleeue any thing.</note>a prudent man neuer beleeueth any thing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightly, but laieth aſide all reputation and credit of him that ſpeaketh, and examineth the ſpeech by it ſelfe: ſo far is he from giuing credit to an ignorant or naughtie fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Neither will he be dazeled with fine and eloquent ſpeech, but (as <hi>Zeno</hi> ſaid) conſidereth whether his ſpeech be tempered with ſenſe and reaſon, that ſo he may iudge foundly of the truth, and take order thereafter. O what number of examples to this purpoſe might be alledged of the great harme that hath followed the credulitie and light beliefe of magiſtrates, gouernors, and heades of monarchies and nations. Alas, our poore France hath but too great experience thereof to hir confuſion and and deſtruction. But this matter may offer it ſelfe heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be more amply handled, as alſo other effects of Prudence, which I haue briefly touched. In the meane while we will conclude, that Prudence is an excellent gift
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8689:72"/>
of God, that it is the guide and light of all the morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, from whence all good and noble actions haue their being and beginning, and that without it a man can do nothing that is excellent and praiſe-worthy.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8689:73"/>
with vertuous deedes, it ought rather to be called the chiefeſt euil: foraſmuch as he that ſinneth through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is more excuſable than the malitious, who ſinneth <note place="margin">Vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be ioined with knowledge.</note>wittingly. And for defence of my ſaying, beſides the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ſcripture, I haue <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſaith, that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without the knowledge and practiſe of that which is good, is very pernitious.

                  <p>All vertue being in the midſt of two vices, the one of them is cleane contrarie vnto it, and the other being more dangerous, ſeeketh to couer it ſelfe with hir name, and it is called of the philoſopher a falſe follower of vertue. For this cauſe they placed want of prudence, which vice is in the defect, at the right hand of prudence: and at the left hand, Malice or Craft, which is the exceſſe, and cauſeth a man to ſinne, not through ignorance, but by deceit and ſubtiltie, and that vnder the name of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Firſt then let vs conſider of want of prudence or vnskilfulnes, and of the effects thereof in the ſoule. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulnes <note place="margin">What want of prudence is.</note>proceeding, or rather being the ſame thing that ignorance is, cauſeth a man (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) to iudge euil of things, to deliberate worſe, not to know how to take the aduantage of preſent good things, but to conceiue ill of thoſe things that are good and honeſt in mans life. And as Prudence is the knowledge of that which ought to be done or left vndone, ſo vnskilfulnes is the ignorance of thoſe ſelfe ſame things, and is alwaies followed of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie, of want of ciuilitie, and of forgetfulnes. Briefly, want of prudence is ſo contagious and peſtilent a thing in the mind of man, that all other infirmities of the ſpirit, wherewithall it is commonly moleſted, and all euill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeeme to proceed from the ſame. And truly whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is, there neither God can be truly honored and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, nor vice auoided, nor any action, either publike or priuate can be orderly, and according to dutie executed. For as a weake and diſeaſed ſight cannot behold the light of the ſunne, ſo an vnskilfull ſoule cannot know the truth,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8689:73"/>
Vnskilfulnes cauſeth a man to fall into ſeueritie, when he <note place="margin">The pernitious effects of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>thinks to exerciſe iuſtice. If he would be liberall, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth prodigall. If he thinketh to auoid ſuperfluitie, he falleth into couetouſnes. If he haue any apprehenſion of the diuine nature, he conſumeth his ſoule with a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed feare through ſuperſtition. If his mind cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that there is a moſt happy and bleſſed nature, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he iudgeth, that there is none at all: and thus guided by ignorance all his deſires and inclinations tend to wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednes and miſerie. Moreouer, <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance taketh away the ſight of the mind from thoſe that are tainted therewith, as blindnes taketh away the ſight of corporall eies from thoſe that lacke their ſight. And further he teſtifieth, that the ignorant mind is vile and wretched, and that it is more expedient not to liue at all, than to liue in ignorance. But if we giue credit to <hi>Cicero,</hi> he onely liueth indeed and poſſeſſeth a ſoule, who ſetling himſelfe to ſome good matter, ſeeketh after renowme by ſome notable fact, or by ſome good art. It is good (ſaith <hi>Socrates)</hi> to leaue off altogither the vſe of that thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue no skill to vſe it well. And ſo for thoſe that know not how to vſe their eies, eares, and whole bodie, it were more profitable neither to ſee, heare, or helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues any way with their bodie. In like maner it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him that knoweth not how to uſe his ſoule, to haue none at all, than to liue. And if he muſt needs liue, being borne, he ſhould be happier in the eſtate of a ſlaue than of a free man. The ſpeech of this wiſe philoſopher expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelfe ſufficiently, as tending to no other end than to giue vs to vnderſtand, that it is better not to be, yea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to haue been borne, than through ignorance to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vice: and further, that it is more dangerous when a man may freely do ſo without feare of any greater than himſelfe. For as droonkennes engendreth rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſo (ſaith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> ignorance ioined with power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth inſolencie and furie. And it is all one (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) to place an ignorant man in authoritie, as to lay a great burden vpon the ſhoulders of a man halfe dead
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8689:74"/>
through weakenes. All theſe things make me iudge an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man to be, I will not onely ſay, like an image or blocke of wood, but in a maner nothing differing from brute beaſts. This cauſed the ancients to vſe this ſaying: <note place="margin">All ignorant men are euill.</note>that <hi>Euery ignorant man was euill.</hi> And <hi>Terence</hi> going yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, that The earth beareth nothing worſe than an ignorant man. And in truth what miſchiefs do we not ſee to come of ignorance? If a man be of a meane or baſe <note place="margin">The effects of ignorance both in rich &amp; poore.</note>eſtate, it maketh him good for nothing, fearfull, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, vnprofitable, needie, vnciuill, ſlothfull, and vnfit to euery good thing. If he be mightie and rich, beſides that he may fall into the ſaid miſeries through the ſame imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he will ſo much the ſooner become arrogant, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, raſh, talkatiue, couetous, vnconſtant, giuen to voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and vniuſt. In a word, the more meanes he ſhall haue to exerciſe vices, the richer in them will he grow to be through ignorance: and ſo not being able to gouerne himſelfe, he muſt needs be vnwoorthie to intermeddle at all either in politicall or Oeconomicall gouernment. If an ignorant man poſſeſſe any great benefit or felicitie, he can neuer know ſo much, before he hath loſt it againe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, this miſchiefe followeth him, that he can neuer make his profit of any good counſell, bicauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of his owne opinion, which he alwaies thinketh better than any other: yea he ſuppoſeth that nothing can be well done except he put to his helping hand. For (as <hi>Menander</hi> ſaith) nothing is ſo raſh as ignorance. And the more that an ignorant man is lift vp vnto ſome excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of dignitie or riches, the more vnſufferable he is, as one that knoweth not how to vſe them: ſo that he is puffed vp with pride aboue meaſure, and not content with his eſtate, but driuen with ambition, he preſumeth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to vndertake things againſt all reaſon and equitie. And contrariwiſe if fortune change, he abaſeth himſelfe out of meaſure, ſhewing nothing but abiection of mind, inconſtancy and impatiencie, and that with ſo great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſquietnes of ſpirit, that oftentimes he is wholie beſides himſelfe. Now theſe are but ſmall fruits of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8689:74"/>
namely, to make a man importunate: to cauſe him <note place="margin">Common effects of ignorance.</note>to ſtay another that hath great affaires, ſaying, that he hath many things to communicate vnto him, when in truth they will do him but ſmall pleaſure: to deſire one that hath loſt his ſuite to beſtow a dinner vpon him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to tell him a way how he may recouer it againe: to ſpeake ill of women, when he is inuited to weddings, or in their companie: to requeſt him to walke that hath alreadie gone a great way: when he ſeeth a thing ſold to bring a chapman to the ſeller, who would haue giuen a great deale more for it: to repeate one thing oftentimes: to ſhew himſelfe readie to do that which a man would not haue him to do, and yet dare not well denie it him: to woonder at all things, and to ſpeake all in a word, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull man is alwaies in all places and in all affaires vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill and impertinent. The examples of theſe foreſaid ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are but too familiar amongſt vs. And firſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe of ſmall and meane eſtate and condition, how many millions of men haue there been in the ages paſt, and do liue yet among vs, whoſe life being ignorant of euery good cauſe and reaſon, is not much vnlike, and in <note place="margin">The ſpring of all errors.</note>many things worſe than that of brute beaſts. The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of ſo many errors, fooliſh opinions, and impieties, hath it not had paſſage through the midſt of their ſoules, bicauſe they had no true knowledge of the end of their being, nor of his will by whom they liue? From thence it commeth, that the beſt aduiſed among them exerciſe baſe handicrafts, not being deſirous to learne further: that ſome lead a ſeruile and contemptible life, bringing their bodies and ſoules in ſubiection to the luſts and wicked deſires of the greater ſort: that others remaine idle and vnprofitable ſeeking to maintaine their liues by vnlawfull meanes: that all through a blockiſh ignorance depriue themſelues of all preſent and eternall felicitie. Now albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it theſe poore men, who haue no great meanes to execure their wicked deſires, may after a ſort ſeeme tollerable and excuſeable to mans iudgement, bicauſe their ignorance doth not greatly hurt any but themſelues, yet it falleth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8689:75"/>
out far worſe with thoſe that haue wealth at will, and authoritie to command others, who not knowing how to vſe their goods well by vertuous deeds, abuſe them to all vice, diſſolutenes, and pleaſure: whereby for the moſt part they caſt themſelues headlong into infidelitie and Atheiſme, bicauſe they neuer had true vnderſtanding of the perfect diuinitie, nor yet conſidered the perfection of his works both in heauen &amp; earth. O pitifull calamity <note place="margin">The reaſons which mooued the heathen to beleeue that there was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie.</note>abounding in this our age more than euer it did. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand millions of Pagans and heathens conſidering that there was nothing to be miſliked in the heauens, neither any negligence, diſorder, or confuſion in the moouing of the ſtars, nor in the ſeaſons of the yeere, nor in their reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, nor in the courſe of the ſunne about the earth, which cauſeth the day and the night, no not in the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and preſeruation of all ſorts of liuing creatures, nor in the generation of yeerly fruits, and for a thouſand other good conſiderations, beleeued and worſhipped one ſupreme eternall eſſence, which gouerneth all things. And ſhall they that carie the name of Chriſtians, to whom the vnſpeakable treaſures of the heauens haue been opened and offered with innumerable graces, ſhall they, I ſay, doubt, yea impudently denie that there is a God? But let vs returne to our matter. It is moſt certaine, that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that ignorant men are aduanced, ſo much without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion are their faults greater than thoſe of meaner eſtate, bicauſe they are hurtfull to many. Yea oftentimes it hath come to paſſe, that one onely fault of ſuch a man hath been the loſſe and deſtruction of an infinite number of <note place="margin">Nicias feared an eclipſe of the moone.</note>men. <hi>Nicias</hi> the general captain of the Athenians, through the feare which he had conceiued of the darkness of an Eclipſe of the moone, and not knowing the cauſe thereof, ſtaied ſo long vntill his enimies had incloſed him round about: whereupon he was taken aliue of them, and put to death, beſides the loſſe of fortie thouſand Athenians <note place="margin">Caligula and Domitian.</note>that were taken and ſlaine. Who doubteth but that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance draue <hi>Caligula &amp; Domitian</hi> into ſuch pride &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, that whilſt they ſought to be worſhipped in ſtead of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8689:75"/>
the true God, they were the cauſe of the death &amp; deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more than a hundred thouſand men? In the time <note place="margin">Otho 1.</note>of <hi>Otho</hi> the firſt there fell a ſtone from heauen, which aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed all Germanie, and turned them from proſecuting an enterpriſe of great waight and importance for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their countrie. If they had knowen it to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thing, and ſuch as had come to paſſe long before, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth, they had not been ſo fearfull, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that dammage to the detriment of the Common-wealth, which came to them afterward. That ſpeech of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> a Greeke philoſopher, agreeable heerunto, is worthie to be remembred, when he ſaid, that a man ought <note place="margin">Anaxagoras ſaying againſt the ſuperſtitious feare of celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſignes.</note>to driue out of himſelfe, and to tread vnder his feete all ſuperſtitious feare of the heauenly ſignes and impreſſions of the aire, which worke great terror in them that are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their cauſes, and that feare the gods with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne and amaſed feare, bicauſe they want that certaine knowledge that philoſophie bringeth, which in ſtead of a trembling and alwaies terrifying ſuperſtition, engendreth true deuotion, accompanied with an aſſured hope of good. Let vs looke a little into our Chronicles, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what profit our kings receiued by their ignorance, when they were called <hi>Simple,</hi> when they ſtood but for images, and were ſeene of their ſubiects but once a yeere. They ſuffered their wiſe maiſters of the palace to take knowledge of, and to order and rule all things, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing them as vnworthie of all authoritie, tooke poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the end of their crowne. And ſurely it is no leſſe pernitious for the greater ſort to aduance ignorant men to charges and places of honor, and to vſe their counſell, than to be ignorant themſelues. For (as we ſaid) ignorance cauſeth him that is aduanced to forget himſelfe, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him vp into all pride. There are amongſt vs too many examples of the ambition and preſumption of many ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant men, who, contrarie to <hi>Torquatus</hi> that refuſed the Conſulſhip, bicauſe of his diſeaſed eies, altogither blind as they are, deafe, dumbe, and deſtitute of all natural light, of prudence and experience to guide themſelues, are not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8689:76"/>
contented to manage the ſailes and tacklings, but deſire to haue the rudder of the Common-welth in their hands. And it is greatly to be feared, that ſuch vnskilfull and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious <note place="margin">Cleander a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus his Lord.</note>men will in the end ſhew themſelues both in will and practiſe to be imitators of one <hi>Cleander</hi> an outlandiſh ſlaue, who being preferred by <hi>Commodus</hi> the emperor to goodlie offices and great places of honor, as to be great maiſter of his men of war, and his chiefe chamberlaine, conſpired notwithſtanding againſt his Lord, ſeeking to attaine to the imperiall dignitie by feditions, which he ſtirred vp in Rome betweene the people and the ſoldiers. But through good order taken, his enterpriſe tooke no effect, except the loſſe of his owne head, and deſtruction of his houſe. Although oftentimes it falleth out cleane contrarie through the iuſt puniſhment of God, for the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and impietie as well of the monarks themſelues, as of their people. Now if fortune turne hir ſelfe about, and ſet hir ſelfe neuer ſo little againſt an ignorant perſon, he is ſtraightway ouercome with a thouſand perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and vrged with deſpaire, as being only grounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vpon the vaine and weake hope and confidence in externall and vncertaine goods. <hi>Perſes,</hi> king of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and one of the ſucceſſors of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great in his <note place="margin">The haſe mind of Perſes being ouercome of Emilius.</note>great conqueſts, but not in his vnſpeakable vertues, was ouercome in battel by <hi>Paulus Emilius,</hi> chiefe captain of the Romans, &amp; was led towards him. <hi>Emilius,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw him, aroſe from his ſeate, and went forward to receiue and honor him, as being a great perſonage, and fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that miſhap by the hazard of fortune. But <hi>Perſes,</hi> being wholie beaten downe through faintnes and baſenes of mind, caſt himſelfe at his feete vpon the ground with his face downeward, vſing ſuch abiect requeſts and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo vnbeſeeming the vertue of a king, that the Conqueror could not abide them, but ſaid thus vnto him: Alas poore ignorant man as thou art, how doſt thou by diſcharging fortune accuſe thy ſelfe in this ſort to be the onely cauſe of this ill ſucceſſe that is befallen thee, ſeeing thou neuer deſeruedſt that honor, which thou haſt had
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8689:76"/>
heeretofore, bicauſe of thy baſe mind within thee, which hath made thee an vnwoorthy aduerſary of the Romans? And truly a man cannot iuſtly be called through the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of fortune, but by knowing how to vſe hir well and wiſely both in proſperitie &amp; aduerſitie. As for an ignorant &amp; baſeminded man, the higher that fortune lifteth him vp in great eſtate where he ſhal be viewed of many, ſo much the more ſhee diſcouereth, deſcrieth &amp; diſhonoreth him. For great calling, &amp; riches are no more able to lift vp the hart of a baſe minded fellow, than pouerty can abate and leſſen the great courage of a noble hart. I could here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge many mo examples of the pernicious effects that are (as we haue ſaid) wrought in the ſoule by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but hereafter they will come in more fitly, when we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe particulerly of vices. Onely I ſay here with <hi>Plato,</hi> that arrogant ignorance hath now more than euer ſeazed vpon the minds of men, &amp; filled them with euils, as being the roote and ſpring of them: that it peruerteth al things, &amp; cauſeth him that poſſeſſeth hir to taſte in the ende of a moſt bitter fruite. Nowe to come to malice and crafte, <note place="margin">What malice and craft are.</note>which is the exceſſe of prudence, it is that which leadeth a man through wilfull ignorance, to oppoſe himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which he knoweth to be dutifull and honeſt, cauſing him vnder the counterfaite name of prudence to ſeeke to deceiue thoſe that will beleeue him. This vice is the chiefe cauſe of ambition and couetouſnes, which moſt men ſerue in theſe daies: but aboue all things it is an enimie to iuſtice, cauſing all their actions to tende to the ouerthrow thereof. To this purpoſe <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that the craftier and ſubtiler a man is, the more he is to be ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and hated, as one that hath loſt al credite of goodnes. All knowledge ſeuered from iuſtice ought rather to be called craft and malice than ſcience and prudence. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the onely act of malice (as the ſame author ſaith) euill &amp; wicked, but alſo the deliberation therof although it take no effect, yea the onely thought thereof is vile and deteſtable: ſo far is it, that any couering or cloake can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a fault committed of malice. Alſo he ſaith, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8689:77"/>
                     <note place="margin">Vertuous men ſeeke after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, not ſecret things.</note>all hope of concealing and hiding the fact muſt be taken away, foraſmuch as vertuous men ought to ſeeke after honeſt, not ſecret things. Moreouer it is the propertie of a malicious man to chooſe hypocriſie and diſſimulation for his companions. Beſides he hath for his firſt author and father, ſathan, who by his ſubtiltie and <note place="margin">Satan the father of malice and ſubtiltie.</note>craft abuſed the ſimplicitie of our firſt mother to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of all mankind. Amongſt many we may note here the example of <hi>Nero</hi> a moſt cruell emperor, who being inſtructed from his youth by that wiſe man <hi>Seneca</hi> his ſchoolemaſter, in the beginning of his empire coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaited ſo great bountifulnes and clemencie, that when he was to ſet his hand to the condemnation of one adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to die, he cried out and ſaid, Would to God I had no learning, then ſhould I be excuſed from ſubſcribing to <note place="margin">The malice of Nero.</note>any mans death. Notwithſtanding within a while after he diſcloſed his deteſtable impiety and cruelty, by putting to death his mother, his tutor and a great number of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men againſt all right and iuſtice. Moreouer he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely cauſed fire to be put into all quarters of Rome, forbidding vnder paine of death that any ſhould quench it, inſomuch that more then halfe the citie was cleane conſumed. Afterward, to the ende he might haue ſome coulor to perſecute the chriſtians, he laid to their charge the kindling of the fire, &amp; ſo put a great number of them <note place="margin">Tiberius.</note>to death. <hi>Tiberius</hi> alſo in the beginning of his raigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himſelfe ſo wiſely, vertuouſly and gently, that he ſeemed to be (ſaith <hi>Suetonius)</hi> a ſimple and plaine citizen. And yet ſoone after he became as deteſtable a tyrant as euer was, for crueltie and filthy pleaſures. True it is that one may attribute the cauſe of ſuch ſodaine alteration of humors to the ſoueraigne authoritie and power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, which commonly hath his propertie to make him that ſeemed good to become wicked: the humble to be arrogant: the pittifull cruell: the valiant, a coward. But it is alwaies more likely that a prince changing his nature ſo quickly vſeth to counterfeit and to diſſemble, and to put a goodly vizard vpon his face, as hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8689:77"/>
write, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> could behaue himſelfe cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that ſort. Now that we may profite by this diſcourſe, <note place="margin">Math. 10. 16.</note>let vs learne to be prudent and ſimple as the ſcripture ſpeaketh, eſchuing all ſhameles and damnable malice and deceit, al want of prudence and ignorance, which procure the loſſe of ſoule and bodie, whereof a man may accuſe none but himſelfe. For ignorance (ſaith <hi>Menander)</hi> is a voluntarie miſcheefe. And although the knowledge of good &amp; euill is moſt neceſſarie of all others, yet is it moſt eaſie. For the obtaining whereof, and auoiding (through the grace of God) of that condemnation, which is to fall vpon the blinde, and vpon the guides of the blinde, let vs neuer be aſhamed to confeſſe our ignorance in thoſe things whereof we want inſtruction: following therein that precept of <hi>Plato, That we muſt not be aſhamed to learne,</hi> leaſt happily we be hit in the teeth to our confuſion with that ſaying of <hi>Diogenes</hi> to a yoong man whom he eſpied in a tauerne, who being aſhamed to be ſeene there, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie fledde further into the ſame. The more thou runneſt in (quoth this wiſe man to him) the further thou art in <note place="margin">We muſt not denie or hide our ignorance.</note>the tauerne. Euen ſo we ſhall neuer cure our ignorance by denying or hiding it, but the wiſer we ſeeke to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, the more ignorant we ſhall remaine: not vnlike to poore men, who being deſirous to ſeeme rich, in the ende finde themſelues poorer than before, by reaſon of their vaine and fooliſh expenſes. But the ignorant man that ſearcheth for wiſedome and inquireth after hir, ſhall be in ſome ſort eſteemed wiſe, and that inquirie ought to be taken for an argument of his wit and prudence: as contrariwiſe he that taketh himſelfe for a wiſeman and preſumeth too much of his skill, falleth often into ſhame and diſhonor, being reprooued of many. Therefore let vs daily accuſe our ſelues of too much ignorance, knowing that euen the ſharpeſt ſighted do ſee but through a cloud and miſt, I meane the inſtruments of our bodie, from which we ſhall not be deliuered vntill we haue put of this mortall to be clothed with that which is immortall in the enioying of the bleſſed life. So that it will be alwaies
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8689:78"/>
neceſſarie for vs during this life, to learne and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in the knowledge of the truth, which is an enimie to ignorance.</p>

                  <p>In the writings of the learned we finde men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a double ſpeech or reaſon: the one inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8689:78"/>
or of the minde, called the diuine guide: the other <note place="margin">A double ſpeech or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note>vttered in ſpeech, which is the meſſenger of the conceits and thoughts of man. The ende of the firſt is friendſhip towards a mans ſelfe. For reſpecting onely the marke of vertue, through the inſtructions of philoſophie, it maketh a man to agree alwaies with himſelfe, it cauſeth him to complaine neuer, to repent him of nothing, it maketh him full of peace, full of loue and of contentation in his owne vertue, it healeth him of euery rebellious paſſion that diſobeieth reaſon, of all contention betweene will and will, and of the contrarietie of diſcourſes. O rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, which floweth from wiſedome into the ſoules of bleſſed men! The ende of the other reaſon or vttered ſpeech, is friendſhip towards others, which cauſeth vs to ſpeake and teach whatſoeuer is fruitefull and profitable for euerie one, and carieth with it great force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade. Of this ſpeech we purpoſe here to intreat, as of that which occupieth no ſmall place, but euen verie great amongſt the ſecrets of nature, and which ought to rauiſh vs into an admiration of his works who is author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The philoſophers, diligent ſearchers out of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">How ſpeech is framed.</note>of all things, ſaid that ſpeech is made by the aire bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and framed with articulate and diſtinct ſounde. But howſoeuer it is framed, the reaſon thereof is hard to be comprehended of humane ſence. And we ought to be ſo much the more deſirous to know for what cauſe it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, and to feare leaſt we make it vnprofitable, or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly imploy ſo great, woonderfull and diuine a thing. <hi>Democritus</hi> ſaide that words were the ſhadowe of works. <hi>Themistocles</hi> compared ſpeech to a rich cloth of tapiſtrie, <note place="margin">Words are the ſhadow of works.</note>figured &amp; ſet foorth with ſtories, bicauſe that both in the one and the other thoſe things that are faſhioned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented are then ſeene when they are opened and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied, and are not ſubiect to ſight, neither bring any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or contentation, when they are folded vp and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. When a wiſe man openeth his lips (ſaith <hi>Socrates)</hi> we beholde as it were in a temple, the goodly ſimilitudes &amp; images of the ſoule. Vertue (ſaith <hi>Plutarke)</hi> hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8689:79"/>
ſo gratious or familiar as ſpeech, which being followed of works, is of great efficacie and force, and woonderfully pricketh forward thoſe that heare vs, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to giue credite to our ſayings, and working in them a deſire to reſemble vs. And <hi>AEſchines</hi> ſaide verie well, that it is not ſo neceſſarie, that the Orator and the Law ſhould agree in one and the ſame thing, as it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that the life of a philoſopher ſhould be conformable and agreeable with this doctrine and ſpeech. Moreouer a wiſe man ought to take euery word he ſpeaketh for a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie and particuler lawe, laide vpon himſelfe, ſeeing that philoſophie is a profeſſion of ſerious, graue &amp; waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters, &amp; not a play or prittle prattle, vnconſtanly vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to obtaine honor onely. Whereby we ſee that all talke ought to haue reaſon for a foundation, and the loue <note place="margin">The foundation and ſcope of all ſpeech.</note>of our neighbor for a marke to aime at. This is that which <hi>Agapetus</hi> would teach vs, when he ſaith, <hi>That the toong is a ſlipperie instrument, and bringeth great danger to thoſe that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it:</hi> but if we direct it with a religious vnderſtanding, it wil ſing vs a ſong tuned with al the concords of a true har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of vertue. <hi>Plutark</hi> ſaith that ſpeech ought to be like gold, which is then of greateſt price and value, when it hath leaſt droſſe in it: ſo a fewe words ought to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende great ſtore of ſubſtantiall matter and inſtruction. Such was the ſpeech of the ancient Graecians, as the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences vttered by them do teſtifie: namely, <hi>Know thy ſelfe, Nothing too much, Nothing more than enough,</hi> and other ſhort ſpeeches full of great and profitable doctrine. Wherupon <note place="margin">Of Laconicall ſpeech.</note>this prouerbe aroſe, <hi>Laconical ſayings,</hi> that is, ſhort and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, which reſemble ſtreams running through a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtraight, where the water is ſo preſſed togither, that one cannot ſee through it. And ſo truely it was verie hard without skil and great labor to comprehende the deapth of the ſence &amp; vnderſtanding of their words, which were full of ſententious grauitie. And when they were to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere any thing propounded on a ſodaine, auoiding all ſuperfluous ſpeech, their anſwers were verie witty and wel contriued, their words very ſignificant and ſhort, hauing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8689:79"/>
in them both grace and grauitie ioined together. As when <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedonia wrote vnto them, that if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within Laconia, he would ouerthrowe them topſy turuy: they wrote backe vnto him onely this word, <hi>If.</hi> And another time, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> one of his ſucceſſors, being angry with the ambaſſadour which they ſent vnto him, asked if he came alone from the Lacedemonians to him, the ambaſſadour made this onely anſwere, <hi>One to one. Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A pretie ſaying of Pittacus.</note>vſed to ſay, that a dry and thirſtie eare muſt be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with a ſentence that is good to drinke, &amp; that ſpeech grounded vpon reaſon onely, is able to content and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the hearing. Notwithſtanding that we may the rather and the more profite others, we are not to neglect, if it may be, the ioining of graue doctrine with ſweet gratious and eloquent ſpeech, mingled with ſome pleaſure, grace, and delight, but voide of all diſſolutenes. For (as <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> ſaith) that is the goodlieſt aſſembly in the world, where <note place="margin">Of graue and eloquent ſpeech</note>the graces and muſes meete togither. Right and reaſon are inuincible, being well vttred; bicauſe the ſoule is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by induced eaſily to beleeue the good reaſons ſhe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, through the delight that is ioined with them. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples alſo being vttred fitly, and with a good grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit no leſſe than the other, bicauſe with the force of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading, which is in the nature of the example, there is ioined the vertue of delighting. But we muſt carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide all ſubtiltie of ſpeech, all proude, ſuperfluous and vnprofitable talke, leaſt that be iuſtly obiected vnto vs, which <hi>Phocion</hi> replied to <hi>Leosthenes,</hi> who laboured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Athenians to warre by an eloquent and verie loftie oration. Thy words (quoth he to him) yoong man and my friend, may fitly be compared to <hi>Cypres</hi> trees. For they are great and tall, but beare no fruite woorth any thing. Or elſe that may be obiected vnto vs, which <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Againſt prating pleaders.</note>anſwered to a great pleader of cauſes, who at euerie ſentence he rehearſed, asked him if that were not a ſtrange thing. Not that, (replied he) but this is a greater mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, that any man hauing two legs can abide thy bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And to another, who after a long diſcourſe ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8689:80"/>
him, I haue troubled thy head philoſopher: not a whit (anſwered he) for I thought not vpon it. Such bablers, whom <hi>Plato</hi> verie aptly calleth theeues of time, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Plutark</hi> to emptie veſſels, which giue a greater ſound than they that are ful. So he that is poore in reſpect of the goods of the ſoule, hath alwaies ſome fond ſpeech in his mouth. But we muſt aboue all things ſhunne this <note place="margin">The toong is the beſt and woorſt thing that is.</note>vice of intemperancie of the toong, which <hi>Bias</hi> called the beſt and woorſt thing that was. It ſerueth vs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and inſtruct others, and by the ſame alſo we hurt and corrupt others. And as a little fire conſumeth a great wood, ſo this little member, which is a fire, yea a world of iniquitie, defileth all the bodie, and ſetteth on a flaming fire the whole world, if it be not extinguiſhed and repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It ſeemeth that nature would teach vs this by fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the toong better than any other part of the body, and by ſetting before it the bulworke of the teeth, that if it wil not obey reaſon, which being within ought to ſerue in ſteade of a bridle to ſtay it from preuenting the thought, we might reſtraine and chaſtice the impudencie thereof with blouddy biting. And becauſe we haue two eares and two eies, it ought to ſerue vs for inſtruction, that we muſt heare and ſee much more than we ſpeake. Do we not alſo ſee, that ſight and hearing go before ſpeaking, and that of neceſſitie, an infant muſt firſt vnderſtand before he can be <note place="margin">Iſocrates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed two times of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note>able to ſpeake? <hi>Iſocrates</hi> appointed onely two times to ſpeake in: the one, when the matter is neceſſarie: and the other, when a man ſpeaketh that which he knoweth. And this we may put in practice without blame in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. As touching the firſt point, it is lawfull and ſeemly for vs to ſpeake when we ſtand in need of any thing: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly when our ſpeech ſhall profit any: alſo to delight and recreate one another with pleaſant deuices, void of diſſolutenes, to mollifie and to eaſe the trauell of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or elſe to reliſh our reſt the better, and to induce vs thereby to giue glorie to God. All ſpeech not grounded vpon one of theſe three cauſes were better reſtrained than vttred. Moreouer we ought to obſerue inuiolably the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8689:80"/>
ſecond point of not ſpeaking that which we know not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in ſeeking and asking after inſtruction: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that which <hi>Apelles</hi> once ſpake to <hi>Megabyſes</hi> a great Perſian Lord, who comming into his ſhop to ſee him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled <note place="margin">Apelles ſpeech to a Perſian lord</note>ſome talke of the art of painting. So long (quoth <hi>Apelles</hi> to him) as thou wert ſilent, thou ſeemedſt to be ſome man of great account, by reaſon of thy chains, carquenets of gold and purple gowne: but now there is not the leaſt of theſe boyes that grinde oker, who doth not mocke thee, hearing thee ſpeak that which thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt not. By which ſaying we may note, that great men <note place="margin">How great men ought to ſpeake.</note>ought to weigh well, and to conſider of that which they ſpeake in publike places, and to vſe graue and ſententious words of another phraſe than that of the vulgar ſort, or elſe to hold their peace if they haue not this gift of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Or at the leaſt they are to ſpeake but little, ſeeing the verie words, geſture and countenance of a prince, are oftentimes taken for lawes, oracles, and decrees. <hi>Tiberius</hi> alſo brought vp this cuſtome of ſpeaking to the prince by writing, and of his anſwere by the ſame, to the ende that nothing ſhould eſcape his mouth that was not well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of before. But to continue our matter, as the aboue named painter had ſet foorth a table of his owne for all men to behold, and had hid himſelfe behinde it, that he might heare what could be reprehended, a ſhooemaker eſpied a fault in the faſhion of the latchet, which <hi>Apelles</hi> afterward corrected. And hauing the next morning hung <note place="margin">Apelles ſpeech to a ſhoomaker.</note>it out again to be viewed, this ſhooemaker paſſing by, and ſeeing that his opinion was followed, entred further to ſpeake againſt other lineaments. But the painter not able to beare his boldnes came from behinde his table and ſtopped his mouth with this ſaying, <hi>That a ſhoomaker ought not to iudge of greater matters than of the ſhoo.</hi> This is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that common prouerbe, to go about to teach <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerua:</hi> which is ſo intollerable a thing in men of honor, and ſo pernitious in the ſimpler ſort that are light of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, <note place="margin">Alexander gaue money to a poet to hold his peace.</note>that for this cauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> the great gaue money to <hi>Cherillus</hi> an ignorant poet to holde his peace and to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8689:81"/>
leaue writing. And ſeeing we are entred into this matter, we muſt know that we ought to be much more ſtaied and <note place="margin">Nothing ought to be written without great deliberation.</note>aduiſed in writing any thing, than in bare ſpeaking: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a raſh and inconſiderate worde may be corrected preſently, but that which is once ſet down in writing can no more be denied, or amended but with infamy. As ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man had need of a readie and quicke wit to be able to ſpeake wel: ſo great wiſedom is very neceſſarie to write well: yea the ſame rules and precepts that belong to ſpeaking, agree alſo to writing. Beſides, writing is called of many, a dumb ſpeech, which ought to be ſhort and full of inſtruction. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in a letter which he ſent to Rome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <note place="margin">Notable and pithy letters of ancient men.</note>the Perſian battaile wrote but theſe three words, <hi>Veni, vidi, vici,</hi> that is to ſaie, <hi>I came, ſawe, and ouercame. Octanian</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his nephew <hi>Cains Druſus,</hi> ſaid thus: For aſmuch as thou art nowe in Illyria remember that thou deſeendeſt of <hi>Caſars,</hi> that the Senate hath ſent thee, that thou art yoong, my nephewe and a citizen of Rome. <hi>Plato</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the yoonger, vſed theſe words onely: To kill thy brother, to double thy tributes, to force the people, to forget thy friends, to take good men for thine enimies, are the works of a tyrant. <hi>Pompey</hi> writing to the Senate from the eaſt parts, ſaide thus: Fathers of the Senate, Damaſcus is taken, Pentapolis ſubdued, Syria, Aſcalonia and Arabia are confederates, and Paleſtina is vanquiſhed. We ſee then the maner of writing vſed by the ancients, for which breuitie they were as much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as the great diſcourſers of theſe tiems after inſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of correction. But to returne againe into the path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſpeaking, we haue in <hi>Cicero</hi> a notable inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">A good precept for ſpeaking.</note>for this matter. Let our ſpeech (ſaith he) be ſweet and pleaſant, not headſtrong: and when we diſcourſe, let vs not be ſo long that we hinder others from ſpeaking. For ſpeech of all other things ought to be mutuall and equall. Moreouer we muſt haue reſpect to that thing whereof we ſpeake. If a man diſcourſe of graue matters he muſt adde a certaine ſeueritie, but if he ſpeake of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable things, a pleaſant and gratious behauior. Aboue
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8689:81"/>
all things we muſt take heede, that our ſpeech diſcouer not ſome vice to be in our manners, which commonly falleth out when we ſpeake euill of a man in his abſence, either to mooue laughter or to his ſhame and reproch. We muſt alſo remember, if our ſpeech vpon ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comming betweene intermit the firſt diſcourſe, that it returne againe in conuenient time. But that is as thinges fall out. For all take not pleaſure in the ſame things, nor at all times. And as we haue begun vpon ſome occaſion, ſo we muſt end by ſome meanes. Now bicauſe in euery action of our life, the perturbations of the ſoule are to be eſchewed, we muſt be carefull that our ſpeech be voide thereof: namely, that it be without choler, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame affections, alſo without careleſnes, and other ſuch like imperfection. Eſpecially we muſt ſtriue to make it knowne, that we loue &amp; reuerence thoſe with whom we ſpeake. Further we muſt know that ſilence in due time <note place="margin">The praiſe of ſilence.</note>and place, is profound wiſedome, a ſober and modeſt thing, and full of deepe ſecrets. This cauſed <hi>Archidamus,</hi> when he ſaw that <hi>Hecatus</hi> the orator was blamed for not ſpeaking one worde at a banquet, to anſwere for him, that they which knowe how to ſpeake well, know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the time of ſilence. <hi>Hyperides</hi> likewiſe being at a feaſt <note place="margin">Hyperides.</note>amongſt a great aſſemblie, verie full of noiſe &amp; pleaſure, and being asked why he ſpake nothing, anſwered thus: It is no time now to diſcourſe of thoſe things for which I am fit: and as for thoſe things, which the time nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, I am vnfit. <hi>Bias</hi> being mocked of a babler bicauſe he ſpake nothing all a ſupper while, anſwered him thus: How is it poſſible that a foole ſhould holde his peace at the table? The ambaſſadours of the king of Perſia being at a feaſt with a citizen of Athens, and ſeeing Zeno the great philoſopher ſay nothing, they began to flatter him, and to drinke to him, ſaying, what ſhall we tell the king our maſter concerning you, maſter Zeno? Nothing elſe (quoth he) but that you ſaw an olde man, who knew wel how to holde his peace at the table. And truly no ſpeech vttred did euer ſo much good, as many kept in haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8689:82"/>
and that which is reſtrained may be ſpoken at any time, but a worde giuen out can no more be called backe againe. For words (as the poet ſaith) haue wings, and are preſently diſperſed euery where: and manie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that they haue ſpoken, but neuer that they held their peace. How many examples do hiſtories ſet before our <note place="margin">Examples of miſchiefes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancie of the toong.</note>eies of men, who through the intemperancie of their toongs, haue throwne themſelues headlong into infinite calamities, &amp; of mightie cities and great eſtates deſtroied and ouerthrowne through the diſcloſing of ſome ſecret? The citie of Athens was taken and deſtroied by <hi>Sylla</hi> the Romane dictatour, who by his ſpies was admoniſhed of the pratling of certaine old men in a barbars ſhop, where they talked of a certaine place of the town that was weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and woorſt defended. The ouermuch talke of one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man was the cauſe that Rome was not deliuered from the tiranny of <hi>Nero.</hi> For ſeeing one of the priſoners that was taken by the tirant to be diſmaid bicauſe he ſhuld be put to death, he willed him to pray to God, that he might eſcape but vntil the morrow onely, &amp; then he ſhould haue cauſe of reioicing. Wherupon the priſoner thinking with himſelfe, that it were better for him to chuſe a certaintie than to expect an vncortainty, and to prefer a ſafe way to ſaue his life, before a iuſt, diſcloſed this ſpeech to <hi>Nero,</hi> who knew wel how to remedy the conſpiracy. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Normandy who in his confeſſion told a Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can frier, that he was once minded to haue killed king <hi>Fraunces</hi> the firſt, may wel be placed amongſt theſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſpeakers. For the king being aduertiſed hereof by the Franciſcan frier, ſent the poore penitentiarie to the court of parliament, where he receiued ſentence of death. Thoſe that are nobly &amp; roially brought vp (ſaith <hi>Plutark)</hi> learne firſt to hold their peace, &amp; then to ſpeake. Therfore <hi>Antigonus</hi> the great being demanded by his ſon, at what houre the campe ſhould diſlodge: art thou afraid (quoth he to him) that thou alone ſhalt not heare the trumpet? <note place="margin">Of concealing a ſecret.</note>He truſted not him with a ſecret matter, to whom the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the empire was to come: teaching him thereby
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8689:82"/>
to be more cloſe and ſecret in ſuch matters. Euerie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer man likewiſe ought to be no leſſe aduiſed in vſing great diſcretion when the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of vttring any thing, which a man would haue concealed. For he (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> to whom one diſcloſeth a ſecret getteth the others libertie. Now in this laudable ſilence which we commend here, we haue this to marke wel, that when the queſtion is of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a truth, or of profiting another, we ought not to doubt in any caſe, what pretence ſoeuer there be, to ſpeak vtter, maintaine &amp; freely to giue counſaile in that thing, which concerneth the dutie of a good man, or the charge wherunto we are called. The ſages &amp; vertuous men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore haue alwaies ſhewed themſelues to be ſuch in their free counſailes &amp; wiſe declarations, as hereafter we may handle more largly. In the meane time we may haue here <hi>Demaratus</hi> for an example of this commendable libertie <note place="margin">Examples of the commendable freedome of ſpeech.</note>of ſpeech, who comming from Corinth into Macedonia, when <hi>Phillip</hi> was at variance with his wife &amp; with his ſon, was demanded by the king whether the Graecians did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree wel among themſelues. Truly ſir (quoth he to him) it becommeth you wel to inquire after the concord of the Athenians &amp; Peloponeſians, &amp; in the meane while to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your owne houſe to be ful of diuiſion and domeſticall diſcord. <hi>Diogenes</hi> alſo being gon to the camp of the ſame <hi>Phillip,</hi> at the ſame time that he returned from making war againſt the Grecians, &amp; being led before him, the king aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him if he were not a ſpy.

vs learne then by your preſent diſcourſe, that talke being the meſſenger of thought diſcloſeth our maners a great deal more than the lines &amp; draughts of our face do.

                  <p>Rare things are commonly moſt eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amongſt men, &amp; the more pretious they are of their owne nature, ſo much the more are they had in requeſt. This we may very aptly apply to a friend, ſeeing there is <note place="margin">Nothing more rare or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than a friend.</note>nothing ſo rare as one that is vnfained and ſtedfaſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing ſo excellent and perfect as he is, if he be a good and prudent man. And for this cauſe the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers accounted friendſhip to be the chiefeſt and moſt excellent good of fortune, as being leaſt of all ſubiect to hir, and moſt neceſſarie for man. But bicauſe the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men is ſo great in theſe daies, that nothing is ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and holy which is not violated, corrupted &amp; brought to confuſion, no maruell if men impudently abuſe this name of a friend (ſo much reuerenced in olde time) that ſome take it to themſelues being altogither vnwoorthie thereof, and others as freely, although to their loſſe and ſhame, grant them this excellent title, and eſteeme them for ſuch in truth towards them, as they falſely vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be. But that we be not deceiued with the greater
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8689:84"/>
number, which is not alwaies the ſureſt marke, let vs brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider what friendſhip is, what fruits ſpring from hir, who may rightly challenge this title of a friend, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of one we ought to chooſe, how we muſt trie him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we take him for ſuch a one, then the meanes whereby to keepe him, and laſtly what mutuall dutie friends are to vſe one towards another. Firſt we ſay with <hi>Socrates,</hi> that <note place="margin">The principall cauſe and end of all true friendſhip.</note>true friendſhip cannot be framed but by the helpe and grace of God, who draweth like to the loue of his like: that euerie perfect friendſhip is to bee linked with the bond of charitie, and ought to be referred to God, as to our ſoueraigne good and cheefeſt friend: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that true friendſhip cannot be ſetled betweene the wicked, who being at diſcord within themſelues, can haue no concorde and agreement one with another. Moreouer, there is to be found in friendſhip whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer men thinke woorthie to be deſired, as honeſtie, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, tranquillitie of minde, and pleaſure: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a happie life, which cannot bee amongſt the <note place="margin">What friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is.</note>wicked. Friendſhip is a communion of a perpetuall will, the end whereof is fellowſhip of life, and it is framed by the perfect habit of a long continued loue. Whereby wee may perceiue, that there is a difference betwixt <note place="margin">The difference betwixt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and loue.</note>loue and friendſhip: bicauſe loue is a deſire of the thing loued, and a beginning of friendſhip, but friendſhip is an inueterate and ancient loue, wherein is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than deſire. To loue (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is nothing elſe but to be deſirous to profit and pleaſure another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of recompence. For otherwiſe friendſhip would bee a meere merchandiſe, whereas it ought to be as free as charitie. <hi>Socrates</hi> alſo ſaid, that the end of friendſhip was, that of two ſoules one ſhould be made in will and affection, and that none ſhould loue himſelfe better than his friend. For there is a meane to be kept in all things, except in conuerſing with a friend, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of whom this ought to be reſolued vpon, that he is either wholie to be forſaken, or wholie to be truſted. What ſhall I hide from my friend (ſaith <hi>Homer)</hi> or what
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8689:84"/>
letteth why I may not thinke my ſelfe alone when I am with him? Whereby it appeereth vnto vs, that a friend is a ſecond ſelfe, and that whoſoeuer would take vpon him <note place="margin">What things are requiſite in friendſhip.</note>this title in regard of another, he muſt transforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into his nature whom he purpoſeth to loue, and that with a ſtedfaſt and ſetled mind to continue ſo for euer. Heereupon one of the ancients ſpeaking of him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth perfectly, ſaith, that he liueth in another mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Friends therefore ought of neceſſitie to haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction and conformitie of maners, of deſires, of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of ſpeech, of ſtudies, of pleaſures, of inclinations, of intermiſſions, if they mind to profeſſe perfect friendſhip. Whereby we may eaſily gheſſe, that he which entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many friends, depriueth himſelfe of the name of a true and ſtedfaſt friend, bicauſe it is altogither vnpoſſible for a man to faſhion himſelfe to all patterns, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelfe to all natures, ſo diuers in euery one: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that he ſhall very hardly find himſelfe like affected in all things to one alone. Now after we haue found ſuch a diſpoſition and conformitie in him that offereth himſelfe to bee our friend, wee muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter further into the knowledge of him, by ſounding out the depth of his hart, that wee may be certaine and ſure of his good diſpoſition. For to ſee outwardly a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of our maners and conditions in another, is not ſufficient to prooue them ſuch in deede without diſſimulation, vnleſſe they bee grounded vpon a good and vertuous nature, which is ſimple, vpright, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained. For otherwiſe we ſee that many (like to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> taking diuers ſhapes) are ſo ſubtill, that when they would currie fauour with any man to deceiue him, they diſguiſe themſelues, and for a while applie themſelues to all his humors. This is practiſed chiefly by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers <note place="margin">The common practiſe of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers.</note>towards great men, who will counterfait rather than they will not imitate the naturall vice of the prince: ſo that as ſoone as euer they ſee him laugh, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelues to laughing, albeit they know not wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And namely wee reade that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8689:85"/>
and <hi>Alphonſus</hi> king of Arragon, hauing ech of them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a wry necke, this by nature, the other through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, the flatterers and courtiers held their necks on the <note place="margin">What maner of man we muſt chooſe for our friend.</note>one ſide, to counterfeit their imperfection. To the ende therefore that the ſugred poiſon of ſuch fained friends deceiue vs not, we muſt make choiſe of an honeſt, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent &amp; wiſe man for our friend, whoſe fidelitie (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) integritie, conſtancie and liberalitie are approoued of euerie one, and whom we ſhall perceiue to be led and poſſeſſed with the ſame zeale to vertue that our ſelues are, to the ende we may be aided and furthered by them in all good and laudable actions. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) friendſhip is giuen by nature for a helpe to vertue, not for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of vices. To this effect <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſaith, that it is not good to ioyne hands with euery one. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> alſo would giue vs to vnderſtand the ſame when he ſaith, that we muſt make all men our well willers if it be poſſible, but onely good men our friends, who are not obtained but after a long time, and that by vertue. And as when we paſſe by a bramble or a burre that taketh hold of vs, we caſt it farre from vs, but contrariwiſe ſeeke for the oliue and the grape: ſo we ought to ſeeke after their friendſhip, that deſerue it, whoſe minds haue ſufficient matter in them to cauſe them to be loued, but to forſake, yea to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect ſuch as are vnwoorthy, and vicious, ſenſuall and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordred, although they fawne vpon vs: bicauſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation marreth and corrupteth euery good nature. Therefore <hi>Bias</hi> ſaid verie well, that a wiſeman receiueth not euerie one vnto his friendſhip. Hauing thus choſen him whom we deſire to entertaine for our friend, &amp; laid the chiefe foundations of friendſhip vpon his agreement of manners with vs, and vpon his good diſpoſition (which we may know by familiar conuerſation with him, and by diligent inquirie) before wee can aſſure our ſelues or boaſt that we haue a true friend, we muſt prooue his ſtedfaſtnes and conſtancie, and not truſt to offers and promiſes, whereof men are verie prodigall now a daies. But this is cleane contrarie to the dutie of a true friend,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8689:85"/>
whoſe propertie is to be ſparing in ſpeech, and prodigall in deedes, bicauſe great proffers are meete to be vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtrangers, and good deeds towards true friends. Now to proue a friend, we muſt not ſtay vntill need and neceſſitie vrge vs, leaſt ſuch triall be not onely vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and without fruit, but alſo very hurtfull and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vnto vs, bicauſe at ſuch a time as neceſſarily requireth friends, we make trial of him, who in truth is no ſuch man. <note place="margin">How we muſt prooue a friend.</note>But we are rather to gouerne our ſelues with prudence and foreſight, as we vſe to do in the receipt of gold and ſiluer. For before we haue need to imploy it, we conſider whether it be currant, that we may be ſure it will ſerue the turne when neceſſitie requireth. To this purpoſe <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> ſaid, that we ought to prooue ſtrangers to loue them, and not loue them to prooue them. Therefore albeit the true and right triall of a friend is in aduerſitie, as of fine gold in a fornace, yet that is to be vnderſtood of him, who is ſuch a one indeede. For if we ſhould expect the firſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vpon our ſelues in time of certaine danger, thereby to be aſſured and out of doubt, if then he ſhould faile vs it would bring vs in great perill: ſo that we were better to trie him when we ſtand not in need, requeſting him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as if we were vrged, and ſtood in need of his helpe and aſſiſtance in a matter of importance. If then he go forward with a ſound zeale and readie affection, we are aſſured of him againſt another time. But if he ſtagger, and do it coldly, or turne away his face &amp; refuſe it, beſides that we haue no hurt or hinderance, we ſhall alſo gaine much by withdrawing ſuch a friend gently, and by little &amp; little <note place="margin">How we muſt ſhake off a falſe friend.</note>from our table, and from our proſperitie: alwaies wiſely obſeruing that this friendſhip be ſimplie forſaken, and no enmitie vndertaken. For it is not good or ſeemly to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with him, with whom we haue liued familiarly. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, we muſt note heere, that triall is to be made in an honeſt, not in a wicked matter. For we muſt not do, as we read that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> did, who, being deſirous to knowe whether he had ſo many friends as he thought he had, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">How Alcibiades tried his friends.</note>them vpon a day one after another into a darke place,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8689:86"/>
and ſhewed vnto them an image of a dead bodie, ſaying, that it was a man whom he had killed, and requeſting them to helpe to carie it away. But amongſt them all he found none except <hi>Callias</hi> that would harken thereunto. This kind of proouing a friend maketh vs vnwoorthie of ſuch a name, and occaſioneth euery good man to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe from our friendſhip. If we do all things (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> both good and bad for our friends, ſuch friendſhip may more truly be called a conſpiracie of euill men, than a confederacie of good men. But, as we haue ſaid, we muſt gaine another mans friendſhip by vertue, and not by vice, as alſo trie a friend in iuſt and reaſonable cauſes: as if we be oppreſſed vniuſtly, if affliction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie follow hard at our heeles, if need or any other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne accident betide vs, into which the beſt men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <note place="margin">The meanes to keepe a friend.</note>fall. After we are ſure that we haue a friend (which truly is very great riches) there is nothing that we ought to deſire more than to preſerue and keepe him. And firſt the mutuall opinion, which ought to be in euerie friend of the vertue of his companion ſerueth very much for this matter. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, The opinion of vertue is the fountaine of friendſhip, and it is proper to vertue to win mens harts, to draw them vnto it ſelfe, and to preſerue their friendſhip. Next, the coniunction of maners and wils keepeth backe all riot and contentions, when as the will and mind of the one ſhall no ſooner be declared, but the other preſently putteth to his helping hand to bring it to paſſe. Thirdly, we are to obſerue this firſt law of friendſhip inuiolably, not to require our friend to do any thing that is not iuſt, or not in his power to performe, but to content our ſelues with the vſe and ſeruice of that which he hath, without further ſeeking his hinderance, after the example of the induſtrious and painfull bee, which draweth honie out of flowers, and hurteth not the fruit. Aboue all things we muſt hold this for a generall rule, which we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die touched, that true and perfect friendſhip ought to be <note place="margin">Friendſhip muſt be free.</note>free, as charitie is, from whence ſhe hath hir beginning: I meane, that it ought to exerciſe it ſelfe not for hire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8689:86"/>
but onely for his loue, who is beloued of vs. For the one is proper to a friend, the other ſauoreth of a hireling. True it is that friends in theſe daies are like to crowes, which fly not but towards thoſe places where there is ſome thing to feed vpon: euen ſo they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſit not mens houſes except it be for profit, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence a friend longer than they ſee him in proſperitie, or may reape ſome commoditie by him. But we muſt ſhun ſuch paraſites, who are but ſaluting and table friends. Moreouer, we muſt reioice and delight in the companie and conuerſation of our friend, as in that wherein the ſweeteſt and moſt pleaſant fruit of friendſhip conſiſteth. And for want of this benefit, friends muſt often commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate togither by letters, thereby to ſhew that they liue in remembrance one of another. For by the letter of a true friend the ſpirit is refreſhed, the eies delighted, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip confirmed, and the mind contented. Beſides we muſt haue our vertues, ſpirits, proſperitie, yea acquaintance, and all common togither, and nothing ſecret or hidden. Laſtly we muſt yeeld to our friend all duties and ſeruices of ſincere friendſhip, and that in all honeſt and profitable things according to right &amp; iuſtice, which are the bounds and limits of an holie loue, deſiring the like of him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. Aboue all things his affliction or aduerſitie, and all iniurie offered him, ought to be common to vs with him, wherein we are to aſſiſt and helpe him with all ſuccor and ſweet conſolation, which is as ſouereigne and fit a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie as can be applied vnto him, eſpecially when good doctrine is ioined with our ſpeech. Heerof <hi>Phalereus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <note place="margin">Phalereus.</note>very well that he had good experience when he was baniſhed from his kingdome, ſaying that his meeting with <hi>Crates</hi> the wiſe man had taken from him all care and thought of his miſerie. And if friendſhip can greatly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the greefe that commeth by aduerſitie, no doubt but it can adde as much grace and pleaſure to proſperitie. We may effect all dutie whatſoeuer we owe to our friend, by <note place="margin">How many waies we owe dutie to our friend.</note>ſuccouring him with fower things: namely, with our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with our goods, with comfort, and with counſell.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8689:87"/>
Which we may alſo comprehend vnder theſe two duties, of releeuing the neceſſitie of our friend, and of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in his tribulation. Now bicauſe, what perfection ſoeuer is in our friend, as likewiſe in our ſelues, it cannot be but there will be alwaies ſome imperfection mingled therewith (mens doings being neuer without ſome euill) we muſt not preſume to be able to build ſuch a perfect friendſhip as ſhall be void and free of all vice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">How we muſt beare with the imperfections of our friend.</note>we muſt gently ſupport and beare with all wants and diſcommodities of our friend, and oftentimes frame our ſelues to many paſſions, ſo they be not directly contrarie to vertue, but ſuch as proceed from the imbecillitie and frailtie of nature common with vs. Neuertheles againſt ſuch imperfections we muſt in time conuenient and to purpoſe, vſe free and gentle admonitions, which are ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in friendſhip, and worthie of ſuch conſideration, that in my opinion we ſhall do well to make a ſeuerall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thereof. Now if it come ſo to paſſe, that ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure or iar happen betweene vs, then is the time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ought moſt of all to ſtudie and labour how we may do ſome profitable or honorable thing to our friend: and not harken to ſlanderous toongs, which watch for ſome ſmall and light occaſion to powre out the poiſon of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, thereby to rent and breake a ſunder our good and ſure friendſhip. To ſuch paraſites, and ſcrap-gatherers at free-coſt feaſts, who ſeeke for nothing but their own gain by the diſagreement of others, we muſt neuer giue eare, but driue them as far from vs, as they thinke to come neer vs. And to the end we may be the better affected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed heerunto, we muſt often call to remembrance, what benefit and happines commeth to ſuch men as are linked togither by true and vnfained friendſhip: as namely, in thoſe affaires at which we cannot be preſent our ſelues, the fidelitie of a friend ſupplieth our place. From whence we will draw this concluſion, that he which violateth friendſhip, ſetteth himſelfe againſt the common ſuccour and aide of all men, and as much as in him lieth, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth humane ſocietie. For we cannot do all things
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8689:87"/>
our ſelues, and therefore friendſhips are ioined togither, that by mutuall duties one may profit another. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that all the aboue named things are both neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and alſo very hard and difficult to be obſerued and kept in true friendſhip, a man may eaſily iudge that this ſo excellent a ſympathie and fellow feeling of two friends is very rare, and not eaſily found: and by a more forcible reaſon it followeth, that it is altogither impoſſible that <note place="margin">Againſt the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of friends.</note>many ſuch friends ſhould be linked togither. So that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer goeth about any ſuch matter can neuer attaine to a certaine and durable friendſhip. For it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he which beginneth new friendſhip cannot but diminiſh and waxe faint in affection in regard of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friendſhip, wherein he was in a maner ſetled. Yea, how can he obſerue all dutifull points of a ſtedfaſt friend, as well in mutuall conuerſation and communication of all things, as in helping his friend in all his affaires, if he haue many friends to looke vnto, who may all ſtand in neede of him at one and the ſame time? It is certaine that in ſeruing one he would be wanting to the other, and peraduenture to both, whilſt he doubteth which to helpe firſt. But there is yet a further matter in it. Do we not take him for our enimie, who is enimie to our friend? It is moſt certainly ſo: as the wiſe man <hi>Chilon</hi> very fitly ſignified ſo much to one who boaſted, that he had neuer a fo. Then haſt thou neuer a friend, quoth <hi>Chilon,</hi> ſeeing it is <note place="margin">He that hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a fo, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a friend.</note>impoſſible, by reaſon of the wickednes of men, that two perſons ſhould liue in the world without enimies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith, If thou ſeekeſt for a ſwarme of friends thou conſidereſt not that thou falleſt into a waſps neaſt of enimies. Heereof it is that hiſtories, when they ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs examples of true and excellent friendſhip make <note place="margin">The beſt and moſt excellent friendſhip is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>mention onely of two perſons: as of <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> whoſe friendſhip could not be hindered by the wrath of the father of the one, no not although he knew, that his friend ſhould raigne ouer him, notwithſtanding he were by inheritance to ſucceed next in the kingdome. So we read of one <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus,</hi> of whom the one falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8689:88"/>
his oth, which was that he would neuer fight, to the end he might reuenge the death of the other. There was but one <hi>Orestes</hi> and <hi>Pylades,</hi> both of them calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by the name of <hi>Orestes</hi> who was condemned to die, thereby to ſaue the life of his companion. Neither was there any mo than one <hi>Ephenus</hi> and <hi>Eueritus,</hi> and one <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> two of which being condemned to die by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the tyrant of Siracuſa, had their pardon granted them by reaſon of the conſtancie and ſtabilitie of the friendſhip that was between them and their companions, whereof they ſhewed this proofe. The two condemned perſons beſought <hi>Dionyſius</hi> to licence them to go vnto their countrie, that they might take ſome order for their houſhold affaires before they died. The tyrant ſcorning at this, asked them what pledges they would pawne for their returne. Whereupon the two other friends willingly offered themſelues for pledges, and ſo ſix moneths ſpace being granted, they were ſet at libertie. When the end of this time drew nie, many mocked theſe poore cautions: but they nothing aſtoniſhed made anſwer, that they were certaine and ſure their friends would not in any caſe faile of their promiſe. And indeede they arriued the laſt day that was granted vnto them. Whereat the tyrant wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, forgaue the condemned parties, and praied them to receiue him for a third man into their friendſhip. So great force had vertue, that it could pacifie choler and crueltie in his hart, whoſe vertue conſiſted in nothing elſe but in <note place="margin">Piſistratus letter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We read of a letter written by <hi>Piſistratus,</hi> prince of the Athenians, ſeruing for a notable example of the force of friendſhip, which oftentimes is greater than all conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie.

a traitor towards me, which I would neuer haue ſuſpected, conſidering that I neuer deſerued any ſuch thing at thy hands. And therefore I would gladly I had ſo much authoritie ouer my ſelfe, that as I can ſhake off this alliance, ſo I could alſo falſifie our friendſhip, which I can neither do, nor determine of, my fidelitie ſaued. For the conſanguinitie that I haue with thee may be ſeparated, as being within the veines: but the loue I beare thee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, ſeeing it is within my hart. A thouſand other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of couples ioined in friendſhip are to be found in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſtories. In the meane while we haue to note, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we meaſure friendſhip heere by the number of two, yet our meaning is not to exclude others altogither. For we know, that true charitie extendeth it ſelfe vnto euery one, that we are bound to loue euen our enimies, and to do good to all, but yet amongſt all we may chooſe one onely friend to loue, and to be loued againe of him in perfection. Neuertheles we muſt labour by a thouſand good duties to get the good will of all men, and in what place ſoeuer we be to follow the wiſe counſell of <hi>Polybius</hi> giuen to <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> that he ſhould neuer depart from the publike place of authoritie before he had gotten vnto himſelfe ſome new friend and well willer. This belongeth to them eſpecially that haue wealth at wil, and are in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like offices, and fauored of the mightier ſort: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſo much the more bound thereunto, as alſo to take delight in doing good to manie, not ſparing any of their ſubſtance. We haue famous examples heereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ancients. That great Romane captaine and Conſul <hi>Titus Flaminius,</hi> who deliuered and freed all Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia <note place="margin">Titus Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note>from bondage, and twiſe in battell ranged diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedonia, is exceedingly commended of hiſtoriographers, not onely bicauſe he was readie to pleaſure euerie one, but alſo bicauſe he tooke ſuch delight therein, that he would alwaies remaine well affected euen to thoſe whom he had once pleaſured, as if himſelfe had receiued the benefit: inſomuch that he was alwaies ready to do them more good. Wherby he ſhewed himſelfe truly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8689:89"/>
zealous of vertue, which is neuer ſet on work for the hope of any earthly recompence, ſeeing the price and reward of a vertuous deed ought onely to be the doing thereof. Therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid very well, that no Commonwealth can either with too little, or too late recompence hir na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countriman. Now to conclude our preſent diſcourſe, we ſay, that friendſhip is ſo excellent a thing, that there is no compariſon betweene it and any other worldly good: that it is vertue, which frameth and vniteth togither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect friendſhips, and that if they be once forſaken, they cannot longer continue. Therefore honeſtie (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) is to be placed aboue friendſhip and profit, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, iuſtice, and fidelitie are to be preferred before the vniuſt requeſts of our friends, howſoeuer they might be profitable for this life, either to them or to our ſelues. We ſay, that whileſt we labour to make all men our well-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers by doing them good, according to the duty of a good nature, if we meete with one ſure and certaine friend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, we haue gotten a great and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Nothing better than to liue with a vertuous man.</note>treaſure: ſeeing there is nothing more fit for life, or more commodius for a good and happie life, than to liue with a vertuous man and our friend, whoſe fidelitie, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, and conſtancie are ruled by charitie. Laſtly we ſay, <note place="margin">Three things neceſſarie in friendſhip.</note>that three things are very requiſite and neceſſarie for the foundation and aſſurance of this friendſhip: namely, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as that which is honeſt: <hi>Conuerſation,</hi> as pleaſant and agreeable: <hi>Profit,</hi> as helpfull. Which is as much to ſay, as, that we muſt receiue a friend after we haue knowen and prooued him, that we muſt reioice in his companie, and vſe him in our need, as we deſire him to do the like by vs. So that he which can boaſt of ſuch a friend is very happie.</p>

But man hauing pride and preſumption naturally rooted in his ſoule, howſoeuer he ſeeth a mote in his brothers eie, yet he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth not the great beame that cloſeth vp his owne eies. This maketh him bold (as it is the propertie of vice to be headſtrong) to defend and maintaine, that he hath alwaies done well, and not eaſily to harken to his reaſons
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8689:90"/>
that reprooueth him, were it not that the mightie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable bond of friendſhip, as of a ſecond-ſelfe did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him to lend his eare to his friend through the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which he hath conceiued of him and his vertue. True it is, that if there were amongſt vs ſuch a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life and maners, and that loue ioined with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <note place="margin">A notable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians.</note>might take place now, as it did long ſince amongſt the Lacedemonians, (who obſerued this cuſtome inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to puniſh him that did not reprooue anothers fault committed in his preſence, with the ſame puniſhment which was inflicted vpon the offender himſelfe, &amp; ſharply to chaſtice him that reſiſted, or was angry at the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) we ſhould not ſee ſo great winking at vices and imperfections, nor ſuch impudent reſiſting and ſhameles contempt of all good admonition as raigneth now a dais amongſt vs, who vnskilfully terme this friendſhip, not to correct one another, but rather to couer &amp; to winke at all faults. But ſeeing our age is ſo greatly corrupted, we may eaſily know what a pretious and neceſſarie thing it is, to haue found a prudent and wiſe friend, who knoweth how to vſe wholeſome and ſharpe reprehenſion, as a preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue medicine, that ſaueth the patients life, being mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in conuenient time, and to purpoſe. Which thing if it be not wiſely obſerued herein (as in all other things) it greatly hurteth, and depriueth the admonition of profite and efficacie. Therefore a friend being oppoſite to a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, who ſtudieth for nothing but to pleaſe, to do and to ſpeake to his liking whom he flattereth (which is enough to ouerthrow friendſhip, whoſe ſtrength is onely in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) <note place="margin">A friend compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a muſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>ought to deal as a skilful muſitian, who in the tuning of his inſtrument ſetteth vp ſom of his ſtrings, and letteth downe others. So a prudent friend yeeldeth vnto ſome things, but refuſeth and contrarieth others, changing his minde as honeſtie and profit require. He is not afraide ſometime to make his friend ſad with intent and purpoſe to profit him, not to breake friendſhip. Likewiſe he is not greatly to care although he ſee his friend angred, ſo that he be bettred, conſidering that anger may better be tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8689:90"/>
than vice. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> king of Sparta ſaid, that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Ageſilaus.</note>well to be praiſed of ſuch friends as would not ſpare him at all, but were ready to blame him alſo whenſoeuer he gaue them occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo to do. To this effect <hi>Epictetus</hi> ſaid, that as a woolfe in ſome ſort reſembled a dog, ſo a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer was like a friend: and therefore that we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, leaſt in ſtead of good dogs for ſafegard, we receiue vnto vs moſt pernitious &amp; hurtfull woolues. For it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as <hi>Antisthenes</hi> ſaid) to ſtand at the curteſie of crowes than of flatterers, ſeeing the one deuoure dead carkaſſes, and the other liuing men. Now let vs conſider of the meanes how to vſe aptly and to purpoſe this ſo healthfull medicine in friendſhip, I meane reprehenſion and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. Sometimes it is neceſſarie (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> for vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke <note place="margin">How we muſt vſe reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>our friends, wherein we are to vſe a more auſtere countenance and vehement ſpeech: but too great ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ouermuch ſadnes ought to be far from vs. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though grauitie be a vertue, yet friendſhip is more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, free and pleaſant. We muſt alſo take heed that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere not we be in choler, but rather that we com againſt our wils to do this dutie, as ſurgeons do to cut off and to burne, and that very rarely, when there is no way to finde or vſe any other receit. Moreouer if one behold his friend in ſome great affliction, knowing it to be the nature of aduerſitie to make men of troubled &amp; vexed ſpirits, ſoone cholerike and vnwilling to heare, and at ſuch a time to be offended at good and true ſpeeches (euen as honie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſweet, yet breedeth greefe when it is applied to vlcers) I ſay a friend well aduiſed ought then to beware that he vſe no ſharp or biting words, which are apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him to anger, that is preſſed with aduerſitie. And this did <hi>Pythagoras</hi> meane to teach vs learnedly by that enigmaticall precept or riddle, which forbiddeth vs to <hi>Stirre vp the fire with a ſword.</hi> A man ought rather in ſuch a caſe to miniſter ſome ſuch ſweet and gratious ſpeech of comfort, as yeeldeth and giueth place a little to the iuſt greefe of his friend, and from whence he may draw ſome eaſe of his euill, whether it be in talking thereof togither
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8689:91"/>
with him, or otherwiſe in lamenting the ſame. And this muſt be done before any mention be made of a remedie, or any other conuenient matter of talking with him be ſought after. In this ſort for a man to comfort himſelfe is no leſſe difficult a matter (as <hi>Thales</hi> ſaid) than it is for a phiſition to cure himſelfe. Aboue all things we muſt be verie circumſpect when we ſee our friend lately angred by reaſon of ſome pregnant and notable iniurie or wrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from another. For then in ſteade of being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with him preſently to forgiue the iniurie, or of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to perſwade him to thinke it a ſmall fault, thereby endeuoring at the firſt daſh to bring him to reaſon, we muſt intreat him gently to deferre the puniſhment, and after by little and little, and by degrees to pacifie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe him. For it is verie certain, that when wrath is much kindled and the hart inraged, a man cannot eaſily receiue comfort, nor ſo ſodainly conceiue and vnderſtand reaſon. And therefore <hi>Plutark</hi> amongſt other things gaue this <note place="margin">Time bringeth as many things to good order as reaſon doth.</note>counſaile to the emperor <hi>Traian</hi> to be patient towards fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious folks, conſidering that time moderateth as manie things, as reaſon doth change. Notwithſtanding when the queſtion is of reſtraining a diſordinate pleaſure, of repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing choler or peeuiſhnes that paſſeth the bounds of all reaſon, of bridling inſolencie, which is gone too farre out of ſquare, of hindring ſome notable couetouſnes, or of ſtaying ſome fooliſh motion, or ſuperfluous paſſion, then is the time wherein a prudent and good friend ought to be vehement and earneſt, and to double the ſpeech of his admonition: yea to frame himſelfe ſo, as if the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeded from himſelfe, &amp; as though his own vtter vndoing lay thereupon. In ſuch a caſe he is to follow that good Graecian captaine <hi>Phocion,</hi> who, when his friend would haue caſt away himſelfe, ſaid that he would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him, bicauſe he was made his friend for that purpoſe. Therefore whenſoeuer any ſuch occaſion is offred, a man is not to ſtay vntill the fault be committed, that he may then giue his friend ſome good inſtruction. For then it would come to late, and no leſſe vnfitly, than that Porters
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8689:91"/>
warning, who after he had hit <hi>Cato,</hi> bad him beware. What (anſwered <hi>Cato)</hi> wilt thou giue me yet another blowe? Moreouer we muſt take good heed that all reprehending of one friend by another be done (as we commonly ſaie) betweene two priuate wals, that is, ſecretly when the doore is ſhut: bicauſe the diſcouerie of any ſinne or vice (euen as of ſom foule diſeaſe) is alwaies ſhamefull. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of theſe two ſages, <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> will fitly agree to this matter. <hi>Socrates</hi> being ſomwhat more earneſt than his cuſtome was with one of his familiar friends before a great companie, <hi>Plato</hi> could not containe himſelf but ſaid vnto him: Had not this beene better ſpoken priuately apart? And had not your ſelfe (quoth <hi>Socrates)</hi> done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if you had told me priuately of this which now you vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Whereupon we may further learne this leſſon, that it is alwaies eaſie enough to reprooue another, but that al our reprehenſions are blame woorthy, if we reape not this inſtruction thereby, to correct, or to auoide the like errors in our ſelues. Thus doth the ſelfe ſame <hi>Plato</hi> teach vs ſaying, that we muſt deſcend into our inward parts, &amp; ſay euerie one with himſelfe, <hi>Am not I ſuch an one?</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">We muſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in our ſelues thoſe faults which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in others.</note>a man might truly reproch vs with that ſaying taken out of an olde Tragedie, <hi>Ech wounded wight doth ſeeke to ſalue the ſores that others haue.</hi> But as we ſee our owne eies ſhine within the apples of our neighbours eies, ſo ought we in the life of other men to lay our owne before vs, and to purge them of thoſe vices which we reprehend. For as <hi>Lyſander</hi> made this anſwere to a Megarian, who thruſt himſelfe foreward to ſpeake aloud for the liberty of Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia in a generall aſſemblie of counſell, <hi>That ſpeech my friend had need of a mightie citie:</hi> ſo may it be ſaide to euerie one that vſeth freely to reprehend others, that his maners had need to be well reformed. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid that he corrected <hi>Speuſippus</hi> by the example of his life. In like ſort, <hi>Xenocrates</hi> caſting his eie vpon <hi>Polemon,</hi> who in diſſolute <note place="margin">Sundry inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh wiſely.</note>apparell was entred into his ſchoole, changed and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all by his onely lookes.

well liked of, when we infold our ſelues in that fault, which we reprooue in others: as that wiſe man <hi>Socrates</hi> vſed to do, when he checked and taught yoong men, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that himſelfe was not deliuered from ignorance, but had need to be inſtructed with them in vertue, &amp; to ſeeke out the knowledge of the truth. For when one accuſeth himſelfe as ſubiect to the ſame faults that his friend is, &amp; proteſteth that his meaning is to correct and reprooue him, as if he were himſelfe, it cauſeth him that reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be loued and reuerenced, and procureth grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter credite to his ſayings. Let vs further obſerue this, that euerie reprehenſion betweene friend and friend ought to be pure, and voide of all priuate paſſions. Inſomuch that if we perceiue our ſelues contemned, and after a ſort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, yet muſt we teſtifie our ſincere and louing affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſpeaking freely in the behalfe of others that are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſpiſed, but not framing our talke in any ſort for our owne defence. Euerie admonition thus grounded as I haue ſaid, cannot but be profitable and well liked of our friend, as that which cauſeth the offender both to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him that gaue it, and to bluſh for ſhame, not daring once to lift vp his eies againſt it. But foraſmuch as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we hate to be reprooued and blamed, as we learned in the beginning of this diſcourſe, we muſt know that to cure ſuch a pernitious inclination, nothing can profite vs ſo much as to beleeue, that the beginning of good life is <note place="margin">Reprehenſion is the beginning of good life.</note>to be blamed and baited at. For man, by nature inclined more to vice than to vertue, can neuer hate euill before he vnderſtand what miſerie it bringeth. So that when he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth if his friend lay the infamie and ſhame of his offence before his eies, vnleſſe he be altogither paſt ſhame, and fraught with impudencie, he muſt needs giue place to the truth, which is inuincible, and ſo with ſhame not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, he is induced to reforme his life according to the patterne of comlines and honeſtie. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that we are greatly beholding to them that tell vs of our faults, and ſhew vs what way we muſt keepe: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is better for vs to amende by being corrected of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8689:92"/>
another, than to vndoo our ſelues by fooliſh perſeuerance. Moreouer as all true and perfect loue ought to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and to extend it ſelfe indifferently vnto all without exception of perſons, ſo likewiſe euerie one according to his ſeuerall place ought to admoniſh and to correct thoſe that do amiſſe as often as occaſion is offred vnto them, &amp; cheefely they that are neere to great men are bound to do it, but with diſcretion and great deliberation. Thus much did <hi>Solon</hi> ſignifie to one, who by way of admoniſhment <note place="margin">Solons good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailors to princes.</note>told him, that princes were either not to be approched vnto, or elſe to be pleaſed: Nay contrariwife (ſaid the wiſe man) either they are not to be come neere vnto, or elſe the truth is to be told them. We may obſerue infinite examples amongſt the ancients woorthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, of the great freedome, which they vſed in reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſhewing the faults not onely of their familiar friends, but generally of all others: and eſpecially of their kings, princes and magiſtrates, who bicauſe they ſee and heare for the moſt part by other mens eies &amp; eares, ought neceſſarily to haue ſuch friends, counſailors and ſeruants about them, as will freely tell them the truth, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we may diſcourſe more at large. This cauſed <hi>Plutark</hi> to <note place="margin">Philoſophers ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant with princes.</note>ſay, that a philoſopher ought cheefely to keepe companie with princes and great lords, and that it was the point of a wiſe man, and of one that is wel affected to the common wealth to be endued with common loue, and to inquire after, or to accept &amp; intertaine ſuch a friendſhip, as might be commodious and beneficiall to many in particuler, &amp; much more in generall to them all. And truely they that company with priuate men, and labor to inſtruct them, may well make them contented, milde and gratious in themſelues, and profitable to them onely: but he that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away an euill qualitie from a lord and magiſtrate, or directeth his wil and intention, as it ought to be, plaieth the part of a philoſopher in the behalfe of common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, and correcteth that mould and patterne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which all the ſubiects are framed and gouerned. This kind of free admonition <hi>Solon</hi> vſed towards <hi>Croeſus,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Solons counſell giuen to Craeſus.</note> whom he perceiued to be blowne and puft vp with pride, through an opinion of earthly and vncertaine felicity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing him to expect what the ende would be. The Gods (quoth he to him) haue giuen to vs the reſidue of the Graecians all things after a meane ſort, and namely a baſe &amp; populer wiſedome, not roiall or magnificall: which as it giueth vs to vnderſtand that the life of man is ſubiect to infinite changes, ſo it forbiddeth to truſt or glorie in the goods of this world, or to make great account of any mans felicitie, that is yet in danger of alteration.

But when the gods conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the proſperous eſtate of a man vnto the ends of his<note place="margin">Why Plato went into Sicilia to Dionyſius.</note> daies, then will we account him happie. The deſire, which <hi>Plato</hi> had to profite many cauſed him to ſaile from Graecia into Sicilia, that by graue diſcourſes &amp; wiſe inſtructions he might ſtay and contain within the bounds of reaſon the yoong yeeres of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> prince of that countrie, who through vnbrideled libertie, and power not limited, waued hither and thither without reſtraint.

But within a while after. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> giuing eare to flatterers, baniſhed <hi>Plato,</hi> to whom when he tooke his leaue of him, the tyrant ſaid, I doubt not, <hi>Plato,</hi> but thou wilt ſpeake ill of me when thou art in the Vniuerſitie amongſt thy companions &amp; friends. Whereunto the philoſopher ſmiling, and obſeruing that freedome of ſpeech, which he had alwaies vſed towards him, made this anſwer, I pray God, <hi>Sir,</hi> there may neuer be ſo great want of matter to ſpeake of in the Vniuerſitie, that we need to ſpeake of thee. He was no ſooner ſhipped from Sicilia but <hi>Dionyſius</hi> returned to his former faſhions, and called backe againe dancers, minſtrels, baudes, and ſuch like vermin, where of commonly there is want a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout great perſonages, ſo that preſently your might haue

ſeene his court, yea all the reſt of his people, ouerwhelmed in al delights and pleaſures. Such great force hath a prince to alter and change at his pleaſure the harts of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, but yet alwaies rather to vice and follie than to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And to go on with our matter of the free and bold admonition of great men, the ſelfe ſame <hi>Plato</hi> vſed it very fitly towards <hi>Dion,</hi> who had driuen <hi>Dionyſius</hi> out of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and that at ſuch time as the ſaid <hi>Dion</hi> was in the greateſt glorie of al his proſperitie. Amongſt other things<note place="margin">Arrogancie dwelleth in the end with ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines.</note> he willed him to beware of arrogancie, as of hir that dwelt with ſolitarines: that is to ſay, which in the end was forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all the world. The ſame kind of admonition <hi>Speuſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> followed, writing to the ſame <hi>Dion,</hi> willing him not to perſume or waxe proud of himſelfe, bicauſe he heard wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children vtter his praiſes and commendation,<note place="margin">Notable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell for princes.</note> but to haue regard onely to this, that <hi>Sicilia</hi> might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with religion and pietie towards God, with iuſtice and good lawes towards men, and that the Vniuerſitie might alwaies be had in honor and eſtimation. O counſel full of Chriſtian inſtruction, and woorthie to be daily ſet before the eies of Chriſtian princes, who may alſo learne of <hi>Demetrius</hi> king of Macedonia to take in good part, to<note place="margin">Demetrius.</note> reape commoditie, and to reward thoſe that reprehend and admoniſh them of their dutie. After he had taken the citie of the Athenians, who had rebelled againſt him, and ſtood in great need of victuals, he cauſed a generall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of the people to be made, wherein he declared, that he gaue them freely a great quantitie of corne. In which oration it fell out ſo, that he committed an incongruitie of ſpeech, whereat one of the inhabitants ſuddenly ſtood vp, and pronounced the word aright as he ſhould haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it. For this correction (quoth <hi>Demetrius)</hi> I giue thee beſides fiue thouſand meaſures of wheat.

For if Rome

For when <hi>Dionyſius</hi> prince of Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa ſent vnto him a tragedie of his owne making, that he ſhould read and correct it, he ſent it backe againe vnto him all raſed and blotted from the beginning to the end, bicauſe he found it in no reſpect worthie to be publiſhed. Neither doth antiquitie onely affoord vs ſuch examples of bold reprehenſion by word of mouth, vſed by wiſe men in old time, but there hath been alſo in our ages woorthie examples of baſe and contemptible men, yet full of good learning. For profe heer of may ſerue that quip, which not long ſince a peaſant gaue vnto an Archbiſhop of Cullen, who was well accompanied with armed men according to the cuſtome of Almaigne.

Neither may we omit the anſwer which a poore Franciſcan Frier made to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, who from the ſame order being come to that great dignitie, ſhewed him his great wealth and riches, ſaying, <hi>Frier,</hi> I cannot ſay as S. <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>I haue</hi>

But the ignorance of things, and imperfection of reaſon, which abounde in him, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his corruption, make him for the moſt part to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and take delight in euill rather than in goodnes, if he be not by other means called to the knowledge of the truth: which ought to be the principal and moſt woorthy obiect of our minds, eſteeming all other knowledge vaine and vnprofitable being compared to this, which is ſo great and diuine. And in this reſpect curioſitie tending to vnderſtanding, (albeit in many things it be verie hurtfull, eſpecially being left vnto it ſelfe) is alſo verie profitable and neceſſary, when it is directed and guided by the grace of God to the beſt end.

ſimplicitie and firſt modeſtie of their nature, to feed their minds with a vaine curioſitie and ſearching out of things ſupernaturall, and incomprehenſible to the ſence and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of man. Which things the more they thought to know, the greater occaſion of doubting they found in them, ſo that for all their labour and vnderſtanding they could neuer carrie away any true knowledge, or certaine reſolution.

The ill ſucceſſe of our age affoordeth vs too manie miſerable teſtimonies, wherin at this day we ſee nothing but contrarieties of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and vncertainties, through their ſubtilties &amp; bold curioſities, who haue ſought to plucke (as a man would ſay) out of heauen the ſecrets hid from the angels: yea, which is worſe, haue boaſted that they haue attained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of them, filling our times with trouble and confuſion vnder that falſe pretence. There are others alſo no leſſe hurtful, who haue binne ſuch curious Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the cauſes of all naturall things, that through fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous and vnprofitable queſtions they haue fallen into that impietie, as to ſeeke for another beginning of all things, than God. Whereupon this prouerbe, which is too true, aroſe, <hi>Of three Phyſitions one Atheist.</hi> This kinde of curioſitie, is of all others moſt pernitious. But foraſmuch as it is without the compaſſe of our Academie, we let it paſſe with this ſhort mention thereof, and with this onely addition, that God commonly puniſheth the pride of ſuch men by thoſe fruits, which we ſee them bring foorth, and by taking from them their vnderſtanding in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and moſt neceſſarie matters, wherein notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they thinke themſelues to be woonderfull and iolly fellowes aboue all others. As touching this point the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Socrates</hi> is very memorable, and to be imitated,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8689:96"/>
who being demanded what the world was, anſwered, that <note place="margin">A notable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Socrates.</note>ſince he had any iudgement he gaue himſelfe to ſeeke out the true knowledge of himſelfe, which yet he could neuer find. But ſo ſoone as he had attained thereunto, then he would ſeeke for other things that would do him no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice or pleaſure. <hi>Aristotle</hi> (as <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> writeth) who for the excellencie of his skill in naturall philoſophie was <note place="margin">The death of Ariſtotle and Plinie through too much curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie.</note>called the god of the earth, burned with ſuch a deſire of curioſitie in vnderſtanding the cauſes of naturall things, that bicauſe he could not know and conceiue the cauſe and nature of <hi>Euripus,</hi> which is in Chalcis a citie of Eubaea, I meane of the flowing &amp; ebbing of the ſea, which turneth &amp; compaſſeth about that place, nor giue a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, he died for very ſhame and greefe which he conceiued thereupon. <hi>Plinie</hi> alſo, who wrote the hiſtorie <note place="margin">The burning of Aetna.</note>of naturall philoſophie, was choked with the flames and vapors of the mountaine Mongibel in Sicilia, whileſt he ſought to find out the cauſe of them, and from whence that great fire came, which ſpoiled the countrie round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the time of <hi>Titus</hi> the emperor: inſomuch that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or eight townes were burned, and many perſons tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling by land, and ſailing on the ſea were ſtifled with the aſhes therof, caried about by the vehemency of the winds. But let vs leaue theſe curious ſpirits, and ſpeake of two <note place="margin">Two generall kinds of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</note>other generall kinds of curioſitie, which reſpect chiefly our morall philoſophie, and from whence all corruption of good maners proceeded. The firſt kind concerneth our ſelues onely, and the other our brethren and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen. To ſpeake therefore of the firſt, it bringeth foorth pernitious effects after diuers ſorts and maners, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs Frenchmen they appeere principally in that <note place="margin">Againſt the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie of ſeeing ſtrange nations.</note>burning deſire, which inflameth vs to trauell into ſtrange nations, and in our carking and caring for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, clothing, and decking of our bodies, and for the ſetting foorth and trimming vp of our houſes with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vnprofitable moueables, wherein we exceede all the ſuperfluitie of other countries. When the ancients ſpeake of the felicitie that accompanied the golden age,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:8689:96"/>
amongſt the good conditions, and commendable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which they noted in that holie and firſt ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they neuer forgat this, that the men of that good time tilled and manured their grounds, and cared not what ſtrangers did in farre countries. Moreouer, ſince the time that men made light account of their owne climate, through a curious and vnſatiable deſire of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating vnto themſelues the inheritance and labour of others, beſides the crueltie, violence, and murders, which prepared a way to their miſerable platformes, all corruption of good maners at home, and all baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like attire haue followed thereupon. We might heere note infinite teſtimonies of antiquitie, and eſpecially of our ancient progenitors the Gaules, who were verie warlike, and liued within their bounds in al ſimplicitie of maners, and frugalitie of life. But our owne example, to our vnſpeakeable ſhame and miſerie, is ſo euident before our eyes, that I neede no better proofe of my ſaying than that experience which we feele by our owne perill. For <note place="margin">One euident cauſe of the ruin of Fraunce.</note>the ruine and deſtruction of this french monarchy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of no other ſecond cauſe (our iniquitie being the firſt) than of the mixture, which we haue made of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with our ſelues. Wherein we are not contented to ſeeke them out vnder their roofes, vnleſſe we alſo draw them vnto vs, and lodge them vnder our roofes, yea preferre them before our owne countrimen and citizens in the offices and honorable places of this kingdome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law and right of euerie good and well eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed policie. Beſides we adore and reuerence all their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties and ſubtill inuentions, and that ſo ignorantly, or rather blockiſhly, that ſuffring them to ſucke vs euen to the verie bowels, in ſteade of all our riches and ſpoiles, which they for their part haue drawne from vs, they haue left vs nothing but new maners and faſhions of liuing in all diſſolutenes and pleaſure, except this one thing alſo, that we haue learned of them to diſſemble, and withall to frame and build a treaſon verie ſubtillie. Such is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion wherewith our french youth is commonly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

To this purpoſe <hi>Gueuara,</hi> Chronicler to the emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, writeth that from forraine countries men commonly bring newes to prattle of, and ſtrange cuſtomes to practiſe: and that few come out of Italie, that are not abſolute and diſſolute.<note place="margin">Lycurgus for-bad traffick with ſtrangers.</note>
                     <hi>Lycurgus</hi> by his lawes commanded the Lacedemonians not to go out of their kingdome, nor to conuerſe with ſtrangers, ſaying, that although by their trafficke with them they might be inriched, yet on the other ſide they would grow poore in regard of their owne vertues. <hi>Titus Liuius, Macrobius, Salustius</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> curſed and bewailed the conqueſts and victories, which Rome had in Aſia, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if the Romanes brought the Perſians, &amp; Medes vnder ſubiection by force, yet the ſelfe ſame Aſians ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Romans with their vices and delights.

And which was woorſt of all, he ſaith, that theſe vices would alwaies remaine with them, but the country conquered, for a little time.

But whatſoeuer my ſpeech hath bin hetherto, my meaning is not to finde fault with the right vſe of hoſpitalitie, which ought to be maintained &amp; kept inuiolable in euerie well eſtabliſhed common wealth. In this reſpect Fraunce hath beene commended aboue all nations for intertaining and receiuing all ſorts of people: prouided alwaies that they be not preferred before our own children, and that they be contented to obey &amp; liue according to the common lawes of the country. Neither do I reprehend that traffick and trade with ſtrangers, which ſerueth for a bond of humaine ſocietie, &amp; whereby the commodities of one to another are communicated togither with common profite: prouided alwaies that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and vnneceſſarie things be left and forſaken. But ere we enter too farre in with them, it were good for vs not to vndertake ſuch voyages to gather wit and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (as the moſt ſay) before we haue profited well in the knowledge of vertue, and are garded with good and commendable maners, which are able to reſiſt all new &amp; ſtrange corruption: wherby otherwiſe the nature of man deſirous of diuerſitie and noueltie, ſuffreth it ſelfe eaſily to be ouercome, making marchandiſe amongſt them of naughtines rather than of goodnes. As hitherto experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſheweth vs, that from this fountaine hath proceeded the curioſitie of ſuperſluous apparell, of gold, of ſilke, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie, pictures, veſſels, perfumes, painting of faces, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſie of meate, and all prouocations of voluptuouſnes, whooredome, gluttonie, and of other filthy diſſolutenes, and infamous vices, too much knowne amongſt vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue heertofore made mention, and will heerafter continue the particular diſcourſe of them.

Now let vs come to the other kinde of curioſitie, which as we ſaide,<note place="margin">Of curioſitie in ſeeking to know other mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.</note> concerneth our brethren and countrimen. This is that which <hi>Plutark</hi> calleth a deſire to know the wants and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of other men. It is commonly ioined with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and euil ſpeaking, and is by that excellent philoſopher compared to adulterie, which may be called a curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie after another bodies pleaſure. Moreouer curious folkes through an ouerweening incontinencie, ſeeke to violate and to diſcouer their neighbors greateſt ſecrets, eſpecially thoſe which are blamewoorthy, that by publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing &amp; blabbing them out, they may nouriſh the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie of their toongs. For as venemous ſerpents ſeeke after infected and ſtinking places: ſo curioſitie delighteth in finding out euill things, but deſpiſeth thoſe that are good and commendable. If there be any one imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a ſtock or kindred, if any infamy, fault, error, or euil gouernment in a houſe, any quarelling, any thing to be miſliked or loathed therein, it is the delight of curious folks to learne that throughly, that they may ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and tell long ſtories of them, by that meanes vſing their memorie for a loathſome regiſter of other mens vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet neither ſee or know any fault of their owne. This cauſeth them all their life time to be the diſciples of ignorance &amp; not of philoſophy, which teacheth vs, not other mens faults, but our owne, as alſo the meanes how
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8689:98"/>
we may be deliuered from them. <hi>Diogenes</hi> beholding one of his ſchollers in a publike place talking very earneſtly with a yoong man that was thought to be ſubiect to his pleaſure, demanded what talke they had. To whom the diſciple anſwered, that the other rehearſed vnto him a notable tricke of youth, which he had plaid the night before. Then <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaide to them both, My will and commandement is, that ech of you haue fortie ſtripes with a whippe, within the Amphitheater, or playing place: Thou (quoth hee to his ſcholler) for giuing eare vnto him, and he for the follie committed, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a philoſopher deſerueth as much for harkening to follie recited, as doth the vagabond that rehearſeth it. What puniſhment thinke you would this wiſe man haue iudged them worthie of, who harken and inquire ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly after other mens faults and imperfections? And yet a man may truly ſay of the moſt of theſe men, that they will neuer looke vpon, or conſider their owne liues, which is a very vnpleaſant ſpectacle vnto them, nor yet returne and looke backe with reaſon, as with a light, vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But their ſoule being full of all ſorts of euil, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that which ſhe feeleth within hir ſelfe, leapeth foorth and wandereth heere and there in ſearching other mens doings, thereby feeding and fatting hir owne ill nature, and vſing curioſitie as an eie to looke vpon other men.<note place="margin">The curious are more profitable to their enimies than to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> Heerof it commeth, that a curious man is more profitable to his enimies than to himſelfe, bicauſe he diſcouereth, manifeſteth, and ſheweth vnto them from what they are to beware, and what to correct: and yet in the mean while he ſeeth not the moſt part of that which is within himſelf, ſo greatly is he dazeled by beholding that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in other men. He openeth all euen to the very wals of ſtrange houſes, and pearceth like a wind into the midſt of thoſe things that are moſt ſecret. His mind is both vpon the pallaces of the rich, and cotages of the poore. He fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retteth out euerie thing, and inquireth many times after the affaires of the greateſt, which is the cauſe of his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, when he buſieth himſelf too far in them. This was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8689:99"/>
wiſely noted by <hi>Philippides,</hi> when <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> the king asked <note place="margin">Curioſitie in princes affaires is perilous.</note>him what part of his goods he would haue imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. What you pleaſe ſir, quoth he, ſo it be no part of your ſecrets. Now if we deſite to diuert and to quench the heate of this vicious paſſion of curioſitie, which is too familiar amongſt vs, and vnſeemlie in a prudent and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <note place="margin">How we muſt cure curioſitie.</note>man, we muſt ſometimes abſtaine from inquiring after lawfull things, though otherwiſe not neceſſarie. In the exerciſe and practiſe of iuſtice, it is expedient ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to leaue vntaken that which a man may lawfully take, thereby to accuſtome himſelfe to abſtaine more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily from taking any thing vniuſtly. Likewiſe it is good for a man ſometime to abſtaine from his owne wife, that he may attaine to the vertue of temperancie, and ſo be neuer mooued to deſire another mans wife. In like maner, if in ſtead of ſhewing our ſelues to be of the number of theſe diligent and curious inquirers after vnprofitable newes, we ſignifie rather to him that commeth to tell vs of ſome newes, that he ſhould pleaſe vs better if he had ſome good and profitable, matter to ſpeake, than ſhould we thereby giue teſtimonie of a ſtaied and ſetled nature deſpiſing cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie. <note place="margin">Examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</note>This was noted in <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who ſeeing a meſſenger running apace towards him with a ſmiling countenance, ſaid vnto him (not ſhewing himſelfe to bee mooued at all, or deſirous to vnderſtand what he would ſpeake) what good newes canſt thou bring me my friend, vnles thou didſt come to tel me that <hi>Homer</hi> is riſen again?

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8689:99"/>
(my Lords Athenians) make no haſte, but deliberate lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely, and looke ſafely to that which ye haue to do. It is certaine, that if we vſe in this ſort to ſhew our ſelues ſtaied in ſuch things, and in all other things of ſmal importance, wherein our naturall inclination would prouoke vs to be curious, as namely, to breake off good communication <note place="margin">Faults wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to curious men commonly fall.</note>begun vpon the receit of a letter, to forſake companie to run and meet a meſſenger onely to know what newes he bringeth, and a thouſand ſuch like ſudden motions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of lightnes and curioſitie, I ſay by auoiding ſuch things we ſhould prepare a way to the reſtraining of al cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie in greater matters, which otherwiſe may procure blame. As for example, to open another bodies letter, to intrude our ſelues into the ſecret counſels of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, to ſeeke out their faults and imperfections, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire buſily after that, which may greeue our familiar friends, or to aske them of that, which they like not of, neither is grounded vpon any good cauſe or reaſon, leaſt peraduenture the anſwer of ſome wiſe man ſhould turne more to our ſhame, than be framed according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Thus dealt <hi>Demaratus</hi> with a curious &amp; importunate <note place="margin">Wittie anſwers made to curious queſtions.</note>fellow that had oftentimes asked of him, who was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteſt man in Sparta: He that reſembleth thee leſt, quoth he vnto him. The anſwer alſo of an Egyptian was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly made to one that aſked him what he caried there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It is wrapped vp (quoth he) bicauſe thou ſhouldſt not know what it is. Now by that which hath been hitherto diſcourſed, it appeereth ſufficiently, that al kind of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie is hurtful, hateful, and greatly to be blamed in euerie one, if it be not bounded and limited by the reaſon of true prudence, which guideth and ſtirreth vs vp to ſeeke after good, honeſt, and profitable things, either in heauen, in earth, in the aire, or in the ſea, according to the gift and capacitie of our vnderſtanding and iudgement, which may be neceſſarie for vs to know, or may helpe vs to liue well and happily. For whatſoeuer is more, we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it vnprofitable and ſuperfluous. Let vs learne then, not to know more than we ought, but vnto ſobrietie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note>

our ſpirits within the limits of mediocritie, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, and modeſtie. Let vs forſake all ſophiſticall curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and worldlie wiſedome, which is meere fooliſhnes before God, that we may imbrace a ſimple, popular, and Academicall kind of knowledge, which will teach vs to know our ſelues and our dutie, whereby we ſhall be led to that happy end, which we ſeeke for and deſire. Let vs not admire any more the merchandiſe and outward ſhewes wherewith ſtrangers feed the eies of curious folks, but let vs wonder at vertue onely: ſaying with the comicall poet, where he ſpeaketh of thoſe that couered their bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteads with gold and ſiluer, what great follie is it to make ſleepe ſo deere, which God hath freely giuen vnto vs? So to ſeeke for that of ſtrangers with ſuch great expences which we may haue at our owne hauen better &amp; more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

We may haue in France (if our blockiſhnes ſtay vs not) Vniuerſities and ſchooles for all honeſt exerciſes meet for our nobilitie without ſtrangers. And if we think that in ſome places amongſt them, they haue better tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers than we haue, let vs firſt ſeeke amongſt our ſelues for thoſe inſtructions that are moſt neceſſarie, namely, for the knowledge of good letters, and inſtitution of vertue, and then if we thinke good, we may heare their teachers and maiſters, without infecting our behauiour with the corruption of their maners.

                  <p>This hath been alwaies a great queſtion among the skilfull and diligent inquiters after the perfection of nature, whether learning or nature teacheth vs to know our ſelues. Iuſtice (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is naturally planted in vs from our birth, as alſo religion, pietie, grace, dutie, and <note place="margin">Natural vertues according to the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who had no knowledge of mans fall.</note>truth. Whatſoeuer is according to nature (as the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay) is certainly ordained and appointed, bicauſe nature is nothing elſe but order, or rather the effect of order. But diſorder, like to Pindarus ſand, cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in any certaine number: neither can that which is againſt nature be defined, bicauſe it is infinite. When they ſpeake generally of nature, they make two <note place="margin">The diuiſion of nature.</note>principall kinds: the one ſpirituall, intelligible, and the vnchangeable beginning of motion and reſt, or rather the vertue, efficient, and preſeruing cauſe of all things: the other, ſinſible, mutable, and ſubiect to generation and corruption, reſpecting all things that haue life, and ſhall
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8689:101"/>
haue end. <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, that nature in one reſpect is ſaid to be the firſt &amp; chiefe matter ſubiect of euery thing that hath being, namely, of thoſe things which haue in them the beginning of their own moouing &amp; mutation: and in another reſpect, it is called the form of any thing. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the infinite diſputations and curious inquirie made by the philoſophers concerning this excellent matter, whereof we haue not heere vndertaken to intreat, we ſay<note place="margin">What nature is.</note> with <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> that Nature (in which the ſteps of the diuinitie ſhine and are liuelie repreſented) is that ſpirit or diuine reaſon, which is the efficient cauſe of naturall works, and the preſeruing cauſe of thoſe things that haue being, through the onely power of the heauenlie word, which is the workmaiſter of nature, and of the whole world, and hath infuſed into euery thing a liuely vertue and ſtrength, wherby it encreaſeth and preſerueth it ſelfe by a naturall facultie. Or to ſpeake more briefly, Nature is the order and continuance of the works of God, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deitie, and his words and commandements, and borrowing hir force and ſtrength from thence, as from hir fountaine and originall. In this nature thus defined, which reſpecteth all things created, we haue heere to conſider of and to handle particularly, according to our meaning at the firſt, the nature of man onely, which naturall philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call the inſtinct and inclination of euerie ones ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.<note place="margin">The propertie and light of nature.</note> There is nothing more true, than that nature of hir ſelfe leadeth men in ſome ſort to that which is decent and honeſt: neither is learning able to ſhew any thing, which is not to be found in nature, whether we go about to teach the end of man, which the philoſophers call, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertue, or whether we ſeeke out the cauſes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of other ſciences. For other is no man ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or wicked in all the world, who is not touched with honeſtie, and who retaineth not ſomewhat of the light of nature. Which may be cleerely perceiued by this, that a vertuous action pleaſeth him, ſo that he is euen conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to commend it. And if he might taſte thereof neuer ſo little, not being fore-poſſeſſed with other diſordinate
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8689:101"/>
deſires, no doubt but he would become ſuch a one, as might purchaſe and deſerue praiſe and commendation. But here we muſt acknowledge the firſt corruption of our<note place="margin">The corruption of nature.</note> nature whereby it is inclined to pleaſure, and to eſchew labour, which are the welſprings of vices and of infinite euils. And if our nature ſhould be ſuffered to runne with the bridle at libertie, whether ſoeuer it is driuen by carnal deſires, hauing none of them cut off by wiſe admonitions and liuely perſwaſions, there is no beaſt ſo vntamed or ſauage, that would not be milder than man. Whereupon it followeth that nature muſt of neceſſitie be tamed, and as it were mollified by the ſtudie of good letters, &amp; by the inſtruction of good philoſophicall reaſons, which as they ſerue for nouriſhment and food to our minds, ſo by them our maners and actions are framed and guided according to vertue and prudence, and we made able to learne how, by the compaſſe of reaſon, to attain to mediocritie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perfection conſiſteth, and to reiect exceſſe, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies dangerous. A good plaier on a lute or violl touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no other ſtringes than thoſe that are touched by him that is moſt vnskilfull. Notwithſtanding being taught in the beginning, he knoweth afterward through vſe what ſtrings make that ſound, which the earc iudgeth by the harmonie and agreement of ſound to be delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereupon he is taken for his craftſ-maſter.

Now if this good nature be ill brought vp, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it will ſpoile it ſelfe and become verie perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Catiline</hi> were both high minded and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious by nature, but foraſmuch as the one was alwaies obedient to the lawes of his common-wealth, &amp; vſed his vertue as reaſon required, he was accounted vertuous, &amp; the other wicked and wretched for doing the contrarie. You aske of me (ſaith <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Xenophon)</hi> whether cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or greatnes of hart proceed of nature or of learning. For my part I think, that as we ſee ſome borne with ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bodies than others are, ſo by nature we haue mindes more fit to ſuſtaine perils &amp; aduerſities than others haue. And that this is ſo, we ſee many brought vp with the ſame maners, and inſtructed vnder like lawes, and yet ſome of them more hardie and bold than the reſt. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there is no doubt but the goodnes of nature is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by learning and inſtitution. It is certaine (ſaith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tark)</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The difference between philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and the common people</note> that there is in all men ſome light of good and right iudgement, but yet the difference between philoſophers and the common ſort of men is great: bicauſe philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers haue their iudgement more ſtaied and aſſured in dangers, whereas the vulgar ſort haue not their harts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and defended with ſuch anticipations and reſolute impreſſions aforehand. Albeit therefore many notable men (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) haue atchieued many braue and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous exploits being guided by their naturall iudgement onely, and by daily experience in affairs, yet infinite faults may be noted in them, eſpecially in their behauiour and maner of life, which might haue been amended and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the knowledge of letters.

True it is, that a good naturall inclination deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth more praiſe being without learning, than learning doth without it: bicauſe euen knowledge ſerueth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times for an occaſion to the wicked, who abuſe it maliciouſly, to further their vnpure purpoſes. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, we can accuſe nothing but their peruerſnes, which by reaſon of their ignorance, would not haue ſtaied it ſelfe from vttering ſuch pernitious effects in them, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture worſe. For in what meaſure ſoeuer it be, yet (as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid) they that haue been well brought vp and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, are in ſome ſort forced to moderate themſelues. Beſides, they that are not altogither well borne, yet being<note place="margin">The defect of nature is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by good education.</note> holpen by good training vp and exerciſe of vertue, they may after a ſort repaire and recouer the defect of nature. Idlenes (ſaith <hi>Plutarke)</hi> annihilateth and corrupteth the goodnes of nature, but diligence in good education cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth the naughtines thereof. And as we ſee, that drops of water falling vpon a hard ſtone make it hollow, and that iron and copper conſume and weare only with hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ground that is more vneeuen and ſtonie than it ought, yet being manured and dreſſed, beareth faire and goodlie fruit, and contrariwiſe good ground becommeth vnfruitfull, and waxeth worſe and worſe the more it is left vnlabored: euen ſo good maners and conditions are qualities, which in long proceſſe of time are imprinted in the ſoule, and morall vertues are attained vnto through<note place="margin">The weaknes of our naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to goodnes.</note> care, diligence, labor, and long exerciſe. Therefore although nature hath this propertie in al men, that it is in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all motion through a weake inſtinct, and that in ſome ſtronger, in others weaker, which cauſeth hir to aſpire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and to deſire the excellencie of hir firſt perfection,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8689:103"/>
whereof ſhe knoweth hir ſelfe void, yet if ſhe be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies holpen and driuen towards the better part, ſhe will ſoone ſuffer hir ſelfe to be caried to the worſe. They are but little ſparks (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> which through vice and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt maners are ſo eaſily quenched, that the light of them <note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note>appeereth not. And as the heate buried in the veines of a flint, ſeemeth rather dead than aliue, if the ſparkles be not drawen foorth by the ſteele: ſo this immortall portion of celeſtiall fire, being the fountaine and firſt motiue of all knowledge, remaineth without any profit or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble action, if it be not ſharpened and ſet on worke. We are no ſooner borne, and taken in hand to be brought vp, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, but we follow after wickednes, as if we had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked iniquitie togither with our nurſes milke. Afterwards being comitted by our fathers to the hands of teachers, we ſo inwrap our minds with errors, that thoſe weake ſeedes of vertue, which are in vs by nature, muſt needes giue place to vanitie, and to opinion. But if good wits find good bringing vp, then they grow alwaies vp from better to better. Whereupon in my opinion that old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe was not ſpoken without reaſon, that education go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beyond nature. Which thing when <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to let the Lacedemonians vnderſtand, he nouriſhed two dogs of one &amp; the ſame litter, vſing the one to hunt, <note place="margin">Lvcurgus exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of two dogs.</note>and bringing vp the other in the kitchen. And when the people were gathered togither, he ſpake vnto them in this maner: It is a matter of great importance (O ye Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians) to ingender vertue in mens harts by education, cuſtome, and diſcipline, as I will let ye ſee, and ſenſibly perceiue out of hand. Then he cauſed both the dogs to be brought, and caſting off a hare on the one ſide, &amp; ſetting a platter of broth on the other, he let looſe his dogs, of which the one followed after the hare, &amp; the other ran to the broth. Thus fareth it (quoth he) with men, who may be made more vertuous by good education, than by nature. Neither will it profit them at all to deſcend of <hi>Hercules</hi> race, if they practiſe not thoſe works whereby in his life time he grew to be moſt famous in the world, and if they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8689:103"/>
exerciſe not themſelues all the daies of their life in honeſt and vertuous actions. Furthermore if we deſire examples of this, that learning, inſtitution and education auaile greatly to conforme and frame our harts and wils to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yea to alter and make them better, <hi>Socrates</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">Socrates and Themiſtocles were by nature vicious, but by education ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</note>in <hi>Plato,</hi> that by nature he was inclined to vices, and yet philoſophy made him as perfect and excellent a man as any was in the world. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in his youth (as himſelfe confeſſed) for want of diſcipline was caried away by his deſires like to a yoong vnbridled colt, vntil that by <hi>Miltiades</hi> example, who was then famous amongſt the Grecians, he cauſed the viuacitie &amp; quicknes of his ſpirit, and the ambition, which naturally was in him to attende vpon vertue. Beſides, education and cuſtome haue power to change not onely the naturall inclination of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler men, but alſo of whole countries, as the hiſtories of moſt nations in the world declare vnto vs: and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Germaines, who in the time of <hi>Tacitus</hi> had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The Germaines much changed by inſtitution.</note>law, nor religion, nor knowledge, nor forme of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, whereas now they giue place to no nation for good inſtitution in all things. Let vs not then be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged or faint by knowing our naturall imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeing that through labor and diligence we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer that which is wanting: but happie is that man, and ſingularly beloued of God, to whom both good birth and like bringing vp are granted together. It followeth now to diſcourſe particulerly of the maner of good education and inſtruction of youth: but this will come in more fite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when we ſhall intreat of Oeconomy. And yet ſeeing we are in the diſcourſe of mans nature, I thinke it wil not be from the purpoſe, nor without profite, if (to make vs more ſeuere cenſurers of our owne faults) we note, that although our behauior be cheefely known by the effects, <note place="margin">A mans naturall inclination may be eſpied in a ſmall matter.</note>as a tree by the fruit, yet many times a mans naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is better perceiued in a light matter, as in a word, in a paſtime, or in ſome other free and priuate buſines, wherein vertue or vice ingrauen in the ſoule may be ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner eſpied, than in greater actions and works done pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely:
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8689:104"/>
bicauſe in theſe matters ſhame or conſtraint com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cauſe men to vſe diſſimulation. Howbeit this alſo is true, that the more power and authoritie a man hath, when he may alleadge his owne will for all reaſon, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection of his hart is then beſt diſcouered. For ſuch an vnbrideled licence mooueth all, euen to the verie depth and bottome of his paſſions, and cauſeth all thoſe ſecret vices, that are hidden in his ſoule to be fullie and <note place="margin">Great men ought eſpecially to learne vertue.</note>euidently ſeene. Whereupon it followeth that great and noble men ought aboue all others to learne vertue, and to ſtudie to liue well, eſpecially ſeeing they haue all thoſe requiſite helps and commodities, through want of which moſt men are hindred from attaining thereunto. Let vs therefore learne by our preſent diſcourſe to knowe, that the nature of all men, by reaſon of the corruption of ſin, is ſo depraued, corrupted and vnperfect, that euen the beſt men amongſt many imperfections carry about them ſome enuie, ielouſy, emulation and contention againſt ſome or other, and rather againſt their verie friends. This did <hi>Demas</hi> a noble man and greatly conuerſant in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of eſtate, declare vnto the councel in the citie of <hi>Chio,</hi> after a ciuill diſſention wherin he had followed that part which ouercame. For he perſwaded thoſe of his ſide not to baniſh all their aduerſaries out of the city, but to leaue ſome of them after they had taken from them all meanes of doing more harme: leaſt (quoth he vnto them) we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to quarrel with our friends, hauing no more enemies to contende withall. For this cauſe we muſt fortifie our ſelues with vnderſtanding and knowledge through labor and ſtudie of good letters, that we may reſtraine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe ſo many pernitious motions mingled togither in our ſoules. Let vs know moreouer, that ſeeing our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is aſſaulted and prouoked by a vehement inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do any thing whatſoeuer, it is a very hard matter to withdrawe and keepe it backe by any force, no not by the ſtrength or feare of any lawes, if in due conuenient time we frame not within it a habite of vertue, hauing firſt wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to be well borne. But howſoeuer it be, let vs endeuor

When we haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered well of the woorthie effects and fruits of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of temperance, no doubt but we will ſubſcribe to this wiſe mans opinion, and to as many as haue written of the praiſes and roialties of that vertue. Temperance (ſaith
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8689:105"/>
                     <hi>thagoras)</hi> is that light, which driueth away round about <note place="margin">What tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranceis.</note>hir the darknes and obſcuritie of paſſions. She is (ſaith <hi>Socrates)</hi> the wholeſomeſt vertue of all. For ſhe preſerueth both publikely and priuately humane ſocietie, ſhe lifteth vp the ſoule miſerably throwen downe in vice, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hir againe into hir place. Temperance (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> is a mutuall conſent of the parts of the ſoule (from whence ſpringeth continencie) cauſing all diſordered and vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled deſires to take reaſon for a rule and direction. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is the mother of all dutie and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. It is the propertie of iuſtice not to violate the right of another man, and of Temperance, not ſo much as to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. In Temperance a man may behold modeſtie, with the priuation of euery perturbation in the ſoule, as alſo away how to frame al things according to that which is decent or ſeemely, which the Latins call <hi>Decorum,</hi> being <note place="margin">What <hi>Decorum,</hi> or comelines i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For as bodily beautie mooueth and reioiceth the eies, by reaſon of the goodly and ſeemely compoſition of all the members, wherin all the parts with a certaine grace agree togither: ſo this decencie, which is honeſtie and ſeemeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſhining in mans life by his good order, conſtancie and moderation both in deed and word, mooueth and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the harts of thoſe amongſt whom we liue. This vertue <note place="margin">The definition of temperance.</note>then of temperance is a ſtedfaſt and moderate rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ouer concupiſcence, and ouer other vehement moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind. But ſhe commandeth cheefly ouer thoſe two perturbations of the ſoule, grounded vpon the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good, I meane, <hi>Vnbridled deſire, and vnmeaſurable ioie,</hi> whereof heertofore we made mention. Thus we ſee, that no man can find out any thing that is ſo excellent and <note place="margin">What paſſions are ruled by temperance.</note>wonderfull as temperance, the guide and gouernor of the ſoule, which bicauſe of hir exceeding great light cannot be hid in darknes: which compelleth vs to follow reaſon, bringeth peace to our minds, and mollifieth them as it were by concord and agreement. She ſerueth for a bridle to reſtraine all pleaſures, and in the midſt of them maketh
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:8689:106"/>
man good and vertuous. She ſerueth for a knife to cut off all ſuperfluous, vaine, and vnneceſſarie deſires as well of the ſoule as of the bodie: and is as it were a rule directing naturall and neceſſarie deſires by fit choice of times, and by temperate vſe of mediocritie. Wherefore we may ſay, that this vertue of temperance comprehendeth in it all the other vertues: that through hir a harmonie, concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and coniunction of them all is made: that ſhe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth vnto them all occaſions of beginning, and being begun confirmeth them by a firme and ſtedfaſt ſafetie. Breefly, temperance (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) is a generall ſurname of thoſe vertues, whereby a man moderateth his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and frameth his geſture and behauiour in ſuch ſort, that no effeminate or looſe maners, no clowniſh or vnciuil faſhions are ſeene in him. O (ſaith <hi>Euripides)</hi> how is temperance to be eſteemed, which is the cauſe of ſuch great glorie and honor amongſt men? This vertue is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided <note place="margin">Fower parts of temperance.</note>into fower principal parts, into <hi>Continencie, Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Modestie,</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> Continencie is that part, whereby concupiſcence and deſire are gouerned by counſell and reaſon. Clemencie is that, whereby the minds of men, raſhly caried away with the hatred of any one, and with deſire to hurt him, are kept backe by gentlenes. Modeſtie is that, whereby honeſt ſhame and baſhfulnes purchaſeth good and due deſerued renowne. Order is a diſpoſition of all things in their conuenient place. All theſe vertues are vndoubtedly ioined with temperance, and conſiſt as well in action, as in the diſcourſing of the mind. For by ioining a certaine mediocritie and order vnto thoſe things that belong to this life, we preſerue honeſtie and dutie. Euerie vertue (ſaith <hi>Iamblicus,</hi> a notable man) deſpiſeth whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is fraile, mortall, and momentanie, but temperance more than the reſt: bicauſe ſhe contemneth, and through chaſtitie beateth downe all thoſe delights and pleaſures, whereby the ſoule (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) is faſtened vnto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as it were with a naile. Therefore if temperance roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out whatſoeuer ſhe findeth vnperfect and ſubiect to perturbations, how ſhal ſhe not therewithall make vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8689:106"/>
This is the meaning of that which the poets would giue vs to vnderſtand vnder that fained fable of <hi>Bellero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> who being aided by modeſtie put to death that <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera,</hi> and all other cruel and ſauage monſters. But as long as the immoderate force of our affections raigneth in vs, it ſuffereth not men to be men, but draweth them to the il fauoured nature of beaſts void of reaſon. Contrariwiſe, this holie moderation, whereby pleaſures are contained within certaine bounds, preſerueth families togither, and cities: and which is more, draweth vs in ſome ſort neere to the diuine nature.

If we ſhould ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor to rehearſe heere al thoſe excellent praiſes, which phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers giue to this vertue of temperance, bicauſe of hir worthie effects and wholeſome fruits, which ſhe bringeth foorth in the ſoule, we were not able to performe it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſhould beſtow this whole daies worke about it. But bicauſe in the ſequele of our diſcourſes, as well in the handling of vices as of vertues, we may conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how neceſſary temperance is, and what profit it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the whole life of man, we will content our ſelues to learne of <hi>Plato,</hi> that temperance is the piller of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <note place="margin">The commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note>the helmet and ſhield againſt luxuriouſnes, the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and guide of the eies, the preſeruer of good will, the raſor of euill thoughts, the corrector of vntamed deſires, an enimie to the diſordered will of the ſoule: that it ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth naturall deſires, hindereth diſhoneſt actions, bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth continencie, mollifieth mens harts, and giueth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a rule in all things. Now let vs note out amongſt the ancients, ſome examples of the force and greatnes of this vertue of temperance, which hath made many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">Woonderfull examples of temperance. <hi>Scipio Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                     </note>men worthie of eternall renowme. <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Romanes, at the taking of the citie of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage had a yoong damſell to his priſoner, of rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beautie. And when he vnderſtood of what great calling ſhe came, and how hir parents not long before had betrothed hir to a great Lord of Spaine, he commanded that he ſhould be ſent for, and reſtored hir vnto him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8689:107"/>
abuſing hir in any reſpect, although he was in the flowre of his age, and had free and ſoueraigne authoritie. Moreouer, he gaue for a dowrie with hir the monie that was brought vnto him for hir ranſome. An act no doubt of great continencie in a victorious captaine towards his captiue, whereof <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> ioining it with that which<note place="margin">Alexander.</note> we read of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, maketh this queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the twaine behaued himſelfe more vertuouſly. For <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing vanquiſhed in battell king <hi>Darius,</hi> and retaining as priſoner his wife, which excelled al the dames of Aſia in beautie, and was withall but yong in yeeres, the victorious Monarke being but yong alſo, and hauing no ſuperior aboue him to whom he was bound to giue an account of himſelfe, had notwithſtanding ſuch great knowledge how to command himſelfe, that albeit by his acquaintance and friends he was ſufficiently certified of the excellent beautie of this Ladie, yet hee bare no ill thought towards hir, but ſent to comfort hir, and cauſed hir to be intertained and attended on with no leſſe honor and reuerence, than if ſhe had been his owne ſiſter. And to auoid all ſuſpicion and occaſion of euill, he would not ſee hir, nor ſuffer hir to be brought before him. The tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance<note place="margin">Cyrus.</note> of <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of Perſia is alſo very famous amongſt the hiſtoriographers. For when one of his minions ſtirred him vp to go and ſee faire <hi>Panthaea,</hi> ſaying that hir rare beautie was well woorthie to be ſeene: that is the cauſe (anſwered this yong prince vnto him) why I will altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſtaine at this preſent from beholding hir at thy perſuaſion, leaſt ſhe hir ſelfe heerafter ſhould induce me through the remembrance of hir perfection to go to hir, and ſo cauſe me in the meane time to let ſlip many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires<note place="margin">Architas.</note> of great importance. <hi>Architas</hi> was ſo temperate, that he would not ſo much as vtter one filthie word: and if he were driuen to declare it vpon ſome iuſt occaſion, then he wrote it, ſhewing by this ſilence, how diſhoneſt a thing it was to commit that, which being onely vttered ought to<note place="margin">Xenocrates.</note> cauſe a man to bluſh. <hi>Xenocrates</hi> was indued with ſuch a great gift of continencie, that <hi>Phryna</hi> a very faire and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:8689:107"/>
courtiſan laid a wager with certaine yoong men, that if ſhe lay with him, ſhe would cauſe him to breake his temperance. But <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> hauing granted hir the halfe of his bed, for example ſake to thoſe youths, was nothing more mooued for any thing ſhe could do. Whereupon <hi>Phryna</hi> being verie angrie made anſwere in the morning to thoſe that demanded the wager of hir, that ſhe laie not with a man but with a blocke. <hi>Iſaeus</hi> the philoſopher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Iſaeus.</note> asked of one that looked vpon a verie faire woman, whether ſhe ſeemed not vnto him to be faire, made this anſwer. My friend, I am not diſeaſed any more in my eies: and ſo would not behold hir at all. <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,<note place="margin">C.

For as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſouldiers had taken a maide of an exccellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and at hir intreatie and earneſt requeſt had brought hir before him, <hi>Sforce</hi> asked the maide why ſhe deſired ſo earneſtly to come before him. To this ende (quoth ſhe) that thou mighteſt deliuer me from the ſouldiers, &amp; that I might pleaſe thee. <hi>Sforce</hi> ſeeing hir to be verie faire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of hir, and at night cauſed hir to lie with him. But as he would haue drawne neer vnto hir, the maide caſt hir ſelfe on both hir knees before him without the bed, and beſought him to ſaue hir virginitie, and to reſtore hir to him vnto whome ſhe was made ſure. Whereupon <hi>Sforce</hi> willingly agreed, beholding the abundance of hir teares,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8689:108"/>
which were teſtimonies of the chaſtitie of hir hart. Will we haue examples of this vertue of temperance in other circumſtances of hir effects? Ambition truly is the moſt vehement and ſtrongeſt paſſion of all thoſe wherewith mens minds are troubled, and yet many notable and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men haue ſo maſtred it by the force of their tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that oftentimes they accepted of offices and eſtats of ſupreame authoritie, as it were by compulſion &amp; with greefe: yea ſome altogither contemned and willingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke<note place="margin">The tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey againſt ambition.</note> them. <hi>Pompey</hi> receiuing letters of abſolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from the ſenate to conduct the warre againſt the two kings <hi>Tygranes</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> cried out: O God, ſhall I neuer come to the ende of ſo many trauels? Shall enuie alwaies hold me in ſuch ſort as hir ſlaue, that newe and great charges daily laying hold vpon me, I cannot rid my ſelfe of theſe ſnares, to the end I may liue ſweetly with my wife and children at my houſe in the countrey? <hi>Pittacus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pittacus.</note> one of the Sages of Graecia, being conſtrained to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the charge of an armie, accepted it with great greefe, ſaying before them all: O how hard a matter it is<note place="margin">Pedaretus.</note> to be a good man! <hi>Pedaretus</hi> the Lacedemonian hauing eſcaped to be elected one of thoſe three hundred ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which gouerned the eſtate of Sparta, returned from the aſſembly verie ioifull, ſaying, that it was an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to finde in that citie three hundred better and more<note place="margin">Scipio.</note> honeſt men than himſelfe. What did <hi>Scipio,</hi> of whom we haue already ſpoken, after he had performed a thouſand glorious facts for the greatnes of the Romaine empire? He forced the nature of ambition, which is alwaies cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a deſire of new glorie, and changed the reſt of his life into quietnes: and abandoning the affaires of eſtate,<note place="margin">Torquatus &amp; Fabritius.</note> he went and dwelt in the countrey. <hi>Torquatus</hi> and <hi>Fabritius</hi> abſented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from Rome, the one bicauſe he would not haue the dictatorſhip, and the other the conſulſhip.

emperor of the Turks, after he had obtained infinite vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and vanquiſhed the king of Hungarie, became a monke of the ſtraighteſt ſect amongſt them.

But what need we maruell at the knowledge of theſe examples, which ſhewe the effects of this vertue of temperance againſt ſtrange paſſions ariſing in vs, proceeding of our nature corrupted with ſinne, and ruling in vs through the ignorance of that which is good, when we may ſee, that temperance doth not onely ſerue for a good guide and ſchoolmaſter to our paſſions and to our naturall and neceſſarie deſires and pleaſures, that are borne with man from the beginning to rule them with mediocritie and reaſon, but alſo compelleth them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſubmit themſelues, thereby triumphing ouer their neceſſitie, although (as <hi>Thales</hi> ſaid) it be inuincible? And then how much more eaſie wil it be to reſtraine, yea, wholy to ouerthrow the fooliſh deſires of vanitie? <hi>Soüs</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Soüs.</note> a captaine of great renowne, and king of Lacedemonia, being beſieged in a narrow ſtraight, &amp; very craggie place void of water, after he had endured the neceſſitie of thirſt to the vttermoſt, he offred to the Clitorians his enemies, to reſtore vnto them al their land, which he had wonne of them, ſo that he and all his companie might drinke of a fountaine neere vnto them. Which being thus agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene them, he led al his men thither, and ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that if any one would abſtaine from drinking, he would reſigne his royaltie of Lacedemonia vnto him. But none would accept thereof, inſomuch that all dranke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept himſelfe, who going laſt downe into the fountaine did nothing but refreſh himſelfe, and wet his mouth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on the outſide, in the preſence of his enemies, not drinking one drop thereof. By meanes whereof he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that he was not bound at all vnto his promiſe, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all dranke not: and ſo he continued the warre to the great honor &amp; aduantage of his country. <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyſimachus.</note> one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſucceſſours in the empire, had not ſo
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8689:109"/>
great power ouer the like paſſion. For being compelled by thirſt, he diliuered himſelfe and all his armie to the Getes his enemies. After he had drunke, being priſoner, O God (quoth he) how faint-harted am I, that for ſo ſhort a pleaſure haue depriued my ſelfe of ſo great a kingdome! <note place="margin">Cato.</note>
                     <hi>Cato</hi> the yoonger, trauelling ouer the deſerts of Lybia, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured verie ſore thirſt. And when a ſouldier offered him a little water in his morion, he threw it vpon the ground in preſence of them all, to the end his armie might knowe, that he would be in no better eſtate than they. Truely a woorthy example for all captaines: for by ſo doing, that which would hardly haue quenched the thirſt of one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained <note place="margin">Rodolphus.</note>it in a whole armie. The emperor <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> who of baſe eſtate attained to this dignitie by his vertue, vpon the like occaſion made an anſwere woorthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. For when a full cup of beere was brought vnto him in the warre which he had againſt <hi>Octocarus</hi> king of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, at what time he was in a place where his whole army was greatly troubled with thirſt, he would not receiue it, but ſaid vnto the bearer thereof, that his thirſt was for all his armie, and not onely for himſelfe, &amp; therfore that cup of beere was not ſufficient to quench it. We read of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Socrates.</note>that whenſoeuer he felt himſelfe very thirſty, he would not drinke before he had ſpilt and caſt away the firſt pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of water, which he drew for himſelfe out of the well, to this ende (as he ſaid) that he might acquaint his ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all appetite to expect the conuenient time of reaſon. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore by ſuch examples and infinite others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in hiſtories we haue certaine and aſſured proofe of the force of temperance ouer naturall and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie paſſions, how credible is it, that ſhe may haue farre greater power ouer thoſe other paſſions that came from without vs, after we fell from our firſt creation? Let vs therefore conclude by our preſent diſcourſe, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of temperance is verie neceſſarie and profitable for a happie life, as that which hath this propertie belonging vnto it, to be skilfull in chaſing a mediocritie in pleaſures and greefes, in keeping that which is honeſt &amp; vertuous,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8689:109"/>
and in ſhunning of vice, eſpecially of carnall pleaſures, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe ſerue alſo to moderate all the actions of our life. And if a prudent man auoideth diſhoneſt things in publike places, a temperate man goeth farther, eſchewing them in ſolitarie and obſcure corners. If iuſtice ſuffereth no violence to be vſed, or wrong offered to any, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance further permitteth none to offend any: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is verie well called of the philoſophers, the mother of all dutie and honeſtie.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Some ſinnes are puniſhments of other ſinnes.</note> I red in <hi>Plato</hi> not long ſince, that there were many ſins, which ought rather to be called puniſhments of other ſins going before, than ſinnes. According to the courſe and ſequele of his ſpeech, if my memorie be good, I thinke his meaning is, that men ſuffering themſelues to be ouertaken of vice in the beginning, as it were in ſport, neuer take heed vnto themſelues, vntill they be wholie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned and giuen ouer (as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith) to their vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note>and pleaſures of their harts, in all vncleannes and turbulent paſſions of ignominie and reproch. Inſomuch that after they haue opened the gate to their concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences, and to the deſires of the fleſh, of whooremongers, couetous perſons, reuengers of their owne wrongs, belly gods, gluttons, and from other leſſe imperfections, being notwithſtanding foule and beaſtly, they become Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Church-robbers, parricides, Epicures, Atheiſts, and full of all execrable villanies, which are comprehended <note place="margin">What intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is.</note>vnder this word of intemperance. Intemperance is very well defined of the philoſophers to be an ouerflowing in voluptuouſnes, forcing and compelling all reaſon in ſuch ſort, that no conſideration of loſſe or hinderance is able to ſtay or keepe backe him that is through long cuſtome infected with vice, from betaking himſelfe of ſet purpoſe, and as a man would ſay, willingly and deſperately, to the execution of all his deſires and luſts, as he that placeth his ſole and ſoueraigne good therein, ſeeking for no other contentation than in that thing, which bringeth to him and to his ſenſes delight and pleaſure. For this cauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> diſtinguiſheth betweene intemperance and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie <note place="margin">The difference betweene an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent and an intemperate man.</note>(albeit many take them indifferently one for an other) ſaying, that an incontinent man chooſeth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſulteth when he offendeth, as one that knoweth full well that the euill he committeth is euill, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued with himſelfe not to follow it, but being ouercome with perturbations, yeeldeth thereunto. Whereas the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate man committeth euill of election and ſetled
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8689:110"/>
purpoſe to follow it, accounting it a good thing, &amp; to be deſired. And this commeth through a long cuſtom &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of vice, which is the cauſe that he neuer repenteth him of the fact, but taketh pleaſure therein: whereas on the contrarie ſide the repentance of an incontinent man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth hard at the heeles of his ſinne and tranſgreſſion. In this maner then proceedeth intemperance, vntill men are wholie addicted and giuen ouer to vice. This is the cauſe why the ſenſuall and vnreaſonable part of the ſoule contendeth no more with reaſon, which then is as it were ſtarke dead, and ſuffereth it ſelfe to be caried to vgly and vnnaturall vices, and to all fleſhly deſires: bicauſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine part of the ſoule is weakened in ſuch ſort, that ſhe hath no more ſtrength, nor feeling of hir eſſence, which is an enimie to vice. And thus accuſtoming hir ſelfe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low nothing but the will of the bodie, ſhe forſaketh God altogither, who ſeeing himſelfe forſaken, leaueth hir to hir concupiſcences, from whence is ingendred this exceeding luxuriouſnes euen againſt nature, this mortall, venemous, and bloodie enuie, this furious and barbarous crueltie, this inſatiable couetouſnes, this bloud-thirſtie ambition, and other incurable diſeaſes of the ſoule, too wel knowen amongſt vs, whereof the ſequele of our diſcourſes will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord a more ample knowledge vnto. Thus we ſee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) is the mother of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations in the ſoule, and cauſeth man (as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid) to differ nothing from a beaſt: bicauſe he neuer thinketh vpon that which is beſt, but onely ſeeketh how to ſatisfie and content the vnbridled deſires of pleaſure and luſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more vſe of reaſon than beaſts haue. Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (ſaith <hi>Euſebius)</hi> corrupteth the ſoule, and deſtroieth the bodie, bicauſe it conſtraineth a man, for loue of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and deſire to ſatisfie it, to do that which he knoweth well is diſhoneſt and vile. And as the winds torment and <note place="margin">A fit ſimilitude.</note>toſſe that ſhip, which they haue ſeazed vpon now heere now there, and will not ſuffer it to be guided by hir mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: ſo intemperance moouing and compelling the ſoule to diſobey reaſon, ſuffereth hir not to enioy tranquillitie

and reſt, which is an aſſured hauen of harbour from all winds. Intemperance (ſaith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> is a vice that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the coueting part of man, whereby we deſire to enioy vnlawfull pleaſures. It is hir propertie to chooſe the fruition of hurtfull and vile pleaſures, ſuppoſing none to liue happily, but ſuch as paſſe away their life in them.<note place="margin">The compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> This vice is vnſeparably accompanied with the troubling of all Order, with impudencie, vnſeemlines, luxuriouſnes, ſloth, negligence, and diſſolutenes. In a word, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance remooueth and troubleth all tranquillitie of the mind, and leadeth men to all kind of wickednes, the end of one vice being the beginning of another: which <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> called the puniſhment of ſinne, that doth not cleanſe but kill the malefactor. There is no kind of diſſolutenes wherein the intemperate man plungeth not himſelfe, no wickednes or crueltie, which he executeth not for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of his vncleane deſires and vnſatiable luſts, no feare or imminent danger, which can draw him backe. And further, he laboreth oftentimes to procure, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and honor ſhould be giuen to his moſt curſed and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable miſdemeanors, imagining and fanſying with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe dreames anſwerable and agreeable to that he moſt deſireth.

For where ſhal we find any ſo dul &amp; blockiſh, that hath no feeling of pleaſure, and that is not mooued with glory and honor? Such a man may be truly taken and accounted as one void of ſence and feeling, &amp; like to a blocke. Neither doth it belong to tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be depriued of all deſires, but to maſter them. For that man (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had experience of pleaſures and delights, neither hath any feeling of them, ought not to be called temperate, as he that hath done nothing which may teſtifie his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie and modeſtie. Thus ye ſee we haue no matter of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred wherabout to beſtow time in reproouing this vice of defect, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which men are too carefull to keep themſelues. But to come to the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our diſcourſe, we ſay with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that concupiſcences and deſires change the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and make the ſoule outragious: that ſo many as are infected with ſuch a pernicious and damnable vice as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance is, are no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but monſters in nature, leading a life altogether like to that of brute beaſts, which being deſtitute of all reaſon, know nothing better or more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt than pleaſure: &amp; hauing no knowledge of the iuſtice of God, neither reuerencing the beautie of vertue, beſtow al the courage, craft &amp; force that nature hath giuen them, to ſatiſfie and to accompliſh their deſires. So that if death brought with it an end of all ſence and feeling, and an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aboliſhing of the ſoule, as well to men as to beaſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate folks ſhould ſeeme to gaine much by enioying their deſires and luſts during their life time, and to haue good cauſe to waxe old, and euen to melt in their foule &amp; filthie pleaſures. But ſeeing we know (for truely he that doubteth hereof, is very ignorant &amp; moſt miſerable) that ſence and feeling remaine after death, and that the ſoule dieth not with the body, but that puniſhment, yea euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting payne is prepared for the wicked, let vs be careful to do the will of our father which is in heauen, whileſt we haue time, that in the triumphing day of his eternal ſonne, we may not heare to our confuſion, that ſentence of his mouth, Depart from me ye workers of iniquitie.

the riot, ſuperfluitie, and curioſitie of diet, which at this day are ſeene amongſt vs. The life of our firſt Fathers, was it not maintained a long time with fruits, milke, honie, and water? Who euer came neere their long and happie daies, ſince thoſe times? What preparation of exquiſite victuals did thoſe ſix hundred thouſand Iſraelites thinke to find, that came out of Egypt to go into a new land, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fortie yeeres through the wildernes, drinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but water, and many times wanting that?

And as the Hebrewes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to eate but once a daye, which was at dinner, ſo the Grecians onely ſupped.

And truly I thinke that theſe men being paſt ſhame, care but little for the glorie that hath beene in many ages, ſeeing they liue for the body onely, after a brutiſh impietie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all regard of the foule, or of the ſecond life. What ſay <note place="margin">Sobrietie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth health.</note>I for the body? Nay rather they are the deſtroiers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſeeing it cannot be denied but that ſobrietie is a great benefit, and helpe to preſerue health and bodily ſtrength, and to expell diſeaſes, and is to be vſed as a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attaine to a happy old age. The experience heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is well knowne to euery one, although there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe but this, that we ſee the ſimple ſort of people, that labor and trauell to liue with bread and water, grow old in health, whereas our Princes and great Lords being delicately brought vp in idlenes, die yoong men, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with infinite diſeaſes, eſpecially when they grow a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in yeeres. Further, let ſuch diſſolute men as make plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ende of their deſire, know, that ſobrietie leadeth thoſe that follow her, to farre greater and more perfect <note place="margin">There is more pleaſure of the creatures in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, than in ſuperfluitie.</note>pleaſures, than incontinencie and ſuperfluitie doe. For theſe exceſſiue fellowes neuer expect hunger, or thirſt, or any other pleaſure of the bodye, but through intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance preuent them, and ſo enioy ſcarce half the pleaſure. But ſober and temperate men, forbearing the fruition of their deſire a long time, haue a farre more perfect taſte of them, bicauſe (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) the pleaſure of life conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth rather in the deſire, than in the ſatietie thereof. And if mediocrity be not obſerued, thoſe things that are moſt acceptable and pleaſant, become moſt vnpleaſant. Do we not alſo ſee, that when the body is not ouercharged with
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8689:115"/>
meate and wine, it is better diſpoſed, and more temperate for euery good action? And as for the ſpirite, for which we ought chiefly to liue, it is more ready and nimble to comprehend and conceiue what right, reaſon, and true honeſtie are. For (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) ſobrietie cauſeth men to iudge better and according to truth, of all things, and in that reſpect is very neceſſary for the attaining of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophye. Likewiſe ſobrietie retaineth that in a wiſe mans thought, which a foole without diſcretion hath in his mouth. And therefore (ſaith <hi>Cares)</hi> we muſt ſtriue by all <note place="margin">The belly is an vnthankfull beaſt.</note>meanes to reſtraine our belly, bicauſe that only is alwaies vnthankfull for the pleaſures done vnto it, crauing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and oftener than it needeth: ſo that whoſoeuer is not able to command ouer it, wil daily heape vp miſchiefe vpon miſchiefe to himſelfe. But frugalitie and ſobrietie are the miſtreſſes of good counſell, and the badges of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie. For this cauſe <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> commendeth more the barrennes and ſterilitie of a countrey, than fertilitie and fruitfulnes, ſaying that men borne in a fat &amp; fertile ſoile, are commonly do-littles, and cowards: but contrariwiſe, the barrennes of a countrey, maketh men ſober of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and conſequently carefull, vigilant, and giuen to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor: as the Athenians were, being ſituated in a very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull place. We make great account (ſaith <hi>Paulonius)</hi> of frugalitie, not bicauſe we eſteeme the creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vile, and of ſmall value, but that by meanes thereof we may encreaſe the greatnes of our courage. And if the greateſt &amp; chiefeſt benefit that could come to man, were (ſaid <hi>Solon)</hi> to haue no need of nouriſhment, it is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the next to that is to haue neede but of a little.

at a ſober and ſimple repaſt (for the greateſt feſtiual dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were oliues, cheeſe, apples, colewoorts, bread &amp; wine) ſaid, that they which ſup with <hi>Plato,</hi> feele the benefit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">How wiſe men in old time fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>the next day, yea a long time after. For theſe wiſe men met togither at bankets void of exceſſe, not to fill their bellies, but to prepare and dreſſe their minds, &amp; to learne one of another by their goodly diſcourſes of Philoſophie, whereof a vertuous ſoule hath better taſte, than the body of a well reliſhed and delicate meale. Such were the feaſts of <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Xenocrates,</hi> and of other Sages of Grecia, where the diſcuſſing of good and learned matters there handled, brought through the remembrance of them great pleaſure, and no leſſe liked commoditie, and that of long continuance to ſuch as were preſent at them. And as for the pleaſures of drinking and eating, they iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the very remembrance thereof to be vnwoorthie and vnbeſeeming men of honor, bicauſe it was to paſſe away <note place="margin">Againſt vaine delights in feaſts.</note>as the ſmell of a perfume. Neither would they ſuffer that men ſhould bring into their aſſemblies the vanitie of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh delights, as of the ſound of inſtruments, of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, or of any other paſtime, which a wiſe man ought rather to eſteeme as a hinderance of delight, than any pleaſure at all. For hauing within themſelues ſufficient matter of recreation and reioicing, through their learned diſcourſes, it were meere follie to beg ſtrange and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous delights from without them. And <hi>Plutark</hi> ſaith, that <note place="margin">The bellie a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding beaſt.</note>the brutiſh part of the ſoule, depending of the feeding beaſt, and vncapeable of reaſon, is that which is pleaſed, brought to order, &amp; ſatiſfied by ſongs and ſounds, which are ſung and tuned vnto it: euen as with the whiſtling of lips or hands, or with the ſound of a pipe, ſheepeheards cauſe their ſheepe to ariſe, or lie downe, bicauſe they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not an articulate or diſtinct ſpeech, that hath ſome pith in it. Therefore I commend <hi>Euripides,</hi> for repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending ſuch as vſe the harpe, ſo long as a feaſt laſteth: <note place="margin">When muſicke is moſt conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note>for (quoth he) muſicke ought rather to be ſent for, when men are angrie, or mourne, than when they are feaſting or making merry, thereby to make them giue more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

to all pleaſure, than before. I ſuppoſe the Egyptians <note place="margin">The cuſtome of the Egyptians at bankets.</note>did better, who vſed in the midſt of their bankets to bring in the Anatomie of a dead bodie dried, that the horror thereof might containe them in all modeſtie. For this cauſe the memorie of the Emperour Henrie the third, greatly recommendeth it ſelfe, who baniſhed all pompe and vanitie from his wedding, and draue away the plaiers &amp; ieſters, cauſing a great number of poore folke to come in their place. The cuſtom which the Lacedemonians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, <note place="margin">The cuſtome of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note>when they liued vnder <hi>Lycurgus</hi> lawes, is alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be remembred: which was, that no torches or lights ſhould be brought vnto them, when they departed from feaſtes at night, that it might be an occaſion vnto them to feare drunkennes, and ſo to auoid this ſhame, that they onely could not find out their houſes. Now in thoſe happie times vines were planted and dreſſed, that wine might be drunke rather in time of ſickenes, than of health: inſomuch that it was not ſold in Tauernes, but onely in Apothecaries ſhops. Thoſe ancient Sages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly meaſured their drinking by that ſaying of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charſis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The manner of drinking in old time.</note>that the firſt draught which men drunke, ought to be for thirſt, the ſecond for nouriſhment: and as for the third, that it was of pleaſure, and the fourth of madnes. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> being much more religious in this matter, and liuing onely of herbs, fruite, and water, ſaid: that the vine brought foorth three grapes, whereof the firſt quencheth thirſt, the ſecond troubleth, and the third altogither dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. He neuer dranke wine, no more did that great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> nor many other famous men, of whome hiſtories make mention. The kings of Egypt were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wine, which they neuer dranke, except on certaine daies, and then by meaſure. And truly it bringeth with it pernitious effects, aſwell to the ſoule, as to the bodie. For from it proceedeth the chiefe and moſt common cauſe of bodilie diſeaſes, and of the infirmities of the ſoule. But to continue the examples of loue, which the Ancients bare <note place="margin">The ſobrietie of Alexander.</note>to the vertue of ſobrietie, this was it that cauſed <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great to refuſe thoſe Cookes and Paiſterers, which

                     <hi>Ada</hi> Queene of Caria ſent vnto him, &amp; to ſend her word backe againe, that he had better than they were: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for his dinner, early riſing, and walking a good while before day: and for his ſupper, a little dinner. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in the ende the Perſian delicacies and riches (which alwaies is the propertie of ſuch goods) cauſed this vertuous monarke to change his commendable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome<note place="margin">Againſt exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue drinking.</note> of liuing, and to approoue and like of exceſſe in drinking: to which vice, that he might giue greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, he propounded ſix hundred crownes for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to him that dranke moſt, and called a great cup af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne name. Which cup, when he offered to <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> one of his fauorits, he refuſed, ſaying: that he would not for drinking in <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſtand in need of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius.</hi> With which the King perceiuing him ſelfe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, was ſo incenſed againſt him, that he cauſed him to be put in a cage with dogs, where he poiſoned himſelfe, being impatient of his captiuitie. Wherein we may note how ridiculous their blockiſhnes is, who for feare, not of ſuch an entertainment as this wiſe man receiued, but of being taken and reputed as void of good fellowſhip, and vnciuill, caſt themſelues into the danger of a ſore ſicknes, rather than they will refuſe to drinke carouſe, when they are inuited thereunto. Hereby alſo thoſe men ſhew their want of iudgement, and of conuenient matter to talke of, who cannot entertaine their friends without dronkennes and gluttonie. And the other, if they knew how to make denial fitly, and in good ſort, beſides the profit which they ſhould receiue thereby, their companie would be more<note place="margin">Cyrus.</note> deſired, than it will be for their dronkennes. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke of the Perſians, from his childhood gane great te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, that he would one daye become a very ſober man. For being demanded by <hi>Aſtyages</hi> his grandfather, why he would drinke no wine, he anſwered, for feare leaſt they giue me poiſon. For (quoth he) I noted yeſterday when you celebrated the daye of your natiuitie, that it could not be, but that ſome bodie had mingled poiſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all that wine, which ye then dranke: bicauſe in

the winding vp of the table, not one of all thoſe that were preſent at the feaſt, was in his right mind. Afterward this vertuous Prince alwaies liued very frugally: for proofe whereof may ſerue his anſwer made one day to <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus,</hi> as he marched in warre, who asked of him what he would haue brought vnto him for his ſupper: Bread, (quoth he,) for I hope we ſhall finde ſome fountaine to furniſh vs with drinke. <hi>Porus</hi> a noble king of India, liued<note place="margin">Porus.</note> with water and bread onely. <hi>Phaotes</hi> alſo king of the ſame<note place="margin">Phaotes.</note> countrey, did the like: and the greateſt feaſtes which he made, or ſuffered his Courtiers to make, was onely with a kind of veniſon. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> king of Arragon, and Cocilia,<note place="margin">Alphouſus.</note> a very ſober man, was demanded of certaine of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, why he dranke no wine: bicauſe (quoth he) wiſdome is hindred through wine, and prudence darkned: which two things onely are able to make a king worthy of that name he beareth. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> king of Lacedemonia, hauing<note place="margin">Ageſilaus.</note> beene alwaies brought vp in the diſcipline of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who had baniſhed all riot and ſuperfluitie from that citie, by the vtter defacing and aboliſhing of gold and ſiluer, became very woonderfull, by reaſon of his ſimplicity and plainnes, in feeding and clothing his bodie, and in beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himſelfe as the meaneſt of his ſubiects. He vſed to ſay (which he likewiſe put in vre) that he which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ruled many, ought to ſurpaſſe them, not in dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and delicacie, but in ſuſtaining labor, and in nobilitie of hart. The benefit which (as he ſaid) he reaped thereby, was libertie, whereof he aſſured himſelfe, that he could neuer be depriued by any alteration and change of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. And as he paſſed with his armie by the countrey of the Thaſians, they ſent him certaine refreſhing of ſloure, &amp; of daintie cates, as comfits, and other daintie deuices made of paaſt: but he would take nothing ſaue onely the floure.

                     <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> after he had ouercome Spaine, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed of notable victories, albeit he was now old and very rich, yet he would adde nothing to his ancient ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of liuing, which was very auſtere, but dranke almoſt nothing but water, and for the moſt part did eat nothing but bread and biefe, laboring in the field in time of peace<note place="margin">Epaminondas.</note> as much as the meaneſt of his ſeruants. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the greateſt captain &amp; philoſopher of his time, liued ſo thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and temperately, that being inuited by a friend of his to ſupper, and ſeeing great ſuperfluitie and ſumptuoſnes, he returned very angry, ſaying, that he thought he had been requeſted to ſacrifice, and to liue honeſtly together, and not to receiue reproch by being entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">C.

friends (for in his time riot had alredy begun to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rome) but going aſide himſelf, he would eate nothing but bread. <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> king of the Numidians, was of ſo great<note place="margin">Maſiniſſa.</note> ſobrietie, that euen at ninetie yeeres of age he would eate but once a day, and then vpon homely meates without ſauce. <hi>Mithridates</hi> king of Pontus, being very old, neuer<note place="margin">Mithridates.</note> ſate downe at the table to eate, and liued very frugallie. <hi>Hannibal</hi> fed vpon no other meat, than did the meaneſt of<note place="margin">Hannibal.</note> his ſouldiers. The reaſon why I ſtay longer in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this vertue of ſobrietie, is to ſhew the beaſtlines of men in our age, to whom it ſeemeth an impoſſible, vayne and contemptible thing, to liue in ſuch ſparing and auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of life: ſaying, that there were none but certain foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Philoſophers (for that is the Epithite, which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſort giue to vertuous men) &amp; ſome ſimple Hermites, who liued after that maner. Therefore that they may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeele their eyes, let them behold here, how in all ſorts and conditions of men, euen in the greateſt, the vertue of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, frugalitie and ſobrietie, did appeere and ſhine. The emperor <hi>Veſpaſianus</hi> one day in euery moneth vſed to<note place="margin">Veſpaſianus.</note> eate nothing. The prieſts of Egypt, the ſages of India and Perſia, and Iupiters prieſts ſeruing falſe gods did neuer eate any fleſh, nor drinke wine. Notable examples for thoſe that haue the firſt places in the Church, who ought to be as a lampe in the midſt thereof. Neither may they take example by Ethnikes and Pagans onely, but alſo by many holy men, who had in them the true loue and feare of God. <hi>Daniel</hi> and his companions neglecting the Kings<note place="margin">Daniel.</note> table, liued with pulſe and water onely. S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">Iohn Baptist.</note> ouer the greateſt part of his age in the deſert, cating nothing but Locuſts and wilde hony.

But to the end we may reape pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by all that hath been here ſpoken, let vs learne of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:8689:119"/>
that the ſoule which hath gotten the habite of frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and is contented with her eſtate, paſſeth away her dais in this world, as he that in the ſpring time taketh ſmall &amp; eaſie iournies in a pleaſant and fruitful region, with great contentation of mind and litle labour.

Let vs adorne and decke our life with this good and rare vertue of ſobrietie, which wil teach vs to renounce world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanitie, and to content our ſelues (next vnto God) in vertue onely, and in heauenly riches. And although deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of fare be ſo common amongſt vs Frenchmen, and maintained with ſuch impudencie, that we permit amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs, and ſtudie kitchin Commentaries, as much as any good Science, ſo that it may ſeem a very difficult matter to take it away, and baniſh it from amongſt vs, yet is it not altogether impoſſible, as many thinke. But let vs follow that ancient precept of <hi>Pythagoras, To chuſe the best kinde of life,</hi> and no doubt but cuſtome will by litle and litle make it eaſie &amp; pleaſant vnto vs. And if we be deſpiſed &amp; rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of others, we may anſwer as <hi>Socrates</hi> did, who being <note place="margin">Socrates feaſt.</note>reprooued becauſe he had made no greater preparation of meat in a feaſt wherunto he inuited many of his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, ſayd, If they be vertuous, there is enough, and if they be not, there is too much. So let vs not ſeeke to pleaſe and to imitate the moſt part of men, but the beſt and ſmalleſt number: neither let vs looke vnto cuſtome, but to that which is decent and honeſt. But if we perſeuer in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutenes &amp; ſuperfluitie, as if we were Chriſtians in name and ſect onely, but Epicures in life, we are to feare that in the end need and neceſſitie will force vs to forſake it. And as it fell out to king <hi>Darius,</hi> who after he had liued a long <note place="margin">Darius in his thirſt, iudged puddle water to be good drinke.</note>time in all abundance of delights, and neuer knew what hunger or thirſt meant, as he fled from the battell gotten by Alexander was very thirſtie: and after he had drunke puddle water proceeding from a riuer tainted with dead bodies, he burſt foorth into this ſpeech, that in all his life

                  <p>Good things (ſaid <hi>Lycurgus)</hi> are contrary and enemies to him that abuſeth the gifts of nature: as if a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man ſhould loue rather to be a theefe, than a ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: or a beautifull perſon an adulterer, rather than a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man. So is it with the goods of Fortune, as we terme them, the poſſeſſion of which giueth occaſion to thoſe that are vnwoorthie of them, to commit many follies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which we may note ſuperfluitie for a verie perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vice, hauing this propertie in it to draw the wils of men ſecretly, &amp; to induce them to couet delights. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto after they haue once addicted themſelues, they buſie their mindes with nothing but to make prouiſion of fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous, exquiſite, and ſumptuous things, taking ſmal care, yea forgetting eaſily thoſe things that are profitable and neceſſarie, whereof afterwards they perceiue themſelues <note place="margin">Pleaſure the end of ſuperfluitie.</note>to ſtand in great need. Now the end of all ſuperfluities, wherein men plung themſelues after diuers manners, is pleaſure, which chiefly and for the moſt part they ſeeke in ſuch a riotous and delicate life, as cauſeth the bodie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labor to enioy all his deſires, luſtes, and delights: or elſe in the fruition of worldlie glorie, wherein through vnprofitable and ſuperfluous expences, they ſtriue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, or at leaſtwiſe to match thoſe that are greater than themſelues. Concerning the marke whereat they aime, there is nothing more hurtfull to man, than pleaſure and delight, which (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) ſerueth for a baite and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement to draw him to commit wickednes, as hereafter we may diſcourſe in more ample manner thereof, as alſo of that luxurious life, whoſe deſire and contentation is in whoredome.

Euen to them that tarie long at the wine: to them that go and ſeeke mixt wine, which in the beginning is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, but in the end pricketh like a ſerpent, and poiſoneth like a Cockatrice. And in another place, the wiſe man ſpeaking of gluttonie, faith: that it drieth the bones, and that more die by it than by the ſword. We ſee that beaſts fatted vp languiſh through ſloth and idlenes: neither do beaſts faint through labor onely, but alſo by reaſon of the maſſe and heauie weight of their owne bodies. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the vice of gluttonie and drunkennes is neuer alone, but draweth with it a thouſand other exceſſiue and diſſolute faſhions. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) it ſtirreth vp luſt, griefe, anger, and loue in extremitie, and extinguiſheth memorie, opinion, and vnderſtanding. Brieflye, it maketh a man twiſe a childe. And in another place, the ſame Philoſopher ſaith, that gluttonie fatteth the bodye, maketh the minde dull and vnapt, and which is worſe, vndermineth reaſon. Wine hath as much force as fire. For as ſoone as it hath ouertaken any, it diſpatcheth him. And as the North or Southwind tormenteth the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian ſea, ſo, and much more doth wine vexe a man. For it diſcloſeth the ſecrets of the ſoule, &amp; troubleth the whole mind.

This was ſo much the more wonderfull, bicauſe ſo great and ſumptuous a feaſt was made ready in ſo ſhort a time.

                     <note place="margin">The beginning of ciuil warres.</note>the Philoſopher ſaid very well) ſtirreth vp ciuill warres, ſeditions, and tyrannies within cities, to the end that ſuch voluptuous men, and ambitious of vaine glorie, fiſhing in a troubled water, may haue wherewith to maintaine their fooliſh expences, and ſo come to the ende of their plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes. Heerof we haue many examples in the ciuil wars amongſt the Romanes, as namely vnder <hi>Cinna, Carbo, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and <hi>Sylla.</hi> Likewiſe in the conſpiracie of <hi>Catiline</hi> &amp; his complices, who being of the chiefe families in Rome, and perceiuing themſelues to be brought to the eſtate of bankrupts, as we commonly ſay, ſought by all meanes to proſecute their firſt deliberation, which was alwaies to ſeeme great and mightie. Thus dealt <hi>Caeſar</hi> in procuring to his countrey that ciuill warre, which he made againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> after he had indebted himſelfe in ſeuen hundred and fiftie thouſand crownes, to get the fauor and good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">How Heraclitus diſſwaded ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie.</note>of the people.

Which being done, he came downe againe, and ſpake ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a word.

Whereby alſo forraine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants (the cauſe of corruption) baniſhed themſelues, as they that ſeeke not after others but for gaine, by ſelling their nouelties very deere vnto them. Neither did the Romane Commonwealth floriſh more at any time, than when thoſe men that caried about them perfumes and ſweeteſmels, and thoſe women that were found ſwilling like drunkards, were corrected with the ſame puniſhment.

But they ought rather both to abſtaine from ſuch vanities themſelues, and alſo to ſeeke by all meanes to baniſh them from their ſubiects: and where their owne example and bodilie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are not ſufficient for this purpoſe, there ought <note place="margin">Commendable impoſts for Princes to lay vpon their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</note>they to lay great impoſts vpon all ſuch things as ſerue but to ſpill and corrupt their ſubiects. Such things are all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite dainties and prouocations of appetite, all ſorts of toies and trifles, perfumes, cloth of gold and ſiluer, ſilkes, ſypers, networks, lace, wouen works, &amp; all works of gold, ſiluer, and inammell: all kind of ſuperfluous apparel, with colours of skarlet, crimſon, and ſuch like, the forbidding whereof hitherto hath profited little. For the nature of men is ſuch, that they find nothing more ſweete and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, than that which is ſtraightly forbidden them: ſo that the more ſuperfluities are prohibited, the more they are deſired, eſpecially of fooliſh men, &amp; of ſuch as are vainely brought vp. Therefore it were good to raiſe the price of theſe things ſo high by meanes of impoſts, that none but rich men and daintie folks may vſe them. And ſuch ſubſidies would aſmuch ſet forward the glorie of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8689:125"/>
God, the profite of the common wealth, the deſire of good men, and reliefe of the poore, as many others now vſed are quite contrary hereunto. Then theſe ſpeeches would no more be ſo common amongſt vs, as now we heare them daily vttered by our Courtiers: We will (ſay they) keep company and be ſeen amongſt the greateſt, &amp; be eſteemed thereafter. If we ſpend not freely, men will make no account of vs. It is our honor and greatnes, and the way to procure glory and renowne to our houſes and families. But I would gladly tell a great number of them, that they would be very much troubled to make anſwer to a law made by <hi>Amaſis</hi> king of Egypt, and after eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed <note place="margin">A good law to cut off the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of idle expences.</note>in Athens by <hi>Solon,</hi> whereby it was enacted, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould yeerely make it appeere vnto his Prouoſt or Bailie how he liued, and if he approoued not his maner &amp; trade of life to be iuſt and reaſonable, he was condemned to die. If in like caſe theſe great ſpenders were to giue an account from whence they receiue wherewith to ſatiſfie their pride and vanities, a man ſhould find that their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe (as we ſay) is far better vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than their rents, &amp; that they commit a thouſand wrongs and deteſtable vices to make ſupply to their lauiſh expences. As for them that haue goods lawfully gotten, yet in ſpending of them waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, they giue ſufficient teſtimonie, that they care &amp; ſeeke for nothing but a vaine and vaniſhing glory, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, contrary to their expectation, is waited vpon with great infamie, and with the certaintie of perpetual puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in the meane while they neglect that glorie which is eternall and always profitable, which they ſhould enioy by well vſing, and not by miſpending their goods, whereof they are but Gardians and Stewards, &amp; muſt one day yeeld vp an account of them. O witleſſe man (ſayd one of the ancient Sages) what will the remembraunce of vaine glory profite thee, if thou art tormented and vexed where thou art, and praiſed where thou art not. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth a longer continuance of ſpeech, but we may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after diſcourſe thereof more at large.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:8689:127"/>
comprehend the forme, greatnes, and beautie therof, and afterwards be burnt of it, as the Poets report, that <hi>Phaeton</hi> was: ſuch a hardie and bold paſſion to vndertake moſt <note place="margin">The force of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to enioy any pleaſure.</note>difficult &amp; dangerous things, is the deſire of enioying any pleaſure whatſoeuer. This may chiefly be ſpoken of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the moſt vehement, ſtrongeſt, &amp; moſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all thoſe deſires which ſo ſore trouble mens minds, and fil them with an inſatiable greedines of glory, <note place="margin">Two kinds of ambition.</note>and with an vnbrideled deſire to rule. But to handle it more profitably, we will make two kinds of ambition, the one reſpecting priuate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only that liue vnder the power and gouernment of heads, of eſtates and pollicies: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhal be of the heads themſelues, of monarchs and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors of peoples and kingdoms. In the meane time we <note place="margin">What ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note>may thus generally define ambition, calling it an vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deſire to enioy honors, eſtates, &amp; great places. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is a vice of exceſſe, and contrary to modeſty, which is a part of temperance. For that man (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith) is modeſt, who deſireth honor as he ought, and ſo farre foorth as it becommeth him: but he that deſireth it more than he ought, and by vnlawful means, is ambitious, and <note place="margin">The effects of ambition.</note>caried away with a perturbation of intemperance. Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neuer ſuffreth thoſe that haue once receiued hir as a gueſt, to enioy their preſent eſtate quietly, but maketh them always emptie of goods, and full of hope. It cauſeth them to contemne that, which they haue gotten by great paines and trauel, and which not long before they deſired very earneſtly, by reaſon of their new imaginations and conceites of greater matters, which they continually barke foorth, but neuer haue their minds ſatiſfied &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. And the more they growe and increaſe in power and authoritie, the rather are they induced and caried headlong by their affections to commit all kind of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and flatter themſelues in furious and frantike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they may come to the end of their infinite plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>of that proud and tyrannicall glory, which, contrary to all dutie they ſeeke after. Theſe imperfections happen vnto them, bicauſe from the beginning they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8689:127"/>
to hoord, and heape vp externall, mortall and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful riches, before they had laid a good foundation of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">The cauſe of ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</note>through knowledge and learning, thereby to direct aright their purpoſes and doings, according to comelines and honeſtie. And therfore oftentimes they are deceiued and miſſe of their intent, and euen looſe that which they might haue had, becauſe they ſought ouer boldly to laie hands on that which they could not ſo much as touch. So that we may wel ſay with <hi>Timon,</hi> that the elements &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of miſchiefs, are ambition &amp; auarice, which are found both together for the moſt part in the ſame perſons. But to enter into a more particular conſideration of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Enuie a note of an ambitious man.</note>of euery ambitious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he hath commonly this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, to enuie the glory of others: whereby he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth odious, and ſtirreth vp againſt himſelf the enuy and ill will of euery one. Moreouer this his ielouſie ouer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans glory, is ſo much the more hurtfull vnto him in that he might, being ſet in high eſtate and authoritie, vſe the helpe and company of ſuch as are vertuous and noble minded in the execution of great matters, if in ſtead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them for his aduerſaries in the purſuite of vertue, he fauored them, and drew them neere vnto himſelf. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may iudge, that there is none ſo pernitious a plague for the ouerthrow of vertue, as ambition, bicauſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without contention for glory and honor, euen againſt the greateſt friends, from whence in the end proceed the greateſt enmities. <hi>Cicero</hi> alſo ſaith very well, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath this qualitie, that many things of the ſame kind cannot be excellent, thereof ariſeth for the moſt part ſuch ſtrife, that it is a very hard matter to obſerue holy ſociety. For equitie is not eaſilie kept inuiolable, when one deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be greater than all the reſt. It commeth through <note place="margin">Sedition a fruit of ambition.</note>the fault of ambition (ſaith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> that many ſeditions ariſe in cities. For the mightier, not the vulgar ſort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for honors and promotions. But if, as <hi>Plato</hi> writeth, there were a Common-wealth of good men, you ſhould ſee as great ſtrife for the auoiding of offices, as now men contend to command and rule. Alſo the honor of a good
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8689:128"/>
man (ſaith <hi>Plutark</hi> to <hi>Traian)</hi> conſiſteth not in that eſtate or office which he preſently inioieth, but in his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; ſo that it is to the office wherunto men giue new ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as for the perſon he hath but a painful charge. Out of the ſayings of theſe great Philoſophers, we will draw this concluſion, that we muſt labor more to deſerue eſtates &amp; honors, than dare to procure them, and account that thing vnwoorthie and vnbeſeeming vs, which is obtained by vnlawfull meanes. Now, as the ambitious man is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in all his actions, ſo eſpecially he bringeth himſelfe in deriſion and reproch, through this burning deſire of glorie and praiſe, which he looketh that others ſhould yeeld vnto him, and wherein he taketh vnmeaſurable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Now, if he perceiueth that he cannot be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Ambitious men full of ſelfe-praiſe.</note>for his doings that are vnworthie of honor, the thirſt of glorie wherewith he pineth away, compelleth him to borow of himſelfe by his owne commendation againſt all ſeemelines: which is neither more nor leſſe, than if the bodie of a man in time of famine, not receiuing nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment elſewhere, ſhould take of it owne ſubſtance againſt nature. Further, if we ſhould go about heere to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall of thoſe notable euils and miſchiefs, which the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of ſome particular men hath brought vpon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, cities, and Commonwealths, and generally vpon all thoſe perſons which were vnder their bloudie raigne, the whole life of one man would not ſuffice to deſcribe them. But to touch this point briefly: we may note in all ancient hiſtories, that the greateſt plagues of flouriſhing <note place="margin">Ciuill warres a fruite of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>eſtates, and oftentimes their vtter ſubuerſion, came from ciuill warres and diſſentions ſtirred vp by ambitious men, deſirous to command, and to be preferred before others. What did at any time procure the ruine of Grecia, flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in armes and ſciences, ſo much as the ambition of thoſe men who ſought to bring the publike offices into their owne hands, as <hi>Leoſthenes, Demoſthenes,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, who were not afraid to kindle the fire of dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall diuiſion, not caring what would be the iſſue of their damnable enterpriſes, ſo they might make waie for their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8689:128"/>
deuiſed platformes? How many miſchiefs did <hi>Alcibiades</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Alcibiades.</note>procure to his countrey, being an enimie to peace, and giuen to all kind of nouelties and ſeditions? Who vſed to ſay, that a noble hart ought to labor but for one thing in this world, namely, to be great among his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, and to purchaſe fame &amp; renowne among ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Which had been well ſpoken, if he had added, by <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue.</hi> Was it not from the ſame fountaine of ambition, that ſo hurtfull wars to both thoſe Common-wealths of the Lacedemonians and Athenians, the one being maiſters of the ſea, and the other of the land, tooke their beginning, and thereby were both brought to ruine in the end? Was it not the ſame cauſe of ambition in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine particular men, which procured the ſpeedie returne of that good king <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> to redreſſe the ciuill diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grecia, when he was in Aſia continuing thoſe goodlie victories, which he had againſt the Barbarians, for the comfort and libertie of many Grecian cities? O yee Grecians (ſaid that wiſe Prince, being then verie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull) howe many more miſchiefes doe yee procure to your ſelues, than were procured vnto you by the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians banded togither for your ouerthrow, ſeeing yee are <note place="margin">A very fit admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition for France.</note>ſo vnhappie as to ſtaye with your owne hands that good ſpeede, which conducted you to the top of felicitie, and to turne backe into your owne entrailes, thoſe weapons which were ſo well guided againſt your enimies, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling backe the warre into your owne countrey, from whence it was ſo happily baniſhed? The great and large ſcope of the Romane Empire ouer three partes of the <note place="margin">Caeſar &amp; Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</note>world, could not ſatisfie the ambition of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> whileſt the one could abide no equall, and the other no ſuperior: inſomuch, that they omitted and forgat no meanes to increaſe their greatnes, although it were with the charges of the Common-wealth. As we may read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who, to ground &amp; vnderprop his power well for continuance, gaue at one time to <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the Conſul, nine hundred thouſand crownes, for feare leſt he ſhould oppoſe himſelfe againſt his enterpriſes: and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8689:129"/>
to <hi>Curio</hi> the Tribune he gaue fifteene hundred thouſand crownes, that he ſhould take his part. After the death of<note place="margin">The Triumui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> theſe two Princes, that great dominion could no better content the Triumuirate, namely, <hi>Octauius, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who by force of armes ceaſed not to put their countrey to ſword and fire, vntill the ſoueraigne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie became reſident in one alone. But why ſhould we ſeeke among the Ancients, or amongſt our neighbours for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the pernitious effects of this vice, ſeing we haue ſo many at our owne gates? Who kindled that fire in France, which had taken hold of all the parts thereof, and<note place="margin">The ambition of the Dukes of Orleans and Burgundy.</note> almoſt conſumed it vtterly vnder the raigne of the Dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, who ſtroue togither for the gouernment of the kingdome? Were there not vpon the ſame occaſion more than foure thouſand men ſlaine in one daye within Paris, the moſt of them being men of name, at the inſtigation and procurement of the Duke of Burgundy, who had taken poſſeſſion thereof? But alas the continuall and preſent remembrance of our late and vnſpeakeable miſeries, procured chiefly from the ſame fountaine of ambition, and knowne to women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſtaieth me from ſeeking farther for teſtimonies of this our preſent matter. Yea, I feare greatly, that we ſhall ſhortly ſee (I would to God I might be deceiued) the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and intire ruine of our Monarchie, which hath flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed as long as euer any did, and continued longer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanquiſhed of ſtrangers. For we ſee hir owne children ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing their hands in hir bloud, and ſeeking to plucke out<note place="margin">Ambitious men can be no good counſellers to Princes.</note> hir hart and intrailes, and to caſt them as a pray before hir enimies. O how would Princes chaſe farre from them all ambitious perſons, if they were well inſtructed in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and in the knowledge of thoſe euils which ſuch men procure! ſeeing it is impoſſible that any good counſell ſhould proceed from them, but onely ſuch as tendeth to the aduancement of their priuate greatnes. Now if ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the mother of ciuill warres, is it not the ſame alſo of all other warres, which are daily bred betweene Kings &amp; Princes, through the deſire of increaſing their bounds,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8689:129"/>
of ſeazing vpon other mens territories, to the treading downe, oppreſſion, and ruine of their poore ſubiects, and oftentimes of their owne eſtats? Is it not ambition which blindeth men ſo, that they are not content to be chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a million of others ouer whom they command, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they be equal or ſuperior to one or two of thoſe whom they know to be greater than themſelues? The deſire of hauing more (ſaith <hi>Plutark)</hi> is a vice common to Princes<note place="margin">Effects of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in great men.</note> and great Lords, which, by reaſon of ambition and deſire to rule, bringeth foorth in them oftentimes an vnſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cruell, and beaſtly nature. And as <hi>Ennius</hi> ſaith, there is no faith or aſſured ſocietie in kingdomes. For they, whoſe greedines neither ſea, nor mountaines, nor inhabitable deſerts can ſtaie, and whoſe inſatiable deſire of hauing, cannot be limited with thoſe bounds, which ſeparate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia from Europe, how will they content themſelues with their owne, and not ſeeke to vſurpe that which belongeth to another, eſpecially when their confines and borders touch one another, and are ioined ſo neere togither, that nothing is betweene them? It is impoſſible. And in truth, how ſoeuer they diſſemble, they purpoſely warre one with another, watching continually for meanes to ſurprize and ouerreach each other. But in outward ſhew they vſe theſe<note place="margin">The names of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Warre</hi> abuſed much by Princes.</note> two words of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Warre,</hi> as a peece of monie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it ſhall make beſt for their purpoſe, not for duties ſake, or vpon reaſon and iuſtice, but for their owne profite and aduantage, wickedly diſguiſing in that manner the intermiſſion and ſurceaſing from the execution of their ill will and purpoſe, with the holie name of iuſtice and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. Princes therfore muſt not thinke it ſtrange, if ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time priuate men (howbeit that doth not excuſe them) find the like dealing profitable vnto them, according as it falleth out for their purpoſe. For in ſo doing, they do but imitate and follow them that are their maiſters in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loialtie, treaſon, and infidelitie, thinking that he beſtirreth himſelfe, who leaſt of all obſerueth that which equitie and iuſtice require. This did <hi>Dionides</hi> the pirat fitly giue <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great to vnderſtand, when he asked of him why

                  <p>It is no new opinion, that many iudging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſenſualitie, and being altogither igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true nature and immortality of the ſoule, haue placed their ſoueraigne <hi>Good</hi> in pleaſure, and in the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things which moſt of all tickle the ſences. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtippus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Who they were that placed their chiefe <hi>Good</hi> in pleaſure.</note>and all the Cyrinaiks, <hi>Epicurus, Metrodorus, Chryſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> and many others, who falſly tooke vnto themſelues the name of Philoſophers, laboured to prooue it by many arguments, cloking their wickednes with graue and loftie words, ſaying: that none could perfectly attaine to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, except he were vertuous and wiſe. But that which <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> alleadgeth againſt them, is ſufficient to diſcouer the maske of their impudencie, and to conuince them of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: namely, that we muſt not ſimply looke to mens ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but conſider whether they agree in their opinions. For how is it poſſible, that he which placeth his chiefe <hi>Good</hi> in the pleaſure of the bodie, and in neuer-feeling griefe, ſhould make account of, or imbrace vertue, which is an enimie to delights and pleaſures, and commandeth vs rather to ſuffer a cruell and dolorous death, than to ſtart aſide againſt dutie? It is certaine, that he which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his chiefe. <hi>Good</hi> in pleaſure, hath no regard to do any thing but for his priuate profit. Whereby he declareth ſufficiently, that he careth not at all for vertue, eſpecially iuſtice, which commandeth nothing ſo much, as to leaue our owne particular pleaſure and profit, and to imbrace, though with our perill &amp; loſſe, the publike welfare. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, how could he be couragious, if he thought that grief were the extreameſt and greateſt euill, or temperate, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing pleaſure to be perfect felicitie?

                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:8689:133"/>
whereof brute beaſtes haue better part than we, and to leaue the care of that which is diuine and immortal in vs, to attend to that which is mortall and ſubiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But theſe erronious and falſe opinions, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to themſelues, are ſo abſurd and full of blockiſh ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that we neede not here looſe much time in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing them, and conuincing them of lies. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it being ſo common a thing with men, to imbrace pleaſure as the principall end of their actions, bicauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally they deſire pleaſure, and ſhun griefe: it will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for vs to ſhew, that ignorance only guideth them, when being depriued of the knowledge of that <hi>Good</hi> which is to be wiſhed for, and is pleaſant and acceptable, they ſeeke after, through an euill choice, the greateſt miſchiefe of all, I meane pleaſure, vnſeparably followed of griefe, which men labour moſt of all to eſchew. Let vs then ſee what <note place="margin">What pleaſure is.</note>pleaſure is, and what fruites ſhe bringeth with hir. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſnes or pleaſure (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is properly called that delight, which mooueth and tickleth our ſences, which ſlideth and ſlippeth away, and for the moſt part leaueth behind it occaſions rather of repentance, than of calling it again to remembrance. For many through wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vnneceſſarie pleaſure haue fallen intogreat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, receiued great loſſes, and ſuffred many reproches. It alwaies (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> bringeth damage and loſſe to man, ingendring in his mind ſorow, ſottiſhnes, forgetfulnes of prudence, and inſolencie. Whereſoeuer ſweete is (ſaith <note place="margin">The fruits of pleaſure.</note>
                     <hi>Antipho)</hi> there preſently followeth ſowre. For voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes neuer goeth alone, but is alwaies accompanied with ſorow and griefe. Pleaſure (ſaith <hi>Plutark)</hi> reſolueth mens bodies, mollifieng them daily through delights, the continuall vſe of which mortifieth their vigor, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth their ſtrength, from whence abundance of diſeaſes proceedeth, ſo that a man may ſee in youth the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the weakenes of old age. Voluptuouſnes is a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell beaſt, making men hir ſlaues, and chaining them (as <hi>Sophocles</hi> ſaith) with diamond chaines. She is ſo much the

more odious, by how much the more ſhe hideth hir ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, putting vpon hir the garment of good liking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying vertue, and killing a man euen when ſhe flattereth him.

For whoſoeuer beleeueth me, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that which ſeemeth faire, &amp; cleauing to thoſe things which outwardly appeere auſtere and hard, he receiueth in the end an eternall felicitie.

And truly there is nothing more certaine, than that immoderate vſe of the venereous act ſpoileth beautie, defileth the bodie, drieth it vp, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it to ſtinke, maketh the face pale, wanne or yellow, weakneth the members and ioints, ingendreth Sciaticke goutes, collick paſſions, griefes of the ſtomacke, giddines of the head, or dimnes of ſight, the leproſie and pocks. It <note place="margin">Oſey. 4. 11.</note>ſhortneth life, taketh away the vnderſtanding, darkeneth the memorie, and as the Prophet <hi>Oſey</hi> ſaith, taketh away the hart.

But we haue beſides, many goodlie ſentences and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples of Ethnicks and Pagans, and namely of the iuſt puniſhment, which for the moſt part followed this deteſtable vice hard at the heeles, and which ought to ſtir vs vp to hate it, and to flie from it with all our might, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when adulterie is ioined therwith, which is when <note place="margin">The effects and end of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence.</note>the ſacred knot of mariage is violated and broken.

Is it not then a ſigne of great looſenes and baſenes of mind, for a man to ſubiect himſelfe to carnall concupiſcences, which are diſordered deſires contrarie to reaſon, and whoſe office and practiſe is to chuſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill for good?

Thinkeſt thou that incontinent men are hindred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing that which is honeſt, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to commit vicious things? I thinke they are as much compelled to do the one, as hindered from practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the other. But what maiſters doeſt thou thinke them to be, who forbid well doing, and conſtraine men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace euill? In good truth, very wicked. And doeſt thou not thinke that bondage of all others moſt troubleſome, when one ſerueth moſt wicked and naughtie maiſters? Yea. Then incontinent men are of all others moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer they be. Beſides, he that neuer thinketh vpon goodnes, but ſeeketh by all means to fulfill his vntamed deſires of pleaſure and luſt, hath no more vſe of reaſon, than beaſts haue. This wiſe Philoſopher teacheth vs ſufficiently how hurtfull and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious a thing it is to ſuffer the deſires of the fleſh to raigne in vs, conſidering that they draw vs vehemently to the practiſe of them, to our owne deſtruction: eſpecially <note place="margin">The fruits of whoredom.</note>whoredom, which bringeth with it all kind of miſchiefe, diſſolueth and weakneth the body, and offendeth all the vertues and goods of the ſoule. Through hir it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that men abaſe themſelues ſo lowe, as to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit both their bodies and ſoules to the inconſtant will and vnrulie deſire of a fooliſh woman. For we ſee ſome men ſo bewitched with a harlot, that if neede be, and ſhe commaund it, they will hazard their honour and credit, and oftentimes make themſelues an example to a whole country vpon an open ſcaffold. And then they labor to couer their folly with this goodly name of <hi>Loue,</hi> which is better termed of <hi>Euripides</hi> by the name of <hi>Furie</hi> &amp; madnes in men. For true &amp; good loue, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip, is alwais grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertue, &amp; tendeth
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8689:135"/>
to that ende: but this ſlipperie and looſe loue, is a deſire founded vpon the opinion of a <hi>Good,</hi> which in deede is a moſt pernitious euil. And if adulterie follow vp<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it (which <note place="margin">The miſerable effects of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</note>according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> is a curious inquirie after another mans loue) the vice is two fold more deteſtable and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, bicauſe that he which committeth it, ſeeketh againſt all dutie of nature to take away another mans honor and reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſpoileth him of that which he accounteth moſt precious, namely, of the loue and friendſhip of his wife, breaketh the peace of a houſe, cauſeth the wife to looſe hir ſoule, who otherwiſe peraduenture would not haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if he had not corrupted hir. In a word, it is the cauſe of infinite miſeries &amp; offences which we daily ſee come to paſſe. Amongthe Auncients this vice was ſo odious, that it was narowly ſought out, and chaſticed with very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous puniſhments. In ſo much that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> cauſed one of his captains to be beheaded, bicauſe he had diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the miſtreſſe of the houſe where he lodged, not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vntill one accuſed him, and without any complaint made vnto him by hir husband. There was a law among <note place="margin">Zaleucus law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt adulterie.</note>the <hi>Locrians,</hi> eſtabliſhed by <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> which condemned all thoſe that were conuicted of this vice of adulterie, to haue their eyes puld out. This lawe was afterward ſo well kept, that his ſonne being taken with the fact, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple intreating for him, <hi>Zaleucus</hi> would neuer ſuffer the puniſhment to be any thing leſſened. And yet to ſatiſfie their importunitie in ſome ſort, he cauſed one of his own, and another of his ſonnes eyes to be plucked out, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to beare halfe the puniſhment allotted for the offence, than that it ſhould remaine vnpuniſhed, &amp; the law <note place="margin">The law of lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia againſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterers.</note>violated. <hi>Augustus Caeſar</hi> made the law <hi>Iulia,</hi> intituled <hi>of Adulteries,</hi> wherein is declared, how proceſſe ought to proceed againſt thoſe that are attainted of it, and how ſuch as are conuicted thereof are to be puniſhed, euen to permit the father to kill his daughter being taken in the fact with the adulterer. After that <hi>Fabius Fabritius</hi> was ſlain by his wife through trecherie, to the ende that ſhe might haue greater libertie to commit adulterie, one of his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8689:135"/>
ſons whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came to age ſlew his mother with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterer, &amp; was abſolued therof by the Senate. We read alſo <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note>that the leſt puniſhment vſed by the Egyptians againſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterers, was to cut off the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s noſe, &amp; the priuy parts of the man. Briefly, we ſhall find, that in all nations where honor and ciuilitie is neuer ſo little regarded, this vice of adulterie hath been grieuouſly puniſhed, and greatly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all noble minds. Herein the example of <hi>Alexander</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Alexander ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adulterie.</note>is woorthy to be remembred, who, when a woman was brought vnto him one euening, demanded of hir why ſhe came ſo late: to whom ſhe anſwered, that ſhe ſtayed vntill hir husband was gone to bed. Which he no ſooner heard, but he ſent hir away, being very angry with his men, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had almoſt cauſed him to commit adultery. He would not ſo much as touch his friends Concubine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he loued hir: and he tooke on wonderfully with <hi>Caſſander,</hi> bicauſe he would by force kiſſe a minſtrels maid. So farre off was he from beyng willing to ſuffer his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to force any wiues or daughters of his ſubiects, or to induce them to ſuborne any for him. But contrary wiſe, we ſee now adayes, that they are moſt eſteemed of great <note place="margin">Anthonie duke of Venice.</note>men whoſe skill is greateſt in corrupting of women. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Venereus</hi> duke of Venice may be vnto them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample worthy to be folowed, who cauſed his owne ſonne to die in priſon, bicauſe he had rauiſhed a maid. But let vs <note place="margin">Teſtimonies of Gods wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>note a litle the eye witneſſes of Gods wrath, who neuer, or very ſeldome ſuffreth whoredome to go without preſent payment meete for ſuch peruerſe wickednes. The reading of holy Scriptures doth furniſh vs with notable examples, <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 9. This ſinne of Dauid was in numbring the people, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth, 2.

that ſubtill practiſe to cauſe the Iſraelites to commit ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, it was by meanes of the faire women of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, thereby to cauſe them to fall into the wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God. Concerning hiſtories written by men, the number of examples of Gods wrath vpon whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers is infinite, of which we will heere alleadge ſome, making mention of violent puniſhments, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation and ſubuerſion of flouriſhing eſtates, which <note place="margin">The danger that dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the looſenes of a Prince.</note>haue proceeded from the ſame cauſe of whoredome. And truly it is more dangerous for a Prince in regard of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, than any other vice, yea than crueltie it ſelfe. For crueltie maketh men fearefull, and ſtriketh a terror in the ſubiects, but whoredome draweth with it hatred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Prince: bicauſe euery one iudgeth an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate man vnwoorthie to command a whole people. <note place="margin">Tarquinius.</note>
                     <hi>Tarquinius</hi> king of Rome, for his loftines ſurnamed the proud, was depriued of his kingdome, bicauſe of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which one of his ſonnes offered to <hi>Lucretia,</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ladie. And although he gathered togither great forces, thinking thereby to reenter into his eſtate, yet he could neuer attaine therunto. Since which time the name of a king hath beene ſo odious among the Romanes, that they would neuer ſuffer any to beare that title amongſt them, but from that time forward, changed the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Monarchie into a Democraty or popular eſtate, aboliſhing all lawes appertaining to a king. In place of which they ſent to the Athenians for <hi>Solons</hi> lawes, which afterward were obſerued by the Romanes, and called the <note place="margin">Appius Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note>lawes of the twelue Tables. <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> one of thoſe ten that had all authoritie in the gouernment of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eſtate, bicauſe he would haue rauiſhed <hi>Virginia,</hi> daughter to <hi>Virginius</hi> a Citizen of Rome, who ſlew hir to ſaue hir honor, was baniſhed with all his companions in that office, and their manner of gouernment changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the authoritie of Conſuls.

of valure, making good penywoorths of their skin, and of their conſcience alſo, whether it be in fight, or in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſome other commandement of theirs, they ſhal haue cauſe to thinke themſelues worthy of great honour, and to be preferred before other men. For they ſuppoſe that honor ought to be meaſured by that good wil and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king which men conceiue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues be moſt wicked, and not by the triall of the worke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or euil in it ſelfe. But I wonder at their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. For ſeeing they haue no goodneſſe in them, how can they iudge what ought to be done or left vndone, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to equitie and iuſtice? And what honor wil they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in all their actions, being guided onely with a deſire of worldly glory, which (as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith) is the chiefe &amp; principal euil? Do not they alſo propound to themſelues as a recompence of their paine and trauell, aduancement to high eſtates and dignities, that they may the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy worldly pleaſures? Whereby they become ſlaues to mortall goods and riches all their life time, and depriue themſelues of that precious libertie of the ſoul, for which a noble hart ought to fight &amp; to ſuffer death. But a good man adorned with goodnes and iuſtice, propoundeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">The White at which euerie good man ought to aime.</note>himſelfe a farre other end. For admiring nothing but vertue, he ſeeketh not to be honored but in obeying hir, in following hir ſteps, and in referring all his doings to the infallible rule thereof. He knoweth (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth) that glory is to be followed, not to be deſired: that it is gotten by ſuch a noble courage as meaſureth al things by conſcience, not doing any thing for oſtentation and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. The price and reward which he expecteth in this life for euery laudable action, is to haue done it: and yet he depriueth not himſelfe of glory, which remayneth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal vnto him among good men for his iuſt &amp; vertuous deedes, neither careth he at all what the wicked or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſort think or ſpeake of him. Hauing layd this ground and foundation of all his intents and purpoſes, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to the moſt beaten way, nor to the preſent ſtate of things, that he might apply himſelfe to the tyme, as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:8689:139"/>
though he feared that he ſhould be left behind, but deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rather to abide vnknown in his ſimplicitie, than with the hurt and detriment of his ſoule, to intrude himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the greateſt. And if he vndertake, or execute any thing, he hath iuſtice and prudence alwaies for his guids: and then neither feare nor danger is able to driue him from his determinate purpoſe, which, how ſoeuer it falleth out, is alwaies no leſſe woorthie of honor and praiſe, than their actions, who do nothing but for worldlie glorie, deſerue blame and diſpraiſe, which they feare moſt of all, and labor to auoid. True it is, that theſe men, who ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeeke after vaine glorie and greatnes, may ſay vnto me, that things go farre otherwiſe than I ſpeake of, and that their doings, who apply themſelues to the pleaſure and liking of the greater ſort, without ſparing their liues, are as much extolled, as the others that reſpect the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes of cauſes, are ſet light by and contemned. But I anſwer them againe, that it is the dutie of a prudent man, <note place="margin">The iudgement of the beſt, not of the moſt, is to be preferred al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</note>rather to feare the iudgement and opinion of a few wiſe men, than of an ignorant multitude. Neither ought he to leaue his conceiued purpoſes grounded vpon reaſon for the praiſe of men. For they that do otherwiſe, declare eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that they liue not but for the world, hauing no care of the principall and chiefe end of their being. <hi>Bion</hi> compared ſuch men very fitly to veſſels with two handles, which are eaſily caried by the eares whetherſoeuer a man will. So theſe men being praiſed and much made of, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake all things boldly: yea, the burning heate of glory oftentimes carieth them ſo farre, that they praiſe &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their owne doings to no purpoſe. Which is ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemelie a thing (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith) that it is more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthie than lying, which commonly goeth with it, and is alſo a great argument of an inconſtant mind. But as <hi>Plutark</hi> ſaith, the more reaſon a man hath gotten by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, the more he looſeth of his pride and arrogancie, and they that haue nothing before their eies, whereunto they aſpire, but vertue and dutie onely, vſe the occaſion, time, and ſequele of their affaires, without caring for any
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:8689:140"/>
other praiſe than that which proceedeth from the nature, iudgement and conſent of all good men. It is true, that <note place="margin">A good man may ſometime praiſe himſelfe.</note>ſometime it is tollerable in good men, yea neceſſarie for the benefit of others, to commend themſelues in ſome ſort, by ſpeaking of themſelues to their aduantage. As if laboring to be beleeued, we rendred a reaſon of our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodnes by our former effects, that ſo hauing meanes to continue our vertuous actions to the benefit of many, we may, as it were againſt their wils, worke their <note place="margin">Themiſtocles did ſo.</note>ſafetie, and compell thoſe men to receiue a good turne, who ſhun all occaſions thereof. This cauſed <hi>Themistocles</hi> to vſe thoſe ſpeeches in the Councell of the Athenians, whome he perceiued to be wearie of him. <hi>O poore men</hi> (quoth he to them) <hi>why do ye oftentimes receiue benefits of the ſame parties?</hi> And another time he vſed theſe words. <hi>In rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and ſtormie weather ye haue recourſe to me, as to the ſhelter of a tree, but when faire weather returneth, ye ſnatch euery one a</hi>

Moreouer, exhortation hauing the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of works readie at hand, and examples ioined with the pricke of emulation, are liuely, and woonderfully whetteth men on: yea they bring togither with courage and affection, hope of abilitie to attaine to the end of that <note place="margin">The effects of pride.</note>thing, which is perceiued not to be impoſſible. But in this caſe, as in euery other action, let vs aboue al eſchew pride, hated of God and men, and the cauſe of the corruption and tranſgreſſion of mans nature. Yea, it cauſeth that worke to become wicked, which of it ſelf is good: ſo that humble ſubmiſſion is better than the proud boaſting of our good deedes, which cauſeth a proud man oftentimes to fall into more deteſtable vices than he was in before. Now in requiring firſt and chieflie thoſe praiſes that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of bountie and iuſtice, my meaning is not that we ſhould contemne, but rather ſearch diligently after thoſe that procure vnto vs immortall glorie by noble and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious acts, prouided alwaies that they paſſe not the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8689:140"/>
bounds of equitie and iuſtice. For otherwiſe they cannot <note place="margin">The works of fortitude muſt be grounded vpon equitie and iuſtice.</note>but falſly be called works of fortitude and generoſitie, as heerafter in our diſcourſes vpon theſe vertues we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand more at large. Therefore it is the ielouſie of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie gotten by vertue, after the examples of our predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors that liued well, which ought to pricke forward euery noble hart, to build for himſelfe an eternall monument through heroicall deedes, when dutie and reaſon inuite vs thereunto. Thus did that good and valiant captaine <hi>Mattathias</hi> behaue himſelfe, who, denying obedience to the tyrannicall edicts of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> after he had ſubiected and ſubuerted Ieruſalem, and taking armes with his fiue ſonnes, went into the fields out of a poore village where he dwelt, and called vnto him ſuch as would follow him to recouer againe their liberty. And after many victories ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him, when he perceiued that he drew neere to death, he exhorted his ſonnes to follow his iuſt and holie deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without feare of any danger. True it is (quoth <note place="margin">Mattathias ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to his ſonnes.</note>he to them) that our bodies are mortall, and ſubiect to the ſame decree that others are, but the memorie of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deedes procureth to it ſelfe an immortalitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I would haue you aſpire in ſuch ſort, that ye thinke not much to die in behauing your ſelues valiantly. Thus it is lawfull for vs to be touched, and ſtirred vp with the ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of a good glorie, ſo that it be without enuying the <note place="margin">How ielouſie of glorie is tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note>proſperitie and preferment of others, but onely ſo farre foorth as it may ſerue for a ſpur vnto vs to vndertake and to effect all vertuous and commendable things. As for example: <hi>Themistocles</hi> hearing of the great victorie that <note place="margin">Themiſtocles.</note>
                     <hi>Miltiades</hi> had obtained in the plaine of Marathon, ſaid: that that newes would let him take no reſt: meaning thereby, that he ſhould neuer be quiet, vntill by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act of vertue he had deſerued as much praiſe, as did <note place="margin">T. Flaminius.</note>this excellent Captaine <hi>Miltiades. Titus Flaminius</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Conſul, who deliuered Grecia from bondage, and twice in battell ranged, ouerthrew <hi>Philip</hi> king of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, ſhewed himſelfe likewiſe touched greatly with a deſire of glorie and honour, not to be blamed, but

to be practiſed of all excellent and noble natures, by putting too his helping hande whenſoeuer he coulde, with the firſt, yea, ſometimes alone, to euery matter and exploit of importance. He kept company oftner and more gladly with thoſe that ſtood in neede of his helpe, than with ſuch as were able to aide him in well doing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting theſe men to be his competitors in the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of honor and glory, &amp; the others to be matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he might exerciſe his vertue. It was an argument of yong yeeres, which ſeemed to promiſe much, and to be borne to all great enterpriſes, when <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> being yet very yong, and beholding the image of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <note place="margin">Caeſar wept at the ſight of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders image.</note>great at foure and twentie yeeres of age, fell to weeping, and ſaid: Am not I miſerable that haue done nothing woorthy of memorie, and yet this prince at theſe yeeres had executed ſo many notable things? Moreouer, we may obſerue among the Ancients infinite woorthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples quite contrary one to another, in that many great &amp; famous men haue altogether deſpiſed the honor of vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, which is neuer without preſumption and pride: &amp; contrary wiſe, others being led with pride and arrogancie, haue fowly abuſed their authoritie and greatnes, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to themſelues more blame and diſhonor, than praiſe <note place="margin">Cyrus.</note>and honour. That great <hi>Cyrus</hi> Monarch of the Perſians, was of ſo meeke and gentle a nature, and ſo little deſirous of vainglory, that he would neuer prouoke his equals in age to any exerciſe wherin he perceiued himſelf the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but thoſe rather, who were better practiſed than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to the end he might not diſpleaſe them by bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the price from them, as alſo that he might reape this benefit to learne that which he could not do ſo well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. O right noble hart, giuing euident proofe of the contempt of baſe and vile things, to treaſure vp thoſe that are great and excellent! But now adayes where about do we ſtriue moſt? namely, who can moſt cunningly ſtrike with the ſword, run at the ring, or ride and manage hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And I would to God we did no worſe. But as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling others in vertue, theſe times require no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

But when he ſaw that in ſtead of meat they gaue him nothing but incenſe, he was greatly aſhamed, and departed from the feaſt in great anger.

Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſhame and ſhamefaſtnes (ſaith <hi>Quintilian)</hi> is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all good counſaile, the right Gardian of dutie, the miſtreſſe of innocencie, well liked of hir neereſt friends, in all places, &amp; at all tymes courteouſly intertained of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as that which hath a fauorable countenance. Honeſt ſhame, being (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) the moderator of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences, procureth vnto vs a ſtedfaſt and commendable authoritie amongſt al men. <hi>Heſiodus</hi> calleth it the hoſteſſe of iuſtice. Of this <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpake, when he ſayd, that vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhame beſeemed youth. I looke for ſmall goodnes of a yong man (ſaith <hi>Seneca)</hi> except of ſuch a one as bluſheth after he hath offended. For he that bluſheth (ſaith <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander)</hi> is not voyd of all good nature. Therefore ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes is to be nouriſhed and much made of. For ſo long as it remaineth in any mans ſpirite, there is good hope to be conceiued of him. Many haue ſhrunke through feare of ſhame, with whom no reaſon or torment could in any ſort preuaile. A wicked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſaith <hi>Euripides)</hi> hath no ſhame in him. Shamefaſtnes (ſaith one of the Ancients) is ſiſter to continencie, and companion of chaſtitie, yea by means of hir ſocietie and fellowſhip, chaſtitie is in greater ſafetie. A fault is leſſened through ſhame, as it is made greater by contention: and ſhame mollifieth the hart of a Iudge, but impudencie prouoketh him to anger. He that is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the quicke through a ſharpe reprehenſion for the reformation of his maners, and yet is nothing reſtrayned thereby, nor full of ſweate and bluſhing for ſhame, which cauſeth heate to aſcend into the face of euery one well borne, but remaineth inflexible and vnmooueable, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8689:144"/>
and ieſting thereat, ſuch a one I ſay, giueth a great argument of a very blockiſh and ſenceles nature, which is aſhamed of nothing, by reaſon of his long cuſtome and <note place="margin">Sinne is naturall in man.</note>confirmation in doing of euill. To ſinne (ſaith <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Athenian) is a thing naturally ingrafted in men: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there euer any law ſo rigorous, that could ſtaie the courſe thereof, although new paines and puniſhments were dailye added to offences, to ſee if men might bee drawne from vice through feare of them. But ſome gather boldnes through pouertie; others becauſe of their riches become inſolent, ambitious, and couetous; and others haue other paſſions and occaſions which mooue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to do ill. Now to turne theſe aſide, &amp; to make them fruitles, there is no better way than deepely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print <note place="margin">How we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe ſinne.</note>in our ſoules the feare of perpetuall ſhame and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which are the inſeparable companions of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and corrupt dealings. And as often as we commit any fault through frailtie, we muſt togither with repentance imprint in our memorie a long remembrance thereof: yea we muſt lay it often before our eies, as alſo the ſhame and diſhonor that might haue enſued thereof vnto vs, to this end, that afterward we may be the better kept backe, and more aduiſed in the like matters. Heerin let vs follow the example of wayfaring men, that haue ſtumbled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſtone, and of Pilots that haue bruſed their ſhips againſt a rocke, who, being mindfull of their miſhap, are all their life time greatly afraid, not onely of thoſe ſtones and rocks, which were the cauſes of their euils, but alſo of all ſuch as reſemble them. There was a prohibition (as <note place="margin">A notable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among the Romanes.</note>
                     <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> writeth) that no yoong Romane ſhould dare to enter into a ſtrumpets houſe, but with his face coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and if it ſo fell out, that any man was ſo ſhameles as to come out of that place vncouered, he was as ſeuerely puniſhed, as if he had committed ſome forced adulterie. And truly when one is aſhamed that he hath offended, we are to hope well of his amendment. Now, as ſhame of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, ſeruing for a bridle to vice, is commendable, ſo that ſhame wherein want of prudence and of wiſedome bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8689:144"/>
ſway, is euil and very hurtfull, not onely to thoſe that <note place="margin">What kind of ſhame is very hurtfull.</note>are touched therewith, but oftentimes procureth great euils to Comminalties and Common-wealths. Whereof thoſe men haue too great experience that liue vnder ſuch Gouernors, Magiſtrats, and Iudges, as of a fooliſh baſenes and cowardlines of mind, either for feare to diſpleaſe the greateſt, or to be blamed and reprooued of an ignorant multitude, bow and bend to another mans becke againſt right and equitie, as though they were aſhamed to do wel. Whereupon thinking to eſchew a light and ſmal reproch, they fall into a perpetuall note of infamie and diſhonor, not beeing able to declare more plainly the ſmalnes of their courage (which fitly reſembleth a weake tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bodie, vnable to reſiſt heate and cold) than in conſenting to euill, bicauſe they dare not gaineſay leaſt they ſhould be miſliked. But <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, that he is no meete ſcholler of Philoſophie, who cannot contemne a fooliſh ſhame. And this cauſeth farre greater miſchiefes, when the ſoueraigne Princes of any eſtate are intangled therwith. Which may be verified of them, if through ouer great bountie and ſimplicity void of prudence, they who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue ouer themſelues to their pleaſure that haue them as it were in poſſeſſion, &amp; dare not gaineſay or deny them in any matter. For heer of it commeth, that flatterers, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and ſuch as are moſt wicked, carie away offices, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, benefices, gifts, and waſtfully conſume the publike treaſure: ſo that a man may behold an impunitie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of vices, and of execrable offences, bicauſe a ſimple and baſhfull king dare not deny a requeſt. And thus vnder ſuch a Prince publik welfare is turned into priuat wealth, and all the charges fall vpon the poore people. But not to ſtray farre from our purpoſe, hauing ſo neerely touched a matter worthie of a large diſcourſe, I thinke we ſhall reape no ſmall profit, if we call to mind heere certaine notable inſtructions, which <hi>Plutark</hi> giueth vs, to teach vs to repell <note place="margin">How we muſt learne to reſiſt all naughtie ſhame.</note>farre from vs all fooliſh and dangerous ſhame: namely, that ſo ſoone as yeers of diſcretion worke in vs any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of goodnes, we ſhould exerciſe our ſelues in thoſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:8689:145"/>
things, which of themſelues are eaſie enough to practiſe, being without feare that any thing can (as the prouerbe ſaith) hang or take hold of our gowne. If at a feaſt (ſaith that great Philoſopher) thou art inuited to drinke more than reaſon, or thy thirſt requireth, be not aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do it. If any babler or ignorant fellow ſeeke to ſtay and keepe thee by diſcourſing of vaine and redious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, be not afraid to rid thy ſelfe of him, and to tell him freely that another time thou maiſt come and viſite him, not hauing at that time any leaſure to keepe him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie any longer. If thy friend, or any other man, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with thee any act or purpoſe of his, wherein thou knoweſt ſomewhat, though neuer ſo little, that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, tell him thereof hardly. If any man be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with thee by requeſts &amp; intreaties, neuer promiſe more than thou art able to performe, and bluſh not bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou canſt not do all things, but rather bluſh to take vpon thee things that are aboue thy abilitie. If any man aske thee a queſtion of any matter whatſoeuer, confeſſe freely that which thou knoweſt not, to the end thou maiſt receiue inſtruction. Now, if we exerciſe our ſelues in this ſort, honeſtly to refuſe, to depart, to breake off, to ſpeake freely, and to ſubmit our ſelues after a comelie manner, ſo that no man can lightly complaine of vs, or blame vs, but vpon very ſlender occaſion, we ſhall be in a readie way to accuſtome our ſelues not to be aſhamed in matters of greater waight, and ſuch as are neceſſarie for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of dutie. For otherwiſe, if we are afraid to put backe a glaſſe of wine, which ſome one of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in drinking doth offer vnto vs, howe will we reſiſt the requeſt of a Prince, which is as much as a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, or the importunate ſuite of a whole people, in an vniuſt and vnreaſonable matter? If we are aſhamed to be rid of a babler; if, as flatterers vſe to do, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende one contrarye to our opinion, whom we heare praiſed of many; or if wee feare to tell our friende of ſome ſmall fault of his, howe will we ſet our ſelues cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly againſt thoſe ſlaunderers of the truth, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:8689:145"/>
maintainers of lies, that are placed in authoritie? Or how ſhall we dare to reprooue notorious faults boldly, beyng committed in the adminiſtration of a magiſtrate, and in ciuill and politicall gouernment? This is that which <hi>Zeno</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Zeno.</note>very well taught vs, when meeting with a familiar friend of his that walked heauily by himſelfe, he asked him the cauſe thereof: I ſhun (ſaid the other) a friend of mine, who requeſteth me to beare falſ witneſſe for him. <hi>What</hi> (quoth <hi>Zeno) act thou ſo fooliſh, that ſeeing him voyd of ſhame and feare to request vniust and wicked things of thee, thou hast not the hart to deny him &amp; to put him back vpon iuſt &amp; reaſonable conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Ageſilaus</hi> may be vnto vs a good Scholemaſter in this <note place="margin">Ageſilaus.</note>matter. For being requeſted by his father to giue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt right, he was not aſhamed to deny him graciouſly with this anſwer. <hi>You haue taught me (O Father) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my youth to obey the lawes, and therefore I will now alſo obey you therein by iudging nothing against the lawes. Pericles</hi> being likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted <note place="margin">Pericles.</note>by a friend of his to ſweare falſly for him, ſayd, I <hi>am a friend to my friends vnto the aultars:</hi> as if he would haue ſayd, ſo farre as I offend not God. The ſame reaſon was the cauſe that <hi>Xenophanes</hi> being called a Coward at a feaſt <note place="margin">Xenophanes.</note>bicauſe he would not play at dice, anſwered without feare of being accounted voyd of ciuilitie and good fellowſhip, <hi>I am in deed a coward and feareful in diſhonest things.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all thoſe pernitious effects of fooliſh and naughtie ſhame that are already touched by vs, oftentimes it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſences of a man ſo brutiſh through a long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that he neglecteth the care of that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">Other perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of fooliſh ſhame.</note>his ſafetie and priuate benefit, yea ſometimes of his owne life. I will not here ſtand to ſpeake of thoſe that ſay they are aſhamed to aske their due, or by way of iuſtice to purſue ſuch as deuour the ſubſtance of their poore fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whereby they make it knowen, that they haue neither vertue, hart nor courage. To this agreeth fitly that which we read of one named <hi>Perſeus,</hi> who being to lend monie <note place="margin">Perſeus.</note>to a very friend of his, went with him to the common place of bargaining, calling to mind that precept of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiodus,</hi> who ſaith:
<q>
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:8689:146"/>
                        <l>Euen when thou doſt diſport with thine owne brother,</l>
                        <l>Let preſent be ſome witnes one or other.</l>
                     </q>
His friend thinking this ſomewhat ſtrang, ſaid: what, ſo orderly by law? Yea quoth <hi>Perſeus,</hi> that I may haue it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of thee friendly, and not be compelled to demand it againe by order of law. But what ſhall we ſay of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great perſonages as are mentioned in hiſtories, who vnder pretence of a fooliſh ſhame badly grounded vpon this conceit, that they would not diſtruſt them whome they tooke for their friends, offered themſelues euen to <note place="margin">Dion.</note>the ſlaughter? <hi>Dion</hi> endued with great perfections, and one that deliuered from tyrannie and freed from thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the citie of Syracuſa, although he was aduertiſed that <hi>Calippus</hi> whom he tooke for his Hoſt and friend, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched opportunitie to ſlaie him, yet he went to that place whether he had inuited him, ſaying: <hi>that he had rather looſe his life, than be compelled to diſtruſt his friends, and to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aſmuch from them as from his enimies.</hi> And in deed it fell <note place="margin">Antipater.</note>out ſo, that he was ſlaine there. The like befell <hi>Antipater,</hi> being bidden to ſupper by <hi>Demetrius.</hi> It ſeemeth alſo that <note place="margin">I. Caeſar.</note>
                     <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> aſwell as they, was in ſome ſort the cauſe of his ownemiſhap, bicauſe hauing had many aduertiſements, ſuſpicions, and forewarnings of the miſerable death that was intended againſt him, yet he neglected them all, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth by that ſpeech, which he vſed the euening before he was murdered, being at ſupper with <hi>Marcus Lepidus.</hi> For a controuerſie ariſing amongſt the gueſts about this <note place="margin">What death Caeſar thought beſt.</note>propoſition, <hi>What kind of death was beſt,</hi> euen that ſaid this Monarch, <hi>which is leaſt looked for.</hi> True it is which may be ſaid, that deſtinie may poſſibly be better foreſeene than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided. But this were an euill concluſion thereupon, that we muſt let goe all care of keeping thoſe Goods, which God giueth vs as a bleſſing proceeding from his grace. For it is the dutie of a good and ſound iudgement to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that which is paſt, with the preſent time, to the end to foreſee in ſome ſort, and to determine of that which is to come, which is alwaies doubtfull and vncertaine vnto vs. Moreouer, to reſume our former matter of honeſt

ſhame and ſhamefaſtnes, which is the guide of our life to decencie and vertue, we may ſee amongſt the an ients in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite examples, how it hath been recommended and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely obſerued, and what ſtrength it hath had in right noble mindes. The Perſians brought vp their youth in <note place="margin">How the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an youth was inſtructed.</note>ſuch ſort, that they neither did nor ſpake any thing that was diſhoneſt, putting him to death that ſtripped himſelf ſtarke naked in the preſence of another. Yea they iudged, euery vnciuill action how litle ſoeuer, committed before others, to be great wickednes. The Parthians would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuffer their wiues to come among their feaſtes, leaſt wine ſhould cauſe them to doe or to ſpeake any diſhoneſt thing in their preſence. <hi>Hippocratides</hi> as he was walking, <note place="margin">Hippocratides ſaying to a yong man that blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note>met with a yong man in a wicked mans company, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that he began to bluſh, ſaid thus vnto him. My ſonne thou muſt goe with ſuch as will not cauſe thee to bluſh: but be of good cheere, for thou maieſt yet repent thee. Blind <hi>Eutichus</hi> was ſet without the aray of the battel <note place="margin">Eutichus.</note>by <hi>Leonidas,</hi> but being aſhamed to leaue his fellowes in danger, he cauſed a ſlaue to lead him to the place where they fought, and there wonderfully doing his endeuor, he was ſlain.

When ſpeech was miniſtred at the banket of the ſeuen Sages, concerning that popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment which was happieſt, wherein all haue equall<note place="margin">Cleobulus.</note> authoritie, <hi>Cleobulus</hi> affirmed, that that citie ſeemed vnto him beſt guided by policie, wherein the Citizens ſtood in<note place="margin">A notable hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faſtnes of the Mileſian mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</note> greater awe of diſhonor than of the law. <hi>Plutark</hi> rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a very noteable hiſtorie of the force of honeſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes in the Mileſian maidens, who were fallen into ſuch frenzie and perturbation of ſpirite, that without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant cauſe to be ſeene, they were ſuddenly ouertaken with a longing to die, and with a furious deſire to hang themſelues. Which thing many of them had alreadie put in practiſe, ſo that neither reaſons, nor teares of fathers and mothers, no comfort of friends, no threatnings, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, or deuices whatſoeuer, could preuaile with them, vntill ſuch time that a wiſe Citizen by his aduice procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an edict to be made by the Councell, that if any heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after hung hir ſelfe, ſhe ſhould be caried ſtarke naked in the ſight of all men, through the market place. This edict being made and ratified by the Councell, did not onely repreſſe a little, but wholy ſtaied the fury of theſe maidens that longed to die. Inſomuch, that a ſimple imagination and conceit of ſhame and diſhonor, which yet could not light vpon them before they were dead, did preuaile more with them than all other deuiſed meanes could do, yea, than death it ſelfe, or griefe, which are two of the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt accidents which men commonly ſtand in feare of.<note place="margin">Honeſt ſhame is alwaies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</note> To conclude therefore our preſent diſcourſe, that honeſt ſhame and ſhamefaſtnes, are alwaies commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and beſeeming all perſons that purpoſe to obſerue modeſtie in their words, geſtures, countenances, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

For being free from all earthly care, and void of feare or ſorow, we contemne euen death it ſelfe, and are in ſuch ſort prepared againſt all griefes, that our contentation li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heerin, that the greateſt and moſt exceeding paines will not continue long, that the leaſt will vaniſh away of themſelues, and that we ſhall be maiſters of the middle ſort. This is that which the Philoſophers by infinite lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">Fortitude is a Good of the ſoule, not of the bodie.</note> writings required to be in the vertue of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> with which the force and ſtrength of the bodie hath nothing common, as that which is a Good that belongeth to the bodie. But this is an immortall Good of the ſoule, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the power and direction of the ſpirite, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and confirmed through the ſtudie of Philoſophie,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:8689:148"/>
and cauſing man of his owne accord to make choice of, and to perfect all honeſt things for their owne ſakes. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> then (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) is that part of honeſtie, which is knowne by the excellencie, greatnes, and dignitie of the hart, which after aduiſed counſell and good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, cauſeth man to vndertake without feare, all peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matters, and conſtantly to endure all kind of trauell. For conſtancie and dignitie are neuer farre from <hi>Fortitude</hi> in greateſt diſtreſſes: bicauſe it adorneth him that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth hir with the contempt of griefe and of death, cauſing him to eſteeme nothing vntollerable that can happen to man, neither any thing euill that is neceſſarie. And ſo it is the preſeruation of a firme &amp; ſetled iudgement in things that ſeeme terrible &amp; full of danger, ſeeing it is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that which a man ought to indure. <hi>Plato</hi> alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it the knowledge of all good and euill: as though he would ſay, that nothing can come to a valiant and noble minded man, againſt his expectation, although it may be contrarie to his will, bicauſe he is ſetled and prepared to vndergo all euents, as if he had certainly foreſeene them. <hi>Ariſtole</hi> ſaith that <hi>Fortitude</hi> is a mediocritie betweene fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and enterprizing. Moreouer, it maketh a man fit for all occaſions of dangers and trauels, and holdeth him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two extremities of cowardlines and raſhnes, which vices are very hurtfull to a happie and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable life. The ſame Philoſopher ſaith, that whoſoeuer<note place="margin">The Properties that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a valtant man.</note> will be ſtrong and valiant, muſt be free from all feare of death, conſtant in aduerſities, void of feare in perils, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to die honeſtly, than to ſaue himſelfe vilan ouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He muſt endeuor to build noble enterpriſes, hauing for his companions hardines, greatnes of hart, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and hope, beſides induſtrie and patience. Then he commeth to ſet downe many kinds of <hi>Fortitude. Cicero</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing well with him, ſaith: that <hi>Magnificence, Conſidence, Patience,</hi> and <hi>Perſeuerance,</hi> are the parts of <hi>Fortitude. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence</hi> ſheweth it doing great &amp; excellent things: <hi>Confidence</hi> in this, that a valiant man conceiueth good hope of the euent of them: <hi>Patience</hi> in a voluntarie and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:8689:149"/>
continuall ſuffering for the loue of honeſtie and vertue: and <hi>Perſeuerance</hi> in a perpetual conſtancie, and in a firme and ſtedfaſt abiding in his purpoſes and reſolutions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with good conſideration following reaſon.<note place="margin">Fortitude figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for iuſtice onely.</note> Moreouer, <hi>Fortitude</hi> (as the Stoicks ſaid very well) is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that fighteth for equitie and iuſtice. And therefore neither they that ſuffer for vniuſt matters, nor they that fight for their priuate commodities, not being led onely with zeale of publike benefit, can boaſt (except falſly) that they are decked with this pretious vertue. For theſe latter ſort of men are rather to be called cruell, barbarous, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, and hired hangmen, deſtroying all humanitie: and the others impudents, ſhameles, and deſperate, yea ſo much more woorthie of blame, as guiltie of wilfull mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in that they ſhew themſelues conſtant in doing euill. But thoſe men are valiant &amp; of great courage, who thinke that no action whatſoeuer, no time or ſeaſon ought to be void of iuſtice, who deliuer the oppreſſed, and thoſe that are wronged, who build all their deuiſes vpon vertuous works. They (ſaith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> are void of generoſitie, who fight either for feare of reprehenſion, or by conſtraint, or being ſtirred vp with other mens ſpeech, or of choler, or through ignorance of dangers. And this was <hi>Platoes</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">All hardie men are not valiant.</note> when he ſaid that all ſtrong and valiant men were hardie, but not all hardie men, valiant: bicauſe hardines commeth to men either by arte, anger, or pollicie: but <hi>Fortitude</hi> is ingendred in the ſoule by nature and holie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation. And therefore this vertue ſtandeth not in need either of choler, rancor, ambition, pride, or of any other euill paſſion, whereby to bring to paſſe braue and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects, but is rather an vtter enimie vnto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proceedeth from a mature and ripe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and election of reaſon, which cauſeth a man boldly to put in execution whatſoeuer he knoweth to belong to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and honeſtie, according to that place whereunto he is called. And this alſo is the cauſe that he neuer taketh any thing in hand raſhly, what pretence ſoeuer it hath, neither is he kept backe by any feare in thoſe matters which offer
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:8689:149"/>
him good occaſion of putting to his hand, what hazard or imminent danger ſoeuer ſeemeth to threaten him. But (according to that ſentence of <hi>Socrates, that the hardest things ought to be taken in hand and executed with greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and valure of hart)</hi> after he hath well and prudently grounded his enterpriſe vpon a certaine knowledge, and firme diſcourſe of reaſon, neither reproches, nor praiſes, neither promiſes nor threatnings, or torments, neither pleaſures nor griefs, are able to cauſe him to breake off, or<note place="margin">The reſolution of valiant man is alwaies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and vnchangeable.</note> in any ſort to alter and change his reſolution, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth alwaies praiſe-woorthie, and is neuer ſubiect to repentance, the matter falleth out: bicauſe we are not to iudge of enterpriſes by the euents, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither out of our power, but by the ground-worke and foundation wherupon they were built. And further, when the greateſt dangers are, then is the time wherein a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man being nothing at all abaſhed, moſt of all ſheweth his ſtrength &amp; prowes, neuer taking himſelfe to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as long as his vertue is free and at libertie to giue him new ſupplie of meanes to ſet forward againe his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, otherwiſe in a deſperate caſe.

And thus it belongeth properly to this vertue, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand chiefly ouer theſe two perturbations grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opinion of euill, namely, <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Griefe:</hi> as before we ſaw that <hi>Temperance</hi> exerciſeth hir power ouer vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled <hi>deſire, &amp; exceſſiue ioy.</hi> Furthermore, bicauſe they that naturally haue greater ſtomacks, and more excellent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, are deſirous and greedie of honors, power, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſeeing that an exceſſiue deſire to rule and to excel others, commonly groweth with the greatnes of the hart, it is neceſſarie that this vnrulie affection ſhould be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the contempt of ſuch things as are common to all men by nature. And this alſo is a propertie belonging to this vertue of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which deſiring the greateſt and beſt things, deſpiſeth thoſe that are baſe and abiect, aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Which is the who cauſe, that whoſoeuer hath this vertue of <hi>Fortitude</hi> perfectly (if ſo great happines could be among mortall wights) he remaineth free from all perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoule to enioy a bleſſed tranquillitie, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with conſtancie, procureth vnto him dignitie and reputation.

Beſides, that honeſty which we ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Of bodily force.</note> is perfected by the forces of the ſoule, of which euery one hath great need, not by thoſe of the bodie. I will not ſay, that the firme knitting togither of the members, and the good diſpoſition of nature to ſuſtaine manfully the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of wether, &amp; al kind of paine &amp; trauel without ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is not a good helpe towards the execution of noble enterpriſes: only I ſay, that it is not ſo neceſſarie, but that many being troubled with a thouſand ill diſpoſitions in their perſons, eſpecially ſuch as were placed in offices of Captaines and Conductors of armies, haue executed infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite great and glorious exploits, ſurmounting all weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their bodies, through the magnanimitie of their hart.

As it may appeere by that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, that being one daye by reaſon of great ſtorme and tempeſt greatly vrged with want of lodging in a plaine, where there was but one little cottage belonging to a Peaſant, which had but one chamber, he commanded that <hi>Oppius,</hi> one of his Captaines, who was il at eaſe, ſhould be lodged there: as for himſelfe he laye abroad with the reſt, ſaying that the moſt honorable places were to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the greateſt, and the moſt neceſſarie for ſuch as were moſt diſeaſed.

Dentatus.</note>he and all his died of the woundes which they receiued in that fight. <hi>Lucius Dentatus</hi> a Romane, was endued with ſuch Fortitude and Generoſitie, that one writeth of him, that he was in ſixe skore battels and skirmiſhes, and eight times came away Conquerour from fighting hand to hand: that he had receiued of his Captaines by waye of rewarde, and in token of his valure, eighteene launces, twentie bards for horſes, foure skore and three bracelets, and ſixe and thirtie crownes: and laſtly, that by his meanes nine Emperours triumphed in Rome. <note place="margin">Eumenus.</note>
                     <hi>Eumenus</hi> a Macedonian Captaine, hauing beene put to the woorſt by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> retired into a ſtrong hold, where being beſieged, and brought to parly through neceſſitie of victuals and munition, it was ſignified vnto him from his enemie, that reaſon would he ſhould come and ſpeake with him vnder his faith and promiſe without Hoſtages, ſeeing he was both greater and ſtronger. But <hi>Eumenus</hi> made him this anſwer, <hi>that he would neuer thinke any man greater than himſelfe, as long as he had his ſword in his owne power.</hi> And therefore demanding of him no woorſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, than as one that thought himſelfe to be his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, he ſailed foorth vpon his enemies with ſuch valure
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:8689:153"/>
and courage, that he ſaued himſelfe out of their handes, and afterward greatly troubled <hi>Antigonus. Aristomenes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ariſtomenes.</note>the Meſſanian, being taken by the Lacedemonians, and deliuered faſt bound to two ſouldiers to be kept, he drew neere to a fire, and burned aſunder his bands with a litle of his fleſh: afterward comming ſuddenly vpon his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, he ſlew them both, and ſaued himſelfe. <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lyſimachus.</note>being caſt to a Lion by <hi>Alexander,</hi> bicauſe he gaue to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listhenes</hi> the priſoner that poiſon wherewith he killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, fought with it, and ſtretching foorth his arme and hand all armed into his throte, he tooke hold of his toong and ſtrangled him. Whereupon the Monarch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after greatly eſteemed and honoured him. By this ſmall number out of infinite examples, which I could heere mention, we ſee the great and woonderfull effects of this vertue of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which are no leſſe in euerye part thereof touched in our diſcourſe, as heereafter I hope we ſhall declare at large. Wherefore we may well ſay, that this vertue is very neceſſarie to liue well and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, and to lead vs to the end of our being, which is to referre both our life and death to the onely exerciſe of dutie and honeſtie: that by it we enioy the true reſt of the ſoule, which is nothing elſe (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) than a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſweete, and acceptable conſtancie, which vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly alwaies followeth <hi>Fortitude,</hi> being crowned with theſe two ineſtimable rewardes, the contempt of griefe, and of death, whereby we forſake that which is mortall, that we may imbrace heauenlie thinges in the hope and certaine expectation of that happie immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>

                  <p>Albeit there is no greater diſgrace than to be iuſtly reproched with a cowardly and faint hart, eſpecially for youth to be called effeminate, yet is that feare good, which turneth vs away from diſhoneſt things, and maketh man ſtaied and wel aduiſed. This is the cauſe why the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients <note place="margin">Two kinds of feare.</note>ſpeaking of feare, made it twofold, the one good &amp; neceſſarie, the other euill and hurtfull. The firſt, which they grounded vpon a good diſcourſe of reaſon &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was ſo eſteemed and honored of them, that in the citie of Sparta, which for armes &amp; arts flouriſhed moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">A Temple dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to feare.</note>the Grecians, there was a temple dedicated &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to this feare: which, as they affirmed, better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſerued the eſtate of Common-wealthes, than any other thing whatſoeuer, bicauſe thereby man was led to ſtand more in awe of blame, reproch, &amp; diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:8689:154"/>
than of death or griefe. Which thing maketh him both apter &amp; readier to vndertake &amp; to execute all vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; laudable matters, whenſoeuer good &amp; iuſt occaſion ſhall be offred, &amp; alſo more ſtaied againſt euerie raſh &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt enterpriſe that might procure dammage to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And this was the occaſion of that Prouerbe, <hi>Feare alwaies accompanieth ſhame.</hi> Another reaſon alleadged by theſe wiſe men, whie they honoured in ſuch ſort this <note place="margin">The feare of neighbour eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</note>fained goddeſſe, was, bicauſe to doubt and feare nothing was more hurtfull to Common-wealths, than their verie neighbour enimies, the feare of whome was their ſafetie and aſſurance. The other naughtie and pernicious feare <note place="margin">Two ſorts of pernicious feare.</note>ſtandeth of two kinds. The firſt beeing deſtitute of all good reaſon and aſſured iudgement, is that which we call Cowardlines and Puſillanimitie, alwaies followed of theſe two perturbations of the ſoule, <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Sadnes,</hi> and is the defect of the vertue of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which wee purpoſe chiefly to handle at this preſent. The Grecians called it by theſe two words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the one ſignifieng tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the other a band; as if they would haue ſaid, that it held the ſoule bound, and wholie troubled. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed alſo, that this feare was as it were a giddineſſe and alienation of the mind from the right ſenſe, making the ſoule idle, dead, void of euerie good exploit or effect whatſoeuer. The laſt kind of feare is that which worketh in the wicked a feare of paine and puniſhment appointed for offences, wherby they are as it were with a bridle kept backe and reſtrained from preſuming to commit their villanies and damnable purpoſes. Now as the firſt kind of feare ſaid to be good and neceſſarie, is a great token of a commendable and vertuous nature, as that which for good cauſe is grounded vpon the feare of reproch and infamie, and vpon a deſire to effect whatſoeuer belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to dutie: ſo the one of theſe two laſt kinds teſtifieth a vile, contemptible, and abiect nature; and the other a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; corrupt diſpoſition. <hi>Plutark</hi> ſpeaking of this good <note place="margin">Of the good feare.</note>feare calleth it one of the Elements &amp; grounds of vertue, ſaying, that it is chieflie requiſite and neceſſarie for thoſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:8689:155"/>
that haue authoritie ouer others, who ought to feare ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to practiſe euil, than to receiue puniſhment for the ſame, bicauſe the firſt is the cauſe of the latter, not onelie to themſelues, but to ſo manie as wallow in wickedneſſe, which is neuer without recompenſe. Therefore a prudent and well aduiſed man ought to haue this feare alwaies <note place="margin">It is ioined with the true loue of God.</note>before his eies, I meane this childlike feare, which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably ioined with the true loue we owe to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon father, and is the beginning of all wiſedome, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are induced to honour him. And looke how much the more the ancient Pagans were kept in awe by this <note place="margin">It cauſeth vs to reſpect the good of our countrie.</note>good feare, ſo much the more ſhall our condemnation be doubled, if we deſpiſe it. The dutie alſo of this profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table feare is, to haue an eie vnto the good and ſafetie of our countrie, and to cauſe vs faithfully to diſcharge euery charge committed vnto vs, to the end we incurre not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſhame and infamie among all good men. It cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to feare onelie the diſhonor of an vnaduiſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or action, and to account it very ſeemelie &amp; honorable to be blamed and euil ſpoken of for well dooing, which Alexander the great ſaid did well become a king. This <note place="margin">Phocion.</note>good feare made <hi>Phocion,</hi> who for his deſert and valure was choſen generall of the Atheniens fiue &amp; fortie times, to ſaie, that he would neuer counſell, but hinder to the vttermoſt of his power that enterpriſe of war, which they would haue concluded againſt Alexander. For (ſaid he) although the Athenians would caſt awaie themſelues, yet I will not ſuffer them to doe ſo, bicauſe I haue for that intent &amp; purpoſe taken vpon me the charge of a Captain. And when <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who perſuaded this warre, ſaid vnto him, the people will kill thee if they enter into a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: <hi>Phocion</hi> replied, Naie they will kill thee, if they be <note place="margin">Antigonus.</note>well in their wits. <hi>Antigonus</hi> the ſecond, king of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, declared what benefit commeth of this good feare neceſſarie for the foreſight of a wiſe and experienced cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in warre, when retiring once from before his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who came to aſſaile him, and being told by certaine that he fled, he anſwered, It is cleane contrarie. For I
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8689:155"/>
looke backe to that profit wich is behind me. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the opinion of the ancients alreadie mentioned, that to ſtand in feare of nothing is more hurtful to Common-wealthes than foraine enimies: it is that which <hi>Scipio</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Scipio Naſica.</note>
                     <hi>Naſica</hi> a Romane Senator meant to ſignifie, when vpon the hearing of ſome, who ſaid that Rome was in ſafetie, if Carthage were laid waſt; he replied, that it was farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. For (ſaid he) we are in greater danger now than euer, bicauſe we ſtand no more in awe of anie: whereby he wiſelie inferred, that too great and vnlooked for proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <note place="margin">The effects of too great proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths.</note>of cities is commonly the cauſe of raiſing ciuill wars in them &amp; ſecret diuiſions, or elſe of bringing into them ſo great idlenes, that by it a gate is opened to all vices, as in truth it fell out with the Romans. For then beeing in the top of their felicitie and greatneſſe, by reaſon of the deſtruction aſwell of the Carthaginians by <hi>Scipio</hi> the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as of the Macedonians vnder <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the people began to abuſe their authoritie, preferring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eſtates and places of honour, not the beſt and iuſteſt citizens, but ſuch as flattered them moſt in their vices and diſſolutenes, and wan their hearts with prodigall and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous feaſts and diſtributions, to whome they ſolde their publike voices. Whereupon in the end, thoſe ciuill wars aroſe, which was the cauſe of their finall ouerthrow, and of the alteration of their popular eſtate into a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, afterwards called a Monarchie. But this diſcourſe being the matter of another Subiect, let vs come to the defect of the vertue of Fortitude, which is a feare voide <note place="margin">Of that feare which is the defect of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note>of reaſon and aſſurance, and argueth a faint and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hart, cauſing a man through want of ſenſe and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to account this the ſureſt waie, to doubt all things, and to diſtruſt euerie one. Of this feare one of the ancients ſaid, <hi>Feare taketh awaie memorie and all good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from euerie art and industrie.</hi> Yea ſometimes ſome haue beene found ſo faint-harted, that as ſoone as this feare ſeazed vpon them, they gaue vp the ghoſt, not beeing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with anie other euill or violence. It is in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Greefe</hi> fullie practiſe their power,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:8689:156"/>
being grounded vpon a falſe opinion of euill, and ſworne enimies to all reſt and tranquillitie, gnawing and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming life as ruſt doth ſteele or yron. Neither is this feare without an vnrulie deſire and immoderate ioie in things that are worldlie, baſe, and contemptible, whereupon the ſoule is continuallie carried hither and thither, with pernicious and immoderate paſſions, which depriue hir of the excellencie of hir immortalitie to attend to the mortall and corruptible affections of the fleſh. Alexander ſpake of ſuch as are poſſeſſed with this feare, when he ſaid, that no place is ſo ſtrong by nature and ſituation, which fearefull men iudge ſafe enough. Therefore the Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall Poe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſaid verie well, <hi>that Fortune alwayes maketh</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Timorous men are alwaies litle.</note>
                     <hi>timorous men little.</hi> For although they be borne bigge of ſtature, yet the ſmall courage of their hearts maketh them ſo much the more contemptible, bringing foorth worſe and more dangerous effects, and making them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthy of all intermedling with matters of eſtate, of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, or of warre. In this number, among many whom hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories <note place="margin">Claudius Caeſar.</note>mention, we may heere reckon <hi>Claudius</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> who was ſo faint-harted, baſe-minded, &amp; bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, that his mother ſaid often of him, that <hi>Nature had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, but not finiſhed him.</hi> And truly a hartles-fellow, or one of litle-hart, is nothing els but a bodie without a ſoule. The memorie of ſuch men (of whome we ſee but too many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples among vs) ought to be buried in obliuion, and during their life time they ſhould remaine vnknowne aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel <note place="margin">The feares of faint-harts.</note>for their owne honor, as for the good of the common ſocietie of men, to which they could not but be offenſiue and hurtfull. For the moſt part they are not onely afraid of men, of the hazards of warres, of troubles &amp; ſeditions, of the dangers of long voyages, of the loſſe of their goods, of diſeaſes, of dolors, yea, of the leaſt diſcommodities and aduerſities that can befall men: the euent of all which, cauſeth them vſually to forget all reaſon and dutie, but they are alſo frighted with dreames, they tremble at ſights and viſions, they credite falſe abuſing ſpirits, and with a forlorne feare they ſtand in awe of the celeſtiall
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8689:156"/>
ſignes. Briefly, vpon the leaſt occaſions that may be, and ſuch as are vnwoorthie the care of a prudent and valiant mind, they fall oftentimes into ſuch vexation of ſpirite, that they looſe it altogither, and become mad and inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: inſomuch, that many haue haſtened forward with their owne hands, the end of their ſo miſerable daies. As we read of <hi>Mydas</hi> king of Phrygia, who being troubled <note place="margin">Mydas.</note>and vexed with certaine dreames, grew to be deſperate, and died voluntarily by drinking the bloud of a Bull. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristodemus</hi> alſo, king of the Meſſenians, being in warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſubiects, it happened that the dogs howled like woolnes, which came to paſſe by reaſon of a certain herbe called Dogſteeth, growing about his altar at home: Wherupon vnderſtanding by the Southſayers that it was an euill ſigne, he was ſtroken with ſuch a feare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit thereof, that he ſlue himſelfe. <hi>Caſſius</hi> the captaine <note place="margin">Caſſius.</note>had a better hart when he anſwered a Chaldean Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, who counſelled him not to fight with the Parthians vntill the Moone had paſſed Scorpio; <hi>I feare not</hi> (quoth he) <hi>Scorpions, but Archers.</hi> This hee ſpake bicauſe the Romane armie had beene put to the worſt before in the plaine of Chaldea by the Parthian archers. Neuertheles that which we ſpake of <hi>Midas</hi> and <hi>Aristodemus</hi> is ſeldome <note place="margin">Baſe minds ſtand in great feare of death and griefe.</note>followed, yea is rarely found amongſt cowards, and baſe minded fellowes, who commonly flie from temporall death as much as may be, as alſo from griefe, which they feare in ſuch ſort, that contemning all vertue and iuſtice, they labour for nothing more, than to preſerue their liues togither with their carnall commodities, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which they ſeeme to liue cleane without all care of their ſoule, as if hir portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were in this world, &amp; ſhould end togither with the bodie. The effects of this feare of death are ſufficiently felt of euerie one in particular, the number of them being verie ſmall, who would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly make (as we ſay) a ſluce to their conſciences, that they might be deliuered thereof. Let vs then confeſſe our ſelues to be fearefull and faint-harted, and not boaſt of Fortitude and generoſitie of hart, which will not ſuffer vs
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8689:157"/>
to ſtand in feare, no not of certaine death in an holie and honeſt cauſe: ſo farre is it from fearing and forſaking du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie through doubt of an vncertaine death. That which <hi>Speron</hi> rehearſeth in his dialogues of a gentleman of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua ſufficiently ſheweth what maruellous force is in the apprehenſion and conceit of death, which extendeth it ſelfe not onelie vpon the ſpirites of men, but alſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the nature of their bodies, who want conſtancie to<note place="margin">A ſtrange alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans haire in one night.</note>beare and ſuſtaine a ſmall and light griefe for the inioieng of eternall goods. This yoong gentleman being put in priſon vpon ſome accuſation, it was tolde him, that of a certaintie his head ſhould be cut off the daie following. Which newes altered him in ſuch ſort, that in one onelie night hee was all white &amp; greie-headed, whereof before there was no ſhew or appearance, and ſo he liued long time after. Beſides, experience daily miniſtreth vnto vs ſufficient proofe of the miſchiefes which proceed of want of courage and faint-hartednes, eſpecially in matters of eſtate, gouernment, and publike offices, wherein a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſoft man, for euerie reproch, diſlike, or euill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the world, yea of ſuch as are moſt ignorant, and much more for the leaſt dangers of his perſon, and for feare and threatnings of the greater ſort, yeeldeth eaſilie againſt all dutie, and ſuffereth himſelfe to be drawne to the error of the wicked and common ſort. As for the middle and leſſer ſort, wherefore ſerue they being void of<note place="margin">Agamemnon diſpenſed with a rich coward.</note> reaſon and aſſurance? <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, <hi>that king Agamemnon diſpenſed with a rich Coward for going to warre perſonally, for a Mare which he gaue him.</hi> Wherein truly he had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bicauſe a fearefull man hurteth much and profiteth little, not onely in warre, but euen in euery good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous action. This cauſed that great captaine <hi>Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi> to ſay, that magnanimitie and courage were for the moſt part reuerenced in euery enimie of theirs, but that cowardlines, although it had good ſucceſſe, yet was it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and of all men deſpiſed. I might here mention ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry vices, which ordinarily growe and are nouriſhed of cowardlines and puſillanimitie, as namely, crueltie, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:8689:157"/>
breach of promiſe, impatiencie, idleneſſe, ſlouth, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes,<note place="margin">What vices proceed of cowardlines.</note> enuie, backbiting, and all iniuſtice, were it not that I hope the ſequele of our diſcourſes will offer vs mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and occaſion to handle theſe vices particularly, our houre not affording vs time and leaſure to enter vpon ſo many things togither. There remaineth yet a word to be<note place="margin">Of ſeruile feare</note> ſpoken of that feare which I ſaid did accompany the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and wicked many times, being called by the Poet a ſeruile feare, which through the onely horror of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holdeth them backe from practiſing their wicked purpoſes. Of them ſpake <hi>Pythagoras</hi> when he ſayd that he which careth not for doing of euill in any other reſpect, but onely bicauſe he would not be puniſhed is very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Now although ſuch feare is accurſed, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in all, yet is it neceſſarie for the preſeruation of humane ſocietie. For otherwiſe, all things would run to confuſion through the ſhameles malice of the wicked, of whom the earth is full. And it is a great deale better, that through ſuch feare they ſhould be reſtrained from their wicked deſires and wils, than that they ſhould without all feare abandon themſelues to put them in execution: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they are no way excuſable before God, who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be ſerued with hart and ſpirit. Neuertheleſſe, ſuch feare doth not alwayes ſtay them from putting their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in effect, but the more they are retained, ſo much the more are they inflamed and kindled with a deſire to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their corrupt will, which in the end is conſtrained to burſt foorth, and euidently to ſhew that miſchiefe which they kept ſecret a long time. But if the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſort (ſaith <hi>Seneca)</hi> be ſtaied by lawes from committing euil, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher contrarywiſe hath reaſon for all lawes, doing good not bicauſe the law commandeth it, and abſtaining fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euil not bicauſe it forbiddeth it, but bicauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the one to be honeſt, and the other vile and wicked.

                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:8689:158"/>
and valure. For this vertue eaſily ouerthroweth it ſelfe if it be not vnderpropped with good counſaile, and the greater abilitie it ſuppoſeth to haue in it ſelfe, the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it turneth aſide to wickedneſſe, if prudence gouerne it not. This is that which <hi>Iſocrates</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Fortitude</hi> ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Prudence is auaileable, but otherwiſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth more euill than good to the poſſeſſors thereof. If <hi>Fortitude</hi> (ſaith <hi>Lactantius)</hi> without neceſſarie conſtraint, or for a diſhoneſt matter hazardeth hir ſelfe into daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſhe chaungeth into raſhneſſe. He that doth anie thing at all aduentures (ſaith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> not conſidering<note place="margin">Who is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man.</note> how well he doth it, ought not to be called vertuous: but onely if he put it in execution, after knowledge, conſultation and election. Therefore as it is a noble acte to make ſuch account of vertue, as for the loue thereof, not to feare the loſſe of life, otherwiſe very deare; ſo is it a point of raſhneſſe and follie to contemne life vpon a ſmall and light occaſion. Raſhneſſe than is that which cauſeth a man with ioy of hart, and for a vaine and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous matter, to caſt himſelfe into certaine &amp; vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted daungers, and to deſire earneſtly to fall into them, to vndertake all things vnaduiſedly, and vnconſtrained to expect thoſe perils which he knoweth will fall vpon<note place="margin">Cato.</note> him. The Elder <hi>Cato</hi> hearing certaine men to commend one openly who deſperately hazarded himſelfe, and was bold without diſcretion in perils of warre, ſaid vnto them, <hi>That there was great difference betweene much esteeming of vertue, and little waighing of life:</hi> as if he would haue ſaid, that it is a commendable thing to deſire life to be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And truely to liue and die are not of themſelues good, but to do both of them rightly and in a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that to ſhunne death, if it proceed not from a faint hart, is not to be reprehended. But raſhneſſe is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be condemned in Captaines and Heads of Armies, as that which procureth great dammage to kingdomes<note place="margin">Iphicrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to a mans bodie.</note> and monarchies, and to ſo manie as march vnder their conduct.

the Scoutes lightly armed to the handes: the Horſemen to the Feete: the battaile of Footemen to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke and breaſt: and the Captaine to the Head of a Mans bodie. For (ſayde he) the Captaine that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeth himſelfe too much, and throweth himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to daunger without cauſe, is not retchleſſe of his own life onely, but alſo of all thoſe whoſe ſafetie dependeth vpon him: and contrarywiſe, in taking care for the ſafegard of his owne perſon, he careth therewithall for all thoſe that are vnder him. <hi>Iſadas</hi> the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian<note place="margin">The raſhneſſe of Iſadas.</note> ſeeyng <hi>Epaminondas</hi> with the Thebane armie at hand agaynſt the Spartanes, readie to force and take their Citie, vnclothed himſelfe ſtarke naked, puttyng off his Shirte and all, and taking a Partiſane in one hand, and a ſworde in the other, he went with might and mayne agaynſt his enemies, where he ſhewed great proweſſe and valure. For which behauiour although he had a Crowne giuen him by the Seignorie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome that was amongſt them, yet he was fined, bicauſe he hazarded his lyfe ſo raſhly. We ſee daylie among vs but too manie examples of great miſchiefes which befall men through their raſhneſſe, led with ambition and deſire of vayne-glorie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, and to drawe ſome profite out of our preſent diſcourſe, we ſay that we ought to feare the incurring of blame and diſhonour for filthie and vnhoneſt matters, and for euill deeds, and are to ſhun all feare proceeding of want of courage, of puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and of a depraued and corrupted nature: this laſt, as proper and peculiar to the wicked, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that which maketh a man vnapt to all good and commendable thinges. And as it is an acte of Prudence and Fortitude to prouide for a tempeſt and for ſtormes to come, (when the ſhippe is ſtill in the Hauen) and yet not to be afrayd in the middeſt of ſtormes: ſo is it a point of raſhneſſe for a man to throw himſelfe wittingly into an euident danger, which might be auoyded without any breach of Vertue and Iuſtice.

                  <p>Although the vertue of <hi>Fortitude</hi> be neuer perfected without Magnanimitie, (which is as much to <note place="margin">What Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie is.</note>ſay, as generoſitie or noblenes of hart) as that which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is comprehended vnder the firſt part of <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> which <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth Magnificence, or a doing of great &amp; excellent things, yet notwithſtanding it ſeemeth that this word <hi>Magnanimitie</hi> carieth with it ſome greater and more particular Empaſis, &amp; that a man may ſay, that the wonderful effects thereof appeare principally in three points, whereof I purpoſe here to diſcourſe. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Magnanimitie conſiſteth in three things.</note>extreme and deſperate matters, as when a man is paſt all hope of ſauing his life, wherein perfect magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie always knoweth how to find out a conuenient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie and wiſe conſolation, not ſuffering himſelfe to be vexed therewith. The ſecond reſpecteth dutie towards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, againſt whom generoſitie will in no wiſe ſuffer a man to practiſe or to conſent to any wickedneſſe, vnder what pretence ſo euer it be, nor for any aduantage which may be reaped thereby. The third cauſeth a noble min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man to contemne and to account that thing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the care of his ſoule which others wonder at, &amp; labor by all means to obtaine, namelie, ſtrength, health, beauty, which the Philoſophers call the goods of the bodie: and <note place="margin">The goods of the body and of Fortune.</note>riches, honor, and glory, which they ſay are the goods of fortune: and likewiſe not to ſtand in feare of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. Amongſt the woorthy and famous men of olde time, whoſe names and glorious factes crowned with an
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:8689:160"/>
immortall Lawrell, are ingrauen in the temple of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, we find no praiſe woorthie of greater admiration, or that ought to awaken and ſtirre vs vp better in Chriſtian dutie, than the effects of this vertue of Magnanimitie, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe three occaſions preſently touched. Whereof one <note place="margin">The firſt effect of Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</note>effect is, that we yeeld not againſt reaſon, nor paſſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of duty by fainting vnder that heauy burthen of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diſtreſſes, which the horror of death bringeth with it: but that euen in the midſt of greateſt agonie which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth intollerable in mans iudgement, we ſhew ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie and woorthines, that we depart not in any ſort from the peace and quietnes of our ſoules, but with conſtancie and cheerefulnes of ſpirit, meditate vpon the ioy of that hauen of ſaluation, which we behold with the eyes of our ſoule, whereinto through a happy death at hand, we ſhall <note place="margin">The ſecond effect.</note>ſhortly be receiued. Another effect is, that we accompliſh (ſo farre as our frailtie can approch to perfection) the commandement of the diuine will by louing our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors as our ſelues, and by abſtaining, euen in regard of our greateſt enimies, from doing, procuring or conſenting, yea by hindring that no treacherie or treaſon ſhould be wrought them, nor any other thing vnbeſeeming that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall loue, which ought to be in euery one towards his like, and further by procuring them all the good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <note place="margin">The third effect.</note>that may be. The third effect of this great vertue, no les wonderful tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt, is in that a noble minded man ſolong as he liueth, wholy withdraweth his affection from worldly and corruptible things through a ſtedfaſt &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <note place="margin">The common remedie of the Ancients in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate caſes.</note>reaſon, and lifteth it vp to the meditation and holy deſire of heauenly and eternal things. The remedy which theſe great perſonages deſtitute of the right knowledge of the truth moſt commonly vſed when their affaires were paſt all hope of mans helpe, was death, which they choſe rather to bring vpon themſelues by their owne handes, than to fall into the mercy of their enimies, whereby they ſuppoſed that they committed a noble act, woorthie the greatnes of their inuincible courage. And if peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they were ſurpriſed, and forced in ſuch ſort by their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:8689:160"/>
enemies, that they were compelled to become their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, they neuer deſired them to ſaue their liues, ſaying, that it beſeemed not a noble hart, and that in ſo doing they ſhould ſubmit both hart and bodie to him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Cato of Vtica.</note>had but the bodie in his power. <hi>Cato</hi> the yoonger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to ſuch extremity in the towne of Vtica, that by the aduice of all thoſe that were with him, he was to ſend Embaſſadors to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Conqueror, to practiſe an agreement after ſubmiſſion to his mercie, yeelded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto in the behalfe of others, but forbad that any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be made of himſelfe. <hi>It belongeth</hi> (quoth he) <hi>to thoſe that are ouercome, to make requeſt, and to ſuch as haue done amiſſe, to craue pardon. As for me I will account my ſelfe inuincible ſo long as in right and iustice I ſhall be mightier than Caeſar. He it is that is now taken and ouercome, bicauſe that which hitherto he denied to take in hand againſt the Common-wealth, is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſufficiently teſtified against him, and diſcouered. Neither will I be beholding or bound to a Tyrant for an vniust matter. For it is a point of iniustice in him to vſurpe the power of ſauing their liues (like a Lord) ouer whome he hath no right to command.</hi> After many other ſpeeches of Philoſophie vſed by him, &amp; ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much vpon that Stoicall opinion, <hi>that onely a wiſe and</hi>

The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which we read of the Numantines, commeth in fitly for this matter which we handle heere. For after they had ſuſtained the ſiege of the Romanes fourteene yeeres togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and were in the ende incloſed by <hi>Scipio</hi> with a very great ditch of two and fortie foote in depth, and thirtie in breadth, which compaſſed the citie round about, the Conſul ſummoned them to commit themſelues to the clemencie of the Romanes, and to truſt to their promiſe, ſeeing all meanes of ſallying foorth to fight, and of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering any victuals were taken from them. To whome they made this onely anſwer, that foraſmuch as they had liued for the ſpace of 338. yeeres in freedom, they would not die ſlaues in any ſort. Whereupon, ſuch as were moſt valiant, aſſembled togither and ſlew thoſe that were moſt growne in yeeres, with women and children. Then they tooke all the riches of the citie, and of the temples, and brought it into the midſt of a great hall, and ſetting fire to all quarters of the citie, each of them tooke the ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poiſon they could find: ſo that the temples, houſes, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and people of Numantia ended all in one day, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to <hi>Scipio,</hi> neither riches to ſpoile, neither man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to triumph withal. For during the whole time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their citie was beſieged, not one Numantine yeelded himſelfe priſoner to any Romane, but ſlew himſelfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he would yeeld. Which Magnanimitie cauſed <hi>Scipio</hi> to bewaile the deſolation of ſuch a people, in theſe words: <hi>O happie Numantia, which the Gods had decreed ſhould once end, but neuer be vanquiſhed.</hi> Now albeit theſe examples and infinite other like to theſe, are ſet foorth vnto vs by

This did <hi>Socrates</hi> knowe very well, when he ſaid, that we muſt not ſuffer our ſoule to depart from the Sentinell wherein ſhe is placed in this bodie, without the leaue of hir Captaine: and that ſo waightie a matter as death ought not (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) to be in mans power. But if it be offred vnto vs by the will of God, then with a magnanimious hart, void of al ſtarting aſide in any thing againſt dutie, we muſt ſet free this paſſage, being ſtaied and aſſuredly grounded vpon that conſolation, which neuer forſaketh a good conſcience, not onely through the expectation of a naked and ſimple humane glorie, which moſt of the Heathen propounded to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but of that life which abideth for euer: following therein the conſtancie of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> a great Captaine of <note place="margin">Alcibiades con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in death.</note>Grecia, who hearing the ſentence of his condemnation to death pronounced, ſaid: <hi>It is I that leaue the Athenians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, and not they me.

For it is very certaine, that he who would in time of battell caſt downe his armour and flie away, might by that meane auoid death (and the like is to be vnderſtood in al dangers &amp; perils) if he were not afraid of infamie. But conſider (O countreymen) that it is no very hard matter to auoid death, but farre more difficult to eſchew wickednes and the ſhame therof, which are a great deale ſwifier of foote than that is.</hi> O ſpeech woorthie of eternal praiſe, and ſuch a one as inſtructeth a Chriſtian notably in a great and noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: namely, to run the race of his ſhort daies in that vocation, wherunto God hath called him, and that in the midſt of tortures, torments, &amp; all agonies of death. From which, whileſt we expect a happie paſſage, we ought to be no more deſtitute of an apt remedie in all thoſe things, which according to the world are moſt irkeſome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, but ſuſtaine them with like conſtancie and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, not departing from the tranquillitie and reſt of our ſoules, which is a more noble act, than to haſten for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of our daies, that we may be deliuered of them.

of this vertue of Magnanimity, wherof Heroical men <note place="margin">Examples of the ſecond ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie.</note>were ſo prodigall heeretofore for the benefit and ſafetie of their enemies, we can bring no better teſtimonie than <note place="margin">Fabritius.</note>the courteous fact of <hi>Fabritius</hi> the Romane Conſul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who warred againſt him, and whoſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrote vnto him, that he offered himſelfe to murder his maiſter by poiſon, and ſo to end their ſtrife without danger. But <hi>Fabritius</hi> ſent the letter vnto him, and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withall, that he had made a bad choice of friends, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as of enemies, bicauſe he made warre with vpright &amp; good men, and truſted ſuch as were diſloiall and wicked: whereof he thought good to let him vnderſtand, not ſo much to gratifie him, as leaſt the accident of his death ſhould procure blame to the Romanes, as if they had ſought or conſented to end the warre by meanes of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not being able to obtaine their purpoſe by their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. <hi>Camillus</hi> a Romane Dictator, is no leſſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <note place="margin">Camillus.</note>for that which he did during the ſiege of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Fallerians. For he that was Schoolemaiſter to the chiefeſt mens children amongſt them, being gone out of the citie, vnder colour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> his youth to walke, and to exerciſe themſelues along the wals, deliuered them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of this Romane Captaine, ſaying vnto him, that he might be well aſſured the Citizens would yeeld themſelues to his deuotion, for the ſafetie and libertie of that which was deereſt vnto them. But <hi>Camillus</hi> knowing this to be too vile and wicked a practiſe, ſaid to thoſe that were with him, that although men vſed great outrage and violence in warre, yet among good men certaine lawes &amp; points of equitie were to be obſerued. For victorie was <note place="margin">A good leſſon for a Generall to learne.</note>not ſo much to be deſired, as that it ſhould be gotten and kept by ſuch curſed and damnable meanes: but a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ought to warre, truſting to his owne vertue, and not to the wickednes of others. Then ſtripping the ſaid ſchole maiſter, and binding his hands behind him, he deliuered him naked into the hands of his ſchollers, and gaue to ech of them a bundle of rods, that ſo they might carye him backe againe into the citie. For which noble act the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:8689:163"/>
yeelded themſelues to the Romanes: ſaying, that in preferring iuſtice before victorie, they had taught them to chooſe rather to ſubmit themſelues vnto them, than to retaine ſtill their libertie: confeſſing withall, that they were ouercome more by their vertue, than vanquiſhed by their force and power. So great power hath Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it doth not onely aduance Princes to the higheſt degree of honor, but alſo abateth the hart of the puiſſant and warlike enemie, and oftentimes procureth victorie without battell. Truly we may draw an excellent doctrine out of theſe examples, which make all thoſe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that ſpare nothing to attaine to the end of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and deuices, making no difficultie at the deſtruction of innocents, but exerciſing all kind of crueltie, ſo they may ouerthrow their enemies by what meanes ſoeuer: v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing commonly that ſaying of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> Admirall of the Lacedemonians, <hi>that if the Lions skin will not ſuffice, the Foxe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Treaſon and crueltie neuer find place in a noble hart.</note>
                     <hi>his skin alſo is to be ſewed on.</hi> But let vs reſolutely hold this, that treaſon neuer findeth place in a noble hart, no more than the bodie of a Foxe is not found in a Lions bodie. Further, it is notoriouſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that the Ancients ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to procure all good and profit to their enemies, vſing clemencie and humanitie towards them, when they had greater occaſion and meanes to be reuenged of them. Heereof we may alleadge good examples, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe heereafter particularly of thoſe vertues that are proper to a noble minded man, who ought to hate cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Of the third ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie.</note>no leſſe than treaſon. We are therefore to looke vnto the laſt effect, and ſound proofe of Magnanimitie &amp; Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſitie heere propounded by vs, which we ſaid, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the contempt of earthlie and humane goods. Wherein truly reſteth the very perfection of a Chriſtian, who lifteth vp his deſires to his laſt and ſoueraigne Good in heauen. Now, becauſe there are but few that loue not themſelues too much in thoſe things that concerne the commodities of this life, and fewer that ſeeke not after glorie &amp; honor, as a recompence of their excellent deeds, and that deſire not riches earneſtly to ſatisfie their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:8689:163"/>
in theſe three points alſo a noble minded man cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his vertue to appeere more wonderfull, bicauſe he doth not iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a worthie reward for the ſame, but rather altogether vnwoorthy the care of his ſoule, for which principally he deſireth to liue. This is that which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that it is not ſeemely that he ſhould yeeld to couetouſnes and concupiſcence, who could not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by feare, or that he ſhould be ouercome by pleaſure, who hath reſiſted griefe: but rather that theſe things ought to be ſhunned by all poſſible means, togither with the deſire of money, ſeeing there is nothing more vile &amp; abiect, than to loue riches, nor more noble than to deſpiſe them. This alſo is that which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that it belongeth to the duetie of a noble hart not onely to ſurmount feare, but alſo to moderate his deſires &amp; concupiſcences, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he hath libertie to vſe them, whither it be in the pleaſure of the bodie, or in the ambitious deſire of vain glory, honour and power. In this ſort then, he that hath a right noble and worthie mind, will no more waigh greatnes among men and eſtimation of the common ſort, than he doth griefe and pouertie, but depending wholie vpon the wil of God, &amp; conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting himſelf with his works wrought in him, he will not that any good thing vpon earth can be taken from him. And bicauſe he aſpireth to thoſe things that are beſt, higheſt, and moſt difficult, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth free from all earthly care and griefe, as being long before prepared for all dolors, through the contempt of death, which bringing an end to the greateſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue pangs, ſerueth him for an entrance into eternall reſt. We haue already alleaged many examples of ancient men fit for this matter which now we ſpeake of, and the ſequele of our treatiſes will furniſh vs with mo when we ſhall come to intreat of riches and worldly wealth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are to ſpeake more at large. But here we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Aristides</hi> onely to be imitated, who was a woorthy <note place="margin">Aristides.</note>man among the Athenians, whoſe opinion was that a good citizen ought to be alwayes prepared alike to offer his body &amp; mind vnto the ſeruice of the common wealth,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:8689:164"/>
without hope or expectation of any hired and mercenary reward either of money, honor, or glory. And ſo with an vnſpeakeable grauitie and conſtancie, he kept himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways vpright in the ſeruice of his countrey, in ſuch ſort, that no honor done vnto him could cauſe him either to be puffed vp in hart, or to be more earneſt in imploying himſelfe: (as it is the maner of ſome to do ſeruice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are recompenced) neither could any repulſe or deniall which he ſuffred, abate his courage or trouble him, or yet diminiſh and leſſen his affection and deſire to profit his common wealth. Whereas now adayes we ſee that the moſt part of men with vs vpon a ſmal diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, labor to make publike profite to ſerue their deſires and paſſions, in ſtead of giuing themſelues to the good &amp; benefit of their countrey. Now concluding our preſent <note place="margin">Magnanimitie is inuincible.</note>diſcourſe, we learne that true and perfect Magnanimitie and Generoſitie is inuincible and inexpugnable, bicauſe vpon this conſideration, that death is the common end of mans life, and that happy paſſage to life euerlaſting, ſhe deſpiſeth it altogither, and maketh leſſe account thereof than of bondage and vice: ſuſtaining alſo with a great &amp; vnappalled hart, moſt cruel torments, not being mooued thereby to do any thing that may ſeem to proceed of the common weaknes and frailtie of mans nature. Further we learne that this vertue maketh him that poſſeſſeth hir, good, gentle, and curteous, euen towards his greateſt eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, againſt whom it ſuffereth him not to vſe any couin or malice, but keepeth him alwayes within the limites of equitie and iuſtice: cauſing him further to make choice of and to finiſh all honeſt matters of his owne will, and for their loue, not caring at all for mortall and corruptible things, that he may wholy apprehend and take hold of thoſe things that are diuine and eternall.</p>

of ambition, of vainglory, or of any other vnbrideled deſire, can neuer haue that happy and good hope, which neuer deceiueth men. And in deed they miſſe oftentimes of their intent, yea, are depriued of that which was their owne and certaine, bicauſe they are deſirous to get vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly another mans right, being alſo vncertaine. The ſelfe ſame thing falleth out to thoſe that truſt and ſtay in ſuch ſort vpon their owne ſtrength, vertue and conſtancie, that fearing in no reſpect (as they ſay) the greateſt calamities that can come to man, aſſure themſelues in their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie<note place="margin">Who are ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt throwen downe with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.</note> to be inuincible in their reſolutions, and preſume that nothing is able to pull them downe, or to cauſe them to change their opinion: and yet, ſo ſoone as the wind of aduerſitie bloweth, they are the firſt that are throwen to the ground, and ſooneſt ſhew foorth the inconſtancie &amp; imbecillitie of mans nature left to it ſelf. As contrarywiſe, they to whom God giueth eyes to acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, are then humbled, ſo that they reuerence the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, who derideth all the enterpriſes of men. The practiſe hereof was well knowen to <hi>Wencelaüs</hi> king of<note place="margin">Wencelaüs.</note> Hungaria, being driuen out of his kingdom, and forſaken of his owne, who oftentimes vſed to ſay, <hi>The hope I had in men hindred me from putting my trust in God: but now that all my confidence is in him, I aſſure my ſelfe that he will helpe me by his diuine goodneſſe.</hi> As in deed it fell out ſo vnto him, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed agayne in all his eſtates and dignities. But <hi>to the end we confound not togither that</hi> which is ſimplie diuine, with that which is humaine, I thinke we ought to make a double hope: the firſt, true, certaine, and vnfallible,<note place="margin">The diuiſion of hope.</note> which concerneth holy and ſacred myſteries: the other doubtful, reſpecting earthly things only. As touching the firſt, we know things to come by the aſſurance thereof, as well as if they were already done.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:8689:166"/>
without doubting the perfect and abſolute enioying of thoſe goods that are immortall, vnutterable and endleſſe in the ſecond and eternall life. Without this hope groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the free goodneſſe of the almightie, let vs aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perſwade our ſelues, that mans eſtate is more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than that of brute beaſts, ſeeing this is the only way of his ſaluation. The other hope which concerneth this preſent life only in all ſuch things as we propound to our ſelues for the benefit and contentation thereof, hath ſuch<note place="margin">Of earthly hope.</note> neede to be ruled, guided, and referred to the happie end of the firſt excellent and heauenly hope, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cannot but be doubtfull, inconſtant, &amp; raſh, what humane reaſon ſoeuer we can alleage to perſwade the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of attaining to the end of our pretended deuiſes, which in one moment may be quite ouerthrown, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions whereof being for the moſt part ſecret and hid from vs. Moreouer the imperfection of whatſoeuer men commonly moſt eſteeme vpon earth is ſo great that togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their continuall vncertaintie, the perturbations which hinder the tranquillitie of the ſoule redouble and abound ſo much the more, as the enioying of theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodities increaſe and augment, leauing in man a continuall deſire to multiply them, and a feare to looſe them. As touching this hope therefore of humane things which we wiſh might alwayes proſper with vs, we may wel hope what we will, but withall we muſt prepare and ſettle our ſelues to ſupport conſtantly whatſoeuer falleth out, that that which commeth vnto vs againſt our will, may not be altogither againſt our expectation: and that we neuer vſe ſuch repinings as theſe, vnbeſeeming a wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Speeches vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a wiſe man.</note> 
                     <hi>I would neuer haue thought it: I looked for another matter: I would neuer have ſuppoſed that ſuch a thing could haue happened.</hi> In the meane while we muſt not omit to <hi>Hope</hi> the beſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in our croſſes and calamities, bicauſe nothing leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth ſo much the ſharpneſſe of preſent aduerſities as the hope of future benefit, the certaine expectation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">The fruit of hope.</note> as it were ſtealeth away our labours, and cauſeth all feare of perill to vaniſh away.

ſaith, that we muſt neuer be diſcouraged for aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, but always hope for better things. The calamities of mortall men (ſaith <hi>Euripides)</hi> in the end leaue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and as the winds do not alwayes blow vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo happy men are not euer fortunate.

                     <hi>Pindarus</hi> calleth it the nurſe of old age. <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> ſaid, that nothing in all the world was more common than Hope, bicauſe it abideth with them alſo that haue no other goods. The Elpiſtick Philoſophers affirmed, that nothing better maintained and preſerued the life of man, than Hope.

For it greatly helpeth man to liue contentedly and happily, if, as we ſaid, it haue reſpect to the beſt ende, vnto which all our deſires and inclinations ought to be referred, and ought to be gouerned thereby according to reaſon and iuſtice. Otherwiſe it is certaine that a man can neuer peaceably and to his contentation, enioy his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate and condition, but alwayes ſome new hope of better things to come, wil cauſe him to neglect that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is aſſured, and to run after an vncertaintie, vntill in the end being often deceiued and miſſing of his purpoſes &amp; enterpriſes, he be ouerthrown quite through his great hopes.

Then <hi>Cineas</hi> hauing brought him to that point which he deſired, ſaid vnto him: And what ſir, letteth vs from reſt at this preſent, and from liuing in ioy and pleaſure, ſeeing we haue all things requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, without ſeeking it with ſo much effuſion of mans bloud, beſides infinite hazards and dangers, and that in ſuch places where it is vncertaine whether we ſhal find it?

And although this Prince could not doubt at all what happineſſe and great felicitie he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke, yet was it vnpoſſible to take the hope of that which he deſired out of his mind. Wherefore <hi>Antigonus</hi> king of <note place="margin">Pyrrhus compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Dice-plaier.</note>Macedonia compared him very fitly to a Dice-player, to whom the Dice ſpeake faire by giuing vnto him good chances, but yet ſo that he cannot caſt the ſame againe to ſerue his turne. For he loſt that by hope, which he had gotten in deede, deſiring ſo earneſtly that which he had not, that he forgate to make that ſure which was already in his poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in deed it fell out very vnhappily with him in the ende. For after he had fought proſperouſly a certaine time, he was diſcomfited by the Romanes, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after beſieged, was ſlaine with a tile which a woman let fall vpon his head. Was there euer monarch who ought rather to haue contented and delighted himſelfe peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <note place="margin">Caeſar was led continually with new hope.</note>in the enioying of his vnſpeakable proſperities than <hi>Iulius Caeſar?</hi> And yet not being ſatiſfied with the Romane
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:8689:167"/>
Empire, which he had obtained by ſo many trauels and innumerable dangers, he made preparation (whileſt the conſpirators ſought his death) to go himſelfe in perſon to warre againſt the Parthians. So that as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the hope of that which was to come, cauſed him to contemne the glorie gotten by his former deeds, and to depriue himſelfe of that commendation, which he ſhould haue no leſſe deſerued in preſeruing himſelfe, and in the good gouernment of his great eſtate, than he did in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the ſame: whereof he reaped no other benefit, but onely a vaine name and glorie of ſmall continuance in his life time, which procured him the enuie and hatred of his countreymen, ſo that he was murdred with 23. blowes of the ſword on his bodie, after he had ouerliued <hi>Pompey</hi> (who was vanquiſhed by him) foure yeeres onely, or little more. Hiſtories are full of ſundrie ſuch alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which commonly follow them that are not content with their eſtate: from whence wiſe men and of good iudgement may drawe this inſtruction, to limit their thoughts and deſires. For as <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Athenian ſaid, <note place="margin">Two things hurtfull to men.</note>theſe two things are very hurtfull to men, <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Loue,</hi> of which the one leadeth, and the other accompanieth them, the one ſeeketh out the meanes to execute their thoughts, and the other perſuadeth them with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. And although theſe two things are not ſeene with the eie, yet are they mightier than viſible puniſhments. Heerof came that old prouerb, <hi>that proud men fat themſelues with vaine hope, which by little and little choaketh them, as naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fat doth mans bodie.</hi> And if we be willing to keepe our ſelues from ſo dangerous a downefall, let vs cure our ſoules of all hurtfull hope, and let reaſon and dutie (as we haue alreadie ſaid) lead and limit all our affections and enterpriſes, conſidering wiſely their beginning, namely, that we ground them vpon right and equitie only, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">We muſt not judge of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent.</note>that they ought not to be iudged of by the euent and end of them, which oftentimes ſeeme to fauor vniuſt cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:8689:168"/>
of violating right and iuſtice. But how ſoeuer it be, a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end bringeth them an ouer late repentance. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs perſwade our ſelues, that the iſſue of our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and enterpriſes, although they be well grounded, ſhall certainly fall out according to our meaning, (for this is that hope, which greatly hurteth, and moſt of all troubleth men) but let vs know, that as in al things which grow, there is alwaies ſome corruption mingled in them (it being neceſſarie that all mortall ſeedes ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ill hap is more common than good.</note>be partakers of the cauſe of death) ſo from the ſame fountaine ill hap floweth vnto vs in great meaſure, yea ſooner and more abundantly than good ſucceſſe. Which thing <hi>Homer</hi> willing to giue vs to vnderſtand, fained that there were two veſſels at the entrie of the great Olympus, the one being full of honie, the other of gall, of which two mingled togither, <hi>Iupiter</hi> cauſeth all men to drinke. And <hi>Plutark</hi> ſaith, that men can neuer purely and ſimply enioy the eaſe of any great proſperitie, but whether it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or the enuie of deſtinie, or elſe the naturall neceſſitie of earthlie things, there eaſe is alwaies intermingled in their life time with euill among the good, yea in the like miſhap that which is woorſe, ſurmounteth the better. All theſe things being conſidered of vs, they will make vs more aduiſed and ſtaied in all our counſels and deuiſes, &amp; in ſuch ſort affected and prepared with true prudence, fortitude, and magnanimitie, that whatſoeuer hapneth vnto vs, we ſhall not be troubled or further mooued, but <note place="margin">Seneca aduiſeth vs to prepare our ſelues to all cuents.</note>receiue it, as hauing long before expected and looked for it. This doth <hi>Seneca</hi> very learnedly teach vs, ſaying: that we ought not to be aſtoniſhed or maruell at vnlooked for chances that light vpon vs, but prepare and conforme our harts to all euents that may come vnto vs, premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and thinking aforehand, that we are borne to ſuffer, and that nothing commeth to paſſe, which ought not to be. <hi>Deſtinie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leadeth thoſe that are conſenting, &amp; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth gain-ſayers by force.</hi> Neither ought we, through doubt of that which is to come, to neglect good, heroicall, and farre remooued hopes of excellent things, hauing thus
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:8689:168"/>
grounded them as we haue ſaid. For wiſe and famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, deſirous of honor and glorie, were alwaies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that they ought to be intertained and kept in a ſound and ſetled reſolution of the mind, bicauſe of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of accidents, which daily happen contrary to the common opinions of men: wherein experience teacheth vs, that according to the direction of a good ſpirite, and the good ſucceſſe that followeth and accompanieth it, whatſoeuer concerneth the managing of worldlie affairs, is changed; and turneth about with the moouing of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, <note place="margin">What the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by the word Fortune.</note>if it be lawfull for vs vnder this Heathen word to vnderſtand the ordinance of God.

                  <p>Among all the ancients, the Stoike Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers were moſt zealous and preciſe obſeruers of all points concerning this vertue of patience, which they grounded vpon the fatall cauſe of neceſſitie, requiring <note place="margin">Of the Stoicall patience.</note>ſuch exactnes and perfection thereof in men, that they would haue a noble hart to be no otherwiſe touched with aduerſitie than with proſperitie, nor with ſorowful things than with ioyfull. For this cauſe <hi>Aristo</hi> ſaid, that vertue onely was to be wiſhed, and therefore that it was all one to be ſicke or ſound, poore or rich: briefly, that in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane and neceſſary vſes of nature, there was no more euil in one kind, than in another. Whereby it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that theſe Philoſophers delighted in painting out a picture of ſuch patience, as neuer was, nor ſhal be among men, except firſt they ſhould be vnclothed of all humaine nature, or become as blockiſh and ſenceleſſe as a ſtone. For ſo long as man remaineth in this life, he cannot be void of affections and perturbations that draw the ſoule to care and to prouide for the body, which continually crieth out againſt her for feare of griefe and of wanting that which belongeth vnto it. But it is the dutie of a wiſe man to moderate all paſſions in ſuch ſort, that in the end reaſon remaine miſtreſſe. Moreouer we ſay that vertue <note place="margin">Vertue is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>which is a habite of comelines and mediocritie in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ought neither to be without hir motions, nor yet too much ſubiect to paſſions. For the aboliſhing of deſire ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:8689:170"/>
the ſoule without motion, &amp; without ioy euen in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt things: as on the other ſide ouer vehement motions thereof altogether trouble hir, and cauſe hir to be as it were beſide hir ſelfe. Further, we ſeeke after the common practiſe of men, not for that perfection which they wiſh for, and whereunto they ought to aſpire: and we deſire that affection ſhould ſhew it ſelfe no otherwiſe in vertue, than a little ſhadow of a hidden cloud, or a line in a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. <note place="margin">Of true pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>Therfore true patience which we ought to imbrace in all things, not as compelled and of neceſſity, but cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and as reſting in our welfare, is a moderation &amp; tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our euils, which, albeit we ſigh vnder the heauie burthen of them, clothe vs in the meane while with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ioy, that ſtriueth ſo well and maſtreth in ſuch ſort the ſence of nature which ſhunneth griefe, that in the end it worketh in vs an affection of pietie &amp; godlineſſe, ioyned with a free &amp; cheerful mind, vnder the yoke &amp; obedience of the iuſt &amp; rightfull will of God, through a certain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of things promiſed, and cauſeth vs to iudge impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiencie to be contumacie and rebellion to this diuine wil, <note place="margin">The definition of patience.</note>and ſufficient of it ſelfe to make a man to be called wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Patience (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> is a habite that conſiſteth in ſuſtaining ſtoutly all labours and griefes for the loue of honeſtie. The law ſaith, that it is a very good thing to keep the tranquillitie of our ſpirit as much as may be in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and not to complaine of that which is vncertaine: bicauſe men know not whither that which is light vpon them be good or euil for them, as alſo bicauſe ſorow can not helpe that which is to come, but rather hindreth the curing of the euill: and laſtly, bicauſe there is nothing in humane matters, wherof any great account is to be made. But if I muſt needs ſupport them, my deſire and labour is to do it nobly, honeſtly, and courageouſly. It skilleth not what we endure, but how we endure it. And then doth patience preuail moſt, when we know that whatſoeuer we haue done, was executed of vs for godlines ſake. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict <note place="margin">The fruits of patience.</note>of Patience (ſaith <hi>Euripides)</hi> is ſuch, that the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed is better than the vanquiſher. And let vs not thinke
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:8689:170"/>
that there is any calamitie which cannot be ſuſtained by the nature of man armed with patience, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible tower. Patience (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is a voluntarie and long ſuffring of labours, calamities, trauels, and difficult matters, for the loue of honeſtie and of vertue. And when all things are ouerthrowen, and counſaile wil do no more good, there is but this one only remedy, to beare patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatſoeuer ſhall come vpon vs. Patience ſerueth vs for a meane to attaine to great matters, ſtaying men from fainting in dangers and trauels. By patience whatſoeuer is diſordred, may be brought againe to good order, as that wiſe emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> would giue vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, when he ſayd that patience had no leſſe holpen him in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his eſtate than knowledge. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is for the moſt part followed of curteſie and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which make him well liked of that is adorned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and ſooner draw good wil, the cauſe of mens obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then force or violence doth. He that is ſlowe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (ſaith the wiſe man) is better than the mightie man, <note place="margin">Prou. 16. 32.</note>and he that ruleth his owne mind, is better than he that winneth a citie. True patience loueth the afflictions which ſhe ſuffreth, cauſing him that poſſeſſeth hir to giue prayſe to God in the midſt of aduerſities, and to ſubmit himſelf to his iudgement when he is preſſed with diſeaſes: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can pouertie keep him backe from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his bountie and goodnes. To be ſhort, as a pearle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hir beautie euen in the midſt of a puddle: ſo a patient man cauſeth his vertue to appeere in al aduerſities. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer this patience which we ſhew in aduerſities, mooueth thoſe to compaſſion and pitie that ſee vs ſuffer. Which thing as it greatly comforteth in affliction, ſo oftentimes it cauſeth others to reape ineſtimable benefite when they behold vs to ſuffer vniuſtly. For it ſerueth to awaken and to ſtrengthen the weake in the knowledge of their duetie, that they ſuffer not themſelues to be deceiued with the poiſonfull ſweetnes of worldly goods and commodities. In a word the vertue of patience is ſo neceſſarie for a good and happy life, that no part or action of mans life can be
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:8689:171"/>
guided to their proper end without hir. And as ſhe is a branch of Magnanimitie, Fortitude, and greatnes of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; ſo Impatiencie is a weakenes and imbecillitie of a <note place="margin">Of impatiencie, choler, and wrath.</note>baſe, vile, and contemptible nature, wherin choler, and in the end wrath, are eaſily ingendred, which are two very pernitious paſſions in the ſoule, and differ nothing from furie (as the elder <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid) but onely in this, that they continue a leſſe time, and this a longer. This is that which <note place="margin">The definition of anger.</note>
                     <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> teacheth vs, ſaying: that Anger is nothing elſe but a ſhort furie. <hi>Aristides</hi> called it the inflammation of blood, and an alteration of the hart. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that that which the Latines call Anger, is named of the Grecians deſire of reuenge. And <hi>Solon</hi> being demanded to whome a man fraught with Anger, might be compared, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: to him that maketh no account of loſing his friends, and careth not although he procure enemies to himſelfe. But beſides the ſayings of all theſe Sages, experience ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſheweth vs, that Choler and Anger are enemies to all reaſon: and (as <hi>Plutark</hi> ſaith) are no leſſe proud, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, and vneaſie to be guided by another, than a great and mightie tyrannie: Inſomuch that a ſhip giuen ouer to the mercie of the windes and ſtormes, would ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it ſelfe receiue a Pilot from without, than a man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried headlong with wrath and choler, would yeeld to the reaſon and admonition of another. For an angry man (like to thoſe that burne themſelues within their owne houſes) filleth his ſoule in ſuch ſort with trouble, chafing, &amp; noiſe, that he neither ſeeth nor heareth any thing that would profit him, vnles he make prouiſion long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſuccour himſelfe with reaſon through the ſtudie of wiſedome, whereby he may be able to ouerthrow his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency and choler, which argue and accompanie for the <note place="margin">Who are moſt giuen to impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</note>moſt part a weake and effeminate hart. And that this is true, we ſee that women are commonly ſooner driuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to choler than men: the ſicke than the ſound: the olde than the yoong: all vitious, gluttonous, iealous, vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, and ambitious men, than thoſe that vnfainedly hate vice. Whereby it is euident enough, that choler pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:8689:171"/>
from the infirme and weake part of the ſoule, and not from the Generoſitie thereof. Neither doth it make againſt our ſaying, to alleadge the opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> &amp; of al the Peripateticks, who maintained that we ought to moderate the affections and paſſions of the ſoule: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe that they were neceſſarie to pricke men forward to vertue. Yea <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that choler was as a whetſtone to ſharpen and ſet an edge vpon Fortitude and Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">Ariſtotle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in opinion to the Stoicks.</note>The Academicks and Stoicks contend greatly againſt this opinion, and namely <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> who ſay, that foraſmuch as choler is a vice, it cannot be the cauſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſeeing they are two contrary thinges that haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing common together. And conſidering that Fortitude proceedeth from an aduiſed conſultation and election of reaſon, which perfecteth the worke, whereas choler hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and troubleth it in ſuch ſort, that an angrie man cannot deliberate, it is not poſſible that it ſhould ſtand him in any ſteed in the performance of excellent actions. And this is an inuincible reaſon, bicauſe vertue commeth not of vice. Now, this being the end of all Philoſophie for a man to know his vices, and the meanes how to deliuer himſelfe from them, and ſeeing that the infamie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie which accompanie impatiencie and choler, cannot but be knowne vnto vs, yea are notwithſtanding ſo common amongſt vs, that the perfecteſt are infected therewith, let vs looke for ſome helpe and meane to cure <note place="margin">How impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and choler may be cured.</note>our ſelues thereof. Firſt let vs know, that although men may be mooued to wrath and choler for diuers cauſes, yet vnto all of them, the opinion of being contemned and deſpiſed is commonly ioined. And therefore the true and ſoueraigne remedie for this, (that ſo we may auoid ſuch a cold and ſlender occaſion of entring into choler againſt our neighbours, altogither vnbeſeeming the loue we owe them) will be to put from vs as much as may be, all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being deſpiſed and contemned, or of brauerie and boldnes, and to lay all the fault either vpon neceſſitie or negligence, vpon chance, vntowardnes, lacke of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ignorance, or want of experience, which are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:8689:172"/>
in them that offend vs. This will ſeeme very ſtrict counſell, and hard to practiſe, yea hatefull to many of our Frenchmen, chiefly to thoſe of the Nobilitie, who are ſo curious in the preſeruation of their honour, with which title they would diſguiſe the deſire of worldly glory, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto <note place="margin">What the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked iudge of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note>they ſhew themſelues ſo much affectionated. But they teſtifie ſufficiently, that they neuer knewe wherein true honor conſiſteth, which is no more ſeparated from vertue, than the ſhadowe from the bodie: alſo that they know not what patience is, accounting it rather to be fainthartednes, and cowardlines, than a part and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the vertue of Fortitude and Generoſitie, yea iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it a diſhonor to a man that is contumeliouſly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not to render the like againe. But contrariwiſe we are to know, that to ſupport and indure wrong &amp; iniurie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and euen then when we haue moſt meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge our ſelues, is a note of a moſt abſolute, noble, and excellent vertue. Yea, it beſeemeth a Chriſtian moſt of all, and ſuch a one as hath thoſe words of the Scripture well <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 18. Deut. 32. 35.</note>engrauen in his hart, <hi>Thou ſhalt not auenge, nor be mindfull of wrong againſt the children of thy people, but ſhalt loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe: I am the Lord, vengeance and recompence are mine.</hi> But I hope that heerafter we ſhall diſcourſe of this ſubiect by itſelfe, which deſerueth to be handled more <note place="margin">Whereof cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is bred.</note>largely. Following therefore our matter, we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that choler is bred of a cuſtome to be angrie for ſmall things, and afterward becommeth eaſilie a fire of ſudden wrath, a reuenging bitternes, and an vntractable ſharpenes, making a man froward and furious, diſliking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing. Wherefore a wiſe man ought preſently to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the iudgement of reaſon to euery little anger, and to ſuppreſſe it. This will helpe to make the ſoule firme and of power to reſiſt and beate backe all fiercenes of choler in matters of greater weight and conſequence.

from the very firſt inſtant wherin it beginneth to appeere, imitating <hi>Socrates</hi> therein, who, whenſoeuer he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſomwhat more egerly mooued againſt any man than he ought (like to a wiſe Pilote that getteth himſelfe vnder the Lee of ſome rocke) let fall his voyce gently, ſhewyng a ſmiling countenance and more curteous looke, thereby ſetting himſelfe directly againſt his paſſion. Beſides, it wil greatly helpe vs, if when we are mooued with anger, we ſtay our toong a certaine ſpace, and delay a litle while our owne reuenge. For it is very certaine that a man promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſpeaketh and doth many things in his anger, which afterward he wiſheth had neuer been in his thought. Vnto this fitly agreeth that counſaile which <hi>Athenodorus</hi> taking <note place="margin">The counſaile that Athenodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus gaue to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</note>his leaue, gaue to <hi>Augustus</hi> the emperor to ſtay the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious effects of quicke and ready choler. This Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher minding to teach ſome remedy to be oppoſed at the very inſtant when this monarch ſhould feele himſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken with anger, whereunto he eaſily ſuffred himſelfe to be caried; willed him to rehearſe the foure and twentie letters of the Greeke Alphabet before he did any thing in his anger. But knowing this that it is a ſpeciall propertie of mans imbecillitie to be ſtirred vp to anger and to be troubled, let vs follow that commandement of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Not to ſinne in our anger, neither to let the ſunne go downe</hi>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:8689:173"/>
ſubiect, he ſhould be mooued with wrath againſt any of his ſeruants that ſhould breake them, and ſo puniſh him too ſeuerely. And of this matter we may alſo draw a good<note place="margin">Magiſtrates ought not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any in their choler.</note> inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for all thoſe that are placed in authoritie aboue others, namely, that they beware leaſt they correct or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any body in their choler, but only when they are void of all vehement paſſions, conſidering the fact in it ſelfe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly, and with quiet and ſetled ſences: knowing that as bodies ſeeme greater through a miſte, ſo doe faults through choler, which for the moſt part carieth Princes headlong to commit execrable and curſed cruelties.

Of which fault repenting him, but too late, he made a law afterward whereby he willed that the execution of his letters Patents and Commaundements ſhould be held in ſuſpence and deferred, thirtie days after ſignification and knowledge of them, namely, when any were to be puniſhed more rigorouſly than of cuſtome he vſed.

But this being a matter of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, let vs continue our morall inſtructions, and note that which we read of <hi>Plato,</hi> deſeruing to be conſidered of here, who being very angry with a ſeruaunt of his for a great fault committed by him, and ſeeing <hi>Xenocrates</hi> to come<note place="margin">Plato refuſed to correct his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> towards him, requeſted him if he were his friend to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that ſeruant of his, bicauſe at this preſent (quoth he) anger ſurmounteth my reaſon. Whereby this wiſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:8689:173"/>
declared ſufficiently, that if the firſt motions are not at all in our power through the imperfection of our nature, yet at the leſt reaſon may ſerue for a bridle to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euery naughtie execution: teaching vs likewiſe, that we ought to vſe and exerciſe our power and authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer others without any extreme paſſion. Further, that we may haue ſuch imperfections in greater hatred, we are to note that choler hath been the ouerthrow of many great men, as it was of the emperor <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> who was endued<note place="margin">Aurelianus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was the cauſe of his death.</note> with notable vertues, but otherwiſe eaſilie mooued to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whoſe wrath was ſuch, that their death with whom he was diſpleaſed, was the onely remedie to appeaſe it. For being one day incenſed againſt <hi>Mnesteus</hi> his Secretarie, he knowing his maſters diſpoſition, for the ſafegard of his life deuiſed to write (counterfaiting the emperors hand) in a litle ſcroule the names of the principall captaines of his army, putting himſelfe in the number of thoſe whom he had fully purpoſed to put to death, and bearing it vnto them, ſayd, that he ſaw this bill fall out of the emperours ſleeue. Whereat they being aſtoniſhed, and giuing credit thereunto, reſolued with themſelues to preuent it, and ſo falling vpon him, ſlew him. Moreouer it is well known to euery one, that choler may greatly hurt health, whereof men are for the moſt part deſirous enough. It was cauſe of the emperour <hi>Valentinians</hi> death, who through crying<note place="margin">Valentinian in his anger brake a veine, and died thereof.</note> out in his choler, brake a veine in his neck. From this vice proceedeth another deteſtable imperfection, which is ſwearing, a thing directly contrary to a wiſe mans life, and condemned by the lawe both of God and man: whereof<note place="margin">Againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous vice of ſwearing.</note> we might eaſilie be cured by cuſtome, if firſt we deſtroied Impatiencie and Choler, which prouoke blaſphcmie. The Romanes obſerued an auncient decree, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commaunded, that when yong men would ſweare by the name of ſome God, they ſhould firſt go out of the houſe wherin they were.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:8689:174"/>
towards the correction of this vice, the vnmeaſurable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence whereof ought to be kept backe and chaſtiſed by ſome better meanes.

Such contemners of the name of<note place="margin">Carilaüs.</note> God ought to learne their leſſon of <hi>Carilaüs</hi> the Ethnicke and Pagan, who being demanded why the images of the Gods in Lacedemonia were armed, <hi>to the end</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that men might feare to blaſpheme the Gods, knowing that they are armed to take reuengement.</hi> Concluding therefore our preſent diſcourſe, let vs learne to decke our liues ſo well with patience, (which is ſo profitable and neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,<note place="margin">1.

And let vs know, that the learning and vertue of a man is knowne by patience, and that he is to be accounted to haue leſſe learning and vertue, that hath leſſe patience. Further, let vs learne that the office &amp; dutie of a prudent and noble minded man is to winke at many things that befall him, to redreſſe other things, to hold his peace at ſome things, and to ſuffer much, ſo that he follow reaſon alwaies, and flie opinion. Laſtly, we are to know, that he which endureth euill patiently, ſhall know alſo how after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he may eaſily beare proſperitie: and that euery chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian offereth an acceptable ſacrifice to God, when he yeeldeth vnto him dailie thanks in the midſt of infinite troubles and vexations: which benefit will worke in vs the vtter ouerthrow of all impatience, choler, and wrath, ſworne enemies to all reaſon and vertue.</p>

For further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation whereof, this incomparable beautie of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhape of the bodie was left vnto him, to the end that in this principall worke, as in a rich picture, he might find large matter to mooue him to contemplate and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the excellencie and greatnes of his Creator, who is able to ſet him againe in his former glorie and brightnes.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:8689:175"/>
By means of this knowledge a man feeleth himſelfe effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually mooued and touched with the loue of his like, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in euery nature, which deſireth vſually to ſhew foorth the effects thereof to the profite of many, if it be <note place="margin">Reaſons to mooue vs to loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note>not wholy depraued and accurſed. This loue ought to be ſo much the greater &amp; more perfect in man, by how much the neerer he approcheth to the vnderſtanding of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible ſecrets of the diuinitie. For what thing ought more to ſtirre vs vp, and to mooue vs with zeale to do good to our neighbours, than the conſideration both of their creation after the image of God, whereunto we owe all honor, loue, &amp; obedience, and alſo of their roeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment into the ſame image by his pure grace &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: beſides the contemplation of the excellent compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and building of this frame of man? Theſe things being well conſidered in our minds, whom ſhall we take for our enemie, for a ſtranger, as contemptible, vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and of no account, ſeeing this brightnes and grace of God ſhineth in euery one, and eſpecially in thoſe whom the world deſpiſeth? Moreouer, when we know by his word that Man is ſubſtituted of God in his place, that we ſhould acknowledge towards him the ineſtimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which we haue and daily receiue from the helpe and goodneſſe of our common Father, who promiſeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as done to himſelfe, what good thing ſoeuer we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to his creatures, ſo that it be done with a gladſome and cheerfull countenance, and with a ſweete and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind of beneficence, void of arrogancie, contumelie, or reproch, ſhal any thing ſtay vs from exerciſing towards euery one all duties of humanitie? We read in <hi>Macrobius</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A Temple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to Mercie.</note>that long ſithence there was a Temple in Athens dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Mercie, into which none was ſuffered to enter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he were beneficiall and helpfull, and then alſo with licence from the Senate. In ſo much that through a deſire which the people had to haue acceſſe into it, they ſtudied earneſtly to exerciſe workes of pitie and pietie. Yea, the greateſt reproch which an Athenian could vtter to his neighbor, was to hit him in the teeth, that he was neuer in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:8689:175"/>
the Academie of the Philoſophers, nor in the Temple of Mercie, girding him by this only reproch with two ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, the one of ignorance and want of prudence, the other of crueltie &amp; inhumanitie. Now if among thoſe of olde time the onely naturall ſeede of the loue of their like, which alſo is ſeen in beaſts, was ſo ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that it brought forth in them (notwithſtanding they were deſtitute of the heauenly light) fruites woorthy of perpetuall memorie, as they that had nothing in greater eſtimation than to ſhew themſelues meeke, gentle, curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, helpfull and gratious towards others, euen towards their enemies. What ought they to do, that ſay they are all members of that one head, who recommendeth ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly vnto them, meeknes, mildnes, gentlenes, grace, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, mercy, good-will, compaſſion, and euery good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards their neighbor? All which things are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder this only ſacred word of Charitie, which <note place="margin">What Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is.</note>is the indiſſoluble band of God with vs, whereby we are inflamed with the loue of him for that which we owe vnto him, and thereby alſo are induced to loue our neighbours for the loue of God. But let vs conſider how the ancients hauing but the ſhadow of this perfect Charitie, prayſed &amp; eſteemed this vertue of Meeknes, from which they knew how to draw ſo many good commodities for the profite and ſuccour of euery one, that after we may note here cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain woorthy examples to ſtirre vs vp ſo much the more vnto our dutie. Meeknes (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> is a vertue that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth <note place="margin">The definition and effects of Meekenes.</note>to the courageous part of the ſoule, whereby we are hardly mooued to anger. Hir office and dutie is to be able to ſupport and endure patiently thoſe crimes that are layd vpon hir, not to ſuffer hir ſelfe to be haſtily caried to reuenge, nor to be too eaſily ſtirred to wrath, but to make him that poſſeſſeth hir, mild, gratious, and of a ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſetled mind. Meeknes and gentlenes (as he ſayth elſe-where) is that vertue whereby a man eaſily appeaſeth the motions and inſtigations of the ſoule cauſed by cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and it ſtandeth him in ſtead of a moderate tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſpirit, decking him with mildnes &amp; curteſie, which
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:8689:176"/>
draweth vnto him the loue of ſtrangers, and good ſeruice of his owne. Whereby it appeereth, that whoſoeuer is mild and courteous to others, receiueth much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and honor than thoſe whome he honoreth. They are not to be credited (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> who ſay that a man muſt vſe crueltie towards his enemies, eſteeming that to be an act proper to a noble and courageous man. For nothing is more commendable or woorthie a great and excellent man, than meekenes and clemencie. It ſeemeth alſo that liberalitie, beneficence, iuſtice, fidelitie, and many other good deedes, wherof many men taſte, and which procure to a man greater good will of euery one, are proper to mildnes and meekenes, called by an ancient man the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of an holie ſoule, which neuer ſuffer innocencie to be oppreſſed, &amp; as <hi>Chilo</hi> ſaid, which lead noble harts ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the feaſts of their friends, but ſpeedily to the ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them in their calamities. This vertue of meekenes is truly moſt neceſſarie for a valiant man. For without it he ſhould be in danger to commit ſome actions which might be iudged cruell. And ſeeing that a noble minded man commeth neere to the diuine nature, he muſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it as much as may be in gentlenes and clemencie, which adorneth and honoreth thoſe eſpecially that are lift vp in dignitie, and haue power to correct others. True it is alſo, that they are deceiued that commend, and as it <note place="margin">A medioeritie muſt be kept betweene mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and crueltie.</note>were adore the bounty of great men and Magiſtrats, who of a certain ſimplicity without prudence, ſhew themſelues gratious, gentle, and courteous towards all men. Which is no leſſe pernitious to an Eſtate, than is the ſeueritie and crueltie of others. For of this ouer-great lenitie, among many other inconueniences, an impunitie of the wicked is bred, and the ſufferance of one fault quickly draweth on another. Therefore the mildnes of thoſe that haue power and authoritie, ought to be accompanied with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie, their clemencie mingled with rigour, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie with auſteritie. This is that which <hi>Plato</hi> learnedly teacheth vs, ſaying: <hi>that the noble and ſtrong man muſt be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous and gratious, that he may both chaſtice the wicked, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:8689:176"/>
                     <hi>pardon when time requireth.</hi> And as for thoſe offences which may be healed, he muſt thinke that no man is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly vniuſt. Therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that it is the property of a noble minded man ſimply to puniſh thoſe that are moſt in fault, &amp; the authors of euill, but to ſaue the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. And thus the rigour of diſcipline directing meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and meekenes decking rigour, the one will ſet foorth and commend the other: ſo that neither rigour ſhall be rigorous, nor gentlenes diſſolute. By the learned ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe Philoſophers, it is very euident, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of meekenes is not onely a part of Fortitude, which can not be perfect without it, but hath alſo ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar coniunction with all the other vertues, yea is as it were the ſeede of them, and induceth men to practiſe all dutie towards their neighbours. But bicauſe the order of our diſcourſes wil offer vs matter and occaſion to intreat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly heereafter aſwell of iuſtice, and of reuenge of wrongs and ininries which a man receiueth of his enemy, as alſo of other vertues heere briefly mentioned, we will now come to certaine notable examples of meekenes, gentlenes, mildnes, and goodnes of nature. The firſt that <note place="margin">Philip a Prince of a good and mild nature.</note>commeth to my remembrance is <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, who giueth place to none in the perfection of theſe gifts and graces. When it was told this good Prince, that one <hi>Nicanor</hi> did openly ſpeake ill of his maieſtie, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors being of opinion that he was to be puniſhed with death: <hi>I ſuppoſe</hi> (quoth he to them) <hi>that he is a good man. It were better to ſearch whether the fault commeth not from vs.</hi> And after he vnderſtood that the ſaid <hi>Nicanor</hi> was a needy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and complained that the king neuer ſuccoured him in his neceſſity, he ſent him a rich preſent. Whereupon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it was told <hi>Philip,</hi> that this <hi>Nicanor</hi> went vp and downe ſpeaking much good of him. <hi>I ſee well</hi> (ſaid he then to his Councellors) <hi>that I am a better Phiſition for backbiting than you are, and that it is in my power to cauſe either good or euill</hi>

hard by his tent, who thought not that the king could ouerheare them, he ſhewed himſelfe, vttering theſe onelie words without farther hurting of them: <hi>Good Lord, could you not go further off to ſpeake ill of me?</hi> And to ſay truth, ſuch gifts and graces become a noble Prince very well: yea, he cannot more woorthily and more beſeeming himſelfe giue place to any wrongs, than to thoſe that are done to <note place="margin">Oh that Princes would conſider this.</note>his owne perſon. As contrariwiſe thoſe men are vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie their ſcepters, who cruelly reuenge their owne iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; pardon ſuch as are done to others, yea ſuch faults as are directly againſt the honor of God. A Prince wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in vertue (ſaith <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his Cyropaedia) ought ſo to behaue himſelfe towards his enemie, as to thinke &amp; conſider that at ſome time or other he may be his friend.

                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, inuincible in all things he tooke in hand, inſomuch that he would not onely force al humane powers, but alſo times &amp; places themſelues, and yet who hath left greater proofes of meekenes and curteſie than he? As he was on his voyage vndertaken for the conqueſt of the Indians, <hi>Taxiles</hi> a king of thoſe countries came &amp; deſired him that they might not warre one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>If thou</hi> (ſaid this king vnto him) <hi>art leſſe than I, receiue benefits, if greater, I will take them of thee.

Neither would he giue him any other anſwer, albeit <hi>Alexender</hi> vrged him thereunto. For he ſaid that all was contained vnder that word. As in deede the Monarch ſhewed that he was nothing ignorant thereof. For he did not onely reſtore his kingdome vnto him, but inlarged it alſo, wherein he ſurmounted his victorie, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:8689:177"/>
procured to himſelfe as much renowne by his clemency, as by his valure. Had he euer any greater enemie than <hi>Darius</hi> vanquiſhed and ſubdued by him? And yet when he ſaw himſelfe letted from vſing towards him any boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Beſſus cruelly put to death for killing Darius.</note>worthy his greatnes, bicauſe <hi>Beſſus</hi> one of his captains had ſlaine him, he was ſo diſpleaſed therwith, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the murderer to be puniſhed (albeit he was one of his familiar frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds) with a moſt cruel death, cauſing him to be torne aſunder with two great trees bowed down by main ſtrength one againſt another, vnto each of which a part of <hi>Beſſus</hi> his body was faſtened. Then the trees beyng ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to returne backe again to their firſt nature, with their vehement force rent aſunder the body of this poore and <note place="margin">Iulius Caeſar.</note>miſerable wretch. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was of ſuch a curteous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that hauing conquered <hi>Pompey</hi> and all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he wrote to his friends in Rome, that the greateſt and moſt pleaſant fruit which he gathered of his victory, conſiſted in ſauing daily the liues of ſome of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had borne armes againſt him: as in truth he did ſo. And for a great proofe of his meekenes and gentlenes, that ſpeech may ſerue, which he vttred when he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that <hi>Cato</hi> retiring into the towne of Vtica after the loſſe of the battell had killed himſelfe. O <hi>Cato</hi> (ſayd this monarch beyng then very penſiue) I enuy thee this thy death, ſeeing thou haſt enuied me the glory of ſauing thy life.

Neither can any victory be called a true and perfect victorie, but that which carieth with it ſome clemencie. To ouercome is a humane thing, but to pardon, is diuine. Hereof it is (ſaid the ſame vertuous prince) that we eſteeme the greatneſſe of the immortall gods not ſo much for the puniſhment, as for the mercie which they vſe.

enemies named <hi>Heraclides,</hi> being a very pernitious felow, fell into his hands: whereupon all his friends gaue him counſail to put him to death. Vnto which <hi>Dion</hi> wiſely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that other captains and heads of armies vſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to imploy moſt of their ſtudie in the exerciſe of armes and of warre, but as for himſelfe he had long ſince ſtudied and learned in the ſchooles of the Vniuerſitie to ouercome anger, enuy and euery euill affection and will: the proofe whereof conſiſted not onely in behauing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe well towards his friends, and towards good men, but alſo in pardoning, and in the exerciſe of gentlenes and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie towards his enemies, ſo that he had rather excell <hi>Heraclides</hi> in bountie and curteſie, than in power &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory. And although (quoth he) mens lawes auouch it to be more iuſt to reuenge an iniurie receiued, than to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">All priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge commeth of frailtie.</note>it to another, yet nature teacheth vs, that both the one and the other proceed of the ſame imbecillitie: and how ſoeuer that man is hardly altered, who hath gotten an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of wickedneſſe, yet are there few men of ſo brutiſh &amp; vntamed a nature, or ſo ſauage in reclaiming, that their peruerſnes cannot in the end be wel ouercome by benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, when they ſee that men returne good turnes againe and againe into their boſome. By theſe learned diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it appeareth that <hi>Dion</hi> forgaue <hi>Heraclides,</hi> and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Lycurgus.</note>vpon him great benefits. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the reformer of the Lacedemonian eſtate, by whoſe meanes that common-wealth ſo long tyme floriſhed, doth yet paſſe all thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleadged through the goodnes and mildnes of his gentle nature.

But he not hurting or diſpleaſing him at all, kept him in his houſe, and inſtructed him in all vertue &amp; good diſcipline, and within the yeeres ende, he brought him foorth into the publike aſſembly, being no leſſe vertuous

and well nurtured than before he was vicious: vſing theſe words vnto the people: <hi>Behold I restore him vnto you, beyng mild, gratious and fit to do you ſeruice, whom ye gaue to me proud, outragious and diſſolute.</hi> O acte beſeeming the ſoule of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian rather than of an Ethnike! which ought to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greatly aſhamed, who for the leaſt wrong receiued of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would not ſtick to ſlay not one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, but a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, yea ten thouſand rather than their worldly honour ſhould be hurt or touched: which pretence of honour they vſe verie often to colour their brutiſhneſſe withall. Now leauing here the ancients, of whom we haue a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of teſtimonies in the reading of hiſtories, I thinke we ſhall do well to propound here vnto our princes beyng too much inclined to reuenge iniuries, the clemencie of king <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. who ſucceeding <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. in the <note place="margin">Lewes the 12.</note>kingdom, would neuer reuenge himſelfe of any outrage or iniurie done vnto him, euen than whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was but duke of Orleance. In ſo much that beyng incited by ſome to puniſh one that was his great enemie during the life of his predeceſſor, he anſwered: <hi>That it would not beſeeme a king of France to go about to reuenge iniuries offered to a duke of Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> Neither ought we to let paſſe in ſilence the goodnes and clemencie of that great king <hi>Frances,</hi> who goyng in perſon to chaſtice the rebellion of the Rochelers, forgaue them, and put not one to death, ſaying: <hi>That albeit he had no leſſe occaſion to reuenge this iniurie than the Emperor Charles, who puniſhed very cruelly thoſe of Gaunt, yet he had rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his prayſes by preſeruing than by destroying his ſubiects.</hi> After his example king Henry the 2. hauing giuen in <note place="margin">Henry the 2.</note>commiſſion to the duke of Montmorencie Conſtable, to chaſtice the rebellion of the countrey of Guyen, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the inhabitants of Burdeaux, afterward gaue out a generall abſolution, and forgaue the racing of the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, the paiment of two hundred thouſand pounds, &amp; the defraying of the charges of the armie wherein they were condemned. And truly as it belongeth to the ſun to lighten the earth with his beames: ſo it appertaineth to the vertue of a prince to haue compaſſion vpon the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

Yea ſo many as ſtand in need of mercy, and beyng woorthy therof craue for it, ought to find harbour in the hauen of his excellencie. Now to come to the end of our preſent diſcourſe, if by ſo many examples which we haue touched, and innumerable others, of which hiſtories are plentifull, we may note amongſt the famous, noble and courageous men of old tyme, ſuch effects of meekeneſſe, gentlenes, bountie, mildnes, clemencie and humanitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their enemies, no doubt but they endeuored to do much more for their friends, brethren and countreymen, for whoſe ſafetie they feared not many times to die, as heretofore we haue ſeene examples thereof, and may ſee more hereafter. And how much leſſe would they haue fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſuccor them in all other duties and charitable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? So that if we be men and not monſters in nature, let vs learne what are the fruits not onely of true Chriſtians, but alſo of true humanitie, and of nature not being who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depraued and corrupted: to the end that framing our maners, mild, gentle, and gratious, to the ſuccor, benefite, and profite of euery one, and following the ſteps and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the vertue of Fortitude and Magnanimitie, which is neuer churliſh, idle or proud, we may liue a happy life di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to hir proper end, expecting our renewing in that life which is immortall and euerlaſting.</p>

                  <p>THere hath beene alwayes men of great humaine learning, but voyd of the ſincere knowledge of the truth, that haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one of theſe two opinions: ſome, <hi>That all things were gouerned by nature: others, that they were ruled by fortune.</hi> They that acknowledge nature for the firſt cauſe of all things <note place="margin">The Stoicks.</note>did attribute vnto hir a conſtellation, which through the ſtrength and efficacie of the ſtarres gouerned the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile <note place="margin">The Epicures.</note>and reaſon of men.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:8689:179"/>
and by chance. Now albeit there are too many at this day that follow this error, yet is it ſo abſurd a thing, that in the writings of Ethnicks and Pagans, a thouſand inuincible reaſons are found of ſufficient force to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince ſuch opinions of meere lying and ouer-great ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhnes, and to conſtraine thoſe that are moſt impudent and ſhameles to acknowledge an infinite almightie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be the creator of nature, and of all things moouing therein, and to diſpoſe and order them with an eternall and euerlaſting prouidence. True it is that I would not abſolutely deny the maruellous effects which many haue noted in heauenlie bodies throughout nature: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles I hold this for certaine, that as all their vertue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of one onely God, ſo he withdraweth from them his power when and as ſoone as it pleaſeth him. Of this I inferre, that they greatly deceiue themſelues, who thinke that the ſeeking out of the ſtarres, and of their ſecret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues diminiſheth any thing from the greatnes and power of God: ſeeing that contrariwiſe his maieſtie is much more famous and woonderful in doing ſuch great things by his creatures, as if he did them himſelfe without any meane. Nowe that which I haue touched heere my companions, is not to offer any occaſion to diſcourſe of the Mathematicks, or of any part thereof, which would be to depart out of thoſe bounds which we appointed to our Academy.

For this <note place="margin">The cauſe why Amaſis forfooke his alliance with Policrates.</note>very conſideration it ſeemeth that <hi>Amaſis,</hi> almoſt the laſt of thoſe kings that raigned peaceably in Egypt, ſhoke off the alliance and league with <hi>Policrates</hi> king of Samos, who was ſo happie in worldlie reſpects, that do what he could, yet could he not know what ſorow meant, but all things fel out vnto him better than he deſired. For proofe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may ſerue that which happened vnto him, after he had caſt into the ſea a ring of great value, which he loued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. Now, although he did ſo of purpoſe, to the end he might taſte of ſome ſorow and griefe, yet he found it quickly againe in the bellie of a fiſh taken by Fiſhermen, and bought for his kitchen. Whereupon this wiſe Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an iudged it a thing altogether impoſſible; but that ſome great miſerie was to follow hard at the heeles of ſo great happines: and therefore he would not be partaker ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:8689:180"/>
as of neceſſitie he ſhould haue beene, if he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill that league which before was betwixt them. Neither was <hi>Amaſis</hi> any thing deceiued in his opinion. For within a while after <hi>Policrates</hi> was depriued of his kingdome, and ſhamefully hanged, ſeruing for a common and notable example of the inſtabilitie and variablenes of mans eſtate, as alſo to ſhew that it is a very abſurd thing to place happines in ſo vncertain felicity. And yet among infinit imperfections borne with man, this is common in <note place="margin">An ordin arie imperfection in man.</note>him to looſe quickly the remembrance of a benefit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but to retaine a long time the memorie of a calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fallen vpon him.

Notwithſtanding, if all men (as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid) aſwell rich as poore, brought their miſhaps, and laid them in common together, and if they were in ſuch ſort diuided, that euery one might haue an equall portion, then ſhould it be ſeene, that many, who thinke themſelues ouercharged &amp; oppreſſed, would with all their hartes take againe vnto them their fortune, and be contented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. <hi>Wouldest thou</hi> (ſaid <hi>Democritus) auoid the griefe of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie?</hi> Behold the life of the afflicted, and by the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">A meane to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Let them be accounted very happy</hi> (ſaid <hi>Homer) to whom fortune hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually wayed the good with the euill. The greatest miſerie of all</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bias) is not to be able to beare miſerie. That man is happie</hi> (ſaid <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the elder) <hi>that hath learned from his youth to be vnhappy. For he will beare the yoke better whereunto he hath been ſubiect and accustomed of long tyme. Demetrius,</hi> ſurnamed the Beſieger, ſaid, <hi>That he iudged none more vnhappy than he that neuer tasted of aduerſitie: as if he would haue ſayd, that it was a ſure argument, that fortune iudged him to be ſo baſe &amp; abiect, that he deſerued not that ſhe ſhould buſie hir ſelfe about him. That man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cicero) is very happy, who thinketh that no humane mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how grieuous ſoeuer they may be, are intollerable, or ought to diſcourage him: iudging alſo nothing ſo excellent, wherby he ſhould be mooued to reioyce in ſuch ſort, that his hart be puffed and lift vp thereby. Yea, he is very happy, who fitly and conueniently behaueth himſelf in all things neceſſary for him. Nothing is euil</hi> (ſaith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke) that is neceſſarie. By which word Neceſſarie, both he and Cicero vnderstand whatſoeuer commeth to a wiſe man by fatall destinie: bicauſe he beareth it patiently, as that which cannot be auoyded, thereby increaſing his vertue ſo much the more: and ſo</hi>

                     <hi>no euill can come to a good man. Solon drawing neerer to the truth of ſincere happineſſe, ſayd, that it conſisted in a good life and death: and that to iudge them happy that are aliue, conſidering the danger of ſo many alterations wherein they are, were all one, as if a man ſhould before hand appoint the reward of the victorie for one that is yet fighting, not beyng ſure that he ſhould ouercome.

For as we ſay not that a body is perfect bicauſe it is richly arayed, but rather bicauſe it is well framed and healthfull: ſo a ſoule well instructed, is the cauſe that both hir ſelfe and the bodie wherein ſhe is inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are happy: which cannot be verified of a man bicauſe he is rich in gold and ſiluer.</hi> When I conſider all the aboue named wiſe opinions of theſe Ethnikes and Pagans, I cannot ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently maruell at the ignorance and blockiſhnes of many <note place="margin">The common opinion of men concerning happines and vnhappines.</note>in our age touching Good and Ill hap, bicauſe they labor to make theſe words priuate, and to tie them to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of their affections in worldly matters: which if they fall out according to their deſire and liking, behold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they are rauiſhed with extreme ioy, boaſting of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they are moſt happy. But contrarywiſe, if they miſſe of their intents, by and by they diſpaire, and thinke themſelues the vnhappieſt men in the world. Do we not alſo ſee that moſt men iudge them happy that poſſeſſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pleaſure, delight, glory and honour, and thoſe men miſerable that want, eſpecially if after they had aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, they looſe it by ſome miſhap, the cauſe wherof they commonly attribute either to good or ill lucke, which <note place="margin">Whereat Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led moſt.</note>they ſay ruleth all humaine affaires? We read that <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Thianaeus</hi> hauing trauelled ouer al Aſia, Afrike and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, ſayd that of two things whereat he maruelled moſt in all the world: the firſt was, that he alwayes ſawe the proud man commaund the humble, the quarellous the quiet, the tyrant the iuſt, the cruel the pitifull, the coward the hardie, the ignorant the skilfull, and the greateſt thieues hang the innocent. But in the meane while who may doubt whether of theſe were the happieſt? that the good were not rather than the wicked? if happines accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancients, &amp; to the truth, be perfected in good
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:8689:182"/>
                     <note place="margin">Notable reaſons to ſhew that no worldly thing can be called good, and that happines can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by any ſuch thing.</note> things, then it is certain, that whoſoeuer enioieth al good things ſhall be perfectly happy. Now nothing can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led good but that which is profitable, and contrary to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: ſo that whatſoeuer may as ſo one be euill as good, ought not to be called good. Moreouer it muſt be the poſſeſſion of ſome firme, ſtedfaſt and permanent Good that maketh a man happy. For nothing ought to wax old, to periſh or decay of thoſe things wherin a happy life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, ſeeing he that feareth to looſe them cannot be ſayd to liue quietly. Therefore neither beautie, nor ſtrength, and diſpoſition of body, neither riches, glory, honour or pleaſure can be truely called Goods, ſeeing oftentymes they are the cauſe of ſo many euils, waxe old, and vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way many times as ſoone as a man hath receiued them, and laſtly, worke in vs an vnſatiable deſire of them. How many men are there to whom all theſe things haue been the occaſion of euill? And how can we call that good, which being poſſeſſed, and that in abundance, cannot yet keep the owner thereof from being vnhappy and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Wherfore we may ſay, that happines cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the poſſeſſion of humane and mortall things, neither vnhappines through the want of them: but that <note place="margin">Wherein true happines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note>the true felicitie which we ought to deſire in this world, conſiſteth in the goods of the ſoule, nouriſhed in the hope of that vnſpeakable &amp; euerlaſting happines, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and aſſured vnto it in the ſecond life. And ſo we <note place="margin">Who are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</note>ſay, that none are vnhappy but they, who by reaſon of their peruerſneſſe, feele in their conſcience a doubting of the expectation of eternall promiſes: as alſo they that giue ouer themſelues to vice, whoſe nature is to corrupt, deſtroy, and infect with the venom that is alwayes about it, all things whereof it taketh hold. As for the common miſeries of mans life they cannot in any ſort make him vnhappy, whoſe naturall diſpoſition &amp; maners beyng fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and decked with vertue, are able to giue &amp; to impart to euery condition of his life, whether it be poore or rich, proſperous or aduerſe, honourable or contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; happineſſe, ioy, pleaſure and contentation, which

flowe in his ſoule aboundantly from that fountaine and liuelie ſpring which Philoſophie hath diſcouered vnto him in the fertile field of Graces and Sciences, whereby he enioyeth true tranquillitie and reſt of ſpirit, as much as a man may haue in this mortall life, moderating the perturbations of his ſoule, and commaunding ouer the vnpure affections of the fleſh. And than as the ſhoe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with the faſhion of the foote, and not contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <note place="margin">The happineſſe of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from within him.</note>ſo the inward diſpoſition of a wiſe and moderate man cauſeth him to lead a life like vnto the ſame, that is, mild, peaceable and quiet, being neuer caried away with vnreaſonable paſſions, bicauſe ſhe neuer enioyeth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth immoderately in that which ſhe hath, but vſeth well that which is put into her hand, without feare or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining if it be taken away: following therein the ſaying of <hi>Democritus, that whoſoeuer mindeth to liue alwayes happilie, must propound to himſelfe and deſire things poſſible, and be content with things preſent.</hi> Therefore ſeeing the fountaine of all felicitie and contentation in this life is within vs, let vs cure and cleanſe diligently all perturbations which ſeeke to hinder the tranquillitie of our ſpirites, to the ende that externall things which come from without vs agaynſt our will and expectation, may ſeeme vnto vs friendly and familiar after we know how to vſe them wel. <hi>Plato</hi> compared our life to table-play, wherein both the <note place="margin">Our life compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play.</note>dice muſt chance wel, &amp; the plaier muſt vſe that wel which the dice ſhal caſt.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:8689:183"/>
that no tedious, grieuous or troubleſome thing can befall him. For being grounded, not vpon vaniſhing goods, but vpon Philoſophicall ſentences, &amp; firme diſcourſes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he may ſay, I haue preuented thee fortune, I haue clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp all thy chances, and ſtopped the wayes of entrance in vpon me: and ſo led a ioyfull life as long as vertue, and that part which is proper to man are ſtrongeſt. And if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſome great inconuenience happen vnto him againſt all hope, which humaine power is not able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, than with ioy of ſpirite he conſidereth that the hauen of ſafetie is at hand, wherein he may ſaue himſelfe by ſwimming out of the body as out of a Skiffe that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, departing boldly and without feare from the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the world, that he may enioy abſolute and perfect<note place="margin">Alexander and Crates oppoſed one againſt an other.</note>happines. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great hauing vnder his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion more than halfe the world, when he heard the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> diſpute and maintaine that there were innumerable worlds, he began to weepe, ſaying, <hi>Haue I not good cauſe to be ſorowful and to mourne, if there be an infinite number of worlds, ſeeing as yet I haue not been able to make my ſelfe Lord of one?</hi> But <hi>Crates</hi> the Philoſopher being brought vp in the ſchoole of wiſdome, and hauing in ſtead of all wealth but an old cloke and a ſcrip, neuer wept in all his life, but was always ſeen mery, and paſſing ouer his dayes cheerfully. By which two kinds of life contrary one to an other, it appeereth ſufficiently that it is within our ſelues, and not in outward things, wherein we muſt ſeeke for the foundation of a certaine ioy which is watered and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth in ſtrength by the remembrance of good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions proceeding from the ſoule guided by right<note place="margin">Agamemnon.</note> knowledge and reaſon. <hi>Homer</hi> bringeth in <hi>Agamemnon</hi> complaining greatly bicauſe he was to command ſo great a part of the world, as if he had an intollerable burthen vpon his ſhoulders. Whereas <hi>Diogenes</hi> when he was to be ſold for a ſlaue, lying all along, mocked the Sergeant that cried him to ſale, and would not riſe vp when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſcoffingly ſaid vnto him, If thou wart to ſell a fiſh, wouldeſt thou make it ariſe?

                     <hi>if any man want a maister, he ſhould buy me: for I can ſerue his turne well.</hi> Wherby we may fitly note this, that all the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, reſt, and contentation of man dependeth of vertue onely, and not of worldlie greatnes and glorie. For this reaſon the ſelfe ſame <hi>Diogenes</hi> beholding a ſtranger come from Lacedemonia, more curiouſly decked on a feſtiuall day than he was woont, ſaid vnto him: <hi>What? Doth not an honest man thinke that euery day is festiuall vnto him?</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is nothing that ought to mooue vs ſo much to ſhew all outward ſignes of ioy, or that breedeth ſuch ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and calmenes againſt the tempeſtuous waues of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane miſeries and calamities, than to haue the ſoule pure and cleane from all wicked deedes, wils, and counſels, &amp; the manners vndefiled, not troubled or infected with any vice. For then acknowledging the eſtate of mortall and corruptible things, we iudge them vnwoorthie the care of our ſoules, that we may wholy lift them vp to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of heauenlie and eternall things, wherein our happines and perfect felicitie conſiſteth. Heereby we learne, that in the ſecond life onely we are to ſeeke for and<note place="margin">Where we muſt ſeeke for true happines.</note> to expect the fruition of true happines, which can neuer increaſe or be diminiſhed. For as no man can make a line ſtraighter than that which is ſtraight, and as nothing is more iuſt than that which is iuſt: ſo he that is happie can not be more happie. Otherwiſe vntill a man had gotten all that might be had, his deſires would neuer be ſetled, &amp; ſo no man ſhould be called happie. But felicitie is perfect of it ſelfe. <hi>Cicero</hi> knew it well enough, when he ſaid: <hi>that no man ſtanding in feare of great things, could be happie:</hi> and in that reſpect no man liuing can be ſo, but to ſpeake in deed of a happie life, that is it which is perfect and abſolute. To the end therefore that we may reape ſome profit by our preſent diſcourſe, let vs neuer thinke that any man may be called happie or vnhappie, bicauſe he is aduanced or diſgraced, with honors, goods, and worldlie commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or bicauſe he is partaker either of proſperitie or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie throughout his whole life. But he onely ought to<note place="margin">Who is happie in this world.</note> be eſteemed happie in this world, that knoweth in reſt &amp;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:8689:184"/>
quietnes of ſoule how to vſe both eſtates, and neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himſelfe to be caried away or troubled with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane deſires, but with all his hart ſeeketh for the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a firme, ſtedfaſt, and abiding Good, being aſſured, as we ſaid, that not one of thoſe things wherein a happie life conſiſteth ſhall waxe old, periſh, or fall to decay. To conclude, he is happie that ſheweth in all the workes and actions of his life a patterne of honeſtie and vertue, being moderate in proſperitie, &amp; conſtant in aduerſitie. A man thus affected and diſpoſed, will behaue himſelfe without reproofe in the time preſent, will call to mind with ioy &amp; pleaſure the time paſt, and wil boldly and without diſtruſt draw neere to the time to come, euen with a cheerefull &amp; ioifull hope of better things, and with a ſtedfaſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that vnſpeakeable and endles happines, which is prepared for the elect.</p>

All mindes are not reſolute and conſtant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from ſlipping beſide themſelues, and beyond the limits of reaſon, neither in great proſperity, which puffeth and lifteth vp mens harts, eſpecially theirs that are baſe by nature, nor yet in vnloked for aduerſity, which through the heauie burthen thereof oftentimes aſtoniſheth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazeth them that are thought to be beſt ſetled and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But if we conſider apart the pernitious effects which iſſue from theſe two contraries, when reaſon doth not guide and gouerne them, we ſhall find nothing but pride
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8689:185"/>
in the one, and faintnes of hart, baſenes of mind, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes <note place="margin">Proſperity more hurtfull than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.</note>deſpaire in the other. Notwithſtanding we may well note this, that proſperitie hath alwaies beene the cauſe of farre greater euils to men than aduerſitie, &amp; that it is eaſier for a man to beare this patiently, than not to forget himſelfe in the other. Whereof I thinke we may not vnfitly alledge for a reaſon that which <hi>Menander</hi> ſaith: <hi>that man of all other liuing creatures is apteſt to fall ſuddenly downe from high to low, bicauſe he dareth vndertake the greatest matters, although he be weakeſt.</hi> Whereupon being as it were naturally ſubiect to falling, it is not ſo ſtrange vnto him being better furniſhed for that, (ſeeing he is or ought to be prepared thereto long before) then when againſt his naturall diſpoſition he aſcendeth to ſome greatnes not hoped for. Now, whether it be for this reaſon, or bicauſe vice is his proper inheritance, the memorie of the time paſt aſwell as of the preſent time, furniſheth vs with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimonies, ſeeing fewe are found that forgat not themſelues in their proſperitie, whereas many haue beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Plato was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted by the Cyrenians to giue them lawes</note>themſelues wiſely, and taken occaſion to be better in their aduerſitie. Which being vnderſtood of <hi>Plato,</hi> when he was requeſted by the Cyrenians a people of Grecia, to write downe lawes for them, and to appoint them ſome good forme of gouernment for their Common-wealth: he anſwered, that it was a very hard matter to preſcribe lawes to ſo rich, happie, and wealthie a people as they were. For commonly thoſe cities which in ſhort time come ſuddenly to great felicitie, grow to be inſolent, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, and vneaſie to raunge in order: neither is there any thing for the moſt part prouder, than a poore man made rich: as contrariwiſe none are ſo readie to receiue counſell and direction, as he whom fortune hath ouerrun. He that is preſſed greatly with aduerſitie, is ſeldome puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp with pride, or vanquiſhed of luſt, or drowned in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, or ouertaken with gluttonie, or lift vp with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and worldlie glorie: all which imperfections happen commonly to thoſe vpon whome fortune too much faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. That felicitie (ſaith <hi>Seneca)</hi> which hath not beene
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8689:185"/>
hurt, cannot indure one blow: but when it hath had a long and continuall combat with diſcommodities, and hath hardued it ſelfe by ſuffering and bearing iniuries, then doth it not ſuffer it ſelfe to be ouercome with any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. Now one of the greateſt benefits that a man may haue in this life, is, neither to be changed by aduerſitie, nor lift vp with proſperity, but to be as a well rooted tree, which, although it be ſhaken with ſundrie winds, yet can not be ouerthrowne by any of them. And truly it is very ridiculous that that which commeth to all worldly things by an ordinarie and naturall courſe, euen by the ſequele of cauſes linked togither and depending one of another, changing the eſtate of mortall things, ſhould haue power to alter or to make any mutation in reaſon and wiſedom, which ought to abide ſtedfaſt in the mind of man. For this cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that there was nothing but vertue could tame it, and that men furniſhed therewith behaued themſelues conſtantly and courageouſly in both kinds of fortune. Vertue (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> abideth calme and quiet in the greateſt tempeſt, and although ſhe be driuen into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, yet ſhe ſtirreth not out of hir place and countrey, but ſhineth ſo alwaies of hir ſelfe, that ſhe cannot be ſoiled with the ſpots of an other. This excellent Orator and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher giueth vs alſo wholeſome counſell to oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Good counſell for thoſe that are in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note>the dangerous effects that are to be feared in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie. When we are (ſaith he) in beſt eſtate, we muſt vſe the counſell of our friends more than we do commonly, and as long as it continueth we are greatly to beware that we open not our eares to flatterers, who are the plague &amp; deſtruction of the greater ſort, bicauſe all their labor is to propound vnto vs occaſions &amp; meanes to enioy delights and pleaſures, and to ſhew out ſelues to be proud and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, during the time of our proſperitie: to the end we ſhould put good men farre from vs, and reſerue to them onely that authority wherein they are ſetled. Whereas on the contrarie ſide our true friends would lead vs backe to conſider the inconſtancie of humane things, to the ende that we abuſe not our felicitie, but behaue our ſelues as a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:8689:186"/>

Which conſideration maketh a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and reſolute to beare and indure all ſiniſter chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not ſo ready and eaſie to be deceiued, bicauſe he always feareth and diſtruſteth fortune. Let vs now come to examples of that which we haue here alleaged. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the pernitious effects of ouer great proſperitie, they <note place="margin">Alexander.</note>may well be noted in <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who although he was indued with notable and rare vertues, yet could not vſe moderately the great good ſpeed and happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of all his enterpriſes, but being conquered of the Perſian delights, gaue himſelfe ouer to commit many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies, and then filled with prefumption and pride, <note place="margin">Iulius Caeſar.</note>would haue been worſhipped. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> being aſcended into the higheſt degree of fauourable fortune that he could deſire, and lending his eare ouer freely to flatterers, would be called and declared a king, (which name was moſt odious to the Romanes ſince the time that <hi>Tarquini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was baniſhed, as we mentioned before) and retained alwayes to himſelfe the authoritie and power of a Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which before continued but a certaine time. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the publike offices and places of honor vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought good, whereof proceeded the ill will of his ſubiects, and in the end his deſtruction. The greatneſſe of <note place="margin">Pompey.</note>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi> was that which afterward ouerthrew him. For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying his credite to fauour others vniuſtly, it fell out to him as to cities that ſuffer their enemies to enter euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſtrongeſt places, diminiſhing ſo much of their own forces, as they adde to others that wiſh them no good. Which thing <hi>Sylla</hi> the Dictator did very notably giue him to vnderſtand, when he ſawe that <hi>Pompey</hi> by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and fauour had brought <hi>Lepidus</hi> a wicked man to the dignitie of Confulſhip. I ſee well (quoth <hi>Sylla</hi> to him) thou art very glad bicauſe thou haſt preuailed in this ſuit; and ſure thou haſt great cauſe ſo to be. For it is a goodly matter, and the point of a noble man to be ſo gratious with the people, that through thy fauour <hi>Lepidus</hi> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keddeſt man in the world hath caried away the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:8689:186"/>
before <hi>Catullus</hi> the honeſteſt man in all the citie. But <note place="margin">A wiſe foreſight of Sylla.</note>I aduiſe thee to beware of ſleeping now, and to haue a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant eie to thy buſines, bicauſe thou haſt armed &amp; made ſtrong an aduerſarie againſt thy ſelfe. Wherof <hi>Pompey</hi> had experience afterward in thoſe warres which <hi>Lepidus</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, againſt whome he was ſent by the Senate, and in the end obtained the victorie. But the fauour he bare to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> entring vpon the gouernment of publike affairs, came not to that paſſe. For he was afterward ouerthrowne by the ſame meanes wherewith he had ſtrengthned <hi>Caeſar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others. Out of which we may draw an excellent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for all that are placed in authoritie, or that haue the eares of great men at commandement, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cauſe the wicked to be aduanced. For as the worme that is bred at the foote of a tree, groweth with it, and in the end deſtroieth it: ſo a wicked man aduanced by the fauour of one greater than himſelfe, becommeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnthankfull and treacherous vnto him. This moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Archidamides</hi> the Lacedemonian to anſwer in this ſort one that commended <hi>Charilaüs</hi> king of Sparta, bicauſe he ſhewed himſelfe alike courteous to all. But how deſerueth that man praiſe, who ſheweth himſelfe courteous towards the wicked? Now to returne to our ſpeech touching the effects of proſperitie, not ruled by the reaſon of true pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, what is more hatefull, or hath at any time beene more hurtfull to men than pride? Which (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) dwelleth with ſolitarines, that is to ſay, is ſo hated, that in the end it is forſaken of all the world? And whereof is it bred ſooner than of proſperitie? Which that wiſe man &amp; excellent Romane captaine <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> knowing ful well, after the victorie gotten by him againſt <hi>Perſes</hi> king of Macedonia, being deſirous to admoniſh the men of warre that were in his armie, and to keepe them within the compaſſe of their dutie, he vſed theſe or the like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">An excellent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of P.

him from that warre, which he purpoſed to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake againſt <hi>Tomyris</hi> Queene of the Scythians, (which fell out hardly for him) vſing theſe words: <hi>Knowe that all worldly things haue a certaine courſe, which doth not ſuffer them to end happily that haue alwaies had fortune proſperous, which he might well ſpeake by experience in him ſelfe.</hi> But <hi>Cyrus</hi> hauing alreadie ſubdued all Aſia, part of Grecia, the kingdome of Babylon, with infinite other places, and beholding his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to conſiſt of ſixe ſcore thouſand men, thought he could not be vanquiſhed. Whereupon giuing battell to <hi>Tomyris,</hi> he loſt his life, togither with the renowne of ſo many goodlie victories, (being now ouercome by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) his whole armie alſo being hewen in peeces. And truly as one puffe of wind cauſeth the goodlieſt fruites, <note place="margin">The inſtabilitie of humane things.</note>which beautifie the whole Orchard, to fall from the tree: ſo a little diſgrace, a ſudden miſhap in one inſtant brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to nothing, and pulleth downe the greatnes, wealth, and proſperitie of men. And when we thinke to lay a ſure foundation of proſperitie, euen then is all changed, and the order of our conceits peruerted &amp; turned into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for diſorder and confuſion. Now let vs come to conſider particularly of the effects of aduerſitie. There are <note place="margin">The common effects of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.</note>few folks (if they be not deſtitute of all good iudgement) that are ignorant and vnderſtand not what belongeth to their dutie, ſo long as proſperitie laſteth: but fewe there are, who in great ouerthwarts and ſhakings of fortune, haue harts ſufficiently ſtaied to practiſe and imitate that which they commend and make account of, or to flie from that which they miſlike and reprehend. Nay rather they are caried away, and through cuſtome of liuing at eaſe, togither with frailtie and faintnes of hart, they ſtart aſide, and alter their firſt diſcourſes. This is that which <hi>Terence</hi> meaneth, where he ſaith, that when we are in good health, we giue a great deale better counſaile to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, than we can take to our ſelues when we ſtande in neede thereof. Notwithſtanding he that is beaten downe and humbled by affliction, eaſilie ſuffereth himſelfe to bee directed, gladlie receiueth and harkeneth to the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:8689:188"/>
aduice of good men, and if there be any little ſeed of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in him, it encreaſeth daily, whereas proſperitie would ſoone choke it. And if he hath profited well in the ſtudie <note place="margin">The fruits of the ſtudy of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie.</note>of wiſdome, he doth as Bees do, which draw the beſt and drieſt hony out of time, although it be a very bitter herb. So out of moſt troubleſome Accidents he knoweth how to reape benefit and commoditie, reſoluing with himſelfe and taking counſell according to the miſhaps that light vpon him. He doubteth not of this, that it is the duetie of wiſe and vertuous men not onely to deſire proſperitie in all things, but alſo to indure aduerſitie with conſtancie &amp; modeſtie. He knoweth that as the fruition of proſperitie is for the moſt part full of ſweetneſſe, when it is not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo the conſtant ſuffring of aduerſitie is always reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and accompanied with great honour. And ſuch a one may truely be called noble and courageous, yea, he ſheweth himſelfe a great deale better to be ſo in deed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he yeeldeth not, nor fainteth in afflictions, than if he were in proſperitie, which puffing vp the harts of cowards and baſe minds, cauſeth them ſomtimes to ſeem courageous, when as they are lift vp by fortune into a high degree of honour and felicitie, whereas in truth there is no ſuch <note place="margin">Craeſus.</note>matter in them. <hi>Craeſus</hi> King of the Lydians beyng throwen from his eſtate &amp; made priſoner to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greater vertue and generoſitie of hart at that time, than he did all the while he enioied his great wealth, through which being puffed vp with pride, he would haue had <hi>Solon</hi> iudged him moſt happy. For being vpon a block ready to be burned, and both remembring and fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to himſelfe thoſe wiſe diſcourſes which he heard <hi>Solon</hi> make vnto him concerning the ſmall aſſurance that we haue in worldly felicitie, and how no man ought to be called happy before the houre of his death, he reſolued with himſelfe to die conſtantly and cheerfully. And cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind this benefit which he receiued by the means of that wiſe man, whereupon he felt his ſoule filled with ioy, he repeated aloud three times the name of <hi>Solon,</hi> vſing no other words. Whereof <hi>Cyrus</hi> asking the cauſe, he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:8689:188"/>
vnto him the ſelfe ſame diſcourſes, which touched the hart of this monarch in ſuch ſort, that preſently changing the ill will he bare to <hi>Craeſus,</hi> he fully reſtored him to the fruition of his kingdom, and kept him neere vnto himſelf <note place="margin">The Romanes were wiſe and conſtant in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.</note>for one of his chiefe and principall counſailors. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes (as <hi>Polibius</hi> ſaith) neuer obſerued their lawes more ſtraightly, neuer cauſed the diſcipline of warre to be kept more ſeuerely, and were neuer ſo well aduiſed &amp; conſtant, as after the Carthaginians had obtained of them the third victorie at the battell of Cannas. And contrarywiſe, there were nothing but part-takings and factions in Carthage, lawes were neuer leſſe eſteemed, magiſtrates neuer leſſe regarded, nor maners more corrupted than at that time. But within a little while after, they fell from the higheſt degree of their felicitie, into vtter ruine, and the Romanes reſtored their owne eſtate into greater glory than it was in before. Vertue is always like to the Date tree. For the <note place="margin">The propertie of Vertue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</note>more ſhe is oppreſſed and burthened, the higher ſhe lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp hir ſelfe, and ſheweth hir inuincible power and ſtrength, ouer which fortune can nothing preuaile. And although aduerſitie ſomewhat troubleth a vertuous man, yet is it not able to alter his noble courage, but remaining firme and conſtant, he knoweth how to take all things as exerciſes of his vertue, which, as an ancient man ſaid, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth and looſeth hir vigor without aduerſitie. It is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therfore that the effects of aduerſitie are not ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thoſe which proſperitie commonly brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto him. For this latter is of a proud and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous nature, always enuied, and as commonly it is not freely admoniſhed, ſo it giueth eare vnto and receiueth as litle: but the other is plaine and ſimple, folowed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and ready to receiue counſell. Beſides, it awaketh a Chriſtian and ſtirreth him vp to humble himſelf before the maieſtie of God, to cal vpon him, and to truſt wholy to his onely grace and vertue. Now if ſome (as I haue ſayd) are ſo faint harted, that they ſuffer themſelues to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed vnder the burthen of turmoiles and calamities, let vs attribute the cauſe thereof to ignorance, and want
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:8689:189"/>
of good iudgement, which depriueth them of learned &amp; ſound cogitations and diſcourſes that tend to a conſtant diſpoſition, wherein the happines of this life conſiſteth. As for vs if we deſire to approch neere to that perfection, which is required by the Sages, let vs propound to our ſelues their examples to folow, that we may be temperate and conſtant in euery eſtate and condition of life. We <note place="margin">The wonderful conſtancie of Socrates.</note>read of <hi>Socrates</hi> that one and the ſame countenance was noted in him all his life time, that it was neither ſadder nor pleaſanter for any thing that happened vnto him. He changed it not when he heard the ſentence of his death pronounced, no not when he dranke the poiſon, folowing <note place="margin">P. Rutilus.</note>therein the contents of his condemnation, albeit he was then aboue three-skore yeeres of age. <hi>Publius Rutilus</hi> a Romane, being vniuſtly baniſhed, neuer changed his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or behauiour, neither would put on any other gowne than that he vſed to weare, although it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſuch as were baniſhed, to alter the ſame. Neither would he leaue off the marks of a Senator, nor requeſt the iudges to abſolue him, but led the reſt of his dayes with the ſame greatnes, grauitie and authoritie that he vſed before, not ſhewing himſelfe any thing beaten down with <note place="margin">Q. Metellus.</note>ſorow for the ſtrange alteration of his firſt eſtate. <hi>Quintus Metellus</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Numidicus,</hi> bicauſe he had ſubdued that countrey of Numidia, being driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into exile through a popular faction and ſedition, went into Aſia, where, as he beheld certaine players, he receiued letters from the Senate, whereby he was certified that the Senators &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with one common conſent had called him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Which good newes he bare with the like modeſtie that he did his baniſhment, not departing from the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the ſportes were ended, nor ſhewing his letters to any of his friends that were round about him before he had aſſembled them togither in his lodging to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <note place="margin">Diogenes.</note>of his returne to Rome. The ſame grauitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie cauſed <hi>Diogenes</hi> when he heard one hit him in the teeth with his baniſhment from Pontus by the Synopians to make this anſwer: <hi>And I haue bounded them within the</hi>

                     <hi>countrey of Pontus.</hi> We muſt account the whole ſcope of the firmament for the bonds of our countrey as long as we liue here. Neither ought any man within thoſe limites to eſteeme himſelfe either baniſhed, or a ſtranger: ſeeing God gouerneth all things by the ſame elements. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Socrates tooke the whole world for his countrey.</note>
                     <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, that he tooke not himſelfe to be either an Athenian or a Graecian, but a worldling. And how ſhal we thinke that they who ſuſtained ſo courageouſly their baniſhment from their countrey (which was ſo deere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that they preferred the benefite thereof before the ſafetie of their life) their depriuation &amp; abſence from their families, friends and goods, would not much more vertuouſly haue ſuffred all leſſe aduerſitie? Therefore to end our preſent diſcourſe, let vs learn that nothing belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to this preſent life hath neither more euill nor good in it, than according to the end which befalleth it, &amp; that it is our dutie to keep our ſelues moderate, conſtant, and vpright, both in proſperitie and in aduerſitie, which is the propertie of true magnanimitie and greatnes of courage. Let vs not lift vp our ſelues aboue meaſure for any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall felicitie, nor be too much diſcouraged bicauſe we are viſited with aduerſitie, but wiſely expect what will be the end of both, which a good and vertuous man ſhal always find to be happy when he changeth his mortall eſtate for a life that is certain and euerlaſting.</p>

                  <p>As children of three or fower yeeres of age haue no other care or thought, but how they may play and paſſe their time with the hauing of dailie foode according to their appetite, not conſidering or taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny care for the meanes which they might haue, and which would be neceſſarie for the nouriſhing of their old age: ſo it ſeemeth to me that the men of our time behaue themſelues, when through a more than childiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they labor without ceaſing, to gather &amp; to increaſe wealth, which will do them ſeruice but a little while, not caring in the meane time for certaine and immortall goods which wil nouriſh them for euer. And yet the ſoule created according to the image of God, cannot better preſerue and ſhew foorth hir diuine nature in this mortal bodie, than by contemning all earthlie, humane, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things. But to the end we be not of the number of thoſe that fill themſelues with ſuch paſſions, to purchaſe their owne deſtruction, let vs conſider by the teſtimonies <note place="margin">Of the nature, qualitie, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of riches.</note>of the ancient Sages, of the nature and qualitie of riches, and of the viſible effects which they dailie bring foorth in thoſe that ſerue &amp; poſſeſſe them: next, we will behold ſome examples of theſe famous perſonages, that we may be induced thereby to contemne ſuch pernitious goods. <hi>Men ought to make great account of riches</hi> (ſaid <hi>Socrates) if they were ioined with true ioy, but they are wholy ſeparated from it. For if rich men fall to vſing of them, they ſpoile themſelues with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergreat pleaſure, if they would keepe them, care gnaweth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth them within, and if they deſire to get them, they become wicked and vnhappie.

And it is a verie miſerable ſaying to affirme that a rich man is happy: yea it belongeth to children and fooles to ſay ſo, making them vnhappy that beleeue and approoue it. Slouth and ſlug giſhnes grow of riches, and they that are addicted to heape them vp more and more, the greater account they make of them, the leſſe they esteeme vertue. So that if riches and rich men are greatly ſet by in a Common-wealth, vertue and good men will be much leſſe regarded: and yet great matters are brought to paſſe,</hi>

                     <hi>and Common-wealths preſerued by vertue, and not by riches. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſocrates) ſerue not ſo much for the practiſe of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie as of wickednes, ſeeing they draw the libertie of men to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and idleneſſe, and ſtirre vp yong men to voluptuouſnes. Men</hi> (ſaid <hi>Thales) are by nature borne to vertue, but riches draw them backe vnto them, hauing a thouſand ſortes of ſorceries to allure them to vices, and through a falſe opinion of good to turne them from thoſe things that are truly good. They ſuffer not him that hath them to be able to know any thing, but draw him to external goods. They are paſſing arrogant &amp; most feareful. If they vſe themſelues, they are riotous, if they abstaine, miſerable. They neuer content their Owners, nor leaue them void of ſorow and care: but as they that are ſicke of the dropſie, the more they drinke, become the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtier, ſo the more that men abound in wealth, the more they deſire to haue. Riches of themſelues breed flatterers, who helpe to vndoe rich men. They are the cauſe of infinite murders and hired ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: they make couetous perſons to contemne the goods of the ſoule, thinking to become happy without them. They prouoke them alſo to delicacies and to gluttony, whereby their bodies are ſubiect to diſeaſes and infirmities. Briefly, riches greatly hurt both bodie and ſoule.

are looſely giuen: brieflie, no euils are left vnexecuted through the deſire of riches. <hi>They that giue them ſelues</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bion) to gather riches, are verie ridiculous, ſeeing fortune giueth them, couetouſnes keepeth them, and liberalitie caſteth them away.

The cauſe thereof as I take it, is this, bicauſe they haue nothing but riches in their mind, which being blind, ſeele vp likewiſe the eies of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. I pray God neuer to ſend me a wealthy life, which hath alwaies ſorow and care for hir Companions: nor riches to gnaw my hart. Speake not to me of Pluto, that is to ſay, of riches: for I make</hi>

For this cauſe the libertie of a wiſe mans ſoule, who knoweth the nature of externall goods belonging to this life, is neuer troubled with the care of them, being aſſured (as Plutark ſaith) that as it is not apparell which giueth heate to a man, but only ſtaieth and keepeth in naturall heate that proceedeth from the man himſelfe, by hindring it from diſperſing in the aire: ſo no man liueth more happily or contentedly, bicauſe he is compaſſed</hi>

And then alſo they ſet ſo light by thoſe which they haue, that they burne with the deſire of hauing more. How then ſhall we call that good, which hath no end or meaſure? Or that which being gotten, is the beginning of a further deſire to haue more? <hi>A horſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Epictetus) is not ſaid to be better, bicauſe he hath eaten more than another, or bicauſe he hath a gilt harneſſe, but bicauſe he is ſtronger, ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and better made: for euery beast is accounted of according to his vertue. And ſhall a man be esteemed according to his riches, ancestors, and beautie? If any man thinke that his old age ſhall be borne more eaſilie by the meanes of riches, he deceiueth himſelfe. For they may well cauſe him to enioy the hurtfull pleaſures of the bodie, but cannot take from him ſadnes, horror, and feare of death: nay rather they double his griefe, when he thinketh that he must leaue and forſake them.</hi> In this ſhort diſcourſe taken from ancient men, the vanitie of riches appeereth ſufficiently vnto vs, as alſo the hurtfull effects that flow from them, if they be not ruled by the reaſon of true prudence.

And when certaine Embaſſadors vpon a day came to viſite him, they found him in his chimney dreſſing of reddiſh for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

Truly gold and ſiluer are nothing but duſt, and precious ſtones but the grauell of the ſea. And (as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſaid) we ought to perſwade our ſelues, that thoſe riches are not ours which are not incloſed in our ſoule. According to which ſaying, <hi>Socrates</hi> when he ſaw that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> waxed arrogant bicauſe of the great quantitie of ground which he poſſeſſed, ſhewed him an vniuerſall Map of the world, and asked him whether he knew which were his lands in the territorie of Athens.

For as long gownes hinder the body, ſo do much riches the ſoule. Therfore if we deſire to liue happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in tranquillitie and reſt of ſoule, and with ioy of ſpirit, let vs learne after the example of ſo many great men to

But this is much more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and without all ſhew of reaſon, that they whom we<note place="margin">Againſt thoſe that think poore men leſſe happy than the rich.</note> call poore according to the opinion of men, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, yea commonly take themſelues to be leſſe happy than rich men, and as I may ſo ſay, baſtard children &amp; not legitimate, bicauſe they are not equally and alike parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their mothers goods, which are the wealth of the world, for the hauing whereof we heare ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and murmurings. For firſt we ſee none, no not the needieſt and pooreſt that is (except it be by ſome great &amp; ſtrange miſhap) to be ſo vnprouided for, that with any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains taking (which is the reward of ſinne) he is able to get ſo much as is neceſſary for the maintenance of his life, namely, food and raiment, neither yet any that for want of theſe things, howſoeuer oftentimes he ſuffer and abide much, is conſtrained to giue vp the Ghoſt. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as touching the true, eternall, and incomparable goods of our common father, their part and portion is nothing leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of the richeſt. Yea many times they are rewarded and enriched aboue others, in that beyng withdrawen from the care &amp; gouernment of many earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, they feele themſelues ſo much the more raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſpeciall and heauenly grace (if they hinder it

This is that which Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe hath taught, ſpeaking to him that demanded what he ſhould do to haue eternall<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 21. 23.</note> life: <hi>If thouwilt be perfect</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſell that which thou hast, and giue it to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen:</hi> adding beſides, <hi>that a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</hi> If a father diuiding his ſubſtance among his children, ſhould leaue to one as to his eldeſt or beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, the enioying of his principall mannor by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to the reſt their mothers goods, which are of much leſſe value, and that only for terme of life, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were it to iudge that theſe laſt were more preferred, and<note place="margin">No compariſon between world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie treaſures.</note> had better portions than the other? And I pray you what compariſon is there betweene the greateſt worldlie and tranſitorie riches that can be, and the permanent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of heauen, ſeeing thoſe cannot be compared but to a thing of nought, than which they are weaker, beeing moreouer accompanied with innumerable hurtfull euils, as we haue alreadie ſhewed? What happines and felicitie can wealth adde to rich men aboue the poorer ſort, that theſe ſhould be accounted miſerable and wretched? <hi>Take away</hi> (ſaith <hi>Lactantius) inſolencie and boaſting from rich men, and there will be no difference betweene a poore man and a rich.</hi> And if he that made the condition both of the one &amp; the other, and that prouideth nouriſhment for vnreaſonable creatures, doth diſtribute vnto vs as much as he knoweth in his eternall preſcience and foreknowledge to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:8689:195"/>
for vs, whereof ſhall we complaine, except, as inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, of that damnable vice of ingratitud from the firſt man, we forget ſo many benefits receiued, as alſo thoſe that are dailie profered and promiſed vnto vs of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie goodnes and grace? In a feaſt (ſaid <hi>Epictetus)</hi> we content our ſelues with that which is ſet before vs, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it an impudent and vile part to aske any other thing of him that entertaineth vs. And how can we be ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſhameles in this world, as to aske thoſe things of God, which he will not giue vs, and not content our ſelues with the vſe of that which he hath liberally &amp; freely beſtowed vpon vs? But there is a further matter. For if we would conſider the great, yea vnſpeakable fruits which<note place="margin">The fruits of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie.</note> pouertie bringeth with hir, &amp; whereof ſhe is able to make vs partakers in this life, without doubt ſhe will be found to be a thouſand times more happie than riches. <hi>Pouertie</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aristophanes) is the mistres of manners. Pouertie</hi> (ſaid <hi>Archeſilaus) ſeemeth to be ſharpe, hard, &amp; troubleſome, but ſhe is nurſe to a good linage, as ſhe that acquainteth hir ſelfe with fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and abstinence. In a word ſhe is a ſchoole of vertue. Wealth is full of wickednes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Euripides) but pouertie is accompanied with wiſedome, and all honeſt men are contented with neceſſarie things. And if they offer ſacrifice to the Gods with a little incenſe in the paulme of their hand, they are for the most part ſooner heard than they that kill many beastes for ſacrifice. For</hi> (as <hi>Menander</hi> ſaith) <hi>the poore are vnder the protection of God, and it is better to poſſeſſe a little wealth with ioy, than a great deale with fadnes. To deſire but a little</hi> (ſaid <hi>Democritus) maketh pouertie equall with riches: and if thou deſirest not many things, a little will ſeeme to thee to be very great. Pouertie</hi> (ſaid <hi>Anaximenus) maketh the ſpirite more ſharpe, and men more excellent in all things belonging to this life. For ſhe is a very good mistres of knowledge and skill. The life of poore men</hi> (ſaid <hi>Aristonymus) is like to a nauigation made alongſt the ſhore of ſome ſea: but the life of rich men to that which is in the maine ſea. For the firſt ſort may eaſily caſt anchor, come a ſhore, and ſaue themſelues, whereas the others cannot do ſo, bicauſe they are no more in their owne power, but in fortunes.

                     <hi>For no man was euer puniſhed bicauſe he was poore, but many bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were vniuſt. Neither is a mans life commended bicauſe he is rich, but bicauſe he is iuſt. Hunger</hi> (ſaith <hi>Plutark) neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth adult erie, nor want of monie, lust: ſo that pouertie is a ſhort kind of temperance. If thou wert borne among the Perſians</hi> (ſaid <hi>Epictetus) thou wouldeſt not wiſh to dwell in Grecia, but to liue there in a happie estate. Art thou not then a very foole, bicauſe thou ſeekeſt not rather to liue happily in pouertie, ſeeing thou art borne therein, than to ſtriue with ſo great labor for riches that thou maist liue? As it is better to lie downe in a very little bed with health, than in a great and large bed, being ſicke: ſo is it a great deale better to liue in reſt with a little wealth, than in trauell and care with aboundance. For neither pouertie procureth trouble, nor riches driueth away feare: but reaſon is that which cauſeth men neither to deſire riches, nor to feare pouertie. If other things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bion</hi> the wiſe) <hi>could ſpeake aſwell as we, and were licenced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with vs, might not pouertie iustly ſay vnto vs after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</hi>

And he that is a thirst, doth he not take very great pleaſure in drinking? Doest thou thinke that a man ſhall die for hunger, bicauſe he hath no tart, or for thirst, if he haue not very delicate wine cooled with ſnow? All ſuch things are but for delicacie and nicenes. Doest thou want a houſe, when there is ſo many goodly Churches in cities? What anſwer could be made to pouertie, if ſhe ſhould ſpeake thus? Truly he that hath vertue poſſeſſeth all goods, bicauſe that alone maketh men happie: which may be ſpoken aſwell of a poore man as of a rich. For they</hi> (ſayd <hi>Thales) that thinke pouertie hindreth Philoſophie, and that riches are a helpe vnto it, greatly deceiue themſelues.</hi> For proofe that it is not ſo, how many moe haue withdrawne themſelues
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:8689:196"/>
from ſtudie through riches, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through pouertie? Do we not ſee that the pooreſt ſtudy Philoſophy beſt, which the welthy bicauſe of their mony &amp; many matters ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not do? For this cauſe <hi>Theognis</hi> ſaid very well, that many mo haue periſhed through ſurfetting than through hunger. And to let you know that pouertie is more happy, &amp; better eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of than riches, conſider the example of <hi>Ariſtides</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Iuſt, who being very poore, was choſen to leuie and to gather tribute before all the rich men in Athens. And <hi>Callias</hi> the richeſt man of all the Athenians, ſought by<note place="margin">Examples to ſhew that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie was more eſteemed of than riches.</note> all means to haue his friendſhip, whereas the other made no great account of him. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was not called half a God, nor <hi>Lycurgus</hi> a Sauiour bicauſe they abounded in wealth, and were ſlaues to their paſſions, but bicauſe they profited their countrey exceedingly, and were content with their pouertie. Therefore we may gather out of the ſayings of ſo many great and vertuous men, an aſſured te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the benefit and profit that commonly folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the condition of poore men. And for inuincible proofes, haue we not the examples of the liues of infinite Sages and learned Philoſophers, who willingly forſaking, &amp; wholy contemning riches, went to the Academy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Schoole of Pouertie, there to enioy the treaſures of wiſdome and vertue? Yea, which is more, we find that pouertie hath been the only and principal cauſe of enriching many with this vnſpeakable treaſure, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſaying of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that calamitie is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the occaſion of vertue. <hi>Zeno</hi> founder of the Stoicall<note place="margin">Zeno.</note> Academic, after he had poſſeſſed much wealth, and ſuffred many loſſes, had no more left but one ſhip of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, which being caſt away, he vttred this ſpeech: <hi>thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est well Fortune to bring me to the ſtudie of Philoſophie,</hi> wherein he continued euer after.

                     <note place="margin">Diogenes.</note> driuen from his countrey, was the cauſe and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his ſtudie of Philoſophie. And if any man thinke it a difficult and ſtrange matter that a poore man ſhould be skilfull, ſeeing that whileſt he ſtudieth, he muſt haue wherewith to nouriſh his body, let vs ſee what <hi>Cleanthes</hi>

anſwered to <hi>Antigonus</hi> king of Macedonia, who asked him if he turned the milſtone always: Yea ſir (ſayd he) I turne it yet about to get my liuing, but forſake not Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie for all that. How great and noble was the mind of that man, who after his labour wrote of the nature of god and of the heauens, with the ſame hand wherwith he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the milſtone? Others ſay, that he got his liuing by drawing water for a gardiner: about which he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the night onely, that he might ſpend the day in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Philoſophers diſpute. This man calleth to my<note place="margin">Menedemus &amp; Aſclepiades.</note> remembrance two other Philoſophers, named <hi>Menede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> who being accuſed before the Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagites the chief iudges in Athens, as idle perſons hauing no goods in poſſeſſion, and being willed to declare how they liued, their anſwer was, that inquirie ſhould be made of their Hoſte who was a Baker. This man being called, ſaid, that they beſtowed the whole day in the ſtudy of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the night in ſifting and boulting his meale, for which he gaue each of them a peece of money whereof they liued. But what? Theſe ancient Sages wanted but few things to liue withall, ſeeing the moſt of them contented themſelues with bread and water, and many times with<note place="margin">Pythagoras kept a ſpare diet.</note> herbes and fruites in ſtead of bread, and ſo <hi>Pythagoras</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways liued. And yet they found ſo great contentation and<note place="margin">Philoxenus.</note> felicitie in ſuch a life, that one <hi>Philoxenus</hi> hauing as yet but taſted of the firſt fruits of this profeſſion of ſtudy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that number which was ſent by the Athenians to inhabite a new citie in Sicilia, wherein a good houſe with great commodities to liue at eaſe, fell to him for his part, and ſeeing that delicacie, pleaſure and idlenes, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exerciſe of letters raigned in thoſe quarters, he forſook all &amp; returned to Athens, ſaying, by the gods theſe goods ſhall not deſtroy me, but I will rather deſtroy them. All theſe fruits which are noted to be in pouertie, gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to an ancient man to ſay, that it was a vertue of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to ſuſtaine pouertie patiently, but to deſire it was the praiſe of wiſedom.

that can be alleaged to men, to diſpoſſeſſe them of the hatred and feare of pouertie, which naturally they ſhun, let vs learne of the ancients who ought to account him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe poore, that we abuſe no more this word Pouertie. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was vpon a time viſited by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ſayd<note place="margin">Who ought to be eſteemed poore.</note> vnto him, <hi>I ſee well Diogenes that thou art poore, and hast need of many things, therfore aske of me what thou wilt, and I will giue it thee.</hi> Whereunto this excellent Philoſopher deſpiſing ſuch offers of goods whereof he ſtood not in need, anſwered: <hi>Whether of vs twaine Alexander, ſeemeth to thee to haue most need, and therfore poorest, either I that deſire nothing but my pile</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diogenes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than himſelf.</note> 
                     <hi>of wood and a litle bread, or thou, who being king of Macedonta do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hazard thy ſelfe to ſo many dangers to inlarge thy kingdom, in ſo much, that the whole world will hardly ſuffice to bound thy ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to content thy couetouſnes?</hi> The Monarch ſo greatly admired the magnanimitie of this man, that he vttered theſe wordes with a loud voyce, <hi>If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes. Marius</hi> a Conſul of Rome diſtributing land among his countreymen, gaue to euery one fourteen Acres onely. And vnderſtanding that ſome were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therewith but demanded more, I would to God (quoth he then) that no Roman would care for any more land than would ſuffice to nouriſh him. So goodly and commendable a matter was it eſteemed of theſe wiſe men to be content with a litle, &amp; with that which is ſufficient, rather than to thinke thoſe men onely rich that were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſtore of wealth. And to ſay truth, ſeeing God alone ſimply and abſolutely ſtandeth not in need of any thing whatſoeuer, it may eaſily be preſuppoſed, that the moſt excellent vertue of man, and that which commeth neereſt to the diuine nature, conſiſteth in cauſing a man to ſtand in need of feweſt things. This is that which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſayd, That to deſire nothing (meaning worldly things) is in ſome ſort to reſemble God. And how can we call him poore whoſe ſoule is inriched with ſo many great and rare perfections? <hi>Cicero</hi> writing to <hi>Atticus,</hi> ſayd, <hi>That a friend was bound to wiſh but three things vnto his friend, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A friend is to wiſh 3 things to his friend.</note> 
                     <hi>That he be healthie, that he be well accounted of, and that he be</hi>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:8689:198"/>
                     <hi>not needie.</hi> Now that all theſe things are found in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and noble minded man, we may learne by the effects of Sobrietie, whereof we haue heretofore diſcourſed, and by thoſe of honor, which is neuer ſeparated from vertue, no more than the ſhadow is from the body. And as for the neceſſarie vſe of foode and raiment, it is not wanting to them that ſtand moſt in need thereof, as we haue alreadie touched it in our preſent ſpeech: &amp; ſo a vertuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called poore. But let vs yeeld a litle to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opinion of worldlings, that pouertie and want of earthly riches is odious and contemptible, yet that pouertie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">What pouertie is odious.</note> which proceedeth of ſlouth, idlenes, and ignorance, or otherwiſe of fooliſh expences, of riot and ſuperfluitie may be ſaid to be full of reproch and ſhame, and is to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For when pouertie is found in an honeſt, painfull, diligent, iuſt, valiant and wiſe man, it ſerueth for a great proofe of his magnanimitie and greatnes of courage, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſet his mind vpon great and high matters, and not vpon ſuch ſmall and vile things as the riches of the world are. Amongſt many others of this number we<note place="margin">Aristides.</note> may ſay, that <hi>Aristides</hi> was, being captaine and gouernor of the Athenian eſtate, as we haue alredy mentioned, who after many excellent &amp; great offices which he bare to the good of his countrey, was ſo ſmally enriched therby, that being dead, all his goods would not ſuffice to bury him. He vſed to ſay that none ought to be aſhamed of pouerty, but they that were poore againſt their wil: &amp; that it was a rarer matter, &amp; worthy of greater praiſe to ſuſtain pouerty vertuouſly and with a noble mind, than to know how to vſe riches well. And ſo pouertie is neuer accompanied with ſhame, except it be to them that fall into it through negligence, or miſgouernment of thoſe goods which God hath put into their hands, that they ſhould be faithfull keepers and diſpoſers thereof in charitable workes. This is that which <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſaith, that it is no ſhame for a man to confeſſe his pouertie, but very great to fal into it by his owne default. Therefore to reape profite by that which hath beene heere diſcourſed, let vs put off that old error
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:8689:198"/>
which hath continued ſo long in mens braines, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie is ſuch a great and troubleſome euill, whereas it is rather the cauſe of infinite benefits: and let vs ſay with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that it is a great deale better to haue a quiet and ſetled minde, lying vpon the ground, than to haue much trouble in a golden bed. Moreouer, let vs knowe,<note place="margin">Where the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of riches is to be ſought.</note> that to poſſeſſe ſmall ſtore of earthlie goods, ought not to be called pouertie, bicauſe all fulnes of wealth aboundeth in the knowledge and aſſurance of the fatherlie grace and goodnes of the Author and Creator of all things, which he offereth liberally to all without accepting either of pompe or greatnes. And further, when as, continuing the care which it pleaſeth him to take of vs, he giueth vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in trauell and ſweate, wherewith to feede and to cloth vs in all ſimplicitie and modeſtie, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our neceſſitie, we ſhould be vnthankfull and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither vnwoorthie the aſſiſtance of his helpe and fauour, and of his eternall promiſes, if not contented, nor glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng him for our eſtate, we complained, or wondred at, &amp; deſired the calling of other men, offering thereby in will and affection our birthrights through a gluttonous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, whereas we ought to preſerue to our ſelues the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that heauenlie inheritance, wherein conſiſteth the perfection of all glorie, reſt, and contentation.</p>

continuing in vice they are eaſily drawen to follow the appetite and luſt of their ſenſualitie, wherein they falſly iudge that pleaſure conſiſteth, and thinke it painfull not to pleaſe it. Being thus guided by ignorance, and walking like blindmen, they haue experience for the moſt part of ſuch an end as is cleane contrary to their purpoſes.

And to ſay truth, the maners, conditions, and natural diſpoſition of ſuch men, are wholy corrupted, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation

is odious, vnprofitable, and to be auoided, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Idlenes is the mother &amp; nurſe of all vice.</note>that Idlenes is the mother and nurſe of vice, which deſtroieth and marreth all. Therefore it was very well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the primitiue Church, that euery one ſhould liue of his owne labor, that the idle and ſlothfull might not conſume vnprofitably the goods of the earth. Which reaſon brought in that ancient Romane edict, mentioned by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke of Lawes, <hi>that no Romane ſhould goe through the ſtreets of the city, vnles he caried about him the badge of that trade whereby he liued.</hi> Inſomuch that <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ſpeaking of the diligence of the ancient Romanes, writeth: that all of them followed their labor and trauell ſo earneſtly, that hauing neceſſarie occaſion one daye to ſend a letter two or three daies iournie from the towne, he could not find one idle bodie in all the citie to carie it. That great Orator and Philoſopher <hi>Cicero,</hi> minding to teach vs how we ought to hate Idlenes, as being againſt <note place="margin">Idlenes is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature.</note>nature, ſheweth that men are in deede borne to good works, whereof our ſoule may ſerue for a ſufficient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible proofe, ſeeing it is neuer ſtill, but in continuall motion &amp; action. And for the ſame cauſe he greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth <note place="margin">Scipio was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer idle.</note>
                     <hi>Scipio,</hi> who vſed to ſay, that he was neuer leſſe quiet than when he was quiet. Whereby he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that when he was not buſied with waightie affaires of the Common-wealth, yet, his owne priuate matters, and the ſearching after knowledge, were no leſſe troubleſome vnto him, ſo that euen then in his ſolitarines he tooke counſell with himſelfe. It ſeemeth (ſaith this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of eloquence) that nature doth more require of a man ſuch actions as tend to the profit of men, than ſhe doth the perfect knowledge of all things: ſeeing this knowledge and contemplation of the workes of nature ſhould ſeeme to be maimed &amp; vnperfect, if no action fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, whereas vertuous deedes are profitable to all men, for which end nature hath brought vs foorth, which ſheweth ſufficiently that they are better and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. So that vnles the knowledge of things be ioined with that vertue, which preſerueth humane ſocietie, it will
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:8689:200"/>
ſeeme to be dead and vnprofitable. Therefore <hi>Chryſippus</hi> the Philoſopher ſaid, that the life of thoſe men that giue <note place="margin">To what end we muſt ſtudie Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</note>themſelues to idle ſtudies, differed nothing from that of voluptuous men. So that we muſt not ſtudie Philoſophie by way of ſport, but to the end we may profit both our ſelues and others. Now, if action muſt of neceſſitie be ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſtudie and contemplation, to make a happie life, ſo that otherwiſe it is as it were dead and idle: what ſhall we ſay of that life that is void both of ſtudie and action, but that it is more beaſt-like than humane? And how many millions of men are there in the world, who liue in this ſort, and more in France than in any other nation? Yea, howe many are more idle and leſſe carefull than brute beaſts, neglecting the prouiſion euen of things neceſſarie for this preſent life? Amongſt the obſcure precepts which <note place="margin">Pythagoras pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt Idlenes.</note>
                     <hi>Pythagoras</hi> gaue to his Diſciples, this was one: <hi>Take good heede that thou ſit not vpon a buſhell:</hi> meaning, that Idlenes and Sloth were eſpecially to be eſchewed. Likewiſe, when we ſhall enter into the conſideration of thoſe euils that iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue from idlenes and ſloth, no doubt but we will flie from them, as from the plague of our ſoules. They are greatly to be feared in a Common-wealth, bicauſe they open a gate to all iniuſtice, and kindle the fire of ſedition, which ſetteth a floate all kind of impietie.

of their enemies, as <hi>Marius</hi> did alongeſt the riuer of Rhone. The Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> enioying an aſſured peace, <note place="margin">Claudius.</note>cauſed the chanell Fucinus to be made, that Rome might haue the commoditie of good waters: about which work thirtie thouſand men were daily imploied for the ſpace of twelue yeeres. <hi>Adrianus</hi> ſeeing a generall peace within his <note place="margin">Adrianus.</note>Empire, continually vndertooke new and long iournies, one while into Fraunce, another while into Germanie, ſometime into Aſia, &amp; into other ſtrange countries, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his men of warre to march with him: ſaying, that he did for feare, leaſt they being idle ſhould be corrupted, &amp; forget the diſcipline of warre, and ſo be the cauſe of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties. <note place="margin">Scipio Naſica.</note>And it ſeemeth that this was the cauſe why a wiſe Romane councelled the Senate not to deſtroy Carthage, leaſt the Romanes being in ſafetie by the vtter ſubuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof (which onely at that time made head againſt them) ſhould become idle. But now we may iuſtly ſay of them, that through a lazie and cowardlie idlenes, they haue loſt the dignitie and vertue of their forefathers.

Whereupon they ſent word to the Captaine of the armie, that he ſhould not after the ſame manner deſtroy another towne, which he had beſieged, writing theſe words vnto him: Take not away the pricke which ſtirreth forward the harts of our yoong men. <hi>Gelon</hi> king of Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſa <note place="margin">Gelon.</note>led his people oftentimes into the fields, aſwell to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor the ground, and to plant, as to fight, both that the earth might be better being well dreſſed, as alſo bicauſe he feared leaſt his people ſhould waxe woorſe for want of trauell. So greatly did theſe ancient wiſe men feare the pernitious effects of idlenes and ſloth, which bring to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and corrupt the goodnes of nature, whereas dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence &amp; exerciſe in good educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> correcteth the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines thereof.

quickly, bicauſe they are couered, ſhadowed, &amp; ſtanding: ſo they that buſie not themſelues, but remaine idle, albeit they haue ſome good thing in them, yet if they bring it not foorth, neither exerciſe thoſe naturall faculties that were borne with them, they corrupt and deſtroy them vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly. And which is woorſe, <hi>as concupiſcence</hi> (ſaith <hi>Plato) and luxuriouſnes are quenched with great, ſharpe, and continuall labor, ſo are they kindled through idlenes.

Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of life hath both ſickneſſe and health, but a ſound man cannot take a better courſe to preſerue his health, than to imploy himſelfe in the practiſe of many good and honeſt duties of humanitie.

It is of that fountaine whereof curſed ignorance drinketh and maintaineth hir ſelfe, and from thence flow all pleaſures folowed with bitternes &amp; griefe, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw vs from all vertuous occupations, to imploy our ſelues about all kinds of trifles, that are neither good, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, nor profitable, but rather hurtfull and very perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.<note place="margin">Of gaming, and of the effects thereof.</note> Of which number we may note gaming, which is as common amongſt vs, and as blame-worthie, as any other imperfection, ſeeing hir foundation is laid vpon lucre and couetouſnes, or els vpon the loſſe of time.

Which they continued for the ſpace of twentie and eight yeeres, preſeruing their country by that means from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall famine through the great ſparing of their prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

But bicauſe the nature of man is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to abide continuall labor, and occaſion of buſineſſe is not alwaies offred, it ſhall be lawfull for vs, according to the precept of <hi>Plato</hi> his Academie, to beſtow our leaſure<note place="margin">How we may recreate our ſelues.</note> vpon ſome honeſt paſtime and game of moderate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that is not far ſeparated from ſtudy or vertue, which will not be blame-worthie in vs, ſo we vſe it as we do reſt or ſleepe, after we haue diſpatched and ended graue &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affaires according to the gift and facultie of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.

one, eſteeming it great honor to end their daies in ſuch a commendable exerciſe: according to that ſaying of <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of perſeuerance</note> 
                     <hi>That in vaine men follow that which is good, and ſtriue to do well, if they ſtand ſtill before the end of their daies.</hi> For that man looſeth his time in running ſwiftly, who fainteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come to the end of his race. <hi>Nothing will be vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee</hi> (ſaith the ſame author) <hi>ſo that thy hart faint not.</hi> Not to go forward in the way of the Lord, is all one with turning backeward: yea, it were better neuer to begin, than not to perſeuer vnto the end. This alſo is that which <hi>Cicero</hi> teacheth vs, that it is not ſufficient to know what ought to be done, but we muſt abide firme and ſtedfaſt in that wherin vpon aduiſed &amp; good counſell we are once reſolued. And though we are out of hope of attaining to perfection, yet we muſt ſtriue to come vnto it. <hi>Many</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that are weakened with diſpaire, will not vndertake that thing which they feare they ſhall neuer be able to finiſh: but they that would obtaine great things, and ſuch as are moſt to be deſired, muſt try euery way.</hi> And if any man hath not this excellencie of ſpirite and greatnes of hart by nature, neither yet the knowledge of euery good diſcipline, let him take that courſe which he is able to attaine vnto. For it is great praiſe to him that followeth after the excellenteſt &amp; beſt things, to ſtaie in the ſecond and third place, if he can doe no better. Thoſe things are great, which are next to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It is our dutie therefore to abide firme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in that good and commendable kind of life, which we haue choſen from the beginning, ſo that the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be to liue well. And let vs ſhun idlenes in ſuch ſort, as to ſay with <hi>Cato,</hi> that this is one thing whereof we ought to repent vs moſt, if we know that we haue ſpent a whole day, wherin we haue neither done nor learned ſome good<note place="margin">An excellent precept of Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cylides.</note> thing. <hi>Phocylides</hi> minding to inſtruct vs in this matter, ſaid that in the euening we ought not to ſleep, before we haue thrice called to our remembrance whatſoeuer we haue done the ſame day, repenting vs of the euill, and reioicing in our well doing. <hi>Apelles</hi> the beſt painter that euer was, would not ſuffer one day to paſſe without drawing of

ſome line, meaning thereby (as he ſaid) to fight againſt<note place="margin">Examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt idlenes.</note> idlenes, as with an arrow. <hi>Aeleas</hi> king of Scythia ſaid, that he ſeemed to himſelf to differ nothing from his horſekee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when he was idle. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the elder being demanded if he were neuer idle, anſwered: God keepe me from that: for as a bowe (according to the common prouerbe) is marred and breaketh by being too much bent: ſo is the ſoule through too much idlenes. This is that which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiniſſa</hi> the Aphrican would learnedly teach vs, of whome <hi>Polybius</hi> writeth, that he died when he was foure ſcore and ten yeeres of age, leauing behind him a ſonne that was but foure yeeres old. A little before he died, after he had diſcomfited the Carthaginians in a maine battell, he was ſeene the next day eating of courſe browne bread, ſaying to ſome that maruelled thereat, <hi>that as iron is bright and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi>

                     <hi>ſo long as it is vſed by the hand of man, whereas a houſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into decay when no man dwelleth therein,</hi> (as <hi>Scphocles</hi> ſaith) <hi>ſo fareth it with this brightnes and glistering light of the ſoule,</hi> whereby we diſcourſe, vnderſtand, and remember. The ſame reaſon mooued <hi>Xerxes</hi> father to ſay to <hi>Darius,</hi> that in perillous times and dangerous affaires, he increaſed in wiſedome.

Now to conclude our preſent treatiſe, ſeeing we know that we are borne to all vertuous actions, let vs flie from idlenes and ſloth, the welſprings of all iniuſtice<note place="margin">The fruits of idlenes.</note> &amp; pouertie, the ſtirrers vp of infinite paſſions in the ſoule, and the procurers of ſundrie diſeaſes in the bodie, euen to the vtter deſtruction of them.

And let vs not doubt but that all time otherwiſe ſpent, is loſt

time: knowing that all times in reſpect of themſeluns are alike, but that which is imploied in vertue is good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of vs, and that which is vnprofitably waſted, and in vices is naught. Further, let vs learne neuer to giue ouer the effecting and finiſhing of that which we once know to<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 22.</note> belong to our dutie, ſeeing that without perſeuerance neither he that fighteth can obtaine the victorie, neither the conqueror the garland, but he that continueth to the end ſhall be ſaued. Therefore let vs be carefull to make profit of that talent which is giuen vs to keepe, that we be<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 36.</note> not found euill and vnprofitable ſeruants before him, to whome we muſt yeeld an account euen of euery idle and vaine word.</p>

The reproofes and iniuries of an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, may peraduenture be tolerated in ſome ſort by the skilfuller ſort of thoſe that boaſt themſelues to be ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſeruers and ready defenders of their honor, ſo that they be not vttred in their preſence: bicauſe they ſay that they cannot be offended at that which is ſpoken of them in their abſence, and that they which ſpeake ſo, will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch that ſlander before their faces, which they rayſed behind their backes. According to theſe weake reaſons they would haue other men iudge of reproch and iniurie, either to credite or to diſcredite them according to their power, and not as the truth of the fact it ſelfe requireth: whereupon alſo they paſſe that ouer without profite and amendment of their life, which they knew was miſliked in them. There are others, who vpon a bare report made vnto them, thinke themſelues greatly miſuſed &amp; harmed by thoſe that ſpake ill of them, ſo that preſently they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be auenged of them. But herein they agree al, that if any man voluntarily offereth iniurie to another, they would haue the ſword preſently to decide the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. What ſay I, for an iniurie? Nay, for a yea or a nay, they forthwith thinke that the lie is giuen them, and that they are out-faced: ſo that nothing but the death of the one, or of both together, and oftentimes of their deareſt and beſt friends is able (as they thinke) to repaire the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and ſuppoſed offence, and all for this vaine honour of the world. O deteſtable furie, not to be found in moſt cruel beaſts, which ſpare the bloud of their ſexe.

And that vertue that commeth neereſt to the diuine nature, which is hardeſt to be obtained, and leaſt familiar with men, is it not more woorthie and beſeeming a noble and valiant man, than all the reſt?

How greatly then ought this vertue to be accounted of, which forceth this natural luſt of reuenge, bred in al liuing creatures, and how noble muſt the mind of that man needs be, which is able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſuch a violent paſſion, ſo common to all men, thereby procuring to it ſelfe the name of a mild and gratious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and readie to forgiue, which is proper and peculiar to the diuine nature?

For that vnreaſonable part of the ſoule being mooued, foreſeeth nothing wiſely, but being driuen forward with a contentious deſire, ſuffereth it ſelfe to be caried hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither, as if it were drunken.

This is that which the ſtudie of our Philoſophie teacheth vs: &amp; euen as expert Phiſitions knowe how to draw medicines apt for the preſeruation of life out of ſerpents, poiſons, &amp; other deadly and venemous things: ſo we ought to draw <note place="margin">An apt ſimill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu le.</note>from our enimies, not their life, which ought to be onely in the power of God and of his iuſtice, but profit &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie by their backbitings, reproches, and iniuries.

                     <hi>Prometheus</hi> the Theſſalien gaue him ſo great a blowe with a ſword vpon an apoſtume which put him in danger of death, that by lancing it he ſaued his life contrary to his meaning: ſo the iniurious ſpeeches of our enimies vttred in wrath &amp; of ill will to hurt vs, haue been the cauſe of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many euils in vs whereof we made no account, and of making vs much better than we were before. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe iniurie ſeemeth ſo hard and vneaſie to be tolerated by the imbecillitie of mans nature, which is ſo ſoone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and by the hart of man being full of reuenge, let vs yet ſee whether we can find any remedie, if not to cure that which is incurable, at leaſt wiſe to purge and to clenſe <note place="margin">How many wayes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may receiue iniurie.</note>the Accidents of this euil. Iniurie is offered either to the goods, to the honour or to the perſon of a man.

If any haue robbed thee, muſt thou become a thiefe or ſatiſfie thy ſelfe by thine owne ſtrength? Much leſſe oughteſt thou to ſet thy ſelfe againſt him that is not faultie, as many do. If thou being the weaker art ouertaken, hurt and wronged, oughteſt thou to vſe new force, violence and murder to reuenge thy ſelfe, and to repaire thy iniurie receiued? The ſword is in the hands of the king and of the magiſtrate that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth his perſon: and it belongeth to him onely to vſe it againſt them that trouble publike tranquillitie and ciuil ſocietie: to the end there ſhould be no ſhew, that any other either would or durſt meddle with the ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whoſe greatneſſe and preſeruation conſiſteth in the adminiſtration of iuſtice.

But ſome man will ſay, that theſe things ought in deed to be dulie conſidered of if Iuſtice were executed,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:8689:207"/>
and had not forſaken the earth to dwell in heauen. And how then canſt thou execute it, ſeeing thou art not called to do, but to demand iuſtice? Tarie, and the iuſt Iudge wil returne double that which hath been vniuſtly taken from thee, which thou haſt ſuffered, or which hath been denied thee, euen then when thou ſhalt haue greater neede than now that thy daies are ſo ſhort: and then thou ſhalt liue for euer of that which thou haſt reaped in this poore and miſerable life. Concerning honor, the iniurie whereof we <note place="margin">Of the offence done to honor.</note>feare more than of the other, let vs know, that it cannot be hurt in a good man, bicauſe vertue, which is inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, protecteth and defendeth it. But now a daies we fetch it not ſo farre off. For we will haue our honor tied to the vaine opinion of the world, which reiecteth and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thoſe men as cowards and baſe-minded, that haue but once put vp the leaſt iniurie offered by another: but honoreth as noble and courageous thoſe that can luſtilie kill their enimies. This is the cauſe why many, who would willingly forget an iniurie receiued, dare not do it for loue of their friends: as alſo bicauſe they ſee, that it would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be imputed vnto them as a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a faint hart, than of a deſire to followe reaſon. But let all theſe blood-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, enclined to reuenge &amp; to murder, couer their beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <note place="margin">The excuſe of quarrellers.</note>crueltie aſwell as they can, yet haue they no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſguiſe it but this, that it is a vſuall kind of behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our now a daies amongeſt men, to the ende they may be welcomed, praiſed, and fauoured of Kinges, Princes, and great Lords, otherwiſe they muſt take a Coole, and ſhut vp themſelues in ſome cloiſter. But they muſt needes affirme this withall, that they had rather vndoe and condemne themſelues with the multitude, ſo they may haue worldlie honour, than be ſaued with the ſmall number of honeſt men: except peraduenture they will ſay, that they knowe no other life but this, &amp; that they liue onely for the world, without beleefe or hope of a ſecond and eternall life. And albeit they confeſſe a ſecond life with their mouth, yet their deeds declare ſufficiently, that they are altogither ignorant of the nature and happines of the other life, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:8689:208"/>
that they care not greatly to come vnto it. But let vs that <note place="margin">Socrates void of reuenge.</note>are better inſtructed imitate <hi>Socrates,</hi> who, being counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to reueng a wrong receiued, made this anſwer: What?

So let vs behaue our ſelues towards them that are froward &amp; vitious, making a great deale leſſe account of their iniuries, than of a blow that hurteth: which they cannot do at all to our honour. As for good men we ſhall neuer be hurt by them.

But he not minding to heare him any further, tooke order that he ſhould be ſtraightly bound, and ſo ſent him to his maiſter.

And if it fell out ſo that they committed any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence wherby they were drawn into iudgement, he holpe them as much as he could, by that meanes winning the friendſhip of euery one.

Whereby we ſee that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The ground of all Iuſtice.</note>of all Iuſtice is grounded vpon that honor &amp; ſeruice which we owe to God, whereupon we are induced to be dutifull to our neighbors according to charitie. Therfore we muſt aboue all things loue Iuſtice, and apply all our ſtudie thereunto, ſeeing it is the firſt and principal point that concerneth the direction of a Chriſtian mans life, yea mo are partakers of the fruit thereof, than of any other vertue. <hi>Iustice</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca) is the law of God, and the bond of humane ſocietie.</hi> For auoiding therfore of confuſion in this matter, we ſay with <hi>Plato,</hi> that Iuſtice obſerued and kept <note place="margin">The diſtinction of Iuſtice.</note>towards God, taketh vnto it the name of pietie. But we will enter into the handling of that Iuſtice onely, which hath reſpect to our dealings with men, being by the ſame <hi>Plato</hi> called an equall diſtribution towards all the world, according to the deſerts of euery one, and a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cities and common-wealths. He ſaith alſo, that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice requireth vpright dealing throughout a mans calling and charge, and that nothing is more like to the greatnes of God, than a man perfectly iuſt. <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth Iuſtice <note place="margin">Whoſoeuer hath Iuſtice perfectly, hath all the vertues.</note>a generall vertue, bicauſe he that hath hir perfectly, may boaſt that he hath within him all the other vertues. For he could not know what were iuſt and vniuſt, nor make choice of the one and flie from the other, if he were not prudent, to which vertue that thing doth properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. Neither could he exerciſe the precepts of Iuſtice, if by temperance he knew not how to moderate all his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:8689:211"/>
and priuate affections, not ſuffering himſelfe to be ouercome either with wine, gluttonie, luſt, couetouſnes, or with any other deſires and motions, which hinder the vſe of reaſon. Beſides, he could not practiſe one principall &amp; diuine point of iuſtice, which is to ſuccour with all his might the afflicted and oppreſſed, and to prouide that no man be wronged, if it lie in his power, notwithſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny danger whereinto he may fall, although it be certaine loſſe of life, and of all earthlie and tranſitorie goods, I ſay he could not practiſe this, if through Fortitude and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſitie he contemne not death, the earth, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſauoreth of the world, that he may be (ſo farre foorth as his humane nature will ſuffer) a follower of the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Iuſtice (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is a conſtant and perpetuall will and deſire to giue to euery one his right. She is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vertue of a noble minded man, bicauſe ſhe is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others, but to hir ſelfe fruitles, laborious, and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Yea that man onely may be called iuſt, that profiteth as many as he can, but hurteth none, that is alwaies at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement<note place="margin">The praiſe of Iuſtice.</note> within himſelfe, and is a friend to God, to men, and to himſelfe. Iuſtice (ſaith <hi>Diogenes)</hi> worketh great tranquillitie and perfect felicitie in our ſoules. For to be afraid of none, and not to bluſh at the ſight of any mans perſon, bringeth with it great contentation, and is as it were the perfection of life, which is proper onely to a iuſt ſoule. Iuſtice (ſaith <hi>Heſiodus)</hi> is a chaſt and reuerent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, not violated or defiled, but lodged alwaies with ſhamefaſtnes, chaſtitie, and ſimplicitie. <hi>Pindarus</hi> calleth hir the Queene of all the world. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> teaching by his riddlelike precepts, how a man ought to beware of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing Iuſtice, ſaith: <hi>Go not beyond the ballance.</hi> If we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe<note place="margin">Reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is not to be vſed in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Iuſtice.</note> (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> to exerciſe Iuſtice perfectly, we muſt make no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of men in regard either of their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, kindred, wealth, pouertie, or dignitie. This vertue (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> requireth of vs the forſaking of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and priuate commoditie, that we may procure the benefit of the Common-wealth, although it be to our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and loſſe. And thoſe men command and gouerne very
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:8689:211"/>
wel, who forbid vs to do any thing wherof we doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be iuſt or vniuſt: bicauſe equity is ſo cleere of it ſelf, that when we doubt of any thing, we may be aſſured that there is ſome iniuſtice in it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> deuide Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice<note place="margin">The diuiſion of Iuſtice. The difference between Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatiue and Diſtributiue Iuſtice.</note> into theſe two partes, <hi>Distributiue</hi> and <hi>Commutatiue.</hi> Diſtributiue Iuſtice conſiſteth in giuing to euery one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſert, whether it be honor and dignitie, or puniſhment. Commutatiue Iuſtice is in keeping fidelitie and in cauſing it to be kept in promiſes and contracts, &amp; in behauing our ſelues no otherwiſe to another, than we would be delt withall. Many parts and particular dueties are alſo attributed by the Philoſophers to Iuſtice, as Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie and ſundry other, whereof we will particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hereafter. But we muſt here learne, that the end of<note place="margin">The end of Iuſtice.</note> all Iuſtice tendeth to the preſeruation of the common ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of men. For the preſeruation of the lawes (which are the Gardian and Tutor of good men, and a mortall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie to the wicked) is ſo neceſſarie for euery eſtate and condition of life, that (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) the very Pirates,<note place="margin">The neceſſitie of Iuſtice.</note> thieues &amp; robbers could not liue together without ſome part thereof. If we deſire to know more of hir vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits, let vs conſider that which <hi>Paulus</hi> the Pythagori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath written, ſaying, <hi>Iustice among men ought in my opinion to be called the Mother and Nurſe of all the other vertues. For without hir no man could be either temperate, valiant or prudent: the profite wherof will be very euident if we conſider all hir effects.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diuers names agree to Iuſtice in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note> 
                     <hi>For the prouidence of God is that Iustice which gouerneth the world, and hath the principalitie ouer it. In cities and townes Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is rightly called Equitie and Peace: in particular houſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the huſband and the wife, Vnitie and Concord: in reſpect of ſeruants towards their masters, Good will: of masters towards their ſeruants, Humanitie and Gentleneſſe: and in mens bodies Health and perfection of the members.</hi> Thus you ſee that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is the beginning and perfection of all the vertues. By theſe ſhort ſayings of ancient and graue perſonages, the excellencie of this holy and ſacred vertue Iuſtice appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſufficiently vnto vs. Yea it is ſo earneſtly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſpirit of God vnto Magiſtrates in theſe words

                     <note place="margin">Ierem. 21. 12. &amp; 22. 3.</note> of <hi>exerciſing Iudgement and Iustice,</hi> ſo often repeated, that whoſoeuer infringeth and violateth it, can not auoid the curſe and wrath of the Almightie, which will both light vpon their owne heads, and alſo worke the deſtruction of them that are committed to their charge. It belongeth to<note place="margin">What Iuſtice and Iudgement are.</note> Iuſtice, to receiue the innocent into protection and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, to maintaine, defend, ſuſtaine, and deliuer them, and to Iudgement, to reſiſt the boldnes of the wicked, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their violence, and to puniſh their offences: bicauſe Magiſtrats are therefore armed with the ſword and with power, that publike peace ſhould not be diſturbed. This alſo is that which <hi>Solon</hi> meant to teach vs, when he ſaid: <hi>that the greatnes and preſeruation of all Common-wealths conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in two things, in the reward of the good, &amp; in the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the wicked:</hi> which being taken away, the whole diſcipline of humane ſocietie muſt needes be diſſolued and come to nothing. For there are many that haue no great care to do wel, if they ſee not vertue recompenced with ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: although this beſeemeth not a noble-minded man, who ought to do nothing but onely for the loue of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And againe, the malice of the wicked cannot be bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled, if they ſee not vengeance and puniſhment prepared for offenders. All theſe aboue ſpecified conſiderations did ſo greatly recommend Iuſtice to the men of old time, and cauſed them to eſteeme ſo much of it, that whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer occaſion was offered to maintaine and execute it, it was preferred before all things: inſomuch that the father did not pardon his owne ſonne. The Egyptians were the<note place="margin">The Egyptians were zealous of Iuſtice. How they pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iudges.</note> ancienteſt Lawmakers, as Hiſtoriographers report, and were very carefull and diligent obſeruers of Iuſtice. In their cities they painted Iudges without hands, and the Preſident or chiefe Iuſtice with his eies blind-folded: to teach, that Iuſtice ought not to be either a briber, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons, that is, ſhe muſt neither take any thing, nor iudge for any fauour. The kings of their countrey obſerued this order, to cauſe Iudges when they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled by them in their offices, to ſweare, that albe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>it they were commanded by them to iudge vniuſtly, yet they
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:8689:212"/>
ſhould not obey them. Since their time, the ancient Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians<note place="margin">The Grecians and Romans.</note> and Romanes ſhewed themſelues great, true, and zealous followers of this vertue of Iuſtice, and that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their greateſt enimies. They iudged it a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act to accuſe the wicked, ſo it were not vpon any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate occaſion or paſſion: they delighted greatly to ſee yoong men by way of Iuſtice to purſue tranſgreſſors, as grayhounds well fleſht follow after wild beaſts. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Solon</hi> being demanded what citie ſeemed to him beſt<note place="margin">What citie is beſt gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> gouerned, to anſwer: <hi>that city wherein they that are not wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, do as egerly follow after ſatisfaction in the behalfe of another man wronged, as if themſelues had receiued the iniurie.</hi> For the truth is (quoth he) that they which violate and breake lawes, do not offend one man alone, but the whole Citie and Common-wealth: therefore euery one ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ſeeke after iuſt puniſhment. Moreouer, the ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which the Lacedemonians obſerued in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, procured ſuch a publike ſafety, that for a long time they vſed not to put either lockes to cofers, or barres to gates. <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh mention of a certaine countrey, where the inhabitants were to aſſure the ſafetie of the waies, and to repay vnto paſſengers that loſſe, which they had receiued by theeues and robbers. Neither is it long ſince the like ſtatute was obſerued in many places of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. But I ſtand greatly in doubt, that at this day it is ilfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoredly kept. O happie, yea an hundred times happy was the golden age of thoſe famous men, full of heauenlie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, bicauſe vnder their gouernment Iuſtice was had in ſuch honor and reuerence. But let vs rub vp the memorie heereof by ſome notable examples. If any thing cauſeth<note place="margin">Examples of the loue of Iuſtice.</note> Magiſtrates to commit iniuſtice, it is chieflye the fauour which they beare, &amp; the bond wherewith they are bound more to ſome than to others. Therefore <hi>Cleon</hi> the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian<note place="margin">Cleon.</note> minding to deale in publike affaires, gathered all his friends togither, and told them, that he renounced &amp; diſcharged himſelf of all their friendſhip, bicauſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip many times cauſed men to yeeld, and to ſtep aſide from their good and right purpoſes in matters of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

True it is that when we haue none but good men to our friends, who are mooued and poſſeſſed with the ſame zeale to vertue that we are, as before was mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we ſhall neuer fall into theſe inconueniences. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <note place="margin">Ariſtides.</note>of <hi>Aristides</hi> the Athenian his loue vnto Iuſtice, is woorthie of ſpeciall remembrance. For calling into the law an enimie of his, after he had ſet downe his accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Iudges were ſo mooued againſt the accuſed party, for the impietie of the fact in controuerſie, that they would haue condemned him vnheard: ſo greatly did they truſt to the honeſtie of the accuſer, that he had ſet downe nothing but the very truth. But <hi>Aristides,</hi> who for his great and rare vertue had before deſerued the ſurname of Iuſt, went with the accuſed partie and caſt himſelfe at the Iudges feete, beſeeching them, that he might be heard, to iuſtifie and to defend himſelfe, according as the lawes commanded. Further, one writeth of him, that when he was vpon a time Iudge betweene two parties that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before him, one of them ſaid: my aduerſarie hath done thee great wrong <hi>Aristides.</hi> But he foorthwith inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting his talke, made this anſwer: <hi>My friend, declare on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether he hath wronged thee. For I am heere to do thee right, and not my ſelfe:</hi> ſhewing thereby, that Iuſtice ought to be executed without any priuate paſſion, reuenge, or choler, <note place="margin">I.

eares with his hand, to the end he might keepe it pure &amp; vpright, not admitting thereinto (as he gaue them to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) any preiudicate or falſe impreſſion, that ſo he might heare the accuſed partie ſpeake in his own defence and iuſtification. Truely an example meete for kings and princes, that they ſhould not lightly beleeue ſlaunderers, nor giue ſentence of execution preſently vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their report and perſwaſion: bicauſe they ought not to take pleaſure, or to glut themſelues as it were, with ſome pleaſant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime, in the corrections and puniſhments of men, which is the propertie of a tyrant. Neither ought they, after the puniſhment is inflicted, to repent them thereof, which is a token of ignorance, and baſeneſſe of mind: but Iuſtice muſt ſee execution done when reaſon and iudgement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and that without either griefe or pleaſure. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Now what iuſtice can be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for of ſuch men? For after they are once placed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the chiefeſt reſpect is to reape gaine, profit and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, according to that valew &amp; rate of money which they laid out vpon it. Did my office coſt me ſo much? than it muſt be thus much worth vnto me. For if I had imployed my money elſe-where, I might haue had thus much of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues and inheritance. Truly this ſaying full of impietie neuer cauſed them to bluſh that haue vttered it ſundrie times, although it hath wrought the ſame effect in many<note place="margin">The ſaving of Alexander and Lewes the 12.</note> that haue heard it. The Emperor <hi>Alexander,</hi> and after him <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. vſed this ſpeech long ſince by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, <hi>That buyers of Offices would ſell by retaile as deare as they could that which they bought in groſſe.</hi> And for this cauſe a wiſe Politician of our time hath written very learnedly, that they which ſet to ſale eſtates, offices and benefices, ſell withall the moſt ſacred thing in the world, which is Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. They ſell the common-wealth, they ſell the bloud of the ſubiects, they ſell the lawes: and taking away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of honor, of vertue, of knowledge, of godlineſſe, of religion, they open a gate to thefts, to bribes, to couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to iniuſtice, to ignorance, to impietie: in a word, to<note place="margin">Againſt buyers of offices.</note> all kind of vice and filthines. Neither do I doubt but that they which buy them are as greatly to be reprooued and blamed, as thoſe that ſell them: bicauſe they miniſter life and nouriſhment, as much as in them lieth, to this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Hydra of couetouſneſſe and lucre, which ſucketh vp and deuoureth the ſubſtance of the poore. But they will ſay, if we lay not out our money hereupon, others wil do it that are as well prouided with coine, and yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture are not ſo zealous of Iuſtice as we are. What? wilt thou doe euill for feare leaſt another ſhould do it before

thee? Beſides, if thou conſidereſt thy ſelfe well, what lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee hereunto but ambition or couetouſnes? And if peraduenture ſome one among an hundred is touched with a good deſire to profite and to ſerue his countrey, what can he do alone amongſt ten that are corrupted? But let this be ſpoken without offence to good men, who for the moſt part bewaile their eſtate and condition being in ſuch company. And let not ſuch buiers of offices thinke, that bicauſe of their bought eſtates they deſerue any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, (if for other reſpects they are not worthie) which is the reward of vertue only: but rather let them know, that they deceiue themſelues no leſſe than thoſe men did, who thought to flie with the golden wings of <hi>Euripides:</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that thing of the heauieſt matter that could be, which ought to be moſt light.

But to end our ſpeech, we will hold this, that nothing is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to guide and to order the life of man to hir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; happy end, than the vertue of Iuſtice: which being taken from amongſt vs, all other vertues ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues far from vs, giuing place to the perturbations of our ſoules, which draw vs into ruine and confuſion.

Inſomuch that by reaſon of that which vrgeth them within their ſoules, they are conſtrained to confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues culpable for their vniuſt deedes before the iudiciall throne of this Deitie. Therfore with what impudencie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the wicked outwardly gloze their corrupt dealings, as if they gloried in them, yet ſeeing they haue, aſwell by the teſtimonie of their conſcience, as by proofe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, this knowledge euen againſt their wils, that Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is vnfruitful, barren, and vngrateful, bringing foorth<note place="margin">The fruits of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice in the wicked.</note> nothing woorthy of any account, after many great labors and trauels which it affoordeth them, the remembrance of their vnpure deedes abateth their courage, &amp; maketh it full of trouble and confuſion. So that although a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and naughty man, during the ſway of his vitious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, perſwadeth himſelfe, that by committing a wicked &amp; execrable deed, he ſhal enioy ſome great and aſſured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, yet the heat, thirſt, and fury of his paſſion being ouerpaſſed, nothing remaineth but vile and perilous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of Iniuſtice, nothing that is either profitable, neceſſarie, or delectable. Moreouer, this troubleth his mind, that through his diſhoneſt deſires he hath filled his life with ſhame, danger, diſtruſt, &amp; terror of the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. For theſe cauſes the Philoſophers ſpeaking of Iniuſtice, ſaid very well, that there was no vice whereof a man ought to be more aſhamed than of that, bicauſe it is a malice and naughtines that hath no excuſe. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men haue this inward ſence and feeling, that their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts do accuſe or abſolue them before God, they ought to make account thereof, as of a watchman that watcheth &amp; prieth into them to diſcouer all thoſe things which they would gladly hide if they could. This cauſed <hi>Cicero</hi> to ſay, that it is more againſt nature to ſpoile ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, and to ſee one man to increaſe his riches by the hurt of another, than either death, or pouertie, or griefe, or any loſſe of goods, belonging either to the bodie or to fortune. And if a good man neither may nor ought for
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:8689:217"/>
                     <note place="margin">Vertue is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worldlie things.</note> profit ſake, to ſlander, deceiue, lie, or execute any ſuch like thing: it is certaine, that there is nothing in this world of ſo great value, no treaſure ſo pretious, which ſhould mooue vs to forgo the brightnes and name of vertuous <note place="margin">Iniuſtice is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vice.</note>and iuſt. Now, as we learned before, that Iuſtice was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vertue, ſo Iniuſtice alſo comprehendeth all thoſe vices whereinto men commonly fall. For this is Iniuſtice, not to giue to euery one that which belongeth vnto him. In reſpect of God it taketh the name of <hi>Impietie,</hi> in regard of men, <hi>of deniall of rights and lawes.</hi> Our diſcourſe is of this latter, which bringeth foorth pernitious effects after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers manners, deſtroying all duties of honeſtie. But not to ſtay ouer-long in the kinds of Iniuſtice, we will note <note place="margin">How many waies a man may be vniuſt.</note>this, that we are ſo many waies guiltie of Iniuſtice, as we deny to our neighbours thoſe duties which we owe vnto them, and which our vocation requireth of vs: as alſo when we ſeeke to inrich our ſelues by their hinderance, whether it be openly, or by ſiniſter and ſuttle meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt chriſtian ſinceritie, which ought to ſhine in all our dealings. Let vs ſee how the Ancients hated this vice, and ſpake of the pernitious effects thereof. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates) ought to commit any vniust act, how ſmall ſoeuer it be, for any treaſure, wealth, or profit, which he may hope to reape thereby: bicauſe all the treaſures of the earth are not to be compared to the leaſt vertue of the ſoule.</hi> For this cauſe all men iointly ought to haue this one end and intent, that when they profit themſelues, they ſhould alſo be beneficiall to euery one. For if all men ſhould haue reſpect but to their owne, their vnitie would ſoone be diſſolued. <hi>And although it were ſo</hi> (ſaid <hi>Cato) that Iniustice did procure no perill to him that doth practiſe it, yet would it to all others. Plato</hi> calleth it a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule, and a ciuill ſedition which neuer looſeth ſtrength, no not in thoſe that haue it onely within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For it cauſeth a wicked man to be at variance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe. It vrgeth, troubleth, and turmoileth him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, vntill it haue plunged him in the gulfe of all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: whereupon afterward he eaſily ouerfloweth in all impietie, not caring for any thing but to ſatisfie his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:8689:217"/>
deſires. And if it fall out that they who haue the ſword in hand to correct Iniuſtice, do either authorize or practiſe it themſelues, then is the gate of all miſeries ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon euery one, through the vnrulie licence of the wicked, who wallow in all kind of crueltie: from whence all diſorder and confuſion proceedeth, to the vtter ruine and finall ſubuerſion of moſt floriſhing townes and cities, and in the end, of empires, kingdomes and monarchies. Thus doth Iniuſtice diſanull the force of lawes, which are the foundation of euery eſtate: it is an enimie to good men, and the Gardian and Tutor of the wicked. Briefly, it bringeth foorth all effects contrarie to thoſe which we mentioned to be the fruits of Iuſtice, and is the welſpring of the other vices that hinder dutie. Is it not Iniuſtice that <note place="margin">The effects of Iniuſtice.</note>giueth authoritie to murders, robberies, violent dealings, &amp; to other damnable vices, which at this day are vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and are the cauſe that of many great, goodly, &amp; wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy families, poore widowes only and orphanes quite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, do remaine, crying for vengeance, and expecting it from aboue, for the wrong that is offered to their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie? How many ſuch are ſet before our eies by hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are the light of truth? But alas the vnhappines of our age is growne to greater meaſure. How many of the greater ſort, I meane of the Gouernors &amp; Magiſtrats of this deſolate kingdome, may iuſtly challenge that praiſe, whereby <hi>Pericles,</hi> Captaine and Gouernor of the <note place="margin">Pericles.</note>Athenians, thought himſelfe more honored, than by all his braue exploits done in his life time, either in warre, or in politike gouernment, wherein he was the chiefeſt of his time, and which his friends laid before his eies, being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to die, thereby to aſſure him, and to cauſe him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice in a true immortalitie of glorie? <hi>O my friends</hi> (ſaid he vnto them) <hi>Fortune hath had hir part in thoſe exploits: but I make greater account of this, that I neuer cauſed any of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for euery ciuil Magiſtrate</note>
                     <hi>to lament, or to weare a mourning gowne, which onely thing ought to be attributed to my vertue.</hi> O excellent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable praiſe, which euery good man ought to ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to deſire: namely, to be no cauſe of bringing ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:8689:218"/>
and griefe to the common-wealth through any acte of Iniuſtice. Moreouer this vertuous Athenian died wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and without repining, taking delight in an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table remembrance of thoſe good turnes, which he had done to his countreymen. But contrarywiſe it will be a very hard matter for others, who haue been the cauſe of many euils to their countrey, and for all thoſe that delight in committing iniuſtice, not to die in great feare, horror, and trembling, tormented with remorſe of conſcience for <note place="margin">Why the life of the wicked can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be happy.</note>their life paſt. The whole courſe whereof cannot be much more happy, ſeeing euery wicked act ingendring it owne torment from the very inſtant wherein it is committed, through the continuall remembrance thereof filleth the ſoule of the malefactor with ſhame and confuſion, with freights and perturbations, with repinings and terrible diſquietnes of ſpirit. This is that which <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith, <hi>That euery wicked man committing a treſpaſſe, is the priſoner of Iustice as ſoone as he hath done it.</hi> This life is his priſon, out of which he hath no meane to depart, or to flie, but is to receiue the execution of that ſentence which is giuen againſt him by <note place="margin">A compariſon.</note>the ſoueraigne Iudge. And if in the meane time he feaſt it out, ſend preſents and gifts, yea if he ſolace himſelfe with ſundry ſports, delights and pleaſures, it is all one as if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned men that were priſoners ſhould play at dice and cardes, and vſe other paſtime, with the halter ouer their heads wherwith they muſt be ſtrangled. But there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men that cannot be better compared than to litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who ſeeing men worth nothing, to dance and play vpon a Theater, apparelled with cloth of gold and ſiluer, <note place="margin">A compariſon.</note>or with other rich garments, and crowned with precious ornaments, haue them in great eſtimation and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thinking them happy, vntill in the end they ſee them pearced through with great thruſts of a ſpeare, or hewen in pieces with ſwords, or behold fire comming out <note place="margin">The wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which men haue of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper.</note>of thoſe goodly precious robes of gold, which conſumeth them. The ſelfe ſame thing is done by them, who when they ſee many wicked men, either placed in great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and dignitie, or deſcending of good &amp; famous hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:8689:218"/>
they honor, admire, and eſteem them the happieſt men &amp; moſt at eaſe in the world: neuer conſidering that they are chaſticed &amp; puniſhed for their offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, before they ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either put to death, or elſe quite falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the height of their fortune. Now ſeeing it is a thing flatly confeſſed of thoſe that haue any knowledge of our Philoſophie, and prooued ſufficiently by our former diſcourſe, that nothing can be called honorable or profitable which proceedeth of iniuſtice, or of malice, that excuſe, which men giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to vice, do commonly alledge to cloke their impietie withall, namely, that Iniuſtice bringeth with it very ripe and readie fruit, and that the puniſhment if there be any, commeth very late, and long time after the delight taken by the offence, hath no more any ſhew of reaſon in it. For, as we haue alreadie learned, the puniſhment of any ſin is equall with it both for age and time. Furthermore God <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of ſinne is equall with it both for age and time.</note>permitteth oftentimes his diuine iudgement to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely knowen and ſhewed vpon the vniuſt: yea he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe ſo much the more openly, by how much the leſſe men exerciſe Iuſtice and vpright dealind. And yet in reſpect of his maieſtie, we muſt not look vnto time, which is alwaies one and the ſame to him, and not future or paſt: yea the whole continuance of mans life is as nothing vnto <note place="margin">All things are preſent with God.</note>him, and leſſe than the preſent inſtant. But if according to our carnall ſences, we deſire examples of the greatnes and ſwiftnes of his wrath, iuſtly kindled ouer our heads for our execrable impieties, contrary to the nature of his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe and benignitie, which mooued him to waite for vs a long time, who can be ignorant of them in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable affliction of this poore France, wherein it were very hard in mans iudgement to diſcerne, whether is moſt lamentable, either iniuſtice, or the miſerie and calamitie, which by the vengeance of God followeth it, the horrible puniſhment whereof the fautors of iniquitie both haue &amp; daily do feele vpon their heads? Thoſe common-wealths (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> which are readie to be ouerthrowen, &amp; haue all things forlorne and deſperate in them, fall into this <note place="margin">A ſure token of a deſperate common-welth.</note>miſerable iſſue, that they whom the lawes condemne are
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:8689:219"/>
reſtored, and iudgements giuen are reuoked and broken. And when ſuch things come to paſſe, let none be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this, that deſtruction is at hand, neither can any man iuſtly conceiue hope of ſafety. What other thing can<note place="margin">The miſerable eſtate of France.</note> I ſay of France (I would to God I were deceiued) ſeeing that all Iuſtice is turned topſie turuie therein, the wicked are placed in authoritie, &amp; good men driuen away: ſuites in law are commenced againſt euery one more vpon kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie than equitie, corruption than integritie, fauor than vprightnes? But to the end that the greater ſort, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular man may open his eies and behold this ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke that threatneth vs: let vs conſider in our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, through the reading of hiſtories, the like cauſes of the ruine, alteration, and ſubuerſion of many very flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Eſtates, proceeding from the raigne of Iniuſtice, which being the daughter of tyrannie (as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſaid) muſt needes be of the ſame nature: namely, that by vſurping an vniuſt and intollerable dominion, it muſt of neceſſitie fall ſpeedily into a miſerable and wretched end. We haue in all our former diſcourſes alleadged ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie examples of vices, which (as we ſaid euen now) take their beginning, or at leaſt wiſe are inſeparably ioined with Iniuſtice, and heerafter we will make mention of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when we handle certaine points, which properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of this ſelfe ſame originall.

                     </note> will heere note that the deniall of Iuſtice hath procured to many their death or vndoing. <hi>Phillip</hi> the firſt, king of Macedonia, was ſlaine by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> a meane Gentle-man, bicauſe he would not let him haue Iuſtice againſt <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

the Nobilitie and people in ſuch ſort againſt him, that putting him into priſon, where he is at this preſent, they elected his yoonger brother to be their king, who nowe raigneth. But for a more woonderfull matter, we might heere rehearſe, how God, to ſhew vnto vs his deteſtation of Iniuſtice, hath ſometimes ſuffered his iudgement to fal out in that very howre and time, which ſuch as were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly condemned did aſſigne to their vniuſt Iudges. In the liues of the kings of Caſtile, we finde that <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the<note place="margin">A notable hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric of the death of Ferdinando the 4.</note> fourth of that name, putting two knights to death more through anger than iuſtly, one of them cried aloud in this ſort: O vniuſt king, we cite thee to appeere within thirtie daies before the tribunall ſeate of Ieſus Chriſt to receiue iudgement for thy Iniuſtice, ſeing there is no other Iudge in earth to whome we can appeale from thy vniuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Vpon the laſt of which daies he died likewiſe. True it is, ſome man may ſay, that death is ſo naturall, and the hower thereof ſo vncertaine, although determined, that no other cauſe thereof ought to be ſuppoſed, but onely neceſſitie. But yet when it followeth ſo neerely ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table wickednes committed, and ſome diſquietnes and torment of mind is mingled therewith in the ſoule, as it commonly falleth out, we may take ſuch a death for a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie and beginning of the Iuſtice of God, who will not ſuffer the vniuſt man to rule any longer, but exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his iudgements diuerſly in due time and ſeaſon, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are not to giue an account of their doings to men like themſelues. And as for ſuch as are of meaner eſtate, and lower in degree, God ſuffreth alſo many times their puniſhment to be notorious, and that ſometime by ſuch as are not much better than themſelues. Heereupon <hi>Apollonius</hi> that great Philoſopher ſaid, that in his peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ouer three parts of the world, he maruelled moſt at two thinges, whereof the firſt was, that he alwaies ſawe the greater theeues hang the leſſe, and oftentimes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. And thus it fell out in the time of king <hi>Phillip</hi> the<note place="margin">Notable Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice committed by a Prouoſt of Paris.</note> long, wherein a Prouoſt of Paris, named <hi>Henrie Lapperell,</hi> cauſed a poore man that was priſoner in the Chaſtelet to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:8689:220"/>
be executed, by giuing him the name of a rich man, who being guiltie and condemned, was ſet at libertie by him. But his reward followed him hard at the heeles: being for the ſame accuſed, conuicted, hanged, and ſtrangled. Not long after a Preſident of the Parliament, named <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hugues of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> of Crecy, met with the ſame fortune, for a certaine corrupt iudgement giuen by him. Therefore let euery one of vs learne to flie from this pernitious vice of Iniuſtice: namely, from euery action repugnant to the dutie of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charitie, and deſtroying the bond of humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, through the vtter ſpoiling of the riuers that flow from the fountaine of honeſtie. And let vs be afraid through ſuch impietie to fal into the indignation and wrath of the Almightie, to whome onely (as to the author of Iuſtice, and to whome all time is as nothing) it belongeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and to determine thereof, when, after what ſort, and how farre it ſtandeth with reaſon, all which things are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to vs. If he deferre ſometime the puniſhment of Iniuſtice, let vs know, that it is for their greater and more greeuous condemnation, who multiplie and heape vp daily vpon their heads iniquitie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniquitie. And for an example, which great men ought to follow, and not ſuffer Iniuſtice to be practiſed according to euery mans fancie, or vnder any other pretence whatſoeuer, we wil propound vnto them the fact of a Pagan king, who ſhall riſe vp in<note place="margin">Artaxerxes.</note> iudgement againſt them, if they do otherwiſe. The Prince I meane is <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> ſurnamed Longhand, and king of the Perſians, who being requeſted by a Chamberlaine of his whome he greatly fauoured, to do ſome vniuſt thing, &amp; hauing by his diligence found out, that he vndertooke this ſuit for another, who had promiſed him thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crownes, called of them Dariques, he commanded his Treaſurer to bring the like ſumme vnto him, and then ſaid vnto his Chamberlaine, Take this mony which I giue thee.

murders and cruelties deface all the commendation of Iuſtice, whoſe waies ought to be ordinary and vſuall, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling rigor with gentlenes, as the rigor of diſcipline ought to moderate gentlenes, that the one may be commended by the other. <hi>Seneca</hi> rehearſeth a crueller fact than any of the former, committed by <hi>Piſo</hi> the Proconſul, who ſeeyng a ſouldior returne alone to the campe, condemned him to<note place="margin">Moſt cruell ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucritie of Piſo.</note> withſtanding he affirmed that his fellow came after him.

But <hi>Piſo</hi> being offended therwith, put them all three to death: the firſt, bicauſe he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the ſecond, bicauſe he was the cauſe of the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and the captaine, bicauſe he obeied not: ſo that he put three to death for the innocencie of one man, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his authoritie and power in moſt cruell maner, what ſoeuer rigor was vſed in thoſe times in the ordinaunce of warlike diſcipline. Now to take from vs all taſte of ſuch<note place="margin">Augustus Caeſar.</note> barbarouſneſſe, let vs cal to mind an act of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> worthie of eternall praiſe, who would not condemne one that was accuſed of ſeeking his death, bicauſe the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proofes were inſufficient, but left him to the iudgement of God. Let vs learne therfore for the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our diſcourſe to hate all kind of Iniuſtice in ſuch ſort, that euery one of vs ſeeke to profit his neighbour, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at an high price (as <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Amongſt the famous and great perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<note place="margin">What Faith and Fidelitie is.</note> of olde time, no vertue was more commended, or ſtraightlier kept and obſerued than Faith and Fidelitie, which they affirmed to be the foundation of Iuſtice, the indiſſoluble bond of friendſhip, and the ſure ſupporter of humane ſocietie. Of this Faith we mind now to ſpeake, not touching at all that religious and ſacred faith, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the holy myſteries of true pietie, which is a ſingular gift of God his ſpirit, and peculiar to thoſe that appertain to his eternall election. This therfore which reſpecteth the mutuall conuerſation and promiſes of men, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept vnuiolable of honorable men, &amp; ought to be ſo amongſt vs: bicauſe he that giueth his faith, layeth to pawne whatſoeuer is moſt precious &amp; diuine in his ſoule.<note place="margin">Of the violating of faith.</note> So that if he forget himſelfe ſomuch as to breake and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the ſame, he committeth manifeſt impietie, ſhewing that he careth not to offend God by abuſing his name to<note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 12.

It were a great deale better neuer to take God to witnes, than to forſweare him in mockerie: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 34.</note> the Scripture ſo often forbiddeth vs to take his name in vaine, to ſweare falſly by it, or in any ſort to defile the ſame. It is true that this queſtion hath alwaies beene, and is at this daye more than euer in controuerſie: namely, whether a man is bound to performe that which he hath<note place="margin">Whether a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced promiſe is to be kept.</note> promiſed and ſworne to by compulſion, or no? And this ſentence is receiued &amp; approoued of many, that nothing but our Will bindeth vs to performe thoſe things, which neceſſitie forceth vs to promiſe.

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:8689:222"/>
we were willing to performe it: bicauſe no vertuous and<note place="margin">A wiſe man muſt neuer promiſe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt dutie.</note> wiſe man ought to forget himſelfe ſo farre, as to do or to promiſe any thing contrary to his dutie for any neceſſity, no not for death it ſelfe.

And if it were lawfull for euery one to alleadge neceſſitie or conſtraint, thereby to cloake the breach of faith, to whome might a man truſt in any matter? Who doubteth but that all agreements made betweene men, whether in time of warre or of peace, or in any particular affaires betweene partie and partie, are grounded vpon a benefit, which euery one ſuppoſeth to be neceſſarie and profitable for himſelfe, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that they ought not to be kept? Who doubteth but that the breach of them may eaſily be coloured with the like neceſſitie, and ſo vnder this goodly pretence of falſe right and equitie ſhould be allowed? But what? May we be iudges for our ſelues, and in our owne cauſe? Firſt our aduerſe parties to whom we are bound muſt be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and muſt agree with vs of Iudges to determine of our promiſes, whether they were lawfull or vnlawfull, forced and neceſſary or no: according to the law, which relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a man of his promiſe if it be vniuſt or vnreaſonable, or if it be too burthenſome vnto him, or if he were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuented by deceit, fraud, error, force, iuſt feare, or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous hurt. But when we are both iudge and partie, and in ſtead of iuſtice ſeeke after force and violence, it is ſoone ſeene, that all ſhew of excuſing the breach of faith giuen, is onely grounded vpon malice and ſubtiltie.

Which kind of dealing argueth a man to be in truth worſe in behauior towards God, than towards his enimies: bicauſe he that beguileth his enimie through the means of fidelitie ſworne vnto him, doth ſufficientlie teſtifie, that he feareth him, and dares not diſcouer vnto him that which lieth hid in his hart: and yet in the mean time he hath no reuerence or feare of the diuine maieſtie from which nothing is hid, but vſeth that for a couering <note place="margin">We muſt keep promiſe with our enimie.</note>and maske of his wickednes. <hi>We must</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cicero) keepe that promiſe vnuiolable, which we haue made to our enimie, albeit the miſhaps of warre haue constrained vs to yeeld vnto it.</hi> How much leſſe therfore ought we to breake our faith giuen to <note place="margin">Of the neglect of fidelitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a cuſtom of lying.</note>our friends, and to thoſe of whom we neuer receiued any thing but profite and pleaſure? Through this neglect of faith we fill our ſoules with lying, nouriſhing and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them therein, and ſeparating them far from the truth (the fountaine of all goodnes) to lie vnto our neighbors, to deceiue and beguile them in thoſe things, which we are able to performe, thereby deſtroying the bond of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſocietie, yea of nature it ſelfe, which bindeth vs both to will and to procure their good.

wordes and lies to ſet foorth their merchandice? Whereas good men haue always been very ſcrupulous &amp; preciſe in keeping the truth from all kind of pollution, as that which ought to be as wel in the hart as in the mouth, in the works as in the words of euery honeſt man. But if <note place="margin">Lying in a prince is moſt odious.</note>lying procure blame and diſhonor to al men, it doth much more to kings and princes. For ſeeing they are placed in ſuch authoritie, that they may doe what pleaſeth them, what need they to lie? If Machiauell and his followers, fauorers of tyrannie, had well waighed that which we read in infinite places of ſcripture, that God will ouerthrowe diſſemblers and liers, with all their lies &amp; ſubtilties, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could they commend diſſimulations, deceits, treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſuch like pranks, wherewith they ſeeke to poiſon the noble minds of good princes, to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate both from their natural diſpoſition, &amp; from the ſteps of ſuch vertuous men as haue gone before them. And to this purpoſe I remember a deciſion of right concerning princes, which deſerueth to be grauen in letters of gold within their lodgings &amp; palaces: namely, <hi>That if the prince go against his promiſe, it ought to be reckoned amongst the caſes that fall out by chance, neither may any man ſuppoſe the contrary.</hi> For the obligation is double: the one in reſpect of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall equitie, which wil haue couenants and promiſes kept: <note place="margin">The promiſe of a prince is tied with a double bond.</note>the other in regard of the Prince his faith, which he muſt obſerue inuiolable, although he receiue loſſe thereby, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the formall Warrantie vnto all his ſubiects, of that fidelitie which is amongſt themſelues: ſo that no fault is more deteſtable in a Prince than periurie. For if he that is debter and pledge for iuſtice be diſloiall, there is no more truſt to be giuen to him in all his othes: but if he be vpright, his bare word ought to be vnto him for a <note place="margin">Of the word &amp; faith of a prince</note>lawe, and his faith for an Oracle. God himſelfe (ſaith the maſter of the ſentences) is bound by his promiſe. Gather togither (ſaith he) all the nations of the earth, that they may iudge betweene me and my people, if there be any thing which I ought to haue done, and haue not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it. What is he then that will call in queſtion, whether
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:8689:224"/>
a Prince is bound to that which he hath ſworne to and promiſed, ſeeing all ſoueraigne power is no leſſe bound to the lawes of God and of nature, than the ſimpleſt that is ſubiect thereunto? If faith ought not to be kept with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, it is not to be giuen vnto them: and if it be lawful to capitulate with them, it is as neceſſarie to keepe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Yea we may further adde, that periurie is not to be reuenged or called in queſtion, after that peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment togither is made: otherwiſe there would neuer be any aſſurance of peace, or end of periurie. From the ſelfe ſame fountaine of the profanation of faith, and cuſtome in lying (it being the propertie of vice to ingender ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vice for a puniſhment of it ſelfe) proceedeth that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious <note place="margin">Of Treaſon.</note>plague of kingdomes and Common-wealths, I meane Treaſon, hated of God and men, wherewith periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſons being bewitched, feare not to betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſo they may betray others alſo, and their countrey. Whereupon they become odious to euery one, euen to thoſe who vſed them to ſerue their owne turnes in diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and wicked actions, and in the end they receiue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward due to their execrable impieties.

If a man be called ſlothfull, he may become diligent: if talkatiue, hold his peace: if a glutton, temperate himſelfe: if an adulterer, abſtaine: if furious, diſſemble: if ambitious, ſtay himſelfe: if a ſinner, amend: but he that is once called a traitor, there is no water to waſhe him cleane, nor meane to excuſe himſelfe. <note place="margin">Notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note>Nowe, let vs come to the examples of the Ancients, and know what zeale they bare to fidelitie and hatred, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie and treaſon, as alſo what recompence commonly followed and accompanied ſuch things, and with what reward noble-minded men did requite thoſe that were <note place="margin">A.

Afterward, hauing reſolued with himſelfe to keepe faith with the enimie, he returned to Carthage, where he was put to death very cruelly. For his eie-lids being cut off, &amp; himſelfe bound to an engine, he died with the force of waking. <hi>Demaratus</hi> king of Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, <note place="margin">Demaratus.</note>being in Perſia with the king, againſt whome a great man of Perſia had rebelled, was the meanes of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Afterward this barbarian king hauing his ſaid Vaſſaile in his power, would haue beene reuenged of him, thinking to put him to death. But the vertuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian turned him from it, declaring vnto him, that it would redound to his great ſhame, not to know how to puniſh him for his rebellion when he was his enimie, and now to put him to death being his ſeruant and friend. A reaſon truly well woorthie to be marked, but very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly put in vre at this day. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> hauing made procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <note place="margin">Auguſtus.</note>by ſound of trumpet, that he would giue 25000.

And not being then in poſſibilitie to be ſuccored of any but of the Celtiberians, who demanded of him 200. Talents (which are 120000.

meanes to be gotten preſently, but yet promiſed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with ſuch a ſumme, and that within any time which they would appoint: otherwiſe that it was more expedient not to meddle with them. But this wiſe and wel aduiſed captaine vſed this occaſion to very good purpoſe, by reſoluing with himſelfe and with his ſouldiers, either to ouercome their enimies, or elſe to die, (after they had agreed with the Celtiberians) that the Romane glorie ſhould not be ſtained by the falſhood of their promiſes. <hi>For</hi> (quoth he to his ſouldiers) <hi>if we get the battell, we will pay them, not of our owne, but at the charges of our enimies: but if we looſe the victorie, none will be left aliue either to pay, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any paiment.</hi> There was no talke among the Councell of theſe noble Romanes, how they might deceiue their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, or thoſe whoſe ſeruice they were vrged to vſe, but they determined rather to die, than to be wanting in their promiſe. Likewiſe we may note, that as their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes<note place="margin">Periurie and faithles perſons haue alwaies had ill ſucceſſe.</note> thus grounded had good ſucceſſe, ſo periurie and violating of right were through the vengeance of God purſued for the moſt part with vnhappie effects, contrarie to the platformes and deſires of periured and faithles men: or at leaſtwife that themſelues were ſpeedily puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed<note place="margin">Tiſſaphernes.</note> for their wickednes.

Whereupon the Grecians noted this as a iuſt iudgement of his periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and breach of faith, in that he was miraculouſly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of his principall intent, which was, by the meanes of that ouerthrow to haue ſuddenly taken the citie of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos.

For the women being full of wrath and iuſt griefe for the loſſe of their husbands, by the cowardly treacherie of this Lacedemonian, tooke thoſe weapons that were in the ſaid towne, and droue him from the wals, not without great murder and loſſe of the greateſt part of his armie. Whereupon within a while after he became furious, and taking a knife he ript his bodie in ſmiling manner, and ſo died. <hi>Caracalla</hi> the Emperor, trauelling with his armie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes<note place="margin">Caracalla.</note> the Parthians, vnder pretence of marying the daughter of <hi>Artabanus</hi> their king, who came for the ſame purpoſe to meete him, he ſet vpon him contrary to his faith, and put him to flight, with an incredible murder of his men. But within a little after being come downe from his horſe to make water, he was ſlaine of his owne men: which was noted as a iuſt puniſhment ſent from God for his vnfaithfulnes. The Corinthians ſaw before their eies<note place="margin">The Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> their cities raced to the ground, bicauſe they had offered violence to the Romane Embaſſadors, contrarie to the lawe of nations.

Now although we are neceſſarily and iuſtly made inheritors of the ſame curſe both of ſinne &amp; death, yet how become we ſo dull of vnderſtanding, as to deſire with cheerefulnes of hart, and without conſtraint, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede him in the cauſe therof, I meane Ingratitude, which we ought to hate in greater meaſure, and to ſlie from it
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:8689:228"/>
more than from death it ſelf, by reaſon of the euils which<note place="margin">No mans life void of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> it hath brought vpon vs? Notwithſtanding, if we looke narrowly into the iuſteſt mans life that is, it will be a hard matter, yea altogither vnpoſſible, to find it purged and exempted of this deteſtable vice, aſwell towards God as towards his neighbours. But this is farre woorſe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the greateſt part of men to nouriſh and feede their ſoules with Ingratitude, as if they tooke ſingular delight therein, by accuſtoming their mindes to keepe very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the memorie of the aduerſities and iniuries which they ſuffer, and to let the remembrance of thoſe graces and benefits which they receiue, ſlip away incontinently, euen as ſoone as the pleaſure of them is paſt. Whereas du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bindeth all perſons to eſteeme as a great benefit, all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, how little ſoeuer it be, which the heauens or mer impart vnto them, and to preſerue it in perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as in a moſt ſafe Treaſurie, wherein they may keepe &amp; lay vp thoſe good things which they receiue. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, vnthankefull men ſuffer the remembrance of their greateſt felicities to ſlide away ſuddenly: which is the cauſe that they are alwaies void of happines, of reſt, and tranquillitie, and full of vnquietnes &amp; vncertaine deſires, which is an argument of the imperfection of their reaſon, and of their ignorance of that which is good. This is that<note place="margin">The life of the ignorance is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull.</note> which <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, that the life of the ignorant is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, wauering, &amp; vnſtaied in things preſent, through the deſire of things to come. And as it is the propertie of an ignorant man to be alwaies troubleſome to himſelfe, ſo from Ingratitude and the forgetfulnes of our proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, proceede cares &amp; melancholie paſſions to no purpoſe, which conſume men, &amp; pull on age vpon them more than yeeres. For it is vnthankfulnes that cauſeth vs to be neuer contented with our preſent eſtate, but to complaine and murmure, in ſteede of giuing praiſe (as it becommeth vs) to him that ſendeth vs far better things than we deſerue. Vpon the leaſt touch of affliction, the Ingratitude for a million of graces receiued before, cauſeth vs to cry out that we neuer had any thing but miſhap: whereas rather
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:8689:228"/>

But to vexe our ſelues vpon euery occaſion, and as often as things fal out contrary to our inconſtant &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious will, which for the moſt part is ignorant of that which belongeth vnto it, is that which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſayd, <hi>To eat our hart,</hi> or to offend &amp; wound our ſoule and ſpirit, by conſuming them with cares &amp; griefs: as alſo not to know that one cauſe which moſt of all troubleth this miſerable life, is the ſuddain entrance of ſorowes and irkſomnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hart, which afterward will not depart out of it but by litle and litle. Theſe are melancholy paſſions voyd of reaſon, which (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) proceed from naughty fumes and bitter vapors gathered togither within vs, and which aſcend and mingle themſelues amidſt the paſſages of the ſoule. Euen as our ſtrange and vnwoonted dreams teſtifie &amp; ſignifie, that there is within vs repletion of groſſe &amp; glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh humors, &amp; perturbations of the vital ſpirits: ſo are thoſe euil vapors which darken our ſenſes, &amp; dim the eies of our<note place="margin">The vapors wherwith the eyes of the mind are dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> ſoule: namely, ignorance, rebellion, arrogancie, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, vnſatiable deſires &amp; other inward corruptions which ingratitude ſtirreth vp and nouriſheth, and which hinder vs from acknowledging the benefits that God beſtoweth vpon vs, either towards him by thankſgiuing, or towards his creatures by good deeds, which he accepteth as done to himſelf.

turns which we receiue from our like: yea vpon the leaſt diſlike of them, which either with, or without reaſon we forge in our braines, we ſay, that neuer any did vs good. The vaſſaile, for the leaſt deniall or hard countenaunce which he receiueth of his lord, forgetteth all the good turnes, furtherances and fauours, which before that time he had done vnto him. The ſonne complaineth of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the brother of the brother, the friend of the friend, the ſeruant of the maſter. Alas we ſee but too many ſuch vngrateful wretches in France, who eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betray &amp; ſel daily them, of whom they hold all their aduancement &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And if vnthankfulnes be familiar with the meaner ſort, let vs not thinke that it is farther off from thoſe of<note place="margin">Of the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of great men.</note> higher calling. For vpon euery light occaſion, eſpecially if a man frame not himſelfe to that vice which they haue in greateſt recommendation, they eaſily forget all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that hath been done vnto them by reaſon of ſome new-come gueſt, who will ſhew himſelfe a ſeruiceable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of their pleaſures. This commeth to paſſe ſooneſt, when they grow vp and increaſe in calling and greatnes, bicauſe commonly as they mount vp in calling (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well inſtructed in vertue) they waxe worſe and worſe in behauior. But let them boldly take this for an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule, that an vnthankfull prince cannot long retaine a good man in his ſeruice. For the hope of reward (ſaith <hi>Plutarke)</hi> is one of the elements and grounds of vertue, and of that honor, bountie and humanitie, wherwith the prince recompenceth vertuous men, thereby prouoking<note place="margin">Reward and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor nouriſheth vertue &amp; Artes.</note> and alluring them to ſeeke the welfare of his eſtate.

And truly it is a very hard matter for them to be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their honor, who ſeeke their owne profit as much as may be. For we muſt know that in equitie and reaſon there is a difference betweene duetie, and that which we commonly call profit: yea they are diſtinct things, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated<note place="margin">Dutie and profit are two diſtinct things.</note> one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, as honeſtie is from ſuch earthly commoditie. This latter maketh men voyd of feare to breake a ſunder and to diſſolue whatſoeuer was ordeined and ioyned togither both by the law of God and man, ſo that they may gaine thereby. But the other cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, cauſeth them to imploy liberally their goods, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, induſtrie, and whatſoeuer elſe is in their power, that they may profit euery one, and that without hope of any recompence: albeit they that receiue good turnes are bound to returne againe the like to their benefactors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilitie, and to acknowledge their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For this cauſe amongſt the lawes of <hi>Draco</hi> eſtabliſhed among the Athenians, there was a commandement, that if any man had receiued a benefit of his neighbor, and it were prooued againſt him long time after, that he had been vnthankfull for it, &amp; had ill acknowledged the good<note place="margin">A law against vnthankful perſons.</note> turne receiued, I ſay, that ſuch a one ſhould be put to death.

Which cauſed him to be grieued aboue meaſure for the death of a friend of his: not (as he ſaid) bicauſe he ſaw that befall him which is common and neceſſarily incident to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, but bicauſe he had loſt all means of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging vnto him thoſe benefits which he had receiued: whereupon he reprooued and blamed himſelfe for delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deferring it ouer-long. For truly money lent may well be reſtored to his heires that did lend it: but it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the hart of a man that is of a good, noble, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent nature, if he cannot make the ſelfe ſame man that benefited him, to feele the recompence of thoſe pleaſures
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:8689:230"/>
which he receiued. This cauſed the ancients not onely to feare the note of ingratitude towards their friends, but alſo to contend with their enimies which of them ſhould do moſt good, and ſhew greateſt curteſie to his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the ſame <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> did behaue himſelfe towards the Romanes, who had giuen him intelligence of a treaſon that was in hand againſt him. For he to acknowledge this good turne, ſent backe vnto them a great number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners taken in warre, which were then in his cuſtodie, and would not let them pay any raunſome.

                     <note place="margin">Circerius.</note> who had been ſecretarie to the great <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he perceiued that he was a competitor, and ioint-ſuter for the Pretorſhip with the ſonne of the ſame <hi>Scipio,</hi> he feared ſo greatly leaſt he ſhould be noted with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards his ſonne, vnto whom he was ſo greatly bound, and of whom he had receiued his aduancement, that putting off the white garment which they vſed to weare that ſued for offices, he became a ſollicitor for <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> and procured him that honourable eſtate wherewith himſelfe might haue been furniſhed, preferring immortal renowne before that, as one that would not ſhew himſelfe vnthankful towards them vnto whom he was beholding. We read of a barbarous Turke, by countrey an Arabian,<note place="margin">A notable hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of an Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Turke.</note> and Admiral of the Infidels in their warre againſt <hi>Baldu in</hi> king of Ieruſalem, who not willing to ſuffer himſelf to be ouercome in beneficence, much leſſe to beare the name of an vnthankfull body towards the ſaid prince, who had once ſet him &amp; his wife at libertie when they were his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, went by night vnto him into a towne whither he was retired after the loſſe of a bartell, &amp; declared vnto him the purpoſe of his companions: wherupon he led him out of the town, and conducted him vntil he had brought him out of all danger. Moreouer as concerning that which we
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:8689:231"/>
haue alreadie touched, that great men ought to haue ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard to this, that they be not vnthankfull, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward liberally men of deſert, foraſmuch as this point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth principally to the vertue of liberalitie, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is ſufficient for a ſeuerall diſcourſe, we wil content our ſelues without any further addition, with the propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Baiazet.</note> of a notable example of <hi>Baiazet,</hi> emperour of the Turkes touching this matter. This man being aduertiſed at the taking of the town of Modona from the Venetians of the valure of a yong Ianitſarie of the age of 22. yeeres, who was the firſt that mounted vpon the wall, wherupon 30000. Ianitſaries mo being mooued therewith were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned to doe the like, gaue him preſently an office of <hi>Sangeat,</hi> which is one of the greateſt &amp; richeſt eſtates next to the Baſchas, and is valued at 10000. duckats in yeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenues. Now if we deſire to follow to the vttermoſt of our power, the noble courage of theſe famous perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, that ſo we may not fall into the ſhamefull vice of ingratitude, this will helpe vs greatly, if we alwais eſteeme the benefit which we receiue of another, greater than it<note place="margin">A mean to keep vs from ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note> is: and contrarywiſe, repute that leſſe than it is, which we giue. For thereby we ſhall feele our ſelues vrged, and as it were bound voluntarily to continue to doe good to our like, and ſo preſerue the bond of humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie inuiolable. Neither let vs (as proud and vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men do, who vaunt that they ſtand in need of none) diſdain to receiue a pleaſure of our friends, although they be of leſſe calling than we, when they deſire our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For if it be an honeſt thing to do good to all, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſhoneſt to receiue likewiſe of all, bicauſe a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is as needefull as a giuer for the accompliſhing of a<note place="margin">Another meane for the ſame.</note> good turne. Furthermore, this will be another great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of preſeruing the common &amp; mutuall bond, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſtand bound one to another, and of baniſhing all ingratitude from amongſt men, if we obſerue this point<note place="margin">Artaxerxes thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted a litle water.</note> alwais, to requite double if we can that good turne which we receiue of another. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> king of Perſia diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the water which a poore handycraftſman, as he
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:8689:231"/>
ſaw him paſſe by, brought from a riuer in his hands and gaue him, but receiued it with a ſmiling and cheerefull countenance, meaſuring the grace of the gift, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the value of the preſent, but according to his good will that offered it. He thought it no leſſe an acte of magnanimitie and kinglie bountie to take ſmall preſents in good part, and to receiue them with a good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, than to giue greater. Againe, we are to know, that a good man muſt neuer giue ouer to do good to all, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any pretence of Ingratitude wherwith they may be noted, whome he hath alreadie bound vnto him. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) that is true vertue, which ſetteth it ſelf<note place="margin">Vertue is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to it ſelfe.</note> on worke, in reſpect of no other end than of it ſelfe: yea vertue is a very ſufficient recompence vnto it ſelfe. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man haue occaſion to be grieued at an vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſon, yet he hath no libertie to repent him of the good turne which he hath done him. Yea the vnwoorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he is that receiueth a benefit, the more is he to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from whome it commeth. And we may aſſure our ſelues that that thing onely is giuen, which is giuen without any reſpect. For if there be hope of recompence, the benefactor deſerueth not at all the name of a liberall man, but of one that giueth out to vſurie. Therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> miſliketh the rehearſing of duties done one to another, ſaying: that thoſe men are odious which vpbraid the good turnes they haue done, the remembrance of which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer ought to retaine, and the giuer muſt paſſe them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in ſilence: ſeeing the greateſt contentation, which an excellent and noble-minded man can take in his glorious deedes and actions, is to ſee himſelfe adorned with that vertue which is profitable to others, but to it ſelfe is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, painfull, and perillous. To the ende therefore that we may reape profit by all that hath beene heere diſcourſed, ſeeing we knowe by ouer-many experiences vnto what miſchiefe Ingratitude hath made vs ſubiect, let vs awaken<note place="margin">The ſleepe of the ſpirite is woorſe than death.</note> our ſpirits out of the deepe ſleepe of ignorance, which hath ſo long time poſſeſſed them, conſidering that (as <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> ſaid) the ſleepe of the ſpirite is worſe than death.

Therefore let vs watch in ſpirite, that both with hart and voice we may ſing and ſet foorth the vnſpeakeable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that are daily offered vnto vs by the goodnes of God, whereof we ſhall be made partakers through his grace, if our frowardnes be no let vnto vs. Let our ioy, contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pleaſure be in them that deſtroy and driue farre from vs all irkeſomnes, and ſad melancholie, and let vs take ſingular delight in profiting one another by good turnes and benefits: yea let vs ſhewe that we haue ſuch noble minds, that no Ingratitude can turne vs aſide from the deſire of doing good to all.

To this purpoſe <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſometime is not wicked, but neuer good. Now then ACHITOB, inſtruct vs ſufficiently in this goodly matter.</p>

                  <p>Seeing Liberalitie is a vertue betweene theſe two vices, <hi>Couetouſnes,</hi> and <hi>Prodigalitie,</hi> and ſeeing the iudgement of reaſon ought to be the director and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of giuing, and of free Liberalitie, that it be not abuſed in delights, or fauour of the wicked, but vſed with a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ripe deliberation; <hi>Where, When,</hi> and <hi>Aſmuch</hi> as ought to be, I am of opinion that we may not vnfitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the effects of this vertue of Liberalitie, to the good vſe of Riches, which of themſelues are not able to make a man better or more happy, as we were before ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently taught: but if they be ioined with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of true honeſtie, and perfect goodnes, they offer <note place="margin">How riches may be well vſed.</note>
                     <pb n="436" facs="tcp:8689:233"/>
meanes vnto him whereby he may the better execute his good and honeſt inclinations, to the profite and reliefe of all them that ſtand in neede. Heereupon we muſt beſtow onely whatſoeuer we haue more than neceſſarie: firſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that are of our blood and kindred, then vpon all indifferently that want our helpe. And this is ſuch an excellent and commendable deede, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> and all<note place="margin">Ariſtotles opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning a happie life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of bodilie and outward goods.</note> the Peripatecians maintained this opinion, that a happie life which conſiſteth in the perfect vſe of vertue, could not be in all reſpects abſolute, if it wanted the aſſiſtance of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie and externall goods, which are as inſtruments to further a man in the good and vertuous execution of his honeſt deſires. But we ſhewed heeretofore by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and according to the opinion of the Academicks and Stoicks, that vertue onely is ſufficient of it ſelfe to make a man liue happily, and that his vertue cannot be either more honored, or diſgraced through the abundant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or not hauing of the goods of fortune, and of the bodie, ſeeing all other things receiue their glorie from vertue, and are not able to adde any thereunto. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">A poore man may be liberall.</note> a poore vertuous man is not kept from any perfect vſe of vertue, no not of Liberalitie, which conſiſteth not in waſting much wealth, but in ſuccouring the afflicted wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and in helping euery one according to abilitie. For this cauſe the poore womans mite was eſteemed of God for a greater gift, than were all the preſents of the rich, bicauſe they gaue of their abundance, and ſhe of that litle which ſhe had. In this manner then euery good man may iuſtly deſerue the name of liberall, neither may any man excuſe himſelfe for not practiſing liberalitie according to his abilitie. But chiefly rich and mightie men are bound thereunto by that commandement giuen vnto them in<note place="margin">Luke 16. 9.</note> the ſcripture, to make them friends with the riches of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. They muſt take good heede that they paſſe not the bounds of this vertue of Liberalitie, but ſtrictly obſerue thoſe three points alreadie touched by me, namely: that they be liberall, <hi>Where, When,</hi> and <hi>Aſmuch</hi> as is requiſite. For when Princes beſtow eſtates, offices, or monie, vpon
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:8689:233"/>
vnwoorthie perſons, they giue where, and more than they<note place="margin">How princes paſſe the limites of liberalitie.</note> ought. And if in time of warre, or calamities of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they giue to flatterers, dancers, and miniſters of their pleaſures, and conſume much vpon feaſts, playes, Turneis, and Masks, they ſpend <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> they ought not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing therby the name of prodigall men, and louers of riot and ſuperfluitie, howſoeuer flattering courtiers labor to diſguiſe ſuch waſtfull ſpendings with the name of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſe and liberalitie. But ſuch ſuperfluous expences bring foorth effects contrary to the vertue and dutie of a king, cauſing princes to leuie extraordinarie taxes and tributes vpon no iuſt neceſſitie, which is wholy to ouerthrow the vſe of liberalitie. And this is done alſo by men of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">When the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſort paſſe the bounds of liberalitie.</note> calling, when in their actions and expences they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to themſelues an other ende than good workes grounded vpon the loue of their neighbors according to charitie. <hi>Cicero</hi> giueth vs a very good precept againſt the opinion of many in our time, who giue out in ſpeech, that they are borne to do great things, namely, to practiſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, and being poore of worldly goods, ſeeke to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelues by vnlawfull and vniuſt meanes, that they may bring to paſſe their loftie deſires: thinking after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards through good-deeds and great liberalitie to make amends for that fault which they haue committed. But (as that father of Philoſophie ſaith) our goods and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie muſt be iuſtly gotten, not by diſhoneſt and hateful gaine: ſecondly, we muſt profite as many as we can, ſo that they be worthie thereof. Moreouer a man may and ought to increaſe it by reaſon, diligence, and ſparing, but to maintaine liberalitie rather than to miniſter vnto luſt, voluptuouſnes, or heaping vp of treaſures. And yet now a daies theſe are the principall occaſions for which riches are deſired, which as they increaſe, ſo we will haue our traine augmented, and our table to be anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Then although ouer-great abundance remaine, yet we exerciſe very coldly the true works of liberalitie, which are to ſuccor the needie. But this is to be farre ſeparated from the commendable end, and good vſe of riches, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:8689:234"/>
all that we haue ouer and aboue our neceſſitie ought to<note place="margin">About what we are to beſtow the ouerplus of our wealth.</note> be imploied in the ſeruice of the common-wealth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing the poore, diſeaſed, afflicted, and priſoners, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the good bringing vp of youth, and generally in exerciſing all other deeds of pietie: accounting it great gaine to helpe the poore, ſeeing God is the rewarder ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Amongſt the ancient Romanes there was a law kept<note place="margin">A notable law amongſt the Romanes.</note> inuiolably, <hi>That no man ſhould preſume to make a publike feast, except before he had prouided for all the poore of his quarter.</hi> And they accounted it a great ſhame and offence to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to ſee any man beg in the ſtreets. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that where there are beggers in a towne, there are alſo thieues &amp; church-robbers. Now if we that beare the name of Chriſtians, and acknowledge the poore to be members of Ieſus Chriſt, are not aſhamed to banquet and feaſt, when as in the meane time the needy crie at our gates, and almoſt die of hunger, doe we not thinke that theſe Heathen men ſhall riſe in iudgement before that great and iuſt Iudge, to accuſe and condemne vs as thieues and church-robbers, and chieflie them that maintaine their delights and pleaſure with the goods of the poore, towards whom the liberall diſtribution of our owne wealth eſpecially ought to be extended both by the lawe of God and man? We muſt feede the poore, and not kill them: but to denie them nouriſhment, or to<note place="margin">How Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled a rich man to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall.</note> driue them from vs, is to kill them. For this cauſe <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> captaine generall of the Thebanes, hauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a very rich man that had no care of the poore in the towne, ſent a poore needie fellow vnto him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him vnder great penaltie to giue preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faile 600. crownes to that poore man. The citizen hearing this commandement, came vnto him to know the occaſion and cauſe thereof: <hi>It is</hi> (quoth <hi>Epaminondas) bicauſe this man being honest is poore, and thou which hast rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed greatly the common-wealth, art rich: compelling him thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to be liberall in deſpite of his teeth.</hi> So carefull were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to helpe them that had need, and to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues enimies vnto them that made no account of the poore.
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:8689:234"/>
But if we ſhould diligently ſearch all hiſtories and deeds of famous men, yet could we not find a more notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,<note place="margin">Cimo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a notable paterne of the true vſe of riches.</note> or worthy to be folowed than that of <hi>Cimon</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian, who hauing gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great wealth honorably, both for himſelf and his country, by the taking and ouerthrow of many Barbarians and townes belonging vnto them, knew neuertheleſſe how to beſtow it liberally with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory and honor, by relieuing all his poore countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to whom his houſe was as an hoſpitall wherein they were all nouriſhed and fed at an ordinarie that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to ſo many as would come thither, which was furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, not with daintie and delicate fare, thereby to occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rich folks to ſeeke it out, but with many common ſorts of victuals in all plentie and abundance, and that for a great number of perſons. This he did chiefly, as he ſayd, to the end that poore honeſt men might haue the more leaſure to imploy themſelues about the affaires &amp; ſeruice of the common-wealth, and not be diuerted from that through trauell and care to get their liuing by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of handicrafts. Beſides, he cauſed all the incloſures, hedges and ditches of his lands and inheritance to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, that ſtrangers which paſſed by, and his owne countreymen that wanted, might take of the fruits that were there according to their neceſſitie. Now if this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of liberalitie be praiſe-woorthie in all perſons that vſe it well according to their abilitie, it is moſt of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, honorable and profitable for kings and princes, heads<note place="margin">Liberalitie moſt neceſſarie for princes and great men.</note> and captains of armies, gouernours of eſtates and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, as that which procureth vnto them, more than any other thing, the good will of euery one, wherein the chiefe ſtrength and ſtay of their greatneſſe conſiſteth. But withall they haue great need of prudence and iuſtice, eſpecially ſoueraigne princes, to diſtribute liberally and according to harmonicall proportion their giftes, graces, and good turnes, whether they be eſtates, offices, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, knighthoods, exemptions, freedoms, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences due as rewards to their ſubiects, according as euery one deſerueth. It belongeth principally to them to

                     <note place="margin">The lawes of liberalitie.</note> keep religiouſly and from point to point the lawes of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, marking well to whom they giue, how much is giuen, at what time, in what place, to what end, and their owne abilitie that giue. Moreouer a ſoueraigne muſt looke that recompence go before gift, by rewarding firſt thoſe that haue deſerued, before he giue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue deſerued nothing: and aboue all things he muſt meaſure his largeſſe at the foote of his power. But when the iuſt rewards of ſubiects and honeſt men are diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the vicious, ſtrangers, and vnwoorthy perſons, this is that which oftentimes ſetteth floriſhing eſtates on<note place="margin">A common miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the greater ſort.</note> fire. There is neuer any want of flatterers and of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent crauers about kings, whoſe onely drift is to ſup vp the bloud, gnaw the bones, and ſucke the marow of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and their ſubiects, to ſatisfie their fooliſh &amp; vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expences, which are ſuch and ſo great, that a man is well at eaſe to giue them any thing, they are alwais ſo nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and monyleſſe, and ſticke not to ſay that they neuer receiue good of their maſters. In the meane while, they that haue beſt deſerued of the common-wealth, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly remooued furtheſt from their maieſties: which commeth to paſſe both by the ignorance of the greater ſort, who make but a bad choice of ſeruants worthy their fauour, as alſo bicauſe the honor &amp; credite of good men forbiddeth them by flattery and begging to ſeek after the rewards of vertue, which ſhould be offred vnto them. But not to wander farre from our matter ſubiect, let vs now conſider of ſome notable examples of the Ancients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this wherof we haue here diſcourſed. It was by his<note place="margin">The liberalitie of Alexander,</note> magnificall and incomparable liberalitie, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great made a way for his noble plat-formes, whereby he became monarch of three parts of the world, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">To the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</note> liberally all his demains amongſt the Macedonians, as before we mentioned.

all their debts? Which thing he likewiſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Moreouer, who will not admire the liberality which all his life time he exerciſed towards the learned men of his time? We read that he gaue at one time to his maiſter<note place="margin">To Ariſtotle.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 800.

He ſent to <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the Philoſopher 50. Talents, which are 30000.

So that the wealth which proceedeth from liberalitie is vnconſumeable, as that which is gotten by giuing, and by<note place="margin">Pertinax.</note> ſcattering abroad is gathered togither. <hi>Pertinax,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Commodus</hi> in the Empire, ſurpaſſed all the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that euer were for exceeding liberalitie, which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the benefite and profite of all his ſubiects.

He forbad alſo that his name ſhould be ſet in any caſtell or place within his dominion, ſaying: <hi>that his lands were not proper to him onely, but common to all the people of Rome.</hi> He aboliſhed all cuſtoms, tributes, and toles laid vpon the hauens of riuers, at the entries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to townes, waies and paſſages, which he called inuentions of tyrannie to get monie, &amp; placed all ſuch things in their ancient liberties. Which actions beſeemed rather a father of the countrie, than a lord and maiſter: and there are few Princes that vſe to doe ſo, but many to whome their owne will ſeemeth to be a moſt iuſt law. But contrariwiſe let them know, that they ought to be ſubiect to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall law, namely, to right, reaſon, truth, and iuſtice, which
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:8689:237"/>
are the proper will of God onely, whoſe people they muſt rule with right and equitie, by comforting them through beneficence, and continuall good turnes. Let vs learne then by our preſent diſcourſe to decke our ſelues with this vertue of Liberalitie, euery one according to thoſe meanes that are giuen vnto him from aboue, and are iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten by him: taking good heede, that we abuſe it not in any kind of voluptuouſnes or vice, neither yet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked, as though we purpoſed to nouriſh and maintaine their impieties.

For this cauſe I ſee no reaſon why men ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme ſo much, or iudge it ſuch a happy thing to haue much goodly land, many great houſes, and huge ſummes of readie money, ſeeing all this doth not teach them, not to be caried away with paſſions for riches, and ſeeing the poſſeſſion of them in that maner procureth not a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation void of the deſire of them, but rather inflameth vs to deſire them more through an inſatiable couetouſnes, which is ſuch a pouerty of the ſoul, that no worldly goods can remedie the ſame. For it is the nature of this vice to make a man poore all his life time, that he may find him ſelf rich only at his death. Moreouer it is a deſire that hath this thing proper and peculiar to it ſelfe, to reſiſt and to refuſe to be ſatiſfied, whereas all other deſires helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſame, and ſeeke to content thoſe that ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Couetouſneſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aristotle) is a vice of the ſoule, whereby a</hi>

gold and ſiluer, encreaſeth his diſeaſe, as water doth the <note place="margin">Conetouſnes like to a dropſie.</note>dropſie: and the obtaining thereof is alwaies vnto him the beginning of the deſire of hauing. He is a <hi>Tantalus</hi> in hell, who between water and meat dieth of hunger. Now it is very ſure, that to ſuch as are wiſe and of ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nature hath limited certaine bounds of wealth, which are traced out vpon a certaine Center, and vpon the circumference of their neceſſitie. But couetouſneſſe working cleane contrary effects in the ſpirit of fooles, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth away the naturall deſire of neceſſarie things, to a diſordinate appetite of ſuch things as are full of danger, rare, and hard to be gotten. And which is worſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the auaritious to procure them with great payne and trauell, it forbiddeth him to enioy them, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp his deſire, depriueth him of the pleaſure. <hi>Strato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>

Their greateſt <note place="margin">The miſerable life of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men.</note>miſerie is, that to encreaſe and keepe their wealth, they care neither for equitie or iuſtice: they contemne all lawes both diuine and humane, and all threatnings and puniſhmentes annexed vnto them: they liue without friendſhip and charitie, and lay holde of nothyng but gayne.

God is forgotten, our neighbour hated, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the ſonne forgiueth not his father, neither the brother his brother, nor the ſubiect his Lord, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of gaine. In a worde, there is no kind of crueltie that couetouſneſſe putteth not in practiſe. It cauſeth hired and wilfull murders (O execrable impietie) to be well thought of amongſt vs. It cauſeth men to breake their faith giuen, to violate all friendſhip, to betray their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. It cauſeth ſubiectes to rebell againſt their princes, gouernours and magiſtrates, when, not able to beare their inſatiable deſires, nor their exactions and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſubſidies, they breake foorth into publike and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſedition, which troubleth common tranquillitie, whereupon the bodie politike is changed, or for the moſt part vtterly ouerthrowen. Moreouer, the exceſſe of the vertue of liberalitie, which is prodigalitie, may be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to couetouſneſſe, and than there is no kind of vice but raigneth with all licence in that ſoule that hath theſe two gueſtes lodged togither. And bicauſe it is a thing that may ſeeme hard to conceiue, how two vices ſo diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing by nature, may be found to agree in the ſame ſubiect, we will ſoone beleeue it, if we ſay with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, <note place="margin">How prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes may in ſome ſort be linked togither in one ſubiect.</note>that it is the point of couetouſneſſe to gripe, and to take, <hi>Where</hi> and <hi>When</hi> it ought not: and that this dealing is put in practiſe neceſſarilie vpon one of theſe two occaſions, eyther of niggardlineſſe and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or for prodigalitie, as they do that vniuſtly ſeeke for meanes to ſatiſfie their fond deſires, and their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and ſuperfluous expences. The common opinion is, that they who put to no vſe the richeſſe which they gette ſo couetouſly, are more miſerable than thoſe that abuſe them after they haue obtayned them by ill meanes: bicauſe manye maye reape pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite by theſe, but of the other none, no not their

                     <note place="margin">Couetous men compared to hogs.</note> onely heires receiue more benefit than they do of hogs, which is after their death. But it falleth not out ſo alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with kings and princes, whoſe couetouſnes ioined with prodigalitie is more hurtfull to their ſubiects than that which is ioined with ſparing. For this latter, althogh it maketh them commit much iniuſtice, and polling of their people to fil their treaſuries, yet when any need hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the common-wealth, either of forraine warre, or of any other calamitie, a good ground-work is laid in the bottome of their cofers for to redreſſe the ſame. But the other maintained with the like iniuſtice, leaueth nothing behind for prodigall princes, wherewith to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in time of neceſſitie. Whereupon oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the finall ſubuerſion of their eſtate, weakened by exactions, to the ouerthrow and vndoing of many who would haue been the ſinewes of their ſtrength: and all to inrich a few who then will ſtand them in ſmall ſtead, or els bicauſe they waſted it vpon riot and ſuperfluities, wherby the warlike vertues both of themſelues and of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects become degenerate &amp; baſtardlike. Of this we note, that after a prince groweth to be prodigall and deſirous of ſuperfluitie and fooliſh expences, no riches he hath will euer ſuffice him: ſo that to ſatiſfie his ſpending, he muſt needs become couetous and vniuſt. The like happeneth many times to the meaner ſort, and to men of all eſtates, that they are couetous and prodigal both togither, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they gather wealth by vnlawfull meanes, &amp; ſpare to ſpend it in the workes of pietie, that they may ſowe it plentifully vpon delights and pleaſures. But the humor of<note place="margin">Couetous men compared to rats and cundit pipes.</note> niggardlines and neerneſſe is moſt common in couetous men, whom <hi>Plutarke</hi> compareth to rats and mice that are in gold mines, which eate the golden oare, and yet nothing can be gotten from them but after their death. Likewiſe he compareth them to pipes through which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being conueied into a ceſterne nothing remaineth for them. So couetous men heape vp treaſures to leaue them to their heires, that they alſo may afterward leaue them to their heires as their predeceſſors did: and ſo neither the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:8689:239"/>
one nor the other reape any good or benefit by them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till in the end either ſome Tyrant take all away by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from that hold-faſt, or els ſome one that is the worſt of the race ſucceedeth, ſpending all diſſolutely vpon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. This cauſed <hi>Diogenes,</hi> ieſting at couetous men, to ſay<note place="margin">It is better to be the ſheepe than the ſonne of a couetous man.</note> that he had rather be their ſheepe than their ſonne, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are very carefull to giue their cattell meete pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, but in ſteede of feeding their youth with conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and profitable nouriſhment, through good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous education, they marre, ſpill, &amp; corrupt them, by graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting couetouſnes in the ſoules of their children, as if they ment to build within them a ſtrong fort wherein to keepe their ſucceſſion ſafely. Whereas contrariwiſe they ſhould learne of <hi>Cicero,</hi> that the glory of vertue, and of praiſwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and honorable deeds, is the greateſt riches which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can leaue to their children, and more excellent than any other patrimonie whatſoeuer. <hi>Socrates</hi> called a yoong man brought vp in ignorance, and rich withall, a golden ſlaue. And that ſeruant anſwered not vnfitly, when, being demanded what his maiſter did, (who was a couetous man, and one that hauing great quantitie of good wine, ſold it to others, and ſought for ſowre wine in Tauernes for his owne drinking) he ſaid: Albeit he hath great ſtore of good, yet he ſeeketh for euill.

Millions of Crownes. He cauſed a very ſtately gilt pallace to be built, which tooke in compaſſe a great part of Rome, but it was ouerthrown after his death, that the memorie of ſuch a cruell tyrant might be rooted out<note place="margin">Againſt the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie of ſumptuous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> of the earth. A notable example for ſuch as thinke to get a vaine glorie by buildings that are more ſtately than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, and yet leaue behind them a notorious marke of their tyrannie, and a perpetuall teſtimonie to poſteritie, that they haue raiſed their houſes with the blood of their ſubiects. <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſeuenth Emperour, a Prince indewed<note place="margin">An Italian Monke.</note> with moſt excellent vertues, was poiſoned with an Hoſt, which an Italian Monke corrupted with monie cauſed him to take. But what neede we ſeeke for ſuch examples of ancient men to know the fruites of couetouſnes, when as the vnhappines of our age daily affoordeth vs new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eies, wherein we heare nothing almoſt ſpoken of, but poiſonings and murders hired with monie, and all committed to this ende, that the authors of them may haue their goods whome they kill, for the ſatisfieng of<note place="margin">A cruell murder of a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and of hir houſhold.</note> their inſatiable couetouſnes? Amongſt many other, who hath not heard of the cruell wilfull murder of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of a good houſe, and of hir men and maides, by hir owne brethren in law, done a few daies paſt? A cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie exceeding that of the Cannibals, who yet ſpare dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall blood. But God the iuſt Iudge would not that ſuch an execrable wickednes ſhould be long concealed &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed. For when it could not be found out by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie of man, one of the murderers touched with the hand of God, and taken with an extreame ſickenes, being
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:8689:240"/>
as it were mad, and as <hi>Cain</hi> was in times paſt, diſcloſed his ſinne of himſelfe, the hainouſnes whereof ſo troubled him, that he ſaid he could hope for no mercie. Afterward recouering his health, he was taken vpon his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and being conuicted of the fact, accuſed all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof, of whome ſome are executed, and the reſt expect no better euent. That couetouſnes cauſeth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to rebell againſt their couetous Princes, and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to their ouerthrowe: we haue an example in <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, who was depriued of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,<note place="margin">Mauritius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the Empire for his couctouſnes.</note> and had his head cut off, beſides the death of his fiue children, &amp; of his wife, by reaſon of the ill will of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and men of warre, which he had purchaſed, who could beare no longer his couetouſnes, whereby he was moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to winke at ſpoiles and murders, and to keepe backe the pay of his ſouldiors. In the time of S. <hi>Lewes</hi> the king, the people of fiue cities &amp; fiue villages of high Almaigne, which at this day we call Switſerland, raiſed ſuch a great<note place="margin">The Nobilitie of Switſerland deſtroied for the ſame cauſe.</note> tumult &amp; ſedition, that they put to the edge of the ſword all their Princes, Lords, and Noble-men, the chiefe cauſe therof was their couetouſnes, which made them oppreſſe their ſubiects with vniuſt exactions. The niggardlye ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of king <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleuenth, mooued ſtrangers greatly<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lewes</hi> 11.</note> to contemne him, and was in part the cauſe of the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſubiects. For hauing put away in a maner all the Gentlemen of his houſhold, he vſed his Tailor alwaies for his Herald of Armes, his Barber for Embaſſador, and his Phiſition for his Chancellour: and in deriſion of other kings, he ware a greaſie hat of the courſeſt wooll. We find in the chamber of accounts a bill of his expences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is ſet downe 20. ſouſe for two newe ſleeues to his olde dublet, and an other clauſe of 15. deniers for greaſe to greaſe his bootes. And yet he increaſed the charges of his people three millions more than his predeceſſour had done, and alienated a great part of his Demaine. Sparing may well be vſed, (which at this daye is more neceſſarye than euer) and yet the maieſtie of a king nothing dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, neither the dignitie of his houſe, and without the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:8689:241"/>

Likewiſe thoſe men, who after they haue hoorded much treaſure, are ſo beſotted and blinded with a couetous loue of their wealth, that they will not vpon any neceſſitie imploy it, can no more auoid<note place="margin">Calipha.</note> their deſtruction, than the other before mentioned. This doth the hiſtorie of <hi>Calipha</hi> king of Perſia, teach vs, who hauing filled a Tower with gold, ſiluer, iewels, and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, and being in warre againſt <hi>Allan,</hi> king of the Tartarians, was ſo ill ſuccoured of his owne people, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not giue them their pay, that he was taken in his towne, and by <hi>Allan</hi> committed priſoner in the ſaid Tower, with theſe words: If thou hadſt not kept this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo couetouſly, but diſtributed it amongſt thy ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, thou mighteſt haue preſerued thy ſelfe, and thy citie. Now therefore enioy it at thy eaſe, and eate and drinke thereof, ſeeing thou haſt loued it ſo much. And ſo he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to die there of hunger, in the midſt of his riches.<note place="margin">How Dionyſius puniſhed a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous wretch.</note> The puniſhment which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the elder, king of Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſa, laied vpon a rich couetous ſubiect of his, was more gentle, but woorthie to be well noted, being full of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For being aduertiſed that he had hid great ſtore of treaſure in the ground, he commanded him vpon paine of life to bring it vnto him: which he did, although not all of it, but retained part, which he tooke with him, &amp; went to dwell in another citie, where he beſtowed his monie vpon inheritance. When <hi>Dionyſius</hi> vnderſtood thereof, he ſent for him, and reſtored all his gold and ſiluer, ſaying vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foraſmuch as thou knoweſt now how to vſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, not making that vnprofitable, which was appointed for the vſe of man, take that, which before thou waſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthie to enioy. And to ſpeake the truth, there is no reaſon wherewith the couetouſnes of ſuch men may be coloured. For if they ſay, that they ſpend not bicauſe they care not for ſpending, it is a point of great follie in them to labour to gather more wealth than they want. But if they deſire to ſpend, and yet dare not for niggardlines do ſo, nor enioy the fruite of their labour, they are a great deale more miſerable. Whereby it appeereth vnto vs what

a goodly and commendable thing it is to be content and ſatiſfied with a little, which freeth vs from the deſire of vnneceſſarie things.

For then the lawes concerning the puniſhment
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:8689:242"/>
of ſuch as had robbed the common-wealth, or of ſuch as being preuented ſlew themſelues, were not made: ſo that they that were accuſed might ſaue their liues by forſaking their goods, yea by paying ſo much only as their accuſers demanded. But there are ſome of a cleane contrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Licinius,</hi> who being readie to giue vp the ghoſt, would gladly cary their wealth with them, as we read of<note place="margin">Hermocrates bequeathed his goods to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> 
                     <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> who by his wil made himſelf heire of his own goods. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> maketh mention of another, who at the houre of his death deuoured many pieces of his gold, and ſewed the reſt in his coate, commanding that they ſhould be all buried with him. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> telleth of one, who being beſieged within the town of Caſſilina by <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> preferred the hope of gaine before his owne life. For<note place="margin">A ratte ſold for 200. pence.</note> he choſe rather to ſell a ratte which he had taken, for 200. Romane pence, than to ſatiſfie his hunger, whereof he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quickly after: and the buier being the wiſer man, ſaued his life by that deare meate. <hi>Craſſus</hi> Conſul of Rome is likewiſe noted by Hiſtoriographers to be extreme coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, which cauſed him to ſwimme between two factions<note place="margin">Couetouſnes cauſed Craſſus to play on both ſides.</note> diuided for <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſeruing his owne turne by them both, and chaunging many times from one ſide to another in the adminiſtration of the common-wealth. He ſhewed himſelfe neither a conſtant friend, nor a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemy, but ſoone forſooke both amitie and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when he ſaw it would be profitable to him, wherof the encreaſe of his ſubſtance gaue great proofe. For when he firſt began to entermeddle in affaires, his riches amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but to 300. talents, which according to our money came to about 180000. crownes: but after when he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to go from Rome to warre with the Parthians, he would needes know how much all his wealth came to. And firſt he offred to <hi>Hercules</hi> the tenth of all his goods: ſecondly, he made a publike feaſt for all the people of Rome of a thouſand tables: and thirdly, he gaue to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Wonderfull riches.</note> citizen as much wheate as would finde him three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. Notwithſtanding all this, he found that he was worth 7100. talents, which amounted to foure millions,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:8689:242"/>
two hundred and three-ſcore thouſand crownes. He vſed to ſay, that he accounted no man rich, except he were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his owne charges to hire and maintaine an armie: bicauſe, as no man can ſet downe a readie reckoning of the expences of warre, as king <hi>Archidamas</hi> ſayd, ſo the riches that is to ſuſtaine it, may not be limited. But in the ende his couetouſneſſe and ambition, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are not farre ſeparated one from another, led him to a violent death, as we declared elſe-where. Now as <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was blamed for couetouſneſſe, ſo <hi>Pompey</hi> was as much<note place="margin">Pompey abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> commended and well thought of, bicauſe he abhorred &amp; contemned it. Whereof he gaue good proofe, as alſo of great piety at the taking of the city of Ieruſalem from the Iewes. For when he entred into the Temple, &amp; beheld the great riches thereof, the table of gold, the golden candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, a great number of veſſels of gold, with great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good &amp; exquiſite ſpice for ſmels, &amp; knew more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer that there was in the treaſurie about two thouſand talents of ſacred ſiluer, yet he would not touch it in any wiſe, nor ſuffer any thing to be taken from it. We that ſay we are chriſtians, follow a farre off the pierie of theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as both great and ſmall watch for nothing more than how to intrappe the goods of the Church to make them ſerue our delights and pleaſures. Moreouer we ſee that this curſed plant of couetouſnes groweth as much in the houſe of prayer, as in the courts of kings and princes. The corruption alſo that hath folowed the ſame, is knowen ſufficiently in thoſe men, who to ſatiſfie their vnſatiable deſires call themſelues protectors of this Hydra Ignorance, to the deſtruction and perdition of their own ſoules, and of ten thouſand mo for whom they are to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <hi>Iouian Pontanus</hi> rehearſeth a pleaſant hiſtory of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall<note place="margin">The great coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall.</note> named <hi>Angelot,</hi> who was well puniſhed for his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes. This cardinal vſed when his horſe-keepers had in the euening giuen oates to his horſes, to come downe all alone without light by a trap doore into the ſtable, &amp; ſo ſteale their oates and cary it into his garner wherof he kept the key himſelfe. He continued his goings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:8689:243"/>
ſo often, that one of his horſe-keepers not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who was this thiefe, hid himſelfe in the ſtable, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him at the deed doing, (being ignorant who it was) beſtowed ſo many blowes on him with a pitchforke, that he left him halfe dead, ſo that he was faine to be caried by foure men into his chamber. <hi>Iohn Maria</hi> Duke of Millan,<note place="margin">The cruel pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a couetous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> chaſticed very iuſtly, but ouer-ſeuerely, the couetouſneſſe of a Curate, who denied the ſeruice of his office in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of a dead body, bicauſe his widow had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pay him the charges of the buriall. For the Duke himſelfe going to the funerals of the dead, cauſed the prieſt to be taken and bound to the corſe, and ſo caſt them both into one pit. A crueltie no leſſe deteſtable than the vice of thoſe wretches that ſell the gifts of God, and make merchandiſe of that, which they ought to giue freely to the people. Now to end our matter, we maintaine this,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 10.</note> that couetouſnes and vnlawful deſire of riches, is the root of all euill, miſerie and calamitie. Moreouer it is more to be miſliked in great men when it followeth riot and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, than if it be ioyned with niggardlines, as wel for the reaſons before touched, as alſo bicauſe niggardly and couetous princes vſe more carefully in their eſtates and dignities to prouide ſuch men as are prudent and ſtaied, for the preſeruation of their ſubiects, knowing that their owne ruine dependeth of their vndoing. Which thing vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous<note place="margin">What magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are beſt liked of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous princes.</note> princes neglect, bicauſe they dreame of nothing but of their pleaſures, and ſo prouide none but ſuch as will ſerue their humor therein, and flatterers, or elſe ſuch as will giue them moſt money wherewith to maintaine their delights. And let vs further know, that all coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men go aſtray from the right way of truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold themſelues in many griefs and miſeries, and become odious to euery one. Beſides, not being content with their daily bread, when contrarywiſe their deſire is infinit, they euidently mocke God as often as they make that petition: bicauſe they labour to conceale and to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before him that knoweth all things, their couetous &amp; greedie affection, whereas true prayer ought to declare

                  <p>That wicked and ſuttle enimie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, not being able to abide the glorie whereunto God had called men, of which he depriued himſelfe through<note place="margin">What execrable ruits enuie hath broughtf oorth.</note> his pride, was driuen with enuie to tempt our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: whoſe ingratitude conceiuing ſinne in the ſoule of man, the firſt fruite brought foorth by this curſed plant, ſeemeth likewiſe to haue beene enuie, with which <hi>Adams</hi> eldeſt ſonne being mooued, ſlew his onely brother. Oh curſed and furious enuie, oh fruitfull branch of execrable euils, ſeeing by thee man was firſt beguiled, and induced afterward to admit murder into his hart, and to water the earth, being yet virgine-like, with his brothers blood: whereby he began his chiefe worke vpon innocencie, to the end that wicked men might from father to ſon haue this prerogatiue to oppreſſe the good! Is there any vice then amongſt vs which we ought to hate and flie from more than from enuie, which hauing nothing of hir firſt euill nature diminiſhed, leadeth men to moſt vniuſt and deteſtable actions? Neuertheles, to what paſſion are we more inclined, or do we nouriſh more willingly than this? Let euery one enter into himſelfe, and vndoubtedly he ſhall find there a thouſand enuies, which are neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hatred and rancor, grafted in the ſecreteſt place of his ſoule. True it is, that enuy according to the ſubiects which it meeteth withall, bringeth foorth more pernitious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in ſome, and leſſe hurtfull in others. But how ſoeuer it be, this paſſion is alwaies blame-woorthie, and ought to be eſchewed of euery good and vertuous man, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, not to wander out of the path of dutie and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.<note place="margin">What Enuie is.</note> We ſay therefore that Enuie is a griefe ariſing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans proſperitie, and that malignitie is commonly<note place="margin">Malignitie is defined of ſome to be the effect of that malice which one man beareth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> ioined with it, whether it be the fountaine therof, as ſome ſay, or one part thereof, as others will haue it. This malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is a delight &amp; pleaſure take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in another mans harme, although we receiue no profit thereby: and it ſeemeth to be accidentall, that is, procured by hatred or ill will, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:8689:244"/>
of ſome euill affection that one man beareth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For this cauſe <hi>Plutark</hi> diſtinguiſheth hatred from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, ſaying: that hatred is bred in our harts through an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination<note place="margin">The difference betweene ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and enuie.</note> and conceit which we haue, that he whome we hate behaueth himſelfe wickedly, either towards all men generally, or particularly towards vs: but that men enuie onely thoſe whome they know to be in proſperitie. And ſo it ſeemeth, that enuie is indefinite and not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, much like to ſore eies, that are offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at euery cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and light, but that hatred is limited, being alwaies grounded and ſtaied vpon ſome certaine obiects in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it ſelfe. Moreouer, no man hath iuſt cauſe to enuie another mans proſperitie. For he doth no man wrong, bicauſe he is happie: whereas on the contrarie ſide many are iuſtly hated for their vices and impieties, and ought<note place="margin">To hate the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a good man.</note> to be ſhunned of good men: which hatred of the wicked is a propertie that belongeth to good men. But the hatred that is borne towards good men, is a paſſion not much ſeparated from enuie. And thus may theſe two paſſions, reſembling two plants, be ſaid to be nouriſhed, preſerued, &amp; increaſed by the ſelfe ſame meanes, albeit they ſucceed one another. The ſame <hi>Plutark</hi> being deſirous to teach vs,<note place="margin">Enuie compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſorcerie.</note> how we ought to abhorre enuie, calleth it ſorcerie: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through the poiſon thereof, it doth not onely fill the enuious bodie with a naughtie and hurtfull diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the infection diſperſeth it ſelfe alſo through the eies, euen vpon them that behold it, ſo that they are tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched therewith, as it were by ſome poiſonfull influence. Likewiſe he compareth it to the flies called Cantharides.<note place="margin">To Cantharides</note> For as they alight eſpecially vpon the faireſt wheate, and moſt blowne roſes: ſo enuie commonly ſetteth it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the honeſteſt men, and ſuch as haue moſt glorie &amp; vertue. Power, honor, ſtrength, riches, are but brands to<note place="margin">The firebrands of enuie.</note> kindle the fire thereof. Therefore <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſaith, that a wiſe man deſireth to be enuied, to the ende he may doe great things. <hi>Bias</hi> ſaid, that enuie and an old houſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times light vpon a man, and neuer knocke at his gates.<note place="margin">Enuie moſt of al hurtfull to the enuious perſon.</note> But if enuie be hurtful to others, it is much more noiſome
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:8689:245"/>
to him that poſſeſſeth it, tormenting him within continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with a thouſand turbulent paſſions, which ſhorten his daies, diminiſheth powers of his bodie, and are a great deale more pernitious to his ſoule. For it will not ſuffer him to taſte or conceiue any good ſpeech, or ſound inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from whomſoeuer it commeth: but cauſeth him to reiect and ſpeake againſt it, as if he were iealous and enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his owne good. The occaſion whereof is the ill will which naturally he beareth againſt all them that deſerue more than himſelfe, whereupon he ſtriueth rather to blame, or to wreſt in ill part whatſoeuer was well meant, than to reape any profite thereby. And if he heare a man commend other mens deuices, or any of his owne doings contrary to his mind, he thinketh that he hath ſo many blowes giuen him with a cudgell. Thus we ſee, that enuie wiſhing well to none, doth no leſſe torment and hurt his ſoule that is infected therewith. And to ſpeake in a word, it comprehendeth the generall iniuſtice, which is all kind of wickednes, and deſtroieth all duties of humanitie, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men to hurt thoſe whom they ought to loue and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. Of this wild plant of enuie, backbiting is a branch, which delighteth and feedeth it ſelfe with ſlandering and lying, whereupon good men commonly receiue great plagues, when they ouer-lightly giue credite to backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.<note place="margin">Of backbiting.</note> Therfore <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick being demanded what<note place="margin">What biting of beaſts is moſt dangerous.</note> biting of beaſts was moſt dangerous, anſwered: <hi>of furious and wild beasts, the backbiters; and of tame beasts, the flatterers.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Themistocles</hi> the Thebane ſaid, <hi>that it was the greatest griefe in the world, to ſee the honor of a good man in the mercie of a venemous toong, and wronged with ſlanderous ſpeeches.</hi> For ſeeing good fame and credite is more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than any treaſure, a man hath no leſſe iniurie offered<note place="margin">When backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hurteth moſt.</note> him when his good name is taken away, than when he is ſpoiled of his ſubſtance. But backbiting and ſlandering do then bring foorth moſt pernitious effects, when Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ready to heare ſlanderers, of whome they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are in the end corrupted. For the enuious &amp; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting perſon doth as a naughtie painter did, who hauing
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:8689:245"/>
ilfauoredly painted certaine cocks, commanded his boy to driue the naturall cocks farre from his picture: ſo he laboureth as much as may be to withdraw good men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe whom he would gouerne. But bicauſe he cannot do it openly, fearing their vertue whom he hateth from his hart, he will ſeeme to welcome, to honour, and to admire them, and yet vnder hand, and behind their backs he will caſt abroad and ſow his ſlanders. And if ſo be that his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and ſecret reports, which pricke behind, do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bring forth the end of his intent, yet he keepeth in memorie that which <hi>Medius</hi> vttred long ſince, who was as it were the maſter and captaine of the whole flock of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, banded togither about <hi>Alexander</hi> againſt all the honeſt men in the court. This fellow taught, that they<note place="margin">A peſtilent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Medius giuen to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters.</note> ſhould not ſpare to nippe boldly and to bite with ſtore of ſlanders. For (quoth he) although he that is bitten ſhould be cured of the wound, yet the skarre at the leaſt will ſtill remaine. And by ſuch skars of lies and falf accuſations, or rather to giue them a better name with <hi>Plutark,</hi> by ſuch fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuloes &amp; cankers <hi>Alexander</hi> being gnawen, vniuſtly put to death <hi>Callisthenes, Parmenion,</hi> and <hi>Philotas,</hi> giuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ouer to the wil and poſſeſſion of three of foure flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, of whom he was clothed, decked, ſet foorth and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it were a barbarian image. Such is the force &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of lying ioyned with flattery ouer that ſoule, which hath no ſound iudgement of reaſon to diſcern truth from falſehood, or a good nature from a malicious. True it is, that this comfort cannot be taken away from good men,<note place="margin">The comfort which cannot be taken away from good men.</note> namely, to be perſwaded that the ſleights of backbiters and ſlanderers are able to preuaile but litle againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible tower of ſacred vertue, &amp; of an aſſured hope well grounded, which, whatſoeuer commeth to paſſe, triumph alwaies, and victoriouſly hold enuy and backbiting vnder their feete. And although theſe vices by reaſon of their force cauſe them to ſuffer ſometimes, yet patience kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth them from being ouercome, ſo that they neuer ſinke downe vnder aduerſities, but euen then lay handes vpon the hauen of their deliueraunce. So that if princes would

                     <note place="margin">Good counſell for princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt flatterers.</note> not fall into thoſe inconueniences, nor be deceiued as this great Macedonian monarch was, they muſt, vpon the reports of backbiters, throughly and with reaſon waigh all things, and not ſuffer themſelues to be perſwaded by ſlanderers, but diſcerne their words with a ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Further let vs note, that they which lend their eares<note place="margin">We muſt not lend our eares to ſlanderers.</note> to their lies and detractions, are no leſſe to be blamed and reprehended, than the ſlaunderers themſelues, bicauſe they are both touched with the ſame imperfection, I meane, of taking delight in the euill report of another. And as the ſlanderer hurteth by accuſing thoſe that are not preſent, ſo doth he that ſuffereth himſelfe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded before he hath learned the truth of things.

Therefore whoſoeuer conſidereth well all thoſe pernitious effects that are procured through backbiting, he ſhall know that it is a great point of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and moſt neceſſarie for him that hath profited well in Morall Philoſophie, not to ſuffer any man to be blamed and euill ſpoken of in his preſence, although he were his<note place="margin">A ſubtill pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of enuious men.</note> capitall enimie. We ſee alſo that this crafty &amp; ſubtill kind of wickednes is vſually practiſed of backbiters and enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, when they perceiue that they cannot cauſe themſelues to be accounted as honeſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they are who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they purpoſe to ſlander, then they labour to prooue that theſe men are not ſo honeſt, as ſome others whom they comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; preferre, ſeeking by that means to couer their hatred &amp; il-will, and to get credit to their ſlander by that praiſe, which they giue indirectly to others.

the dead many times, neither is there any let in them why through their enuy they drawe them not out of that reſt wherin they are, which is deteſtable impietie. Now ſeeing we know what euil proceedeth from theſe wild &amp; naughty plants of enuy, hatred &amp; backbiting, &amp; that naturally, as inheritors of the vice &amp; ſin of our firſt parents, we cary in our harts, I know not what enuy, ielouſie &amp; emulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome one or other, let vs beware that we noriſh not ſuch vicious paſſions, but weaken their force, &amp; make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And if it be poſſible, let vs not be ſparing in giuing vnto them their praiſe &amp; honor, whenſoeuer they do any thing that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth iuſtly to be commended: bicauſe that alſo bringeth greater praiſe to him that giueth it.

Beſides we ſhal reape a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter benefite than is hitherto rehearſed. For when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome our ſelues to praiſe our enimies for well doing, and are not grieued when any proſperitie befalleth them, we ſhall vtterly driue from vs the vice of enuy and iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ouer the good ſucceſſe of our friends &amp; acquaintance, when they attain to honor. Whereas on the contrary ſide if we acquaint our ſelues and take delight in enuying the welfare of our enimies, we ſhall do the like many times to our friends: as we ſee experience thereof in many at this day, who are ſo touched with this vice, that they reioice at the euil which happeneth to their wel-willers, and to ſuch as are the occaſion of their good &amp; preferment. But if we be deſirous to diſcharge our duetie towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for whoſe profite we are borne, let vs ſeeke to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe that ſentence of <hi>Cicero, that an honeſt man &amp; good citizen neuer ought to be moued with hatred or enuy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuppoſed crimes, no not towards his enimy, wiſhing to die rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to offend againſt</hi>

                     <hi>Iustice, which is an vtter enimie to that vice.</hi> This alſo will be a good helpe and meane to keepe vs from backbiting, if<note place="margin">What ſcoffing is, and how it is to be auoided.</note> we eſchew al kind of ſcoffing, which (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſaith) is nothing elſe but a cloſe and coloured reproofe of ſome fault, which by little and little inureth him that mocketh to back bite another openly and vntruly. This great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of gibing is very familiar amongſt vs, although it be as vnſeemely for an honorable perſonage as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more infamous vice. But to the end we may haue better occaſion to keepe vs from it, let vs know that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">A ſcoffe is many times woorſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken than any other iniurious ſpeech.</note> times a man is more mooued with a gibing gird, than with an iniurie: bicauſe this latter proceedeth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the vehemencie of ſudden choler, euen againſt his will that vttereth it, but the other is more taken to hart, as that which ſeemeth to come from a ſetled wil and purpoſe to offer wrong, and from a voluntarie malitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without any neceſſitie. If we be diſpoſed to be merie,<note place="margin">How mirth is commendable.</note> as ſometimes opportunitie, place, and perſons inuite vs thereunto, let it be done with a good grace, and without offence to any. Now although enuie and backbiting, by reaſon of their pernitious effects, are ſo odious to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and vertuous perſonages, yet no other reuenge is to be ſought or deſired, than that puniſhment which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth and groweth with the vice it ſelfe, which neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth him that is touched therewith, to enioy any reſt in his ſoule, as we haue already learned. Neither is there any great care to be had for the matter, ſeeing enuious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and backbiters are no waies able to bite the deſerts of good men. But if we would haue their puniſhment<note place="margin">A notable way how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged vpon the enuious.</note> augmented and doubled, there is no better way, than to ſtudie ſo much the more to do well, as we ſee them labor more earneſtly to enuie and to condemne our dealings. For as the Sunne being directly ouer the top of any thing whatſoeuer, if it leaue any ſhadow at all, yet is it but ſhort and little, bicauſe the light thereof is diſperſed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame: ſo the excellencie of vertue, glorie, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in the end conſtraineth the venemous toong to drinke and to ſwallow downe hir owne poiſon, not daring
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:8689:247"/>
to bring it againe in ſight, whereby enuie and blame are as it were wholy extinguiſhed, and vnable to hurt good men any more. This reaſon cauſed <hi>Phillip</hi> king of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia to make this anſwere to certaine, who told him, that the Graecians ſpake ill of him behind his backe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he did them much good, and therefore willed him to chaſtice them: What would they do then (quoth<note place="margin">Phillip tooke occaſion through back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting to do better.</note> this noble and gentle Prince) if we ſhould doe them any harme? But they make me become a better man. For I ſtriue dailie both in my wordes and deedes to prooue them lyars. And another time, as his friendes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled him to put to death, or to baniſh a Gentleman of Macedonia, who continued in ſlandering him, he would not doe either of both, ſaying: that it was no ſufficient cauſe to condemne him to death: and as for baniſhing him, he ſayd: that it was a great deale better if he ſtirred not out of Macedonia, where all men knewe that he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than if he went amongſt ſtrangers to ſpeake ill of him, who bicauſe they knewe him not well, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture admit his ſlander as true. Whereby this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Prince at one tyme ſhewed foorth the effectes of three excellent vertues: firſt, of <hi>Clemencie,</hi> in that hee would not put him to death, of whome he had receiued great iniurie: then of <hi>Magnanimitie,</hi> in contemning iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and laſtly, of woonderfull <hi>Prudence,</hi> in that he did not baniſh him. And in deede he was of ſuch a gentle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he would neuer puniſh them that gaue him an euill report, but rather tooke away the occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as heeretofore we haue in part mentioned it. And for a greater teſtimonie of the goodnes of this Monarch, the anſwere he made to them that counſelled him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the citie of Athens, deſerueth well to be heere ſet downe. <hi>I doe all thinges</hi> (quoth he to them) <hi>for glorie, how then ſhould I destroy Athens, which by reaſon of learning, is the Theater of glorie?</hi> The example of <hi>Demetrius Phale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Athens the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater of glorie.</note> a Prince of immortall renowne, ſerueth fitly to teach vs what ſmall account we are to make of the dealings of enuious men, ſo farre ought we to be from caring either
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:8689:248"/>
for their dooings or ſayings. When word was brought to this Prince, that the Athenians, mooued with enuie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, had broken downe thoſe three hundred ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which were before erected in their ſtreete of <hi>Ariopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> to his honour, and thereupon was prouoked by his Councel to be reuenged of them, he ſaid: The Athenians may well throw downe my images, but they are not able to abaſe my vertues, for whoſe ſake my images were heeretofore erected for a publike ſpectacle. And truely thoſe actes of Princes, which, being done in their life<note place="margin">The beſt monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a Prince.</note> time, are woorthie of memorie, may ſerue them for an euerlaſting monument, and not Images &amp; Tombs made with mens hands, which length of time, beſides a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other accidents may bring to pouder. Neither are they depriued of the ſame glorie that liue vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of great men, when, according to their places and callings, they direct their actions to the benefite and ſafetie of the Common-wealth. For whenſoeuer enuie laboureth to hurt them with ſuppoſed crimes, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie<note place="margin">Innocencie is a tower of braſſe againſt ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> (as <hi>Horace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> ſaith) will be vnto them in place of an inexpugnable tower of braſſe: ſo that being aſſured of that, they neede not ſtand in any feare of the cruell teeth of ſlanderers. Therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> being reprooued by <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> bicauſe he did not once dreame of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe when he was accuſed, made this anſwere: I haue dreamed of that all my life time, by ſtriuing to liue well. To conclude then our preſent diſcourſe, let vs learne to vncloath our hartes of all enuie and hatred, which procure ſo many turbulent and hurtfull paſſions in the ſoule, and ouerthrowe all that charitie and loue, which we ought to beare towards euery one. Let vs feare<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3. 15.</note> this ſentence pronounced by the holie ſpirite, <hi>that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hateth his brother is a man ſlayer.</hi> And if we ſee that vice and imperfections raigne in our like, let vs hate their euill manners, and loue the welfare of their ſoules, by ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to bring them backe againe into the path way of vertue, vntill we ſee that all hope of remedie is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by reaſon of their long ſetled habite and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:8689:248"/>
in vice: for then we are to ſhunne altogither the hurtfull conuerſation of ſuch forlorne men. Let vs take heede that wee pleaſe not our ſelues in detracting and backbiting, or in ſpeaking raſhly of any without aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken of whome, to whome, and what we ſpeake. Let vs not be giuen to lying, or to harken to ſlanderers, but following the counſell of the Scripture, let vs laye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide<note place="margin">1.

The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo, which the Ancients gaue of Fortune, is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the effect of the thing ſignified, and of that wherof we haue daily experience: namely, that there is no other final end of chang &amp; alteration in man, than that of<note place="margin">The opinions of ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers touching Fortune.</note> his being. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that Fortune is an accidentall cauſe, &amp; a conſequence in thoſe things which proceed from the counſell of man. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that Fortune is a caſuall &amp; accidental cauſe in things, which, being purpoſely done for ſome certaine end, haue no apparant cauſe of their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out otherwiſe: ſo that a man may well ſay, that ſuch a thing came to him by Fortune, which falleth out beſides his thought, when he vndertaketh any worke with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration. <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſaid, that Fortune was ſuch a cauſe, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed neither to perſons, times, or manners. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> ſpeaking of Fortune, ſaith, that ſhe looketh not whereat ſhe ſhooteth, that oftentimes ſhe delighteth in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that, which is gotten with very great paine, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ouerturning thoſe felicities, which, as men think, are beſt ſtaied and aſſured. <hi>Iuuenal</hi> ſaith, that when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth hir, ſhe maketh a Conſul of a Rhetoritian: &amp; likewiſe cleane contrary, hauing this propertie in hir to reioice greatly in the varietie of chances, &amp; to deride all the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men, oftener lifting vp into the place of ſoueraigne authoritie ſuch as are vnwoorthy thereof, than thoſe that<note place="margin">The Romanes gaue great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to Fortune.</note> deſerue the ſame. Amongſt the Ancients, the Romanes honoured Fortune more than all the reſt, eſteeming of hir (ſaith <hi>Pindarus)</hi> as of the patron, nurſe, &amp; vpholder of the citie of Rome. They builded for hir many ſumptuous Temples, wherein ſhe was adored vnder ſundry names, &amp; honorable titles for a Goddeſſe of ſingular power: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they thought themſelues more beholding to hir for the greatnes &amp; proſperity of their Empire, than to vertue. <hi>Sylla</hi> hauing attained to the ſoueraigne authoritie of a Monarch, and of Dictator, yeelded himſelfe &amp; all his
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:8689:250"/>
actions to the fauor of Fortune, ſaying, that he reputed<note place="margin">Sylla ſurnamed himſelfe <hi>Happie.</hi>
                     </note> himſelfe to be Fortunes child, and thereupon tooke vnto him the ſurname of <hi>Happie.</hi> Which opinion ſeemeth to haue preuailed greatly with him, in cauſing him, after he had committed infinite proſcriptions, murders, &amp; cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, voluntarily &amp; without feare to giue ouer the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip, to lead the reſt of his yeeres in all aſſurance &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes, &amp; as a priuate man to paſſe &amp; repaſſe through all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly without any gard, euen in the midſt of them whome he had ſo much offended. We read alſo, that when <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> king of Pontus wrote vnto him concerning the war, which he had vndertaken againſt him, ſaying, that he maruelled how <hi>Sylla</hi> durſt buckle with his great fortune, eſpecially knowing that ſhe had not deceiued him at any time, whereas ſhe neuer knew <hi>Sylla</hi> Conſul, he returned this anſwer. For this ſelfe ſame reaſon thou ſhalt now ſee, how Fortune doing hir dutie, will take hir leaue of thee to come to mee. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> gaue a certaine argument<note place="margin">I.

Thus we ſee what great eſtimation the Romanes had of Fortune, yea they ſtood in ſo great awe of hir pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">P.

For (quoth he) as long as he liueth he will be a fire for the Romane empire, which wanteth but ſome one or other to kindle it. When he was in the vigor and ſtrength of his age, neither his hand nor his body had procured ſo great damage to the Romanes, as his good vnderſtanding and ſufficiencie in the arte of warre had done, being ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the hatred he bare them. Which is nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed through old age, neither yet through the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his eſtate and fortune: bicauſe the nature and qualitie of maners continueth alwaies. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of this requeſt of <hi>Titus,</hi> ſtieped poiſon in a cup of drinke which he had kept a long time againſt an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

And yet <hi>Titus</hi> ſhall not obtaine a victory greatly honorable, or woorthy the praiſe of the ancient Romanes, who, euen then when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> their enimy warred againſt them, and had wonne battels of them, ſent him word to beware of poiſon that was prepared for him. Thus did this great &amp; vertuous captaine finiſh his daies, being vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, and trode vnder foote by fortune, which for a time had placed him in the higheſt degree of honor that could be. <hi>Eumenes</hi> a Thracian, one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,<note place="margin">Eumenes.</note> and one that after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death had great wars and made his partie good againſt <hi>Antigonus</hi> king of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, came to that greatneſſe and authoritie from a poore Potters ſonne: &amp; afterwards being ouercome and

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:8689:253"/>
which are to be ſeene daily amongſt vs, ſeeing the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign<note place="margin">Of the foure ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</note> Empires of Babylon, of Perſia, of Graecia, and of Rome, which in mans iudgement ſeemed immutable and inexpugnable, are fallen from all their glittering ſhew and greatnes, into vtter ruine and ſubuerſion, ſo that of the laſt of them, which ſurpaſſed the reſt in power, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth onely a commandement limited and reſtrained within the confines of Almaigne, which then was not the tenth part of the rich prouinces ſubiect to this Empire?

And much leſſe if it fal out ſo with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who by nature are ſubiect to change, and of themſelues deſire and ſeeke for nothing elſe but alteration. Being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured therefore, that there is ſuch vncertaintie in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, let vs wiſely prepare our ſelues, and apply<note place="margin">We muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelues for all euents.</note> our will to all euents, whoſe cauſes are altogither incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible in reſpect of our vnderſtandings, and quite out of our power. For he that is able to ſay, I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented thee O fortune, I haue ſtopped all thy paſſages, and cloſed vp all thy wayes of entrance, that man putteth not all his aſſurance in barres or locked gates, nor yet in high walles, but ſtaieth himſelfe vpon Phyloſophicall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and diſcourſes of reaſon, whereof all they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable that imploy their wils, trauell and ſtudie thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

And (as <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith) riches, glory, authoritie and credite, reioyce them moſt, that ſtande leaſt in feare of their contraries. For when a man ſeeketh after any of them with an ouer-burning deſire, whereby alſo too great a feare of looſing them is imprinted in him, the pleaſure which he hath by enioying the ſame, is verie weake and vnſtable, much like to a flame blowen vp and downe with the winde. But as for the power of fortune
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:8689:253"/>
(ſaith the ſame Philoſopher) it bringeth downe thoſe men that of their owne nature are cowards, fearefull and of ſmall courage. Neither muſt we attribute cowardlines to<note place="margin">Of the power of fortune.</note> miſfortune, nor valure and prudence to fortune, who is not able to make a man great without vertue. For what good will weapons doe a man without experience, riches without liberalitie, victorie without bountie and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, fighting without valure and boldneſſe: briefly all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes goods without knowledge how to vſe them well? Let vs learne alſo that it is too great blockiſhneſſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the cauſe of the change of monarchies, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, eſtates, of battels loſt, and generally of all caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all miſhaps, both generall and particular, to certaine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes: one while accuſing the ambition of ſome, the ignorance or negligence of others, the ſmall courage, want of money, of men, or of munitions. But we muſt<note place="margin">Whether we muſt looke in the change and ſucceſſe of things.</note> looke higher, and turne towardes him who vſeth ſuch meanes in the execution of his wonderfull counſell, when he mindeth to chaſtiſe and to puniſh men for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Example hereof we haue in thoſe great monarchies of Babylon, of Perſia, and of Graecia, whoſe markes are no more to be ſeene, than the pathe of a ſhip in the water, or way of a bird flying in the aire. And yet they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen and vanquiſhed by ſuch as had a thouſand times leſſe humane force and chiefe ſinewes of warre, as treaſure, men, munition and other furniture, than their monarches and emperours had, who abounded euery way. But God purpoſed to puniſh their pride and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. Let vs therefore ſtand in awe, not of the goddeſſe fortune, which is but the dreame of man, and cannot (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) greatly hurt him, that iudgeth hope groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon vertue more firme, than that which is built vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hir forces, but let vs feare him who directeth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth in wiſdome all things created to their proper end,<note place="margin">The proper end of all things.</note> which is the glorie of his name, and ſaluation of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: albeit the order which he obſerueth, the cauſe, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and neceſſitie of them, are for the moſt part hid in his ſecret counſell, and cannot be comprehended by the

Which he performed, as ſoone as he thought vpon it: foraſmuch as with him to will, is to be able, and to do: as likewiſe to<note place="margin">Another end.</note> be able and to do, is to will. Furthermore, he inſtituted this diuine myſterie for the generall increaſe of mankind, and lawfull propagation of nature, euen in the time of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie before man had ſinned, ſanctifieng it at the ſame time with his bleſſing.

Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth that we haue need of this remedy in two reſpects, namely: in regard of the end and condition of our firſt nature, as alſo by reaſon of ſin, which came in afterward, except in thoſe to whome God hath granted the ſpeciall

Notwithſtanding there hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais been a thouſand contrary opinions as touching this matter, namely, whether mariage is to be deſired &amp; ſought after, or rather to be hated and eſchewed, neither part wanting reaſons, oftentimes more glorious in ſhew than forceable to conclude for the defence of their ſaying. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Philoſophers, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the firſt of them, was<note place="margin">The varietie of opinions tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching mariage.</note> one of the greateſt enimies of mariage, as may be proued by that which is written of him.

Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſophers were of his opinion, yea they ſaid, that nature appointing a contrary to euery liuing creature, hath alſo giuen to man (to whom all other things are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect) the woman for his contrary, whoſe malice is a ſworn enimie to the reaſon of man. <hi>Secundus</hi> was of this ſect, who<note place="margin">Secundus opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a wife.</note> being demanded what a wife was, <hi>the contrary</hi> (quoth he) <hi>of a huſband.</hi> Moreouer they ſaid, that a womans nature was ſuch, that although ſhe had continued 30. yeeres with hir husband, yet he ſhould daily find in hir new fanſies, and ſundry ſorts of behauior: ſo that nature ſeemed a ſtepmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to men rather than to beaſts, bicauſe theſe know and ſhun their contraries, but man is naturally led to loue and to ſeek after his enimie. His miſerie therfore is very great in that ſo weake fleſh is able to force a hart that is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, cauſing a man oftentimes to procure to himſelfe that which doth him hurt, and to make great account of that which he conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth, as experience ſheweth the ſame in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Thales</hi> one of the Sages of Graecia, minding<note place="margin">Thales iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> to ſhew that it was not good for a man to marry, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one asked him why he maried not being in the flower of his age, ſaid, that it was not yet time.

For the concluſion therefore of this preſent matter<note place="margin">Motiues to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> we ſay, that no man can iuſtly blame mariage, vnto which all lawes both diuine and humane exhort vs, nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh vs, honeſtie draweth vs, infinite commodities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite vs, all nations ſhew vs the way thither, and laſtly, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of continuing our kind conſtraineth vs. And brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anſwere the grounds alleaged to the contrary, they may be ouerthrowen by one onely dictinction, which is, that moſt of them that diſpraiſed mariage were heathens, and blinded in their vain wiſedom, or to ſpeake better, in their folly, wanting then that knowledge of the truth, which God of his grace hath ſince reuealed vnto vs.

And no maruell if they erred in diſpraiſing Mariage, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could neuer attaine to the knowledge of the true and ſoueraigne good of man, as we haue handled already. But yet it can neuer be found that <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and ſuch<note place="margin">The beſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers praiſed and vſed mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> as were moſt excellent amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Philoſophers, blamed it, but rather honoured &amp; commended it, the moſt of them alſo being maried, as namely, <hi>Socrates, Plato, Ariſtotle, Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Plutarke,</hi> and others. As for their ſtrongeſt reaſon that miſlike mariage, namely, the deceiuing of men by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the fault ought to be imputed rather to the men, than to the women, bicauſe men, according to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their ſexe, ought to be wiſer than women, who are by nature more changeable by will, and more fraile in counſell, although all are not ſo. So that if there be any imperfection, it ought not to be obiected to them by way of reproch, but rather to nature than to them. And they that vpbraid them therewith, ſhew that they wander out of the path of reaſon, are deſtitute of all good ſence, and are vnworthie that women ſhould haue conceiued them, brought them into the world, giuen them ſucke, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed them.</p>

                  <p>When I conſider of the excellencie &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Plato</hi> his skil, who was greatly admired of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, as he that for vertue &amp; honeſty of life, for eloquence<note place="margin">Plato eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of al things in his Common-wealth.</note> of ſpeech, &amp; perſwaſion by true and learned Philoſophie, went far beyond all other Philoſophers, I cannot ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wonder, how, amidſt ſo many good lawes &amp; profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtatuts for a common-wealth, which we haue receiued from him, he imagined to eſtabliſh therein the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of goods, wiues, &amp; children, amongſt his Citizens, not ſuffring them to haue any thing proper &amp; peculiar: to the end (as he ſaid) to baniſh from his citie theſe two words, <hi>Thine &amp; Mine,</hi> which in his opinion were the cauſe of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils &amp; deſolations that befall Common-wealths.

Which affections ſo long

as they beare ſway amongſt the Citizens, cauſe them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to turne aſide from their duty towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, whereby it is made weaker, &amp; of leſſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. Now among many grounds confuting this error,<note place="margin">The confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this error.</note> (which being receiued, would fil all with diſorder &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, to the ouerthrow of humane ſocietie) this is moſt certain &amp; cannot be impugned, that foraſmuch as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſtributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of goods, &amp; maner of mariages, are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God (as it is manifeſt) &amp; ſeeing the ordinance of God may not be altered by any counſell of man, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that aſwell the diuiſion of goods, as of wiues and children, are immutable, and conſequently, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie of goods, wiues, &amp; children, is a thing flatly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying the inſtitution of God, &amp; therfore to be reproued. Moreouer, if goods were common, an infinite multitude of do-litles, of idle &amp; negligent perſons, borne (as <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith) onely to deuoure &amp; to conſume the benefits of the earth, being vnwilling to labor, &amp; reſembling waſpes that eate the honie of the Bees, would feede and cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their goods, who get their liuing with great ſweate of their bodies, &amp; vexation of their minds. Which is againſt the expreſſe commandement of God, who will haue vs eate our bread in the ſweat of our face. But what greater ſhame &amp; offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vtterly defacing all honeſty of life, can there be amongſt men, than the community of wiues, whereby all fornications &amp; adulteries would be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by authority?

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. For there would not be any publike thing, if nothing were priuate, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, if nothing were peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar. Yea <hi>Plato</hi> afterward did wiſely leaue that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly renounced his firſt Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, to giue place to a ſecond.

Thus following the order eſtabliſhed of God, and continued alwaies through ſo many ages, vntill our<note place="margin">The definition of a houſe.</note> time, and hauing ſeene the firſt inſtitution of mariage, we muſt alſo containe it within the houſe, which is a ſocietie and communion of life betweene the husband and the wife, the maiſter and the ſeruant, for daily profit. <hi>Heſiodus</hi> putteth the Oxe in ſteede of the ſeruant, ſo farre foorth (faith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> as the Oxe being fit to labour, is to poore men in the place of a ſlaue. This houſe thus deſcribed is ſimple, but when children are contained therein, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute<note place="margin">The diuiſion thereof.</note> and compleate. Therefore a houſe that is perfect and accompliſhed, may be diuided, according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Philoſophers, into theſe foure parts: into Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, Parentall, Lordly or Maiſterlie, and Poſſeſſorie part.

                        </gap>oure kinds of mariage.</note> beene well inſtructed in the ſtudie of wiſedome, ſhall find that there are foure kinds of coniunctions and mariages, namely, the mariage of honour, the mariage of loue, the<note place="margin">The mariage of honor is of three ſorts.</note> mariage of labour, and the mariage of griefe. The mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of honour is diuided into the higheſt, middlemoſt, and loweſt degree.

We ſaw the effect and truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the incarnation and natiuitie of the eternall ſonne of God. The middlemoſt mariage of honour is, when God and the ſoule meete, and are ioined togither by grace and glorie. The loweſt degree of the mariage of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:8689:261"/>
is when God and the Church are coupled togither, and are made one myſticall bodie. Theſe three ſortes of mariages are ſupernaturall, and appointed of God after an vnſpeakeable manner: but the cauſe of our aſſemblie requireth not that we ſhould ſpeake any more of them. Now to come to the other kinds of coniunctions, which<note place="margin">2. The mariage of loue.</note> reſpect onely the eſtate of mankind: the mariage of loue, is that which is betweene an honeſt man and a vertuous woman, linked togither by God for the preſeruation of the linage of man. It may be called a charitable coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vnitie, and ſocietie of them that are good, being made by grace, peace, &amp; concord. Of this mariage ſpake that wiſe lewe, ſaying: that three things among others,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 25. 1.</note> were approoued of God and men, <hi>the concord of brethren, the loue of our neighbour, and the husband and wife that agree well togither.</hi> And to ſay truth, it is one of the greateſt benefits, yea one of the rareſt felicities in the world, when a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is well and duly kept, when both the husband &amp; wife feare God, and keepe their promiſe one to another: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Ecclus. 26. 1.</note> to that ſaying of the wiſe man: <hi>Bleſſed is the man that hath a vertuous wife:</hi> the wife alſo being no leſſe happy that hath a good husband. The other kind of mariage,<note place="margin">The mariage of labour.</note> namely of labour, is that which is commonly practiſed in our daies, wherein many, yea almoſt all, marie for coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, not for the vertue, chaſtity, or good report, which<note place="margin">Plautus would haue a man chuſe his wife by the eares, not by the fingers.</note> they heare of women and maidens. <hi>Plautus</hi> the comicall Poet ſaid, that in mariage a man muſt take his wife by the eares, and not by the fingers: that is to ſay, for hir good report, not for hir dowrie, which is told with hands. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> being deſirous that his Citizens ſhould put the ſame in practiſe, eſtabliſhed a law, which forbad all giuing<note place="margin">Lycurgus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad all dowries.</note> of dowries with maidens in mariage, to the end that euery maide ſhould labour to endow hir ſelfe with vertue: for loue wherof, and not of riches, they ſhould be demanded in mariage. The ſame reaſon mooued <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> when<note place="margin">Themiſtocles.</note> two men required his daughter in mariage, to preferre the honeſt man before the wealthie: ſaying, that he had rather haue a man to his ſonne in lawe without goods,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:8689:262"/>
                     <note place="margin">Olympias.</note> than goods without a man. We read that <hi>Olympias</hi> the mother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> hearing of one that had maried a very faire woman, but ſcarce chaſt, being rauiſhed with bir loue, ſaid, that he was a braineles man, otherwiſe he<note place="margin">We muſt not marie by the luſt of our eies, nor by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> would not haue maried by heare-ſay, nor by the luſt of his eies. We may ſay aſmuch of them that marie by the report of their fingers, counting vpon them howe much their wiues bring to them by mariage, not conſidering before whether they bee ſo qualified, that they may liue with them. But let vs know, that euery mariage made through couetouſnes, eſpecially where there is inequalitie of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as namely, when the husband is poore, and the wife rich, will be alwaies riotous, and very hardly will there be<note place="margin">Menander.</note> any peace betweene them. Which thing <hi>Menander</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to teach vs, ſaid, that when a poore man marieth a rich wife, he giueth himſelfe in mariage to the woman which he weddeth, and not the woman to him. And the Satyricall Poet ſaith, that nothing is more intollerable<note place="margin">Pittacus anſwer to a yoong man that asked his aduice in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> than a rich wife. This cauſed a yoong man to go to <hi>Pitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> one of the Sages of Grecia, and to aske his counſell, ſaying: I haue two wiues offered me, the one is equall to me in goods and parentage, the other goeth farre beyond me, which of them ſhal I take? Marke (ſaid this wiſe man) where children are readie to play at fence, go to them, and they will counſell thee. He did ſo, and as he drew neere, they began to ſet themſelues one againſt another to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. And when they ſaw this yoong man comming, who exceeded them in ſtrength and bignes, and ſuppoſed that he would make one amongſt them, they ſaid aloud, let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery<note place="margin">Euery one muſt marie his equal. <hi>Martia.</hi>

For ſhe knew well, that they deſired hir for hit king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and not of any good wil they bare vnto hir: as it is the cuſtome of Princes to reſpect onely their alliance and profite, marying often-times by ſubſtitutes and proxies<note place="margin">Againſt mariage by ſubſtitutes and proxies.

Of this that hath beene hitherto diſcourſed, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the experience which is daily ſeene, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that mariages made through couetouſnes, are in deed mariages of labor. And of this number may thoſe be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned,<note place="margin">Of mariages made onely for beautie.</note> wherein bodilie beautie, and other outward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are only regarded. For it ſeldome falleth out, but that the ſpirite of diſſention troubleth all in thoſe houſes, and that all loue and liking vaniſheth togither with age, which cauſeth the liuely hue of colour to wither away.

may rather be rendred, that the wife may more eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint hir ſelf with hir husbands manners, he being then of ripe iudgement, and ſhe comming into his power from hir tender yeeres. For (as the ſame <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith) diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of manners and callings hindereth friendſhip and true loue. But bicauſe of the ſhortnes of mans daies, I<note place="margin">Why a man ought to haue ten yeeres moe than his wife.</note> thinke it were good for him to marie at thirtie yeeres of age, taking a wife of twentie yeeres old, to the ende that hir age may not be too much vnlike his: that ſo liuing according to the common courſe of nature, they may leaue their children prouided at the ſame yeeres, and ſuch as might be well able to liue without them. A maiden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of that age is able to iudge a great deale better what is meete for hir, and what dutie ſhe oweth to hir husband, and of his commandements, than if ſhe were yoonger.

S. <hi>Hierome</hi> rehearſeth a hiſtorie quite contrarie to this heere ſpoken of, auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that he ſaw at Rome a woman that had beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried<note place="margin">Of a woman that had beene maried to 22. husbands.</note> to 22. husbands, who afterward marying one that had had 20. wiues, died in his life time. Whereupon the Romanes crowned him with Lawrell, in token of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and cauſed him to carie a branch of Palme in his hand at his wiues funerall. He maketh mention alſo of another widowe, who of almes brought vp a little child<note place="margin">The notorious looſenes of a widow.</note> and abuſed it at the age of ten yeeres, by whome ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came great with child, contrarie to the order of nature, God ſo permitting it, to diſcouer the vile filthines of that woman. Second mariages were a great deale more honourable for ſuch widowes. The fourth kinde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage remaineth yet, which wee called the mariage of<note place="margin">Of the mariage of griefe.</note> griefe, which is nothing elſe but the aſſemblie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the wicked and reprobate, of whome that common prouerbe is ſpoken, <hi>that it is better one houſe be troubled with them than twayne.</hi> Their life can not but be full of wretchednes and miſerie, the griefe whereof will abide by them for euer.

and enrich their weddings, are woorthie of eternall<note place="margin">Diuers cuſtoms vſed at the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of mariages.</note> praiſe. Moreouer, they had amongſt them infinite and ſundrie cuſtomes kept at the knitting vp and celebration of mariages, ſome being good, others bad, of which we will heere alleadge certaine, bicauſe we may finde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in them. The Aſſyrians had certaine Magiſtrats called <hi>Triumairs,</hi> and Preſidents of weddings, approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and graue men, whoſe office was once a yeere in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Towne and Village to bring all the yoong maidens that were to be maried, into one publike place, and to cauſe them to be proclaimed one after another, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">The Aſſyrians cuſtome.</note> with the faireſt, who were giuen to them that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt, and bad laſt. With this monie that came by them, they maried thoſe that were hard-fauoured, as good cheape as they could: and otherwiſe than after this ſort, it was not lawfull for any bodie to contract matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Wherein they ſhewed a maruellous care in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding<note place="margin">The cuſtome of the Grecians.</note> equally for all their daughters. The ancient Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians had a cuſtome to burne before the dore of the new maried wife, the Axletree of that chariot wherein ſhe was brought to hir husbands houſe: giuing hir to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thereby, that ſhe was to dwell there with him, whether ſhe were willing or no, and neuer to depart from thence. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> would not haue the husband and wife to lye togither in the beginning of their mariage, nor to ſee one another, but by ſtealth and ſecretly: to the ende (ſayde he) that amitie and loue might be the better preſerued betweene them, that they might be healthie, and that their children which ſhoulde come of them,<note place="margin">The cuſtomes of the Romanes.</note> might be ſtronger. The Romanes paſſed all other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in pompe, ceremonies, and comlines of mariage. They obſerued this inuiolably, that their maidens and widowes ſhould not be conſtrained to marrie. On the wedding daie they vſed that faſhion, which at this daie is verie common. The newe maried wife was richly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, with hir haire hanging about hir ſhoulders, and hir head crowned with a garland of flowers. The mother of the Bride went before hir daughter, bearing a cofer of
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:8689:264"/>
trinkets, iewels, rings, and other little ornaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to women. The maidens that came of wealthie houſes, had a chariot prepared for them, drawne with two white horſes, to declare the puritie of bodie, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of mind, which the yoong woman ought to haue. The newe maried wife was led from hir fathers houſe to hir husbands houſe, alongſt the broadeſt ſtreetes in the citie, to note thereby, that a wife ought alwaies to paſſe by the greateſt way, and not be found at any time in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and ſecret places, whereupon ſome ſuſpition of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill may ariſe. When ſhe was come to the entrie of hir husbands houſe, before ſhe went ouer the threaſhold of the dore, he tooke hir with both his armes by the wings, and lift hir aloft in ſuch ſort, that he ſtroke hir head and the dore poſt togither, and ſo ſet hir within the dore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euer hir feete touched the ground. This was done, that the maried wife ſhould remember through the griefe of the blow, not to go often foorth out of hir husbands houſe, if ſhe would haue the report and name of an honeſt woman. Hir garments, behauiour, geſture and gate, were correſpondent to all modeſtie, honeſtie, &amp; ſhamefaſtnes. She ware a iewell hanging by a riben about hir necke, to ſignifie, that ſhe was bound, and put in ſubiection to hir<note place="margin">The Romane brides vſed to preſent fire and water to their husbands.</note> husband. She preſented alſo to hir husband water in one hand, and fire in the other. Which ſome interprete thus, that as the communication of mans life conſiſteth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the vſe of theſe two elements, of fire &amp; water, ſo there cannot be any fellowſhip more familiar or neerer linked togither, than that of the husband and the wife. Now, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fire and water ſignifie communication, others haue thus vnderſtood it, that as fire and water are cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries aſwell in the firſt as in the ſecond qualities, ſo are man and wife, the one being hot and dry, of the nature of fire, and the other cold and moiſt, of the nature of water: which contrarieties being ioined togither, make a harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie &amp; temperature of loue. Againe, ſome would haue the diſſentions, murmurings, &amp; complaints, that are often in mariages ſignified therby: wherin laughter is not without
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:8689:265"/>
weeping, nor reſt without labor, nor ſweete without ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, according to the nature of all earthly things, in which we cannot taſte honie without gall, nor ſugar without A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes. Many other ceremonies were vſed of the Ancients, which for breuity ſake, as alſo bicauſe there is ſmal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in them, I omit for this preſent. Therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude<note place="margin">What is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of a houſe.</note> our diſcourſe, we learne that the name of a houſe doth not onely ſignifie the wals and roofe of a building, but that it ought to be taken for a familie gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to communicate one with another in all neceſſities. We learne alſo that in euery mariage we ought to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ordinance and inſtitution of God, and to thoſe politike lawes vnder which we liue, to the ende we trouble not common tranquillitie: that we muſt auoide all diſparitie of goods, of houſes, of age, and eſpecially of nature and manners. Let vs not ſuffer our ſelues to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with any fooliſh paſſion, but looke chiefly to this, that vnder a gratious &amp; honeſt behauiour may ſhine foorth cleare and euident ſteps of an vpright and ſincere ſoule, void of diſſimulation: ſaying with the Wiſe man,<note place="margin">Prou. 31. 30.</note>

                     <hi>Gorgias</hi> an excellent Orator, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Cicero</hi> in many places, exhorted the Graecians long ſince to peace and concord, by an oration of woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full arte. Which when he had ended, one <hi>Melanthus</hi> ſtoode vp before all the companie that was preſent, and ſayd: My Lordes, behold <hi>Gorgias,</hi> who by his eloquent oration exhorteth vs that are in number infinite to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and yet he cannot playe the Oratour ſo well as to cauſe his wife and hir chamber-maide to liue quietly with him in his houſe, wherein there are but they three. For ye ſhall daily ſee them at ſtrife and continuall diſſention.
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:8689:266"/>
Therefore, my Lordes, I thinke it great raſhnes in him to exhort vs to concord, when he cannot haue it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his priuate houſe. And truly, beſides the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable torment that is ioined with ſuch riots, iang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and controuerſies in a houſe, it is a ſhamefull of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence when they are knowne to ſtrangers. The Ancients<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lar</hi> the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold God of the Heathen.</note> had a priuate and houſhold God, whome they called the God <hi>Lar,</hi> which we may tranſlate into our language, the God of the Harth. He was had in ſuch veneration, that if any man withdrewe himſelfe to the harth and houſe of his deadlie enimie, his enimie durſt not offer him anie violence as long as he was there, the harth being vnto him a ſanctuarie and place of immunitie. For ſo we read<note place="margin">Themiſtocles ſaued by flying to the harth of his enimie.</note> of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> that being baniſhed from Athens, and purſued by ſome that would haue layed violent handes vpon him, he fled to the Harth of his deadlie enimie, who for that cauſe durſt not ſtrike him, nor offer him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniurie. This Harth was dedicated and conſecrated to the Goddeſſe <hi>Vesta,</hi> and was placed where the chiefe fire of the houſe was made. Nowe I pray you, if it were prohibited, and accounted an vniuſt thing for a man to quarrell, to iniurie, or to offer violence, euen to his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enimie, beeing fled to his Harth, howe infamous an acte (thinke you) and vnwoorthie the nature of man, did theſe men iudge it to be, to offer any violence to them that were of the ſame Harth, but chiefly to the wife, who<note place="margin">What place the wife hath next to the man.</note> is a principall perſon belonging to the bed, table, Harth, yea to the whole houſe of the husband, and is called by the lawe, a companion both of the diuine and humane houſe? At this daie we commonly obſerue this, not to offend in any ſort thoſe that come to ſee vs: and if we haue any occaſion of quarrelling, it ſhall not be ſhewed as long as they are in our houſe, if we haue any care not to be accounted vnciuill, and void of diſcretion. And how ſhall we not vſe the ſame reaſon towards them that are vnto vs a ſecond ſelfe, with whome we are to liue and die? Let vs then haue regard to thoſe principall points that are to be deſired for the eſtabliſhment and continuance
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:8689:266"/>
of loue, vpon which euerie holie mariage ought firſt to<note place="margin">Loue the firſt foundation of euery holy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> be grounded, as we haue already ſaid. Secondly, it muſt be grounded vpon the conformitie and agreement of good and honeſt conditions: and laſtly, it muſt hold &amp; depend of prudence, which breedeth a continuall, liuely, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affection of one towards another, the true teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie whereof is a reuerent behauiour of each to other. It is a Maxime and principle granted by wiſe men, that no<note place="margin">The beſt muſt command.</note> man is woorthie and meete to command, vnles he be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they ouer whome he commandeth. Therefore it ſeemeth that nature commonly giueth more vigour, ſtrength, authoritie, grauitie, and prudence, in deedes and wordes to men than to women. The effects of which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he cannot better ſhew foorth, than by gouerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe<note place="margin">The husband muſt command ouer his wiſe as ouer a free per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> with reaſon, and according to duty towards his wife: firſt, in louing hir, then in gouerning hir gratiouſly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free perſon, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, perſwading hir more by reaſon than authoritie. He muſt not offer hir any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, either in deede or worde, but honour and make much of hir. For the husband that honoureth his wife, honoureth himſelfe. The Lawyer ſaith, that maried wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are and ought to be ſet foorth with the beames of their husbands, and that the husband ought to giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others to honour his wife: whereby alſo he ſhall prouoke his wife to honour him. But on the other ſide, by offring hir wrong, he ſhall incenſe hir, and giue hir occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reply vpon him with bitter ſpeeches, which in the end will prouoke him to wrath, and to behaue himſelfe<note place="margin">The fruits of hard dealing with ones wife.</note> woorſe towards his wife, thereby conſtraining hir, as it falleth out often-times, to inuent ſome miſchiefe againſt him and his honor. There are a thouſand examples heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in good authors, and experience affoordeth too many proofes of the ſame. We reade of <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> the wife<note place="margin">Clytemneſtra.</note> of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> that, to reuenge an iniurie receiued from hir husband, ſhe committed adulterie, and afterward conſented to his death. It is true that this is but a ſimple reuenge of women, and ſuch a one as lighteth vpon them ſelues. But what? This ſexe is fraile, ſpitefull, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:8689:267"/>
to reuenge: and therefore men are to vſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prudence in the gouerning and managing of them. The prouerbe is, that a man is bitten of his dog, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking him ouer-much, and that an Eele is often-times<note place="margin">A husband muſt neuer beate his wife.</note> loſt, when it is ſtrained ouer-hard. Therefore let a wiſe husband knowe this, that he muſt neuer deale iniuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his wife, eſpecially before others: and that he muſt abſtaine moſt of all from laying violent hands vpon hir. If the Ancients would haue their ſlaues corrected, rather with wordes than blowes, much more ought the<note place="margin">Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us precept to husbands.</note> wife to be ſo dealt withall, whome God calleth a helpe like to vs. To this effect <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſayd, that a wiſe husband and one that mindeth to liue peaceably with his wife, ought aboue all things to obſerue this rule, namely: <hi>to admoniſh hir often, to reprehend hir ſeldome, but</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iupiter.</note> 
                     <hi>neuer to lay hands vpon hir. Homer</hi> bringeth in <hi>Iupiter</hi> reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his wife, and threatning hir when ſhe is rebellious, but neuer maketh him goe farther. We read in the life of<note place="margin">Cato.</note> 
                     <hi>Cato,</hi> of whome it was giuen out that he was a ſworne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie to women, that he neuer ſtrake his wife, accounting that ſacriledge: and yet he knewe well howe to vſe the place and dignitie of a husband, which keepeth his wife in obedience. But aboue all that hath beene hitherto ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">A husband muſt eſpecially auoid adulterie.</note> a husband muſt obſerue this as an inuiolable lawe, that he abſtaine from touching any other woman but his owne, aſwell in reſpect of the feare of God, who exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all whoremongers &amp; adulterers from his heauenlie manſion, as alſo bicauſe his wife ſhould haue no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or ſuſpition thereof. For otherwiſe he will caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into a more dangerous Labyrinth, than was that of king <hi>Porſenna</hi> or of <hi>Dedalus:</hi> yea, he ſhall hardly haue a good countenance of his wife at any time, except ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the matter, that ſhe may the better be renenged of him, either by rendring like for like, thinking that ſhe hath iuſt occaſion to breake hir faith made to hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſeeing he hath broken his to hir, or elſe by ſome other meane vpon his perſon. Of this ſuſpition which the wife hath of hir husbands incontinencie, or the husband
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:8689:267"/>
of the wiues, is bred a great paſſion, or to ſpeake better,<note place="margin">What iealouſie is.</note> fury and rage, which we call iealouſie. <hi>Chryſippus</hi> calleth it a diſeaſe of the minde, proceeding from a feare which a man hath, that that thing is communicated to another, which he would not haue common but priuate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Or otherwiſe we may ſay, that iealouſie is bred of that loue, which will not ſuffer a partner in the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. Some write (ſaith <hi>Plutarke)</hi> that Cats are troubled with the ſmell of perfumes and ſweet ſauours, in ſo much that they waxe mad withall. Likewiſe if it ſhould ſo fal out that a woman ſhould be offended and haue hir braine troubled with the perfumes of hir husband, he were of a very ſtrange nature if he would not abſtaine from it, but for the enioying of a little pleaſure would ſuffer hir to fall into ſo great an inconuenience. Now ſeeing it is ſo that ſuch accidents come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, not when their husbands are perfumed, but when they giue ouer themſelues to the<note place="margin">Whoredom is great iniuſtice.</note> loue of harlots, it is great iniuſtice in them to grieue, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and trouble their wiues in ſuch hainous ſort. At leaſt wiſe they ſhould behaue themſelues as they do that draw neere to Bees, who abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching euen their owne wiues. For it is reported of Bees, that they hate and make warre more againſt them than againſt others, bicauſe they haue ſuch falſe harts, as to lie neere their wiues, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and polluted with the company of any other wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The wilde bore (ſaith one of the Poets) purſued of dogs, the Lioneſſe bitten with hunger, the Tyger robbed of hir yong ones, or the Viper whoſe taile is troad vpon, are not more terrible than a woman that is offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: but nothing wil ſooner caſt hir into a phrenſie &amp; fury, than ielouſy. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riadna</hi> buried aliue <hi>Zenon Iſauricus</hi> the emperour, that ſhe<note place="margin">The cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adna.</note> might be reuenged on him. He that taketh to himſelfe thoſe pleaſures which he forbiddeth his wife, doth as much as if he commanded hir to fight againſt enimies, to whom he had alreadie yeelded himſelf. And if vice, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, curioſitie, ſuperfluitie, choler and other imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raigne among men, how ſhould they driue them away from women? So a husband muſt correct himſelfe firſt,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:8689:268"/>
and after vſe learned inſtructions towards his wife. Let him (as Bees do) gather togither and cary to his wife, ſo much of his ſtudies as may ſerue for hir profit. For ſeeing<note place="margin">Women are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie.</note> women (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) haue a ſoule as well as we, and as quicke a ſpirite, yea oftentimes a more excellent ſpirite than we, we muſt not think them vncapable of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſons of Philoſophie, wherein many of them haue gone beyond many Philoſophers. Knowledge and skill wil keepe a woman from other vnmeete exerciſes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rauiſhed with hir husbands braue diſcourſes, ſhe will contemne the loſſe of time in vnprofitable matters. She will neuer fall into that daunger which oftentimes befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth women, who conceiue and bring foorth by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtrange counſels, and extrauagant paſſions, when they receiue not from elſe-where the ſeedes of good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and when their husbands impart not vnto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſound doctrine. The ſame (as fables faine) preuailed more than the Northerne winde. For the more the wind laboured to get away a mans gowne, and to that ende blew more violently, the harder did he girde vp and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine<note place="margin">A tale of the ſunne and the wind.</note> his garment. But when the Sunne waxed hote af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the winde, the man feeling himſelfe heated, caſt off his gowne, and afterward burning with heate, he put off his coate and all. So if husbands go about to order their wiues with their bare authoritie and by force, they will ſtriue againſt it, and be offended: but contrarywife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Women muſt be led more by reaſon and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes, than by force.</note> admoniſhed with reaſon they yeeld of themſelues and take it patiently. The fooles of this world commonly gird and mocke that man, who peraduenture ſeemeth to be led a litle too much by his lawfull wife &amp; loyall ſpouſe, vſing more gentleneſſe and curteſie towards hir, than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and commaunding: and yet you ſhall ſee themſelues ſo ſtrangely bewitched by ſome ſtrumpet, that they feare not to hazard their life and honour in hir ſeruice. But it beſeemeth a man a great deale better to be well liking, gentle and acceptable to an honeſt and vertuous wife, than to abaſe himſelfe to a common harlot. And thoſe men deceiue themſelues, who, hauing maried rich wiues
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:8689:268"/>
and of noble houſes, ſtudie not to make them more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt<note place="margin">The beſt way to bring an vnruly wife into good order is to make hir more honeſt.</note> and better qualified, but to pull them downe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading themſelues that they will come to better order when they haue abaſed &amp; brought them lowe. Whereas e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ought to maintain the dignitie of his wife as he would do the iuſt height of a horſe, and be skilful both in the one and the other to vſe the bridle well as it become<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him. Beſides, a husband is not to rule his wife as a lord or maſter doth his ſlaue, but as the ſoule doth a wiſe mans bodie, through a mutuall loue and ioint affection, whereby he is bound vnto hir. And as the ſoule may well be carefull ouer the body, although it become not a ſlaue to the pleaſures &amp; inordinate affections thereof: ſo a wiſe husband will behaue himſelfe by pleaſing and gratifiyng his wife in honeſt things, and by ſhewing that he loueth honor and vertue aboue all things. This will be a mean to make hir as wiſe, vertuous and honeſt, as otherwiſe: if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe be giuen to voluptuouſneſſe, he ſhall cauſe hir to like of curtiſans conditions, and to become ſlipperie and laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuious.

Whereupon <hi>Euthyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> whom he had brought home to ſuppe with him, roſe vp to depart.

And as cities at ſundry times renew theſe alliaunces, which they haue one with another: ſo this lawe-maker would haue the alliaunce

of mariage, that I may ſo ſpeake, renued by the ſpeeches<note place="margin">Husbands muſt be carefull in looking to their families.</note> vſed at ſuch greetings and viſitations. We ſee daily what miſeries and offences light vpon houſes, when the head of the familie hath no care to rule and guide it: whereupon alſo the women thinke that they are deſpiſed and ſmally beloued. And in truth they haue occaſion giuen them ſo to thinke, when their husbands ſeldome keep them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The Pilote that giueth ouer his ſhip to the mercy of the waues, declareth euidently that he careth not for loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that which is in it. A wife without hir husband is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to many ambuſhes and aſſaultes that are hardly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained.<note place="margin">Women maried their ſeruants in the abſence of their husbands.</note> To this purpoſe I remember a notable hiſtorie written in the chronicles of Ruſſia, namely, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Nouogradum, which at this day is the chiefe &amp; principall ſeate of that countrey, being gone into Graecia to beſiege the towne of Corſun, where they continued for the ſpace of ſeuen yeeres, their wiues in the meane while wearied with their long abode there, maried their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. The husbands afterward returning conquerours, found their ſlaues in the field, who gaue them battell, and had the better of them. Neuertheles in the end the ſlaues were vanquiſhed, and the moſt part of the women moued with indignation for that ouerthrow, hung themſelues. Now as touching that other point mentioned by that<note place="margin">Men muſt not dally with their wiues in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of others.</note> wiſe man <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> namely, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt not dally with his wife in the preſence of others, <hi>Cato</hi> depriued a Senator of Rome from the Senatoriall dignitie, bicauſe he kiſſed his wife in his daughters preſence.

to that ſexe: cauſing hir to be feared, reuerenced, and obeied of the children, men-ſeruants and maid-ſeruants, as himſelfe. But as if one take two ſounds that agree well, the baſe is always more heard: ſo in a well ruled and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered houſe, all things are done by the conſent of both parties, but yet ſo, that it is alwaies apparant, that things are done by the direction, counſell, and inuention of the husband. For a familie will ſuffer but one head, one maſter<note place="margin">There muſt be but one head in a familie.</note> &amp; one lord: otherwiſe if there were many heads, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements would be contrary, and the familie in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall trouble. Now the foundation of all dueties here mentioned by vs of the husband towards the wife, and of all others which daily communication may require, is that true and vnfained loue that ought to be the vnſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bond of euery good mariage. We haue handled<note place="margin">Loue the band of mariage.</note> heretofore the great effects of friendſhip: which if they be required among common friends, no doubt but they are much more between thoſe, whom God, nature, the lawes, and loue, haue ſo ſtraightly ioined togither. Alſo let huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes know, that they ought to reuerence their wines more than any other perſon: and perceiuing them to be wiſe and vertuous, (as they may make them if they be not altogither forlorne and corrupted) let them neuer ſeeme<note place="margin">a hu band muſt not diſtruſt his wife.</note> to diſtruſt them in any reſpect. The Romanes when they returned from a voiage, or from a farre countrey, or onely out of the countrey into the citie, if their wiues were at home, they ſent word before to giue them intelligence of their comming, to the end they ſhould not conceiue this opinion, that they meant to deale craftily or maliciouſly with them. Foraſmuch therfore as loue and friendſhip is the fountain of euery good dutie of the husband towards his wife, and that which as it were ſtealeth away, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the will of his half-partner to be wholy his owne, let vs conſider for the concluſion of our ſpeech, of ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table<note place="margin">Examples of the loue of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands towards their wiues.</note> examples of great loue in the behalfe of men, to the end we may be drawen on to loue and to honor them that are in the ſame place towards vs that the church is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: which he ſo loued, that he ſent his only ſonne

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:8689:271"/>
wiues. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſubmit themſelues to their husbands,<note place="margin">It is an honor to a woman to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey hir husband</note> they are praiſed: but if they will become miſtreſſes ouer them, it beſeemeth them as ill, as it doth ſuch as yeeld to that ſubiection: and both of them reape more ſhame tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honor thereby. Therefore thoſe women that make choice of effeminate husbands, &amp; delight in commanding them, are like to ſuch as had rather guide the blind, than follow the wiſe and cleare-ſighted. So that if a wife loue, eſteeme, and honor hir husband, I thinke that all honeſt dutie will flow from thence, to their common contentation &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, &amp; to the benefit, quietnes, and honour of the whole familie: I meane, if ſhe loue him as hir ſelf, and eſteem and honour him, as hir neereſt lord. A wiſe woman ought to thinke that hir husbands maners are the lawes of hir life, which (if they be good) ſhe is wholy to folow: but if they be bad, ſhe muſt patiently beare with them. For as a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſe ſerueth to no purpoſe, although it be gilt and<note place="margin">A wife compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a looking glaſſe.</note> decked with precious ſtones, if it doth not liuely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his face that looketh into it: ſo a woman is not to be liked albeit ſhe haue ſtore of goods, if hir life be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and hir behauior &amp; conditions be not conformable to hir husbands. If a looking glaſſe repreſent a ſadde and mourning countenance to one that is ioyful and mery, or contrarywiſe a ſmiling face to him that is ſorowfull, it is a falſe glaſſe and worth nothing. So is ſhe a bad wife and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, which frowneth when hir husband is deſirous to be mery with hir, &amp; to take ſome honeſt recreation: or contrarywiſe, which laugheth and ſporteth hir ſelfe when ſhe ſeeth him full of buſines and greatly troubled. For the one is a token of hir froward diſpoſition: &amp; the other, that ſhe deſpiſeth the affections of hir husband. And as lines and ſuperficiall partes, as the Geometricians ſay, mooue<note place="margin">Notable ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</note> not of themſelues, but as the bodies mooue wherein they are: ſo a wife muſt haue no proper and peculiar paſſion or affection to hir ſelf, but muſt be partaker of the paſtimes, affaires, thoughts &amp; laughters of hir husband. The farther the Moone is from the Sun, the cleerer it is, and ſhineth ſo much the more: and contrarywiſe, it hath leſſe light, &amp; is

                     <note place="margin">Euil wiues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the moone.</note> obſcuved the more, as it commeth neerer therunto: ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil women deale with their husbands when they loue not their preſence. For in their abſence you ſhall ſee them as iocund and frolick as may be, but when they are with their husbands and at home, then are they ſorowful &amp; penſiue. Moreouer, a wife muſt not truſt too much either to hir wealth, or to the nobilitie of hir race, or to hir beautie, but to that which ſetteth neereſt hir husbands hart, that is, to hir behauior, maners and conuerſation, taking order that<note place="margin">An ouerthwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wife ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hir ſelfe odious.</note> theſe things be not hard, troubleſom, or irkſom to hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band euery day, but ſuch as pleaſe him and agree with his conditions. For the troubleſome conuerſation of a wife that alwais iarreth, in the end maketh euen hir honeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior odious, as hir ouer-great pinching &amp; niggardlines cauſeth hir ſparing &amp; good huſwiferie to become hateful. As this cuſtom was obſerued amongſt the Perſians, that when their enimies came ruſhing vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with great cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, they receiued them with ſilence, &amp; contrarywiſe, if they were ſet vpon with ſilence, they made head againſt<note place="margin">How a wife muſt deale with hir cholerike husband.</note> them with ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouth: ſo diſcreet wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold their peace when their husbands cry out with choler, &amp; contrarywiſe if they vtter not a word, they labor to appeaſe and pacifie them with their comfortable ſpeeches. A wiſe woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that loueth hir husband as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth hir, ſomtime tollerateth &amp; diſſembleth an euil intreatie, truſting ſo much to hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For by diſcouering them, either ſhe ſhal make hir ſelf a laughing ſtock to others, or els giue occaſion to the enimies of hir honor, to prouoke &amp; ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit hir to naughtines. And if any one knowing the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of hir husband, vnder this pretence of ſeeing hir hardly delt withal, perſwade hir to decline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir duty, ſhe muſt anſwer him after the example of king <hi>Phillip,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wronged by the Graecians intreated them curteouſly, what then would my husband do vnto me, if I begin to

                     <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> one of the wiſe men of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, ſaid, that a houſe is not to be called good, bicauſe it is well built, and of good ſtuffe, but men muſt iudge thereof by that which is within, &amp; which belongeth to the houſe,<note place="margin">What maketh a houſe to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led good.</note> as namely, by the children, wife, &amp; ſeruants: with whome, being wiſe and well qualified, if the father of a familie communicateth, and imparteth of that which he hath, whether it be in the bottome of a caue, or vnder the ſhade of a bough, he may be ſaid to dwell in a good and happie houſe. Therefore it is no ſmall happines and felicitie for them that are called to the gouernment of a familie, when they ſee it wiſe and well nurtured in euery part. But as nerues and ſinewes, being the inſtruments of ſence and motion, proceede and are deriued from the head, which by them infuſeth into all parts of the bodie, the <hi>Animal</hi> ſpirite, without which the bodie could not exerciſe any
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:8689:277"/>
naturall function of ſence and moouing: ſo the parts of a houſe commonly receiue the habite of manners and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions<note place="margin">All good order in a houſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the head of the familie.</note> from the father of a family, as from the head ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but then eſpecially, when he is prudent and wiſe, and imploieth his care, diligence, and induſtrie thereupon. Therefore a good houſholder muſt beginne the right go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment<note place="margin">Where a houſholder muſt begin to rule his houſe well.</note> of his houſe at himſelf, by letting his houſhold ſee, that he is prudent, chaſt, ſober, peaceable, but chiefly religious and godly: as alſo by bringing foorth plentifull fruits of his dutie towards thoſe that are vnder his charge. For as the anger and threatnings of the head of a familie aſtoniſheth his children and ſeruants, ſo his good workes harteneth them on to do well. Now, bicauſe there is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of houſes, whoſe difference is commonly taken from the goods and abilitie of men, which abound to ſome, and are wanting to others, I will propound heere, as my purpoſe and meaning was before, a meane houſe, in all pointes perfect, and as we vſe to ſay, neither poore nor rich, from which notwithſtanding both great and ſmall may draw inſtruction for their gouernment. We haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſeene, that a houſe is diuided into foure partes, whereof the coniugall or wedlocke part hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie handled by vs. Now we muſt conſider of the other three, I meane of the Parentall, Maiſterlie, and Poſſeſſorie parts. And I thinke it will be beſt to follow that order which is moſt vſuall in the perfection and progreſſe of<note place="margin">The progreſſe of a familie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come to perfection.</note> mariage, and in the accompliſhment of a houſe, which, both before and after the conſummation of mariage, is firſt compounded of the goods and wealth of men: next of men-ſeruants and maid-ſeruants: and laſtly, it is made abſolute and perfect by thoſe children which God ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. The Poſſeſſorie part then is that which we call mooueable goods, immooueables, and ſuch goods as<note place="margin">What a hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholder muſt firſt looke vnto.</note> mooue of themſelues. This part of a houſe (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith) belongeth ſo to Oeconomie, that it ſhould go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and ſerue it, to the end that victuals, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie goods, might not be wanting in the houſe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in otherwiſe (ſaith the ſame Philoſopher) a man can not
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:8689:278"/>
liue, much leſſe liue well. For as in arts that haue their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits determined, it is neceſſary that conuenient and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtruments be had to finiſh their woorke: ſo muſt it<note place="margin">Goods are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the maintenance of life.</note> be in Oeconomie, in which goods are inſtruments ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to maintaine life: and to poſſeſſe goods, is nothing elſe but to haue a multitude of inſtruments ſeruing that<note place="margin">Two ſorts of goods.</note> action wherein life conſiſteth. We may diuide all theſe goods into two principall kindes: namely, into thoſe that come from the father to the ſon by ſucceſſion, which we call Patrimonie, and thoſe that are gotten by induſtrie and labor. It is the dutie of the father of a familie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that for his, which his predeceſſors left him, to haue<note place="margin">What intereſt a father of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hath in his goods.</note> the vſe thereof onely as they had, and to vſe them well, as a faithful gardian and diſpoſer of thoſe goods which God giueth for the ſuccour &amp; profit of his creatures. Yea, from that day wherin he taketh a wife, &amp; much more when he hath children, he muſt thinke that he is no more Lord of his goods, but onely a Tutor: &amp; that if they ſhould be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted or loſt through his negligence, he were no leſſe faulty than he that ſhould ſteale them. Secondly, he muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his patrimonie by trauel, care, &amp; good husbandry: he muſt get goods for his familie, by iuſt &amp; ciuill meanes, obſeruing decencie and honeſtie in all things. After the firſt functions of a holy &amp; chriſtian dutie, which are to go before, &amp; to be ioined inſeparably to al the actions of life,<note place="margin">Two ſorts of getting goods.</note> as elſe-where we haue handled, &amp; ſhal ſee more heerafter: we find two ſorts of getting, the one natural, the other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall. The naturall way conſiſteth in paſturing, or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of cattell, in tillage, in hunting &amp; fiſhing, vnto which we may ſay, that an honeſt praie and bootie, agreeable to nature, is ioined, if it be practiſed in iuſt and lawfull wars. Heerunto alſo is referred the vent and ſale of his increaſe, that thoſe things which are ſold, and whereof we haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, may procure vs from elſe-where ſuch other things as we want. The artificiall kind of getting, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in workes, artes, handicrafts, trafficke, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,<note place="margin">The end of arts, ſciences, and trafficke.</note> exerciſed for gaine. The end of which kind of getting ought to be aſwell publike profite as priuate:
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:8689:278"/>
Therefore whatſoeuer is grounded vpon domeſtical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite onely in this ſecond ſort of acquiſition, is to be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and miſliked. For whereas it was firſt brought in of neceſſitie to helpe men to liue, this were craftily to turne it to another ende, and to applie it onely to one priuate mans gaine, not without the oppreſſing and detriment of our neighbour, for whoſe benefite a man muſt labour no leſſe than for his owne. Amongſt filthie gaines, V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie<note place="margin">Biting vſurie a deteſtable gain.</note> is moſt to be miſliked and moſt deteſtable, which the Hebrewes call biting, and which doth not onelye gnaw the debtor to the bones, but alſo ſucketh out all the blood and marrow from the bones, engendring monie of monie, contrarie to nature, and to that intent for which monie was firſt brought in: namely, that exchange might<note place="margin">Why monie was firſt inuented and vſed.</note> be made of ſuch things as are vneaſie to be tranſported, and that the commoditie of trafficke might be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for publike profite. Nowe a daies there is no trade ſo common, as that of vſurie: although it be altogither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by the lawes of God &amp; men. And ſurely we haue a goodlie cloake to couer the ſhame thereof, I meane the name of<note n="*" place="margin">The queſtion of intereſt hath waightie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on both ſides.</note> intereſt, or profite of monie, when as it hath beene alwaies vnpleaſant in the ſight of God, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth all kinde of vſurie whatſoeuer it be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought not to haue any place amongſt men that liue vprightly. There was a lawe amongſt the ancient<note place="margin">An ancient law againſt vſurie.</note> Grecians and Romanes, which forbadde all vſurie ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting one pennie for a hundred by the yeere, and they called it Vnciarie Vſurie. If any Vſurer tooke greater profite, hee was condemned to reſtore foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: bicauſe (as <hi>Cato</hi> ſayth) they iudged, that a Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer was a more wicked and vile man than a theefe, who was condemned but in double as much. Againe, this lawe was ſince that brought to a halfe-penie a yeere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romanes, and not longe after, Vſurie was<note place="margin">The law Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia forbad all v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie.</note> cleane taken awaie by the lawe Genutia, bicauſe of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall ſeditions which aroſe through the contempt of lawes concerning Vſurie. Whereupon, we may note, that what moderation ſoeuer is appoynted in Vſurie, if
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:8689:279"/>
men be ſuffered to take neuer ſo little, they will aſcend to the higheſt degree of all. Therefore we muſt conforme<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 25. Deut. 23. 19.</note> our ſelues to the law of God, which taketh away all liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie heerein ſo plainly from vs, that it cannot be called into queſtion. Concerning arts exerciſed for gaine, although there are ſome of them very vile and contemptible, yet thoſe alſo after a ſort reſpect publike profite. But thoſe arts wherein there is more prudence, or no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, as Phiſicke, Architecture, and other points of knowledge in liberall arts and ſciences, are honeſt and ſeemely for them that exerciſe them according to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Now in all theſe diuers ſorts of getting, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">The praiſe of husbandrie.</note> others about which men are but too diligent, husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie is very commendable, yea, nothing is more fruitfull, nothing more pleaſant, nothing more woorthie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a free man, and nothing more agreeable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We will note therfore touching this part of a houſe, called Poſſeſſorie, that it belongeth to the dutie of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a familie to attend diligently to his houſe, careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prouide for his familie whatſoeuer is needfull &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for it, and to preſerue for the ſame that which is already gotten, onely by well vſing the poſſeſſion therof.<note place="margin">What good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie is.</note> This is that which is ſignified by the Greeke worde <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or good husbandrie: which is as much to ſay, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie in getting goods, and diſcreete gouernment in ſpending them to good purpoſe. And truly he that hath no care ouer his goods and houſhold, will be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to liue vniuſtly, and to take that which belongeth to another. For ſloth and vnwillingnes to do any thing, is the beginning and wel-ſpring of all iniuſtice. And ſo, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt a good father of a family laboreth to profit euery one, he muſt alſo be carefull for himſelfe and his. Let vs now<note place="margin">Of the Maiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie part of a houſe.</note> come to the ſecond part of a houſe, called the Maiſterlie part, which comprehendeth vnder it men-ſeruants and maid-ſeruants. If prudence and reaſon are moſt neceſſary in all parts of houſe-keeping, their effects are well woorth the nothing, and to be deſired in this part, of which we will now intreate. For power and authoritie are of themſelues
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:8689:279"/>
too ſurlie and imperious in him that knoweth not how to repreſſe them wiſely: yea, they are eaſily turned into intollerable arrogancie, if the bridle of reaſon reſtraine them not. Therfore ſeeing we liue in a free countrie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ancient abſolute power of life &amp; death ouer ſlaues hath no place, they, to whome God hath granted this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour<note place="margin">Inſtructions touching the dutie of a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter towards his ſeruants.</note> to excell, and to goe before others, whether it be in gifts of nature, or in graces of the ſoule, or otherwiſe in the goods of Fortune, they, I ſay, muſt in no wiſe contemn thoſe that ſeeme to haue beene forgotten and ſtripped of all theſe good things. Beſides, a father of a familie muſt conſider, that he ruleth not ſlaues, but free perſons. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt vſe their ſeruice, although not franckly for nothing, yet as that which commeth from a willing and free mind, not dealing roughly with them vpon euery oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but rather handling them gently, as the creatures of God made after his image: ſeeing the pooreſt man is<note place="margin">The poore and rich are both created to one end.</note> created for the ſelfe ſame principall ende that the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt and richeſt is. <hi>Aristotle</hi> granteth this, that although a Maiſter is not bound in anie reſpect to his Vaſſaile, ſo farre foorth as he is a Vaſſaile, yet, bicauſe ſlaues are men, he is of opinion, that all lawes of humanitie ought to be kept with them. What then ought we to doe to ſuch as ſubmit themſelues freely vnto vs, to whome alſo we are vnited and linked by chriſtian charitie, as to bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and inheritours of the ſame goods and promiſes? And yet we ſee that maiſters fall into bitter anger, crie<note place="margin">Againſt rigorous maiſters.</note> out, offer outrage, vſe violence, and lay handes of their ſeruants vpon ſmall or no occaſion at all, as if they were vnreaſonable creatures, yea handling them woorſe than they doe their brute beaſtes. That this is true, we ſee not one of them but he hath great care that his horſes be well fed, dailie looked vnto, harneſſed and decked. Beſides, he taketh great heede that they be not tyred, nor ouer-laboured: but as for their ſeruants, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpare nor comfort them one whit, nor haue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their eaſe and reſt. For mine owne part, I thinke that ſuch maiſters deſerue rather to be ſeazed vpon, as
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:8689:280"/>
mad men, than admoniſhed as ſociable perſons, I wiſh<note place="margin">Two properties requiſite in a maiſter.</note> therefore, that euery maiſter of a houſe had theſe two properties in him: namely, that with all clemencie and meekenes he would vſe the ſeruice &amp; obedience of them that are vnder him, by conſidering of them with reaſon, and by looking rather to the good affection and deſert of his ſeruant, than to the great and profitable ſeruice, which he draweth from him. The other point is, that the maiſter vſing the ſweate and ſeruice of his, ſhould not ſeeme to be diſpleaſed, teaſtie, or hard to content, but rather alwaies ſhewe foorth a gentle kinde of fauour and curteſie, or at leaſt a ſeuere familiaritie, ſeaſoned with a cheerefull and merrie countenance. Whoſoeuer ſhewe themſelues to be ſuch men, beſides the glorie which they ſhall obtaine by being taken generally for gentle and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men, their houſhold ſeruants will loue them the more, and will reuerence them as their fathers, not ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ſuch awe and feare of them, as men commonly doe of intollerable tyrants. Moreouer, as this aſſembly of a maiſter and of ſeruants tendeth, as euery other ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie alſo, vnto ſome good end, the maiſter hauing regard to that which concerneth him and his houſe, and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants<note place="margin">Seruants muſt not be defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of their pay.</note> to the hope of profite and commoditie; order muſt be taken, that they, which haue with all carefulnes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their dutie, and yeelded that fidelitie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that is requiſite to their ſuperiour, be not defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the price, reward, hire, and deſert of their trauels. For if we thinke it great villanie to rob another man, let vs eſteeme it nothing leſſe to keepe backe the fruite of life, and to defraud the labours, perils, watchings, and exceſſiue cares of our ſeruants, in not recompencing them. Therefore concerning this part of a houſe, called the Maiſterlie part, we will note this, that as the Ancients made their ſlaues free, thereby to drawe from them vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie and vnconſtrained ſeruice, and to deliuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of that feare and diſtruſt, which they alwaies had of their ſlaues, accounting that prouerbe true: <hi>As many enimies as ſlaues:</hi> ſo ought we to bring vp and to nouriſh
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:8689:280"/>
our hired and mercenary ſeruants, which ſerue vs in theſe daies with a free and liberall kind of loue, by dealing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly with them, by perſwading them with reaſon, and by rewarding them liberally: and this will induce them to ſerue, honour, and eſteeme vs, as if our weale and woe were wholy common with them. The laſt part of the houſe remaineth nowe to be intreated of, which is the<note place="margin">Of the Parentall part of a houſe.</note> perfection thereof, and is called the Parentall part, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending vnder it, the Father and Mother, or one of them, with the children. The head of a familie (ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle)</hi> commandeth ouer wife and children, but ouer both, as free perſons, and yet not after one and the ſame<note place="margin">The difference betweene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ouer a wife and ouer children.</note> manner of commanding, but ouer the wife, according to gouernment vſed in a popular ſtate, and ouer the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, royally or Prince-like. This commandement ouer children, is called royall, bicauſe he that begetteth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth<note place="margin">The word Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a kingl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and ſacred title</note> by loue, and by the prerogatiue of age, which is a kind of kinglie commanding. Therefore <hi>Homer</hi> calleth <hi>Iupiter</hi> the father of Men and of the Gods, that is king of all. For a king muſt excell by nature, and muſt be of the ſame kind, as it is with the aged in reſpect of the yoonger ſort, and with him that begetteth, in regard of his child, ouer whome he ought to be as carefull, as a king is ouer his ſubiectes. Vnto this part of the houſe a Father of a familie muſt haue a carefull eye, bicauſe heereuppon chiefly dependeth the honour and quietnes of his houſe, and the diſcharge of his dutie towardes God and his countrie: namely, by making his children honeſt and of good conditions. As the deſire and pricke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (ſayth <hi>Dion)</hi> driueth vs forward to beget children: ſo is it a teſtimonie of true loue and charitie, to bring them vppe, and to intreate them after a free manner, and to inſtruct them well. Therefore a Father of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie ſhall ſatisfie his dutie concerning this parte of a houſe, by the good education and inſtruction of his children, and by exerciſing them in vertue. For man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions are qualities imprinted in vs by longe tracte of tyme, and vertues are gotten by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:8689:281"/>
care, and diligence. Heereafter we are to conſider more amply and particularly of the inſtruction of youth, and therefore at this time we will content our ſelues with the giuing of certaine generall precepts, woorthie to be diligently obſerued of euery good father of a familie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his children. For in vaine (ſayth <hi>Plato)</hi> doth he hope for a harueſt, that hath beene negligent in ſowing. I ſay, he muſt be paſſing carefull, and imploie all poſſible<note place="margin">Youth is the ſeede-corne of the Common-wealth.</note> labour, that his children and youth may be well inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bicauſe they are the ſeede-corne of the citie: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that carefull heed is to be had euen of their words, geſtures, ſportes, and other actions, that nothing may leade them vnto vice. For otherwiſe if no reckoning be made of this age, a man ſhall labour no leſſe in vaine to preſcribe good lawes for them afterward, than the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition doth that miniſtreth plentie of medicines to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed partie that keepeth no diet at all. The beſt giftes<note place="margin">The giftes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſoone corrupted.</note> of nature, if they be not well trimmed and looked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, become naught at the firſt, and afterward paſſing euill. Therefore a father of a familie ought not to be more carefull of anie thing than of the bringing vp of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, according to whoſe good or euill education, the whole houſe will be gouerned. This firſt inſtitution of their life from the firſt age, is called diſcipline, which by little and little leadeth the ſpirite of the childe to the loue of vertue, euen of that vertue, whereby, beeing come to mans eſtate, he knoweth both howe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and howe to obeie, and to followe after nothing but that which the lawe commandeth and affirmeth to be good. The vices of children are ſwordes which paſſe through the hartes of their Fathers, who are for the moſte parte the cauſe of them through their negligence in correcting them, and ouer-great libertie which they graunt to this age that needeth a ſtaye and bridle, yea ſpurres, whereby to bee broken and made tractable, as men vſe to deale with yoonge Coltes. Therefore <hi>PLATO</hi> ſayde, that it is not in our owne power to cauſe our children to bee borne ſuche as wee woulde
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:8689:281"/>
haue them, but yet that it lieth in vs to make them good. Whereunto this will be a good meane, if from their yong<note place="margin">A father muſt be loued, feared, &amp; reuerenced of his children.</note> yeeres we imprint in their harts a loue, feare, &amp; reuerence of vs. For if theſe thinges concurre not togither in the childes hart, he will neuer yeeld due obedience to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſaid, that a prudent father was better to be liked than a cholerike, bicauſe prudence ſerueth to procure loue and good will in thoſe that ought to obey: whereas choler maketh them odious that command, and cauſeth their admonitions to profite but little. For this cauſe <hi>Aristotle</hi> requireth perfection of Morall vertue in a father of a familie, ſaying: that his office is a kind of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">The office of a father reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to building.</note> &amp; that reaſon is as it were the builder, by whome he guideth &amp; bringeth that Oeconomical worke to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And in deede the Ancients tooke great paines in teaching their children themſelues, not ſuffering them to be farre from their preſence during their youth: bicauſe they iudged (and that vpon good reaſon) that ſon-like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect &amp; loue were good pricks to driue them forward to<note place="margin">A child will learne better of his father than of any other.</note> the ſtudie of vertue. And no doubt but if a skilfull father would execute this dutie of inſtructing his child in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learning, he would conceiue and take it a great deale better of him than of any other. Therefore <hi>Marcus Portius Cato</hi> would needs beſchoole-maiſter to his owne<note place="margin">M.

This is very badly put in vre at this day, when the ſonne doth not onely not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor his father, but euen diſhonoreth him, and is aſhamed of him.

If he be angry, he laboureth to anger him more: brieflie, ſcarce any dutie of a child towards his father is ſeene now a daies. And if ſome point therof be found in any towards his father, yet is it cleane put out in regard of the mother: as if he that commanded vs to honour our father did not<note place="margin">The mother is no leſſe to be honoured than the father.</note> preſently ſay, <hi>and thy mother,</hi> vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in truth we owe no leſſe honor, reſpect, and obedience, than to our father, as well in regard of the commaundement of God, as of the vnſpeakable paines and trauell which ſhe ſuffered in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and bringing vs into the world, in giuing vs ſucke, &amp; in nouriſhing vs. But alas, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe that ſpoile their parents of their goods, houſes and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and deſire nothing more than their death, that they may freely enioy, euen that which oftentimes their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents haue purchaſed for them?

in ſuch ſort through our default vnto wrath, that in ſtead of bleſſing vs, they fall to curſe vs. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) there is no prayer which God heareth more willingly than that of the father for the children.

For when his father beyng priſoner ſent him worde by one of his acquaintaunce to giue no credite, nor to make account of any letters from him, if it ſo fell out that <hi>Seleucus,</hi> whoſe priſoner he was, ſhould compell him thereunto, and therefore that he ſhould not deliuer vp any of thoſe townes which he held, <hi>Antigonus</hi> contrarywiſe wrote to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that he would<note place="margin">An example of great loue in a child towards his father.</note> yeeld vp vnto him all the landes he had vnder his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and would alſo himſelfe become his pledge, if he would deliuer his father.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contrarywiſe we may iudge, that thoſe brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which loue and cheriſh one another, which ioine togither in one bond of ſelf-ſame wils, ſtudies &amp; affections, that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had diſioined &amp; ſeparated in bodies, &amp; laſtly, which haue all their talke, exerciſes, playes &amp; paſtimes common amongſt them, they I ſay vndoubtedly giue occaſion to their parents of a ſweete and happy contentation in their old-age for this brotherly loue &amp; friendſhip. For no father (ſaith <hi>Plutarke)</hi> euer loued learning, honour or ſiluer ſo much as he did his children. And therefore they neuer took ſo great pleaſure to ſee their children good orators, rich, or placed in great offices and dignities, as to ſee the loue one another. To this purpoſe one rehearſeth that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonida</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apollonida.</note> mother to king <hi>Eumenes</hi> and to three other of his brethren, accounted hir ſelfe happy as ſhe ſaid, and gaue great thanks to God, not for hir riches or principalitie, but bicauſe ſhe ſaw hir three yonger ſons, as it were a gard to their elder brother, who liued freely and moſt ſafelie in the middeſt of them with their ſwordes by their ſides, and their iauelins in their handes. Contrarywiſe, when<note place="margin">Xerxes.</note> king <hi>Xerxes</hi> perceiued, that his ſonne <hi>Ochus</hi> lay in waite for his brethren to put them to death, he died for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure thereof. Therefore <hi>Euripides</hi> ſayd, that warres betweene brethren are grieuous, but moſt of all to their<note place="margin">He that hateth his brother, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his parents.</note> parents: bicauſe he that hateth his brother and cannot abide to looke vpon him, muſt needes alſo be offended
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:8689:286"/>
with him that begate him, and hir that bare him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as good children that loue one another for the loue of their parents, are ſo much the more prouoked to loue and honour them, ſaying and thinking alwayes with themſelues, that they are bound vnto them for manie cauſes, but chiefly in regard of their brethren, who are vnto them as precious, pleaſaunt and gracious an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce as any they could receiue from them. This ment <hi>Homer</hi> to teache vs when he brought in <hi>Telemachus</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning<note place="margin">Telemachus.</note> this amongſt his calamities, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the race of his father in him, and had not giuen him a brother. Let vs not then doubt, but that this is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine demonſtration to the parents that their childe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, when he loueth his brethren. And this alſo ſerueth for as great an example and inſtruction to his children to loue one an other, as any can be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs vtterly baniſh awaye all hatred of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which is both condemned by God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth aboue all things concord vnto vs, and alſo a naughtie nurſe for the olde age of fathers and mothers, and a worſe for the yong yeeres of children. And ſeeing we are about this matter of brotherly loue, ſo precious and excellent, whereunto now adayes men haue ſo ſmall regard, I thinke we ought to inſiſt and ſtand longer vpon it, and alleage ſome precepts and examples of auncient men, whereby to confirme vs in it more and more. Firſt, nature hath bred from our birth in regard of vs the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<note place="margin">The beginning of brotherly loue is in our natiuitie.</note> and occaſion of this amitie, and hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from our iudgement all former motions to procure loue. Therefore we muſt beware that we ſeeke not too exactly after the faults and imperfections one of another, but couer &amp; beare with them, bicauſe they are of our own blood: knowing that no mans life can be ſincere &amp; clean fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all vice, ſo that we were better to ſupport the domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make trial of thoſe that are in ſtrangers. That brother (ſaith <hi>Plutark)</hi> that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with his brother, &amp; ſeeketh to procure a ſtranger to friend, ſeemeth to me to cut off voluntarily a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his

                     <note place="margin">The benefite that commeth to brethren by hauing common friends.</note> owne fleſh belonging to him, that he may apply and faſten to that place one taken from another mans body. We note alſo, that nothing more preſerueth the loue of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, than to haue the ſame common friends. For ſeueral familiaritie, conuerſation &amp; company keeping turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide &amp; alienateth them one from another, bicauſe thereby they acquaint themſelues with diuers natures, and take pleaſure in things that are contrary. But there is a further matter in it. For as tinne doth ſoder &amp; ioine togither bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken copper, by touching both ends of the broken pieces, bicauſe it agreeth as well with the one as with the other: ſo a common friend ſerueth to confirm, to preſerue, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe &amp; to reunite their mutual friendſhip and good-wil, when vpon light occaſion ſomtimes it is as it were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of breaking. Which is ſo much the more to be feared,<note place="margin">Enmitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween brethren is prodigious &amp; vnnaturall.</note> as it is certain, that all enmitie breedeth within our ſoules a thouſand paſſions that torment vs, but eſpecially that enmitie which a man beareth towards his brother, as that which is moſt prodigious and againſt nature. And as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were once ioined togither, if the glew or bande waxe looſe, may be reioined and glewed againe; but if a naturall bodie breake or rent aſunder, it is hard to find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoder that is able to reunite and knit them well togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe: ſo thoſe mutual friendſhips, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract<note place="margin">It is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reconcile brethren once fallen at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> voluntarily with ſuch as are not of kinne or allied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, if peraduenture they fall aſunder ſometimes, may eaſily be vndertaken againe, but when brethren are once eſtranged and fallen from that loue whereby nature doth neceſſarily linke them one with another, they are hardly reconciled againe togither. And if they be friendes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, yet it is alwayes with ſome diſtruſt and ſuſpicion. Queſtionles it is impoſſible but that affaires ſhould breed in theſe times wherein we liue many occaſions of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and debate betweene brethren, namely, for goods<note place="margin">How brethren muſt behaue themſelues in the partition of lands &amp; goods.</note> and ſucceſſions, as this worde of <hi>Parting</hi> importeth, and bringeth with it diuiſion, euery one being deſirous to haue his owne. But herein alſo they muſt ſuffer their matters to fight by themſelues, without adding any head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:8689:287"/>
paſſion, couetouſneſſe, or choler, which are as a hooke that taketh hold of them, and ſeeketh to ſet them togither by the eares. They muſt, as it were in a balance, conſider iointly togither on which ſide right and equitie declineth, and as ſoone as they can poſſible, let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the iudgement and deciding of their controuerſies to the arbitrement of ſome good men. Yea, a good brother ought rather to reioyce and to boaſt that he hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and gone beyond his brother, in gracious behauior, in curteſie, in voluntarily giuing of place, &amp; in euery good dutie towards him, than in the diuiſion of ſome goods. Now let vs conſider of ſome notable examples amongſt the ancients, of great brotherly loue. Although we had ſearched all hiſtories, yet could we not finde a more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable act, or woorthier to be ſet foorth at this day, and to be rather followed, eſpecially of the greater ſort, who<note place="margin">Examples of brotherly loue.</note> quarell for their poſſeſſions and reuenues, than that which fell out betweene the children of <hi>Darius</hi> monarch of the Perſians. <hi>Ariamenes</hi> the eldeſt, and <hi>Xerxes</hi> the younger, being in great ſtrife togither for the ſucceſſion of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the eldeſt alleaged his birth-right, the yonger, that he was the ſonne of <hi>Atoſſa,</hi> daughter to <hi>Cyrus</hi> the great, and that he was borne ſince his father was crowned king, and ſo next inheritour of the kingdome now that <hi>Cambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was dead. Each of them had great confederates, and many Perſian lordes were diuided into factious about this matter. But <hi>Ariamenes</hi> came out of Media, not in<note place="margin">Ariamenes.</note> armes to make warre, although hee had greate meanes thereunto, but onely with his ordinarie traine, as one that purpoſed to purſue his right by way of iuſtice. <hi>Xerxes</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Xerxes.</note> before his brothers comming, exerciſed in Perſia all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to a king: but as ſoone as his brother was arriued, he willingly put off his kingly diademe and hat, and went out to meete him and to imbrace him. After that he ſent preſents vnto him, with commaundement giuen to thoſe that bare them, to ſay vnto him in this maner: <hi>Xerxes</hi> thy brother honoreth thee now with theſe preſents, but if by the ſentence and iudgement of the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:8689:288"/>
princes and lordes of Perſia he be declared king, his will is that thou ſhouldeſt bee the ſecond perſon in Perſia after him. <hi>Ariamenes</hi> returned this aunſwere: I receyue my brothers giftes with all my harte, and thinke that the kingdome of Perſia belongeth to me: but as concerning my brethren, I will giue them that dignitie and honour that is due vnto them next to my ſelfe, and to <hi>Xerxes</hi> firſt of all. Nowe after that by their common conſent <hi>Artabanus</hi> their vncle had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided and brought to an ende their controuerſie, and adiudged the kingdome to <hi>Xerxes; Ariamenes</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aroſe from his ſeate and went to doe homage to his brother, and takyng him by the right hande, ledde him to his royall and kingly throne. From that tyme forward he was always the greateſt next vnto him, and ſhewed him-ſelfe ſo well affected towards his right, that in the Salamine battell by Sea he died, fighting vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntlie<note place="margin">Antiochus.</note> in his ſeruice. <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſurnamed the Holie, makyng warre with his Elder brother for his part in the kingdome of Macedonia, declared euen in his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all brotherly loue was not quite extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and cleane put out in him. For in the hotteſt tyme of their warre, when his brother <hi>Seleucus</hi> had loſt the battell with great deſtruction of his men, and was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to haue been dead bicauſe no newes was heard of him: <hi>Antiochus</hi> put off his purple robe, and clothed him-ſelfe in blacke, and ſhuttyng vp his pallace royall, mourned and lamented verie much for his brother. But beyng afterward aduertiſed that hee was ſafe and ſound, and preparing an other armie, hee went in open ſhewe from his lodging, and ſacrificed to the gods by way of thankeſ-giuing, commaunding the Townes that were vnder his iuriſdiction to offer the lyke ſacrifices, and to weare Hattes of flowers in token of publique<note place="margin">Athenodorus.</note> ioye. <hi>Athenodorus</hi> the Graecian hauyng a brother el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than him-ſelfe, called <hi>Zeno,</hi> who beyng conuicted of a certayne crime, had loſt all his goodes by confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, parted agayne with him all his owne goodes,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:8689:288"/>
and gaue vnto him the iuſt halfe. When the king of Lydia demaunded of <hi>Pittacus</hi> whether hee had anye<note place="margin">Pittacus.</note> goodes, yea (quoth hee) twiſe ſo much more than I woulde I had, beyng heire to my brother that is dead. The loue of that Perſian woman, of whome <hi>Plutarke</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Great loue of a Perſian woman towards hit brother.</note> maketh mention, was verie great, who beeyng asked why ſhee had rather ſaue the lyfe of hir brother than of hir owne ſonne: bicauſe (quoth ſhe) I may well haue mo children, but not more brethren, ſeeyng my Father and Mother are bothe deade. Howe much more then ought we to preferre our brethren before all other our friendes and acquaintaunce. For many may bee got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this kinde, and others if theſe fayle: but it is no more poſſible to get a newe brother, than to get an hande agayne that is cutte off, or an eye that is plucked out. <hi>Agrippa,</hi> brother in lawe to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour<note place="margin">Agrippa.</note> 
                     <hi>Augustus,</hi> vſed to ſaye, that hee was greatlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to that ſentence of Saluſt, Small thinges en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by concorde, but periſh through diſcorde: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it procured vnto him all his wealth, by ſeekyng to liue in peace and friendſhip with his brother, and with euerie one. This is that which <hi>Scilurus</hi> leauyng<note place="margin">Scilurus left 80. ſonnes behind him.</note> behind him foure-ſcore male-children, meant to teach them, and how they ſhould bee inuincible beyng ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vnited togither, by offering to each of them a bundle of dartes to breake, which when they could not doe, he brake them one after another before their eyes. I woulde further enlarge this diſcourſe with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the loue of brethren, ſhinyng greatly in ages paſt, were it not that we muſt here ſpeake ſome-what of the ductie and obedience of ſeruauntes towards their maſters, according to that order which was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs. This wee will brieflie comprehend into foure generall poyntes. The firſt is, that they muſte<note place="margin">The dutie of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in ſoure points.</note> be preſt and alwayes readie to put in execution their maſters will and commaundement, and to doe their buſineſſe moſt diligently, not beyng ſlouthfull, ſlacke and negligent, nor doyng any thing grutchingly. The
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:8689:289"/>
ſecond point is, that they muſt be faithfull vnto them, not beguiling nor defrauding them of any thing, nor affirming that before their faces to flatter them, which they will vnſay behind their backes. The third thing is, that they muſt ſeeke their maſters profite and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie more than their owne, and take good heede that no harme, loſſe, or trouble come vnto them. And if any goe about to procure any ſuch thing, they muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the defence thereof diligently, euen to the hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their liues if neede bee. The laſt point which good ſeruauntes are to keepe, is to vſe a double ſilence: the firſt, that they replie not againe to their maſters commaundementes, although ſometymes they ſuppoſe that they know better what is to be done than they that commaund them. The ſecond, that they reueale not to others their maſters ſecretes, nor ſowe them out of his houſe. To be ſhort, we cannot giue them better inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than that of Saint Paule, ſaying: <hi>Seruauntes be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3. 22. 23. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>vnto them that are your masters according to the fleſhe in all things, not with eye-ſeruice as men-pleaſers, but in ſinglenes of hart, fearing GOD. And whatſoeuer ye doe, doe it harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as to the Lorde, and not vnto men, knowyng that of the Lord yee ſhall receiue the reward of the inheritaunce: for yee ſerue the Lorde Christ.</hi> And elſe-where he exhorteth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>to be ſubiect to their masters, and to pleaſe them in all thinges not aunſwering agayne, neyther pickers, but that they ſhewe all good faithfulneſſe, that they may adorne the doctrine of GOD our Sauiour in all thinges.</hi> Nowe for examples to all<note place="margin">Examples of the loue of ſeruants towards their maſters.</note> ſeruauntes that are deſirous to effect their dutie towards their maſters, we will propound two, the one olde, the other of late yeeres, which giue ſufficient teſtimonie of a ſonne-like rather than of a ſeruile affection. <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> beyng ouercome of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and diſpairing of his<note place="margin">Eros the ſeruant of Antonius.</note> ſafetie, vrged the promiſe of <hi>Eros</hi> his ſeruant in whom he truſted, bicauſe he had giuen his faith long before that hee would kill him when he required the ſame at his hands. But the ſeruaunt drawyng his ſword, and holding it out as though hee would haue killed him, turned
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:8689:289"/>
his face on the one ſide, and thruſt it into himſelfe cleane through his bodie. <hi>Maurice</hi> duke of Saxonie beyng in<note place="margin">The ſeruant of Mauritius duke of Saxonie.</note> Hungarie againſt the Turke, and walking out of the campe onely with his ſeruaunt, was ſet vpon by certaine Turkes, and his horſe being ſlaine, he was throwen to the ground.

Therefore to ende our preſent diſcourſe, let vs learne, that it is a great and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue, and beſeeming euery good and gentle nature, to know how to obey well, and to giue honour and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to thoſe that occupie the degree of fathers, lordes, and maſters ouer vs: as alſo to loue our brethren with an indiſſoluble loue, to reuerence one an other, the younger honouring the elder, and the elder yeelding all dueties of ſincere loue to the younger. Let vs not be leſſe afrayd of the curſe repeated ſo often in the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diſobedient children, than the auncients were of that lawe which condemned them to be ſtoned to death when they would not obey the voyce of their Parents, nor harken vnto them when they inſtructed them: but let vs much more feare that puniſhment, which will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for euer, where there will be weepyng and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>

Haue we not very good occaſion to ſay with <hi>Crates</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, that it is moſt neceſſarie that one ſhould aſcend vp into the higheſt place of this kingdome, and cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude: Oh ye men, whither doe ye throwe your ſelues<note place="margin">Crates procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for theſe times.</note> headlong in taking all the paynes that may be to heape vp goodes and treaſures that periſh, and in the meane while make no reckoning of your children, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to continue long, and to grow old in ignorance which deſtroyeth them both body and ſoule, and turneth to the confuſion and ouerthrow of your country? For it is<note place="margin">Euil education corrupteth a good nature.</note> moſt certaine, that a good nature ill brought vp, waxeth very pernitious, and that the mindes and hartes of men

                     <note place="margin">Euil education corrupteth a good nature.</note> that are corruptly inſtructed, become moſt wicked. Doe you thinke (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> that execrable villanies and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible vices proceede rather of a naughtie nature, than of a noble nature corrupted with euill education? In like maner a good nature well tilled will attaine to the toppe of vertue, but if it be negligently looked vnto, it will be nothing but vice. But let vs ſee what goodly inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the auncients haue giuen concerning this matter.<note place="margin">Of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent education of children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Plato.</note> The ſame <hi>Plato</hi> was ſo carefull, and ſearched out ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the good education of children, as that which is as precious and neceſſarie a thing as any can be in the life of man, that hee taketh them euen from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, yea before they are begotten. Firſt, hee willeth that the husband and wife that are deſirous of children ſhould keepe them-ſelues from drunkenneſſe, and from entring into the bedde when they are chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike and full of trouble, bicauſe that many times is the cauſe of vices in children. Next he requireth that great<note place="margin">Women with child muſt walk much.</note> bellied women ſhould giue themſelues to walking, and beware of liuing either too delicately, or too ſparingly: that they ſhould haue quiet mindes, with many other things, which he alleageth to that purpoſe. He ſaith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that children being in their mothers wombe, receiue good and ill, as the fruites of the earth doe. After they are borne, he carefully recommendeth their education. Wee will not here ſtande vpon many pointes to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued<note place="margin">Euery mother ought to nurſe hir own child.</note> therein, as namelie vpon the choice of Nurſes, whereof fewe are ignoraunt, ſeeing it belongeth to the true and naturall office of euerie mother to nouriſh that with hir teate, which ſhe hath brought into the world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be ſome great and lawfull impediment. But let vs go on with the ſayings of <hi>Plato.</hi> He chargeth nurſes to<note place="margin">Of the bringing vp of infants.</note> lead their children oftentimes on their feete vntil they be 3. yeeres old, bicauſe this moouing is very profitable for them. He forbiddeth much crying in children, bicauſe it breedeth in them a habite and cuſtome of ſadneſſe. From<note place="margin">From 3. yeeres.</note> 3. yeeres to ſix, he would haue them moderately corrected when they commit a fault, &amp; forbidden aboue all things
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:8689:291"/>
to accuſtome them from that time forward vnto dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or to ouer-great ſeueritie, ſaying, that delicatenes maketh them froward, hard to pleaſe, cholerike, &amp; ſoone mooued: and that ſeueritie maketh them hard-harted, cruell, abiect, baſe-minded, very blocks and fooles, and<note place="margin">From ſix yeeres.</note> haters of men. At ſixe yeeres of age he would haue them put apart from the daughters, and begin to learne to ride a horſe, to ſhoote, to practiſe all kind of feates of Armes, both with the right hand and with the left: to put in vre all other exerciſes of moderate labor, that they may waxe ſtrong, and be acquainted with labour, and therefore to vſe ſuch laborious paſtimes. But he expreſly forbiddeth to change euery day for new, this age being very apt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: ſaying, that nothing is more pernitious than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint youth to deſpiſe antiquitie. But aboue all things, he commandeth that children ſhould be ſo brought vp, that they be not conſtrained to any thing whatſoeuer<note place="margin">Youth muſt be taught as it were in ſport, and not by compulſion.</note> they ſhall take in hand, but as it were in ſport, that ſo eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones nature may be knowne. Neither would he haue them beaten without great diſcretion, bicauſe it is not ſeemely that a free man ſhould learne liberall ſciences by ſeruitude and compulſion. And in truth no ſcience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon a man, will continue ſtedfaſt with him. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<note place="margin">A commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke.</note> he would haue them apply themſelues to Muſicke, both to ſing hymnes and ſongs to the praiſe of God, to laud and magnifie him, and to hope for all good ſucceſſe from him, as alſo to recreate their ſpirits. He greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liketh in them ſlouth and too much ſleepe, ſaying, that much ſound ſleepe is good neither for the bodie nor for the ſoule: that it is nothing profitable for him that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to bring any good thing to paſſe, bicauſe as long as a man ſleepeth, he doth nothing more than if he liued not. Therefore whoſoeuer deſireth to liue, and to come to knowledge, let him watch as much as he may, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard notwithſtanding to his health, which is contented with a little, when a man is once acquainted therewith. Now, bicauſe a child (as he ſaith) is more vnruly than a ſauage beaſt, he would neuer haue him left without a wiſe

It is no leſſe neceſſarie (ſaith he) to conſider what teachers a man hath, than what parents. For as children doe in a manner carie away the ſpirits of their forefathers: ſo the vices of teachers are deriued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſchollers. Therefore let ſuch be choſen as teach vs their vertue by their workes, and not ſuch as onely vtter<note place="margin">From the tenth yeere.</note> and ſpeake many goodly words ſtudied out of it. At ten yeeres, this diuine Philoſopher would haue children to learne letters vntill fifteene. But bicauſe we are to learne languages that differ from ours, it were good to beginne ſooner, and to end a little after. I thinke it were very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for youth to begin at the aboue named age of ſixe yeeres, to teach him his moother toong perfectly, that he may read, pronounce, and write it well. After, at eight yeeres, to teach him the rudiments of the Latine toong, and to let him follow that vntil it be as familiar vnto him,<note place="margin">From the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeere.</note> or little leſſe, than his natural ſpeech. At fourteene yeeres, the ſame <hi>Plato</hi> would haue children learne Arithmetike, ſaying, that it is very neceſſary both for a ſouldior, and for a Philoſopher: next, Geometrie, and that part of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie that is neceſſarie for Coſinographie, which he would haue likewiſe learned. He commandeth alſo that<note place="margin">Hunting ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of warre.</note> youth ſhould practiſe hunting, bicauſe it is as it were an image of warre, and an exerciſe that maketh men apt to ſuſtaine all labour and trauell. This inſtitution of youth is ſurely woorthie of that diuine ſpirite of <hi>Plato,</hi> and that partie were very vnhappie, and of a froward and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, who being thus diligently brought vp, would not growe to be a vertuous and good man. He putteth<note place="margin">Of the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of daughters.</note> ſmall difference betweene the education and bringing vp of daughters, and that of ſonnes, not depriuing women from publike adminiſtrations &amp; charges, but onely that he would haue them imploied about ſuch things as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire leaſt labour, and not to beginne to meddle with publike affaires, before they be fortie yeeres of age. He<note place="margin">Reaſons why women may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with publike affaires.</note> alleadgeth theſe reaſons, bicauſe often-times many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue beene more excellent than all the men of their countrie, and ſuch are dailie to be ſeene. And ſeeing they
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:8689:292"/>
haue a ſoule aſwell as we, as quicke a ſpirite, and often-times more quicke than we, (whereof thoſe women are witneſſes, who hauing giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues wholy to any thing whatſoeuer, were not inferiour, but rather went beyond many men) it were great follie in men, ſeeing God hath created man and woman with the like ſpirite, to cut off as it were the one halfe of their ſtrength, and to helpe themſelues but with a part thereof. Nowe, albeit theſe reaſons are of great waight, yet ſure it is that men and women, both by diuine and humane policie, haue their<note place="margin">Againſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in women</note> diſtinct and ſeuerall offices. It is very true, that I like not the opinion of many, who ſay, that women ought to knowe nothing, but to ſpinne and ſowe: which ſaying commeth neere to that of the Emperour, who would not haue a woman to haue more witte than is needefull for hir to diſcerne hir husbandes ſhirt from his doublet. Such opinions are fit for ignorant perſons, and proceede from a darke braine. For it cannot but be very ſeemely<note place="margin">Women muſt be able to giue a reaſon of their being.</note> and profitable for a woman to be able to render a reaſon of hir being, aſwell by the knowledge of the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as by the precepts of good life, which we haue from the Ancients. This ought parents to teach their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they may be withdrawne from all other fooliſh loue, through the loue of vertue, and be deſirous of all honeſtie and chaſtitie: as alſo, that when they are moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in good and holie mariage, they may be a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe of the good bringing vp of their children. Yea hiſtories reckon vp vnto vs a great many, that haue<note place="margin">Example of learned women.</note> beene in ſteede of Schoole-maiſters in excellent ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Aretia</hi> taught hir ſonne <hi>Aristippus</hi> Philoſophie.<note place="margin">Aretia.</note>

But let vs followe our diſcourſe of the generall inſtruction of children.<note place="margin">Of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of youth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</note> 
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſeemeth vnto mee to bee a good teacher and Maiſter, where hee ſayeth, that there are two ages, in
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:8689:293"/>
which it is neceſſarie to diuide the inſtitution of thoſe diſciplines, which we would haue our children learne: namely, from ſeuen yeeres vntill foureteene, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the age of pubertie: and againe from this age vntill<note place="margin">Two things to be reſpected in the inſtitution of youth.</note> the one &amp; twentieth yeere. He ſaith, that in the inſtitution of youth, two things muſt be looked vnto: the one, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in children are to be inſtructed, the other, how they ought to be inſtructed. For all men are not agreed of this, what things children are to learne, neither yet is it decided, or reſolued vpon, to what end their inſtitution ought to be directed, whether to profite, or to manners, or to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and contemplation, which proceedeth from the variable opinions of men, who place their end in diuers<note place="margin">The end of all ſtudies.</note> things. But how ſoeuer it is, we muſt, as we ſaid before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all our ſtudies to the glorie of God, and to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of our neighbours, in liuing well according to thoſe charges and vocations whereunto we may be called. We haue already ſeene the diuiſion of ſciences and arts, and ſpoken of thoſe that are moſt neceſſarie for a happie life.<note place="margin">Ariſtotle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that children ſhould learne foure things. Of Grammer.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> following the cuſtome then vſed in Grecia, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that children ſhould learne foure things, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, bodilie exerciſe, Muſicke, and painting: for certaine commodities meete for the life of a man. Grammer is the entire to all ſciences, whereby we learne to ſpeake exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">The commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof.</note> alſo to read and to write. And this is neceſſarie for all eſtates of life, whether publike or priuate, in peace or in warre, in a quiet life, or in multitude of buſines, for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice, for the guiding of a houſe, for the obtaining of knowledge, for the continuance and perpetuitie of the memorie of man. Briefly, as nature is the cauſe of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo the knowledge of letters, which Grammar tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, worketh in vs the knowledge how to liue well. For this cauſe <hi>Charondas</hi> the law-maker, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Sicilian writeth, preferred Grammer before all other ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as that which is moſt neceſſarie for mans life, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing<note place="margin">A notable law for the common inſtruction of children.</note> that all the children of his citie ſhould learne their letters at the charges of the common-wealth, which was to maintaine publike maiſters to teach both poore

and rich. Truly this law ought to be put in practiſe in all the townes of this kingdome, to reſiſt that pernitious Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra of ignorance, which the richer ſort defend, making no account of knowledge, to the treading downe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the poore, who would gladly haue the meanes whereby they might be inſtructed. The Gymnaſtical part<note place="margin">Of Gymnaſtick, or bodilie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</note> was that arte, which, as the Ancients affirmed, did ſerue for health and ſtrength, preparing the bodies of children by honeſt and moderate exerciſes, as fencing, ſhooting, throwing of a ſtone, riding, wraſtling, running, leaping, ſwimming, and ſuch like. Theſe according to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, are to be moderately practiced by children, vntill they be foureteene yeeres old, exerciſing them lightly, &amp; not with forced labors, that their growth be not hindred thereby. This age being paſt, after they haue beſtowed three yeeres in other Morall diſciplines, and followed their ſtudies in deeper ſciences, vntill the one and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yeere, then may they be exerciſed with more ſharpe<note place="margin">The end of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke.</note> and hard labors of the body.

Let them alſo knowe howe to drawe platformes of publike and priuate buildings, to ſet foorth countries, townes, and caſtels, their height, breadth, and length for the warre: liuing creatures of all ſortes, with their parts, herbs, trees, rootes, leaues, flowres, fruits for medicine, &amp; for the knowledge of ſimples. In this inſtitution of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had reſpect to that which was conuenient, &amp; drew neereſt to the forme of a happie Commonwealth eſtabliſhed by him, and to that which was neceſſary for the preſeruation and maintenance thereof. Nowe, let vs apply to our vſe that which we may learne both of him, and of the reſt of the Ancients, for the framing of yoong men to honeſty and vertue: leauing to the libertie of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to make choice of thoſe arts and ſciences wherein

The firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. The firſt thing that youth muſt learne, is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God.</note> if we obſerue and vſe theſe fower things, <hi>Instruction, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, Promiſe, Praiſes, and Threatnings.</hi> We will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all <hi>Instruction</hi> vnder ſixe precepts. The firſt ſhall be to ſhewe vnto children, that they muſt worſhip God, and honour him chiefly and aboue all things, referring all their thoughts and deedes to the glorie of his name: that it is he that hath created and preſerueth all things, that he ſuffereth no wickednes to paſſe vnpuniſhed, nor good worke vnrewarded, but giueth eternall happines to good men, and euerlaſting paine and puniſhment to them that<note place="margin">We can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the grace of God.</note> are euill. Let them knowe that without his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour they can doe nothing, no not ſo much as liue one moment: and therefore that they muſt continually and before euery worke call vpon him, and beware that they offend him not by neglecting his commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which<note place="margin">2. The ſecond precept.</note> for this cauſe they muſt diligently learne. The ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction<note place="margin">Youth muſt not glorie in tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric goods.</note> which I finde moſt neceſſarie for youth, is to teach them not to glorie in earthlie and worldlie goods, but to learne rather to deſpiſe them, and to tranſport the loue of the bodie and of carnall goods, which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, to the loue of the ſoule and of eternal goods, which<note place="margin">Nor in bodilie beautie.</note> properly belong vnto them. They muſt not make great account of the beautie of the bodie, which hauing inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within it the ſoule that is defiled with vice and ſinne, is nothing elſe but a pretious and proud ſepulcher, vnder which is contained a ſtinking and putrified carrion. They muſt not put their hope and confidence in riches, but be perſwaded that they are rich and happie, if they be wiſe, learned, and vertuous. And whileſt their vnderſtanding is good and in vigour, and themſelues haue time, they muſt put all their ſtrength to the obtaining of that which<note place="margin">The fruits of true knowledge and vertue.</note> will be profitable vnto them in their olde age: namely of knowledge and vertue, which will procure vnto them, honour, ſafetie, praiſe, happines, reſt, and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in their life time, and will in the ende guide them to
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:8689:294"/>
eternall life, to be made coheires of the kingdome of heauen with Ieſus Chriſt. Thirdly, they muſt be taught<note place="margin">3. The third pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</note> to eſchewe and flie from all ſuch thinges which they ſee are hurtfull to others, and learne to be wiſe by their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and perils. Nowe, that which marreth and hurteth<note place="margin">The common diſeaſes of youth.</note> others, is diſobedience, lying, pride, infidelitie, naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, hazarding games, whoredome, drunkennes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, idlenes, and euill companie. Againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of which vices, no better preſeruatiue can be had, than to ingraue modeſtie in their hartes, by the rule and<note place="margin">Modeſtie is the beſt remedie for them.</note> meaſure whereof they may eaſily be directed to behaue themſelues vertuouſly. For this cauſe <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſayth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry elegantly, that the fooliſh opinion and preſumption, which yoong men commonly conceiue of themſelues, ought rather to be emptied, than the ayre wherewith bottles and Kiddes skinnes are puffed vp when any good thing is to be put into them. Otherwiſe, being full of the winde of ouer-weening, they receiue none of that good inſtruction which men thinke to powre into them. For the fourth precept of their inſtruction, we will ſet<note place="margin">4 The fourth precept hath fower branches.</note> downe theſe fower thinges, which will ſtande them in great ſteede towards the attayning of a happie life. <hi>Let</hi>

For this cauſe we reade that the olde men of Rome vſed at feaſtes to ſinge the famous actes of their Anceſtours before

                     <note place="margin">6 The ſixt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</note> their youth. For the ſixt and laſt precept, we ſay, that it is needfull for youth to be vſed to labour and weariſomnes, to keep them from idlenes, and from falling into any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt pleaſure. We haue ſeene what exerciſes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes are meete for them, according to the opinion of the Ancients: and at this daye we knowe howe to make choice of them, as ſhall be meeteſt for the nobilitie. Now, to ſpeake briefly of the other three generall precepts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Of admonition.</note> by vs for the inſtitution of youth: <hi>Admonition</hi> is very neceſſarie for that age. For although youth be well borne and brought vp, yet hath it ſuch actiue and vehement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations, that it is eaſily brought to ſtumble. Wherfore yoong men muſt be often admoniſhed of their dutie, and ſpoken vnto of honeſtie, and of vertuous men, bicauſe words mooue their minds. The ſteps of their honeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors are to be laid before their eies, to induce them<note place="margin">Of promiſes. Youth is to be drawne on with the promiſes of eternall life.</note> to follow their paths. And aboue all things, the promiſe of that life, which is eternally happie for thoſe that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in vprightnes and iuſtice, is to be propounded vnto them. O man well affected (ſaith <hi>Horace)</hi> go ioifully whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy vertue leadeth thee, and thou ſhalt reape great rewards for thy deſerts. O ye yoong men (ſaith <hi>Plautus)</hi> walke on in that way wherein vertue will direct you, and ye ſhall be very well recompenced. For he that hath ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, hath all thinges neceſſarie for him, and wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Theſe are the promiſes which ought to be beaten into the harts of children: adding further to them that are very yoong a promiſe to giue them what they will, ſo that they learne well that which is taught them. Laſt of<note place="margin">Of praiſes and threatnings.</note> all, praiſes and threatnings muſt be added, by commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding children when we ſee them profit in vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, to encourage them to go forward, and to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; better. Glorie (ſaith <hi>Ouid)</hi> giueth no ſmall ſtrength to the mind, and the deſire and loue of praiſe, cauſeth the hart to be reſolute and readye to vndertake all things. <hi>Quintilian</hi> would haue yong men praiſed, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte, and are willing to learne, as likewiſe they are to be threatned, if they be ſlothfull and negligent in the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:8689:295"/>

And if they amend not with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, they muſt haue good diſcipline and correction vſed towards them, and be chaſticed with diſcretion. To this purpoſe <hi>Plutark</hi> ſaith, that the hope of reward, and feare<note place="margin">Hope and feare are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertue.</note> of puniſhment, are as it were the two elements and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of vertue. For hope maketh yoong men prompt and readie to vndertake all good and commendable things, &amp; feare maketh them ſlowe in preſuming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch things as are vile and full of reproch. So that if we practice diligently theſe precepts in the education &amp; inſtruction of our children: there is no doubt, but as ſeales and ſignets doe eaſily make a print in ſoft waxe, ſo we may quickly caſt in the mindes of little children, as it were in a mould, whatſoeuer we would haue them learne for the leading of a good and happie life, to the glorie of God, the profit of their neighbours, and diſcharge of our conſciences which are bound thereunto.</p>

                  <p>It cannot be denied, that place and time are a great helpe to honeſtie and vertue: inſomuch, that if we conſider not of them the knowledge and practiſe of that which belongeth to our dutie, cannot greatly profit vs.<note place="margin">Place and time are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all things.</note> For all things are to be applied in time &amp; place, and ſome thinges are decent and lawfull vpon one occaſion, which would be very vnſeemely in another.

<pb n="563" facs="tcp:8689:296"/>
honeſty are alwaies requiſite in a man, bicauſe it is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ornament of his life: yet in diuers ages diuerſity of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt behauior is required, &amp; the ſelfe ſame things are not decent in them, but ſome kind of behauiour is proper to<note place="margin">All kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> the age of childhood, ſome to youth, and another to old age, bicauſe as nature altereth with age, ſo it behooueth that maners ſhould chang. Now, among them that haue moſt diligently obſerued the ſecrets of mans nature, there hath beene two ſundry opinions concerning the diuiſion of the ages of man. Some haue made 7. parts, adding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepite<note place="margin">Of the diuiſion of the ages of man.</note> or bed red-age after old age: &amp; they would grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their principal reaſon of this diuiſion vpon this, that the<note place="margin">The number of ſeuen accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a perfect number.</note> number of 7. is an vniuerſall &amp; abſolute number. So we reckon 7. planets, whoſe motion worketh all generations &amp; corruptions in the earth. By a ſtronger reaſon therfore this number of ſeuen wil be applied to the continuance of time. Moreouer, the growth of men according to age, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth at the ſeuenth number. For teeth are bred in the ſeuenth moneth, &amp; in the ſeuenth yeere they change &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Beſides, in the ſame yeere doubled, that is in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeere, man receiueth abilitie of ſeede, that is to ſay, of engendring. True it is, that the number of ſix worketh alteration in females. Yet the number of 7. in other things worketh augmentation, or elſe the reſt and quietnes of men, and ſheweth the difference or iudgement of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The whole time of the creation of the world is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended therein, &amp; likewiſe the reſt and ceaſing of the worke-maiſter thereof. All the ancient writers haue alſo noted, that the number of 63. which is the multiplication of ſeuen by nine, carieth with it commonly the end of old men: bicauſe that in the whole courſe of our life we liue vnder one onely climate, which is either from ſeuen, or<note place="margin">Of the climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall yeere of 63.</note> from nine yeeres, except in the yeere of 63. wherein two terminations or climates ende, that is to ſay, nine ſeuen times ſeuen, or ſeuen nine times nine: and therefore this yeere is called climactericall, wherein we may note out of hiſtories the death of many great men, and the change of eſtates and kingdomes. As touching the other diuiſion
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:8689:297"/>
                     <note place="margin">The whole age of man diuided into ſix parts. Of Infaucie.</note> of the age of man into ſixe parts onely, of which opinion <hi>Iſidorus</hi> is, we will now enter into the particular handling thereof. The parts are theſe: Infancie, Childhood, Youth, Adoleſcencie, Virilitie, &amp; old age. Infancie is the firſt age of man, beginning after his natiuitie: &amp; it is ſo called, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at that time he hath no vſe of ſpeech, and therefore<note place="margin">Of Childhood.</note> cannot then learne manners and vertue, hauing no ſence or vnderſtanding to comprehend them. Childhood is, when children beginne to ſpeake; albeit as yet they haue not the full vſe of reaſon: in which eſtate a man may ſay they are vntill the age of ſeuen yeeres, during which time fathers and mothers ought to nouriſh and bring them vp in the feare of God, &amp; reuerence of their parents, &amp; frame them gently vnto all good maners, as we haue already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. This age is called of the Latines <hi>Pueritia,</hi> as it were pure and neate from<note n="*" place="margin">He meaneth not common &amp; naturall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offences.</note> ſinne: foraſmuch as children haue then no vſe of diſcretion, ſo that iudgement cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to their works, wherby they may be called good or euill. Youth is reckoned from ſeuen yeeres of age vntill foureteene, at which time children ought to be deliuered vnto skilfull and honeſt maiſters &amp; teachers, to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.<note place="margin">Two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a Schoolemaiſter, skill, and bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of life.</note> Then muſt parents looke well whether thoſe two things are in them, to whoſe direction they commit the keeping of ſuch a pretious pledge: leaſt that befall them, which <hi>Hyperides</hi> an Orator of Grecia ſaid to one who told him that he had ſent a ſlaue with his ſon to gouerne him, <hi>you haue</hi> (quoth he) <hi>done very wel: for in ſteede of one ſlaue, you ſhall receiue twaine.</hi> Therefore it is very neceſſarie that ſuch maiſters ſhould be choſen for them, as are learned and of<note place="margin">The benefit that commeth by good Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters.</note> good life &amp; conuerſation, that, as good Gardiners ſticke downe certain props hard by yong plants to keepe them vpright: ſo wiſe teachers may plant good inſtructions &amp; precepts about yoong men, that their maners may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to vertue. Let fathers beware leaſt being mooued with couetouſnes, they make choice of maiſters vnworthy their charge, that they may pay the leſſe ſtipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſeking for good cheape ignorance: ſeeing that (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beare away as it were the minds of their progenitors,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:8689:297"/>
ſo the vices of the Schole-maiſters flow vpon their ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. At this age of youth the children of Rome did hange<note place="margin">A ſtrang cuſtom vſed by the children of Rome.</note> in the Temple a little coller or iewell which they ware a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks, during the time of their infancie, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring therby that they renounced all childiſhnes, and that they were to chang their maners for the time to come. In token wherof one gaue them a white robe, and a purple coate, to teach them by the white colour to ſhunne vices, which made the ſoule blacke, and by the purple, to ſtriue to make their life gliſter and ſhine with good manners and vertue. And it ſeemeth that the Latines called this<note place="margin">The reaſon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We ſaw before ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently what is further required of this age, in regard of their inſtruction. Adoleſcencie is the fourth age of man, beginning at the foureteenth yeere, and continuing vntil<note place="margin">Of adoleſcencie</note> the 28. and it is deriued of this verbe <hi>Adoleſco,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to growe. For then doe men growe in bodie, in ſtrength, and reaſon, in vice, and vertue. And at that age the nature of a man is knowne, and whereunto he ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his minde, which before could not be diſcerned by reaſon of the ignorance of his age. This is that which <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> ſaith, that the ſtudies vnto which we addict our ſelues in the time of our adoleſcencie, like to herbes and fruites that are come to their faſhion, declare what vertue there will be in time of ripenes, and what manner of harueſt wil follow. Therefore yoong men (ſaith this Father of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) muſt make choice of one certaine kind of life, whereunto they are to giue themſelues all their life time without any manner of contradiction, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant therein, they muſt draw all their actions to that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end, as an arrow is drawne towards a white. But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much<note place="margin">The fruits of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doleſcencie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left to it ſelf.</note> as in the corruption of our time we ſee poore fruits of this age when it is left to it ſelfe, we may well ſay, that in this ſeaſon of adoleſcencie, children haue greateſt neede to be gouerned, ruled, and kept in great awe. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to pleaſures, and the eſchewing of labour, which
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:8689:298"/>
are naturall in man, commonly begin then to aſſault him with ſuch violence, that if yoong men be not well follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they quickly turne to vice, hate thoſe that giue them good inſtruction, become preſumptuous, and ready to leaue that which before they loued: and taking no care for the time to come, like beaſts ſeeke for nothing but to ſatisfie their luſtfull deſires. For this cauſe that good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour<note place="margin">Aurelius exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his ſonnes gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> 
                     <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſaid to thoſe vnto whome he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his ſon after his death. Beware that he bathe not himſelfe in ſlipperie pleaſures and deſires, ſeeing it is a hard matter to moderate and to ſtay the burning affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a yoong man, eſpecially when he ſeeth in his own hand a licence not limited, which offereth vnto him all kind of contentation. And truly this vnbrideled licence of not being in ſubiection to any, which yoong men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ſeeke after ſo earneſtly, and for want of right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, falſly call and imagine it to be libertie, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them in bondage to ſeuerer and ſharper maiſters, than were thoſe teachers &amp; Schoole-maiſters which they<note place="margin">Concupiſcence raigneth moſt in Adoleſcencie.</note> had in their infancie: namely, to their luſts and diſordred deſires, which are then as it were vnchained and let looſe. But he which knoweth, that to follow God, and to obey right reaſon, are reciprocall and neceſſarily following ech other, muſt thinke that to leaue his infancie &amp; firſt youth, and to enter into the ranke of men, is no freedome from ſubiection, but only a chang of commandement: bicauſe our life in lieu of a hired maiſter, who gouerned vs before,<note place="margin">Who are to be accounted free.</note> hath then a heauenly guide, that is, reaſon, to whome they onely that obey, are to be reputed &amp; taken for free men. For after they haue learned to will that which they ought, they liue as they will, whereas the freedome of the will in diſordred actions and affections is ſmall, feeble, &amp; weake, and mingled with much repentance. Theſe are thoſe good reaſons, which ought to ſound often in the eares of yoong men, and be ſupplied by little &amp; litle through the ſtudy of good letters, &amp; Morall Philoſophie of ancient men, vntill they haue wholy in poſſeſſion that place of maners, which is ſooneſt mooued, and moſt eaſily led, &amp; are lodged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

by knowledge and iudgement, which will be as a gard<note place="margin">Knowledge and iudgement are the gard of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcencie.</note> to preſerue and defend that age from corruption. Vnto which things the Ancients looked very diligently, both to repreſſe boldnes, which commonly is the companion of adoleſcencie, and alſo to chaſtice their faults ſeuerely.<note place="margin">Catoes ſonne baniſhed for breaking an earthen pot.

Therefore if a yoong man be well guided with reaſon, he will chuſe &amp; propound to himſelfe that kind of life, which he purpoſeth to keepe vntill death, and begin ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable life that is had in recommendation among ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men. The ancient Romanes minding to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration<note place="margin">How the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes taught their yoong men to forſake the follies of their firſt age.</note> heereof, when their children were come to that age, they brought them to the common market place clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a mans gowne, and cauſed them to ſcatter nuts heere and there, &amp; after that to forſake all play: ſignifieng therby, that they muſt leaue the follies of their firſt age, to imbrace more graue and ſerious matters.

That great Monarch <hi>Alexander</hi> in his youth deſpiſed all kind of pleaſure and delight, eſchewed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, contemned monie, and all plaies and paſtimes that were vnprofitable, and to no good vſe, louing nothing but vertue and glorie gotten thereby. This was the cauſe why, being demanded whether he would not be preſent at the feaſt of the Olympian games, to try if he could win the price of running, ſeeing he was well made, and woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull light of foote, he anſwered. yes, if they were kings that ran. Whenſoeuer he heard newes that his father had taken any famous Towne, or wonne ſome great battell, he ſhewed no token of ioye, but ſaide to his equals in yeeres: My Father, Sirs, will take all, and leaue no goodlie and great matter for me to doe, and to conquere with you. Among other his commendable giftes of nature, which men admired in him at that age, he was greatly praiſed for a good horſe-man, which he ſhewed full well<note place="margin">Bucephalus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders horſe.</note> when <hi>Bucephalus</hi> the horſe was brought to his father, and was to be ſold for thirteene Talents, that is in value 7800. crownes: which the yeomen of the kings horſe perceiued to be ſo skittiſh and wild, that they durſt not vndertake to breake him. But <hi>Alexander</hi> mounted on him, and handled him ſo cunningly, that all thoſe that were preſent, cried out by way of admiration: and <hi>Phillip</hi> kiſſing him, ſaid: Oh my ſonne, thou muſt ſeeke out a kingdome that is meete for thee, for Macedonia is not able to containe thee.

When he was yet verie yoong, he committed an

act of a wiſe and aduiſed captaine, being in the Romane armie whereof <hi>Strabo</hi> his father was captaine againſt <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> For when the ſouldiers began to rebel and to conſpire the death of their captaine, <hi>Pompey</hi> diſcouered the ſame, and tooke order for his fathers ſafetie. After, perceiuing that the ſouldiers truſſed vp bag and baggage to go yeeld themſelues to <hi>Cinna,</hi> he thruſt himſelfe into the middeſt of them, beſeeching them moſt humbly with teares in his eies, not to deale ſo groſely with their captain. In the end when he ſaw that they perſiſted in their opinion, he threw himſelfe proſtrate all along ouerthwart the gate of the campe, ſaying vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if they were ſo deſirous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, both they and their horſes ſhould go ouer his body. Whereupon they were ſo aſhamed, that chaunging their mindes, euery one betooke him againe to his quarter, and reconciled themſelues vnto their generall. The prudence of <hi>Papyrius</hi> deſerueth to be alleaged here, who according<note place="margin">Papyrius.</note> to the cuſtome of the young gentlemen of Rome, was brought into the Senate, after he had put on the gowne wouen about with purple which they vſed to giue to yong men, to the end to frame them by litle and litle to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of affaires. In his returne from the Senate, which was longer in breaking vp than vſually they were woont to do, his mother asked him the cauſe thereof. And after many threatnings and compulſions, <hi>Papyrius</hi> not willing to reueale the ſecret of the councell, as it had been expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden him, bethought himſelfe of a ſubtill lie, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Senators were in great contention whether it were more expedient to agree that one man ſhould haue two wiues, or one woman two husbands: which (quoth he) ſhalbe determined to morow. His mother beleeuing it, told the ſame to the Romane ladies hir companions, who met all the next day at the entrie of the Senate, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the iudges to giue a fauourable ſentence for them.

But herein he agreeth with vs, that the perfection of mans ſtrength beginneth at 29. yeeres, where we ſaid that adoleſcencie ended. In this ſtrength a man continueth vntil 50. yeeres, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to grow weake, and to decline continually vntill<note place="margin">The dutie of a man at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his age.</note> death. The whole age of virilitie ought to be full of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and vertue, &amp; to bring foorth the effects of prudence, temperance, fortitude and iuſtice, whereof we haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed at large. And if any man before he came to this age, had not that education and inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him (whereof we haue alreadie diſcourſed) by reaſon of his fathers neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or through the licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of adoleſcencie, then eſpecially is he to take the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between his teeth in good earneſt, bicauſe yet there is good time &amp; ſeaſon, yea oportunitie of great fruit, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in learning and vertue, ſo that he cannot alleage this<note place="margin">Clitomachus.</note> excuſe, that he was not inſtructed in youth. <hi>Clitomachus</hi> of Carthage, when he was aboue 40. yeeres of age, came to Athens to learne vnder <hi>Carneades,</hi> with whom he profited ſo well, that after his death he ſucceeded in his place and taught others. <hi>Lucius</hi> being at Rome, and meeting with<note place="margin">M.

It becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euen an old man (quoth he) to learne. I am goyng (ſaid he) to <hi>Sextus</hi> the Philoſopher, to learne that which I know not.

The ſixt and laſt age of man is called Old-age, which according to <hi>Marcus Varro,</hi> and other authors, beginneth at 50. yeeres, bicauſe at this age the naturall power and ſtrength of man beginneth to decline and fade away. <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>

But as neither the diuiſion of ages here ſet downe, nor the termes wherein we haue encloſed them, could agree to the ages of our firſt fathers, either in the firſt or ſecond age, wherin they liued commonly as manie yeeres as we do moneths, ſo conſidering the ſhortneſſe of our days, which the Pſalmiſt limiteth within 80. yeeres at<note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 10.</note> the moſt, I think we are to folow the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Varro,</hi> who calleth old-age whatſoeuer is aboue 50. yeeres.

And albeit that men now a dayes greatly abuſe thoſe charges, yet ſurely they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to olde men, to whome it appertaineth to gouerne townes, to adminiſter iuſtice, and to be a paterne and example of honeſtie to the younger ſort. For then haue they no time to take their eaſe, but (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) they muſt encreaſe the exerciſes of the ſoule, as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the labours of the bodie.

But ciuil ordinance muſt carefully prouide, that the true ſeruice of God be not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely violated and polluted through an vncontrouled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, eſpecially conſidering that the conſeruation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery well ordered policie dependeth thereupon. But we ſhal vnderſtand this matter more at large hereafter in the<note place="margin">Euery eſtate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now to goe on with that which was propounded vnto vs, let vs ſpeake of thoſe kindes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments which were amongſt the ancients. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a citie, or order amongſt magiſtrates, eſpecially amongſt them that had the ſoueraigne rule ouer all, was called of the ancients, <hi>Common-welth,</hi> or as ſome others wil haue it <hi>Weale-publike,</hi> which in hir kind of gouernment was named<note place="margin">When com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths are right, and when corrupt.</note> according to the qualitie of the chiefe rulers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And thoſe common-wealths that tended to common benefit were ſaid to be right, &amp; ſimply iuſt: but if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the profit of the ſuperiors only, they were ſaid to be corrupt, &amp; were called tranſgreſſions of right commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealths, theſe being the cauſe of as much euil to the whole
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:8689:304"/>
body of the city, as the others are of <hi>Good.</hi> For as the good or euill of an houſe dependeth of the father of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the ſafetie or loſſe of a ſhip, of the Pilote or maſter, the<note place="margin">The good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil eſtate of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths dependeth of the magiſtrates next vnder God.</note> good or ill ſucceſſe of an army, of the generall thereof: ſo the happines or vnhappines of townes and peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of the magiſtrates, and yet ſo that God ruleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all. Common-wealths then are either good or bad,<note place="margin">The diuiſion of common-welths in generall.</note> right or corrupted. That is a good common-welth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the gouernours ſeeke the publike profit of the citizens, &amp; the benefit of the whole ciuil ſocietie. It is called right and iuſt, bicauſe it hath ſuch an end, and ſeeketh after the ſame, taking no counſell about any thing, but only about the preſeruation of iuſtice. A corrupt common-wealth is that which repugneth and is directly contrary to that which is good and iuſt, &amp; chiefly to the end therof. For it ſeeketh only the increaſe of priuate commoditie, hauing no care of publike profit. There are 3. kinds of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,<note place="margin">The ſubdiuiſion of them.</note> and 3. of bad, whoſe gouernment alwayes conſiſteth in the ſuperiors of the eſtate, taking their appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and name of them, as hath been ſaid. The firſt kind of good common-wealths is a Monarchie, which taketh<note place="margin">Of a monarchie.</note> place whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſoueraigntie is in one alone. This reſpecting publike profit onely, and preferring common benefit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before hir own priuate and particular commoditie, taketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir the name of a kingdom, or of kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But if ſhe looke vnto his particular benefit that ruleth, ſeeking to raign by an abſolute wil without any obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iuſt laws, then ſhe hath the name of tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie, which is<note place="margin">Of a tirannie.</note> the firſt bad kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-welth. Now foraſmuch as we liue in this kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder this firſt kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-welth, called a kingly monarchie, we wil dilate this matter, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thereof at large in a ſeueral treatiſe, that we may the better know the excellencie of it, when it is wel &amp; iuſtly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. The ſecond kind of a right &amp; good commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-welth is of a Greek word called an Ariſtocratie, which in our la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage<note place="margin">Of an Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and what it ſignifieth.</note> we may interprete, <hi>the power of the beſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we cal in latine <hi>optimates,</hi> bicauſe they are accounted for the beſt &amp; moſt vertuous men. This forme of gouernment taketh
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:8689:305"/>
place when a few tried and approoued men for maners and learning haue the ſoueraigntie iointly togither, and make lawes for the reſt of the people, whither it be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally or particularly, directing their thoughtes to no other marke than to publique vtilitie and profite. This was ſeene moſt excellently among the Lacedemonians,<note place="margin">The Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian eſtate was an excellent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> whoſe common-wealth ſurpaſſed all others of hir time, as well for hir policie and eſtabliſhment, whereof there was neuer the like, and wherein ſhe continued about 500. yeeres, as alſo for the glorie of hir warlike actes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe helde the empire of Graecia a long tyme, vnder the lawes of that happy Ariſtocraticall gouernment, which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> eſtabliſhed there. This man ſeeyng their eſtate to incline one while to tirannie, when the kings had too much power, and an other while to popular confuſion, when the common people beganne to vſurpe too great<note place="margin">Why the Senate of Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.</note> authoritie, deuiſed with him-ſelfe to giue them a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoize, that ſhould be healthfull for the whole bodie of the Common-wealth, by eſtabliſhing there a Senate, which was as a ſtrong barre, holding both the extremities in equall balaunce, and giuing firme and ſtedfaſt foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their eſtate. For the 28. Senators making the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Senate, ſometimes tooke part with the two kings who were depriued of all ſoueraigntie, ſo far foorth<note place="margin">What power the kings of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia had.</note> as was thought needfull to reſiſt the raſhneſſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and contrarywiſe, ſometimes they ſtrengthened the peoples ſide againſt the kings, who had then but the voyces of two Senatoures in the councell, thereby to keepe them from vſurping any tyrannicall power. True it is that their eſtate was not purely Ariſtocraticall, vntill one hundred yeeres after the firſt eſtabliſhment thereof by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> bicauſe hee had left the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and abrogation of the aduice and decrees of<note place="margin">The policie of Polydorus and Theopompus to get the power out of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hands.</note> the Senate in the peoples power. But <hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Theopompus</hi> beyng kinges, and ſeeyng how hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was to aſſemble all the people togither, and how they ouerthrew many tymes the ſacred decrees of the Senate, holpe them-ſelues with an oracle from <hi>Apollo,</hi>
                     <pb n="581" facs="tcp:8689:305"/>
whereby it was ſignified that the Senate of thirtie ſhould from thence-forth haue all power in matters of eſtate, in ſo much that of Senators they became ſoueraigne lordes. And to content the people, they appointed fiue Ephories<note place="margin">Why the Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That policie then is truely Ariſtocraticall, wherin vertue only is reſpected in the diſtribution of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracies, and the benefit of the ſubiects is chiefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the gouernment thereof. <hi>Oligarchie</hi> is oppoſite<note place="margin">Of an Oligarch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> and contrary to this, and is the ſecond kinde of a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted common-wealth. This is when a few noble or riche men occupie the authoritie and adminiſtration of the common-wealth, reiecting the poorer and baſer ſort, and aiming at nothing but at their owne priuate and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar profite, without all care of publique commoditie. Theſe men alwayes vſe to take part with their like in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie or riches, to the treading downe and oppreſſion of the meaner ſort of people. Moreouer, they rule all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters according to their affections, and through ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and couetouſnes take them into their own hands, vntil<note place="margin">How an Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie is changed into a tirannie, with examples thereof.</note> ſome one that is mightieſt amongſt them, find the means to rule abſolutely, and to change the Oligarchie into a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth that all the auncient gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Sicilia were Oligarchies, among which that of the Leontines was tranſlated into the tirannie of <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> that of <hi>Gela</hi> into the tirannie of <hi>Cleander,</hi> that of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium</hi> into the tirannie of <hi>Anaxilas,</hi> and ſo of many others. The third kind of a good and right common-wealth is of a Greeke worde called Timocratie, which we may call<note place="margin">Of a Timocraty.</note> 
                     <hi>The power of meane or indifferent wealth.</hi> This kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nernment was after a peculiar ſort called of the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents by the name of <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> bicauſe this policie tended moſt of all to publique profite, and was guided by lawes, and<note n="*" place="margin">His meaning is, that it is ruled by ſome lawes taken from ccb of theſe.</note> compounded of an Oligarchie and a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie, which are two extremes, and of themſelues vicious and corrupt. For of their mediocrities this forme of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was inſtituted after 3. ſortes. Firſt, by taking the lawes and inſtitutions of both: ſecondly, by holding
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:8689:306"/>
the mediocritie of things commanded by them: thirdly, by following the conſtitutions, partly of the one, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the other. <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſpeaketh of this kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth when he ſaith, That ciuill ſocietie conſiſting of meane perſons is very good, and that thoſe cities are wel gouerned wherein there are many of the middle ſort, who haue more power than both the other parties, or at leaſt than any one of them. For where as many are paſſing rich, or extreme poore, there followeth either an extreme Democratie, or an intollerable Oligarchie, or els through their exceſſe, a tirannie. Nowe the laſt kind of corrupt common-wealth remaineth to be ſeene, which is called<note place="margin">Of a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie.</note> Democratie, where free and poore men being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number, are lordes of the eſtate. There were fiue<note place="margin">Fiue kinds ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according to Ariſtotle in his 4. booke of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liti. ca. 4.</note> ſortes of them: the firſt, where the gouernment was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually communicated to all: the ſecond, where regard was had to wealth, although it was but ſmall: the third, where all the citizens were partakers of the gouernment vnder the ruling of the lawe: the fourth, where euery one might attaine to the magiſtracie, ſo that hee were a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and the lawe ruled: the fift, where other things beyng equall, the multitude commanded and not the lawe: and then the people onely gouerned, accordyng to their fanſie by decrees and prouiſoes, which they gaue out daily, oppreſſing the vertuous, riche and noble, that they might liue in all libertie. This kinde is not to bee called a Common-wealth, ſeeing the lawes beare no ſway, but beyng aunſwerable to a tirannie, it is paſſing ill, and<note place="margin">Athens a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical eſtate.</note> vnwoorthie to bee numbred among Common-wealths. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> wrote, that the Democratie of Athens was ſuch a one, where the people was giuen ouer to all licentiouſneſſe without either feare of Magiſtrates, or obſeruation of lawes. Nowe of the three kindes of good Common-wealthes mentioned by vs, <hi>Aristotle, Polybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> compound an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is partaker of all three: ſaying, that euery kind<note place="margin">Of a mixt kinde of common-wealth.</note> of Common-wealth eſtabliſhed ſimplie, and alone by it ſelfe, ſoone degenerateth into the next vice, if it be not
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:8689:306"/>
moderated and kept backe by the reſt. Therefore they ſay that a Common-wealth erected with a right gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to continue long, muſt haue the vertues and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the other Common-wealths, ioyned togither in hir, to the ende that nothing growe out of proportion which may cauſe hir to degenerate into hir next euill, and ſo conſequently ouerthrow hir. Likewiſe many auncient<note place="margin">Examples here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> and late Politikes haue maintayned, that the Common-wealths of the Lacedemonians, Carthaginians, Romans and others that are famous, as that of the Venitians, were compound and mildlie intermingled with the royall, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraticall, and popular power. But this ſubiect deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth well a ſeuerall diſcourſe, which beyng needleſſe for the vnderſtanding of the matter here propounded vnto vs, we will not ſtay any longer in the curious ſearching out of ſundry other kindes of eſtates and policies, which the ancients haue drawen out of theſe alreadie deſcribed. We will note therefore for the concluſion of our ſpeech that the reaſon why ſo many kindes of Common-wealths are mentioned by the auncients is this, bicauſe euery citie is compounded of many partes, the diuerſitie of which, according as they were in greater number and power, cauſed them to varie the names of gouernments. But to<note place="margin">The perfecteſt diſtinction of common-wealths.</note> auoyd confuſion and obſcuritie, we may ſay, that if the ſoueraigntie conſiſteth in one onely prince, the eſtate is Monarchicall: if all the people haue intereſt in it, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is popular: and if onely the leaſt parte of them haue the chiefe power, the eſtate is Ariſtocraticall. But<note place="margin">There is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the eſtate and the gouernment of a common-wealth.</note> if their forme of gouernment be contrary to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they take an other qualitie but chaunge not their eſſence. Moreouer we ſay, that the preſeruation of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie publique ſocietie dependeth of the policie well ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, without which there can be nothing but diſorder &amp; confuſion among men. We ſay, that policie is the order of a citie in the offices of magiſtracie, namely, in the chiefe of all, in whoſe gouernment the whole Common-wealth conſiſteth: which if it be in the peoples handes, is called<note place="margin">Examples of the popular eſtate.</note> Popular, as in the Cantons of Switzerland, and leagues
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:8689:307"/>
of the Griſons, in many free townes in Germanie, and in old time was in Athens: if in the hands of certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as of the gentlemen of Venice, and of ſome families<note place="margin">Of the Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall,</note> in Genes, it is called Ariſtocraticall: if it dependeth of the wil of one alone, it is called a Monarchie, as in France,<note place="margin">Of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall.</note> Spaine, Portingale, England, Scotland, Sweathland, Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. Further we ſay, that the diuerſitie of gouernment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong cities and peoples, dependeth of their end: if they tend to a good ende, which is to publique benefite, they are good and iuſt: but if to an ill ende, namely, to the particular profite of ſuch as commaund, they are euill and vniuſt.</p>

Now, let vs ſee whether this vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Magiſtrate be lawfull and approoued of God.

Wherefore<note place="margin">The calling of the Magiſtrate is moſt holie.</note> no man ought to doubt of this, that ciuill ſuperioritie is not onely a holie and lawfull calling before God, but alſo the holieſt and moſt honourable of all other, whereunto all the people is ſubiect, aſwell by the eſtabliſhment of the right of the eſtate, as by the holie and heauenly ordinance of God. And if the Magiſtrate be perſwaded (as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that many Eſtates haue had that foundation) that the cauſe of his firſt inſtitution, and voluntarie ſubiection whereunto the people ſubmitted themſelues for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But further, if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate<note place="margin">He is the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> know that he is appointed the miniſter of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, vnto what great integritie, prudence, clemencie, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and innocencie, ought he to conforme &amp; frame<note place="margin">Good counſell for Magiſtrats.</note> himſelfe? With what confidence dare he ſuffer any ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie to haue entrance into his ſeate, which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth to be the throne of the liuing God? With what boldnes will he pronounce any vniuſt ſentence out of his mouth, which he knoweth is appointed to be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth of God? With what conſcience will he ſubſcribe to, or ſeale any euill ſtatute with his hand, which he knoweth is ordained to write the decrees of God? To be ſhort, if the Magiſtrate call to mind, that as God hath placed the Sunne and Moone in the heauens as a token of his diuinitie, ſo is he alſo appointed in earth for the like repreſentation and light, will he not thinke that he is to
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:8689:309"/>
imploy and beſtow all his care and ſtudie, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent vnto men in all his dooings, as it were an image of the prouidence, defence, goodnes, clemencie, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God? It is certaine that the Magiſtrate is the ſame<note place="margin">The Magiſtrate compared to the hart of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature.</note> thing in the Common-wealth, which the hart is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a liuing creature. If the hart be ſound and pure, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth life vnto the whole body, bicauſe it is the fountaine of the bloud, and of the ſpirits: but being corrupted, it bringeth death and deſtruction to all the members. So fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it with the Magiſtrate, who is the ſoule of the people, their glaſſe, and the white whereat all his ſubiects aime. If he liue vnder right, reaſon, truth and Iuſtice, which are the proper wil of God onely, he is not vnlike to a line or rule,<note place="margin">And to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters rule.</note> which being firſt right it ſelfe, afterward correcteth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crooked things that are applied vnto it. For nothing is more natural, than that ſubiects ſhould conforme them ſelues to the manners, deedes, and words of their prince. The wiſe Hebrew, <hi>Plato, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> haue left this Maxime vnto poſteritie as an infallible rule of Eſtate. And <hi>Theodoricus</hi> king of the Gothes, writing to the Senat of Rome, goeth yet further, vſing theſe words, as <hi>Caſſiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> rehearſeth them: <hi>That the courſe of nature would ſooner faile, than the people would leaue off to be like their Princes.</hi> But further, as the hart in the bodies of liuing creatures is laſt corrupted, inſomuch that the laſt relicks of life ſeeme to abide therein: ſo it is meete, that, if any diſeaſe corrupt the people, the ſoueraigne Magiſtrate ſhould continue pure and ſound vnto the end from all that pollution. If there be any euill in the ſoule, it proceedeth from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of the body, being ſubiect to peruerſe affections: and looke what good thing ſoeuer is in the body, it ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the ſoule, as from the fountaine thereof. Now as it would be againſt nature, if the euils of the body ſhould come from the ſoule, &amp; the good gifts of the body ſhould be corrupted by the vices of the ſpirite: ſo would it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurd, that corrupt manners, euill lawes, vice, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines, ſhould proceede from the Magiſtrate vnto the people, ſeeing (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) he holdeth the ſame place

And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the whole Common-wealth repreſenteth but one certaine bodye compounded of diuers members, whereof the Magiſtrate is the Head and moſt excellent of all, he muſt alſo vſe ſuch equitie, that he profit euery one of them, and beware that he be not contagious to the whole publike body through his euil example. The people<note place="margin">The example of the Magiſtrate is the beſt way to teach the people.</note> (ſaith <hi>Seneca)</hi> giue more credite to their eies, than to their eares: that is to ſay, they beleeue that which they ſee, ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than that which they heare. And to inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by precepts, is a long and difficult way: but to teach them by examples is very ſhort, and of greater efficacie. Therefore the Magiſtrate muſt be more carefull of that which he doth, than of that which he ſpeaketh. And that which he preſcribeth his ſubiects for a rule, as it were by law, muſt be confirmed of him by works and deedes. For as he is chiefly bound to follow the lawes of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo he muſt make all thoſe lawes and ſtatuts, which he eſtabliſheth in his eſtate, according to that paterne. And<note place="margin">Whereunto the Prince is bound aſwell as his ſubiect.</note> therfore one of the Ancients ſaid very wel, that the prince togither with his ſubiects, had one and the ſame God to ſerue, one law to keepe, and one death to feare. We will then briefly comprehend the dutie of the Magiſtrate in<note place="margin">The dutie of the Magiſtrate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in three things.</note> theſe three things, in ruling, in teaching, and in iudging his people: which duties are ſo neerely knit and ioined togither, that the one cannot be well exerciſed without the other, and he that faithfully diſchargeth one, fulfilleth<note place="margin">The art Royall, Philoſophicall, and Politicall is all one.</note> them all. For this cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that the arte and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the King, of the Philoſopher, and of the Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is one and the ſame, bicauſe they conſiſt all three in knowing how to rule, to teach, and to iudge well. He ſaith alſo, that the only way to procure true quietnes and moſt happie felicitie in Common-wealths, is when by ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence the ſoueraigne authoritie of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie meeteth with the will of a wiſe Philoſopher in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that vertue may be ſuperior, and vice ſuppreſſed. And if ſuch a gouernour ouer people is to be accounted very

happy, they are no leſſe happie, that may heare the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſcourſes, &amp; good inſtructions which proceed from his mouth. Beſides, when they ſee vertue after a liuely ſort imprinted in a viſible paterne, &amp; that the Magiſtrates life is ſuch an example, they become wiſe of their own accord. Then is force, conſtraint, or threatning, needeles to bring them to their dutie, as they that conforme themſelues to an'vpright &amp; good life in friendſhip, charitie, &amp; concord,<note place="margin">Who is moſt woorthie of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> one with another. So that we may boldly ſay, that he is by nature moſt worthie of ſoueraigne authority, who is able by his vertue to imprint in mens harts the like diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; affection to liue wel &amp; vertuouſly. But foraſmuch as<note place="margin">Why there are ſo few vertuous Princes.</note> few vertuous men are found, &amp; ſoueraigne Magiſtrats are not commonly choſen out of that ſmal number, but come to that authoritie for the moſt part by ſucceſſion: it is no maruell if there be but fewe ſuch Magiſtrates, as we haue here deſcribed: nay, it is rather greatly to be wondered at, if any one amonge a great many become very excellent. Notwithſtanding, as their ſoueraign is nothing leſſe ouer their ſubiects, who owe fidelitie &amp; obedience vnto them: ſo are they alwaies bound to do their dutie and office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">Wherin the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the chiefe Magiſtrate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> them, which conſiſteth in miniſtring iuſtice, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, comfort, aide, and protection. Moreouer, bicauſe inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and rebellious wickednes is alwaies to be found in ſome corrupt perſons, who neither by teaching, nor by example of good life will be brought to vertue, but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in committing a thouſand impious &amp; vniuſt actions,<note place="margin">Why the ſword is put into the Magiſtrates hand.</note> for the puniſhment of ſuch, the ſword is put into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates hand, both by the law of God &amp; man, that as the miniſter of God he ſhould ſerue his wrath, &amp; take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them that do euil.

                     <hi>ſaith to the wicked, thou art iuſt.</hi> Yea, an offence is to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aſmuch or more to him that ſuffereth it to be done, when he may &amp; is bound to ſtay it, than to him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the ſame. And if it be a point of true iuſtice in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to perſecute the wicked with drawne ſword, let not them that will needes (forſooth) abſtaine from all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie, and keepe their hands pure from blood, whileſt the ſwords of the wicked are drawne out to commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and violence: I ſay, let them not doubt but they them ſelues ſhall be iudged guiltie of great iniuſtice before the<note place="margin">Seueritie and clemencie are to be linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</note> diuine Maieſtie. It is true, that gentlenes and clemencie moſt of all beſeeme a great and excellent man, and is one principall vertue neceſſary for a Magiſtrate. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it muſt ſo be ruled, that for the benefite of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, ſeueritie and rigor be ioined therewith: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is vnpoſſible to rule &amp; gouerne a multitude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this. And yet it is not the part either of a wiſe Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of a good gouernor of an Eſtate, to ſet hand to the iron, except in great neceſſitie, when there is no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. For if they do otherwiſe, as there is want of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in both, ſo moſt of all in the Magiſtrate, bicauſe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice alſo is ioined with crueltie. So that it is neceſſarie both in clemencie and rigor to keepe ſome honeſt meane by right reaſon, and prudence, to the end that the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences of both may be eſchewed. This is that which <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocrates,</hi> ſpeaking of the manner of raigning wel, teacheth, when he ſayth, that a man muſt be ſeuere in ſearching out of faults, and mercifull in impoſing puniſhments that are
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:8689:311"/>
leſſe than the faults, gouerning men more by clemencie<note place="margin">Ciuilitie and grauitie muſt be ioined both togither in a Magiſtrate.</note> and prudence, than by rigor and crueltie. And ſeeing it falleth out ſo, that an ouer-ſeuere Magiſtrate becommeth odious, and that he is contemned &amp; deſpiſed who is too gratious, a wiſe man muſt be both ciuill and graue; graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being comely in commanding, and ciuilitie neceſſarie for him that conuerſeth with men. For the concluſion therefore of our diſcourſe, we learne, that both by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of euery eſtate and policie, and by a holie &amp; heauenly decree, we are ſubiect to the ſoueraigne Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who is lawfully ordained to rule, to teach, and to iudge vs in all things that reſpect this preſent life, and the preſeruation of ciuill ſocietie. We learne, that ſeeing he is<note place="margin">The dutie of the Magiſtrate.</note> the image of God vpon earth, he muſt conforme himſelfe aſmuch as he is able to the perfection of all goodnes and iuſtice, that he may bring on them that are committed to his charge to godlines and vertue by his example: &amp; that it is his dutie to honor the good, and to puniſh the euill, declaring thereby that he is the protector and preſeruer of publike tranquillitie, honeſtie, innocencie, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and appointed to maintaine the common ſafetie and peace of all men.</p>

thoſe iuſt couenants and bargaines that are made with<note place="margin">Wherein the abſolute power of Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> them, they are iniurious to God. And as for their power to abrogate ſuch lawes by their abſolute authoritie, it is no more permitted vnto them than the other: ſeeing the power of a ſoueraign is only ouer the ciuill or poſitiue lawes. But that we may haue ſome certaine vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the matter heere propounded vnto vs to intreate of, we muſt firſt ſee what the lawe is, into howe many kindes it is diuided, whereunto it ought to tend, the<note place="margin">The definition of the law.</note> profite of it, and howe we muſt obey it. The lawe is a ſingular reaſon imprinted in nature, commanding thoſe things that are to be done, and forbidding the contrary.<note place="margin">The diuiſion of it.</note> We haue both the lawe of nature, and the lawe written.<note place="margin">What the law of nature is.</note> The lawe of nature is a ſence and feeling, which euerie one hath in himſelfe, and in his conſcience, whereby he diſcerneth betweene good and euill, aſmuch as ſufficeth to take from him the cloake of ignorance, in that he is<note place="margin">The diuiſion of the written law. The diuiſion of the law of God.</note> reprooued euen by his owne witneſſe. The written lawe is double, diuine, and ciuill. The diuine lawe is diuided into three partes, that is, into Manners, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,<note place="margin">Of the Morall law.</note> and Iudgements. That of Manners was called of the ancient writers the Morall lawe, beeing the true and eternall rule of Iuſtice, appointed for all men, in what countrie or tyme ſoeuer they liue, if they will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their life according to the will of God. And as for the Ceremonies and Iudgements, although they haue ſome relation to Maners, yet bicauſe both of them might be altered and aboliſhed without the corruption or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of good manners, the Ancients did not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend thoſe two parts vnder the word Morall, but attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this name particularly to the firſt part of the lawe, of which the ſincere integritie of Maners dependeth, which neither may nor ought in any ſort to be altered or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and whereunto the end of all other lawes is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, in honouring God by a pure faith, and by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,<note place="margin">Of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall law.</note> and in being ioined vnto our neighbour by true loue. The Ceremonial lawe was a Pedagogie of the Iewes, that is to ſay, a doctrine of infancie giuen to that
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:8689:313"/>
people to exerciſe them vnder the obedience to God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the manifeſtation of thoſe things which were then fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured<note place="margin">Of the Iudiciall law.</note> in ſhadowes. The Iudiciall law giuen vnto them for policie, taught them certaine rules of iuſtice and equitie, wherby they might liue peaceably togither without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another. Now, as the exerciſe of ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to the doctrine of pietie, which is the firſt part of the Morall law (bicauſe it nouriſhed the Iewiſh Church in the reuerence of God) and yet was diſtinct from true pietie: in like maner, albeit their Iudiciall law tended to no other ende than to the preſeruation of the ſelfe ſame charitie that is commanded in the Morall law, yet it had a diſtinct propertie, which was not expreſly declared in the commandement of charitie. As therefore the ceremonies were abrogated, and true religion and pietie, I meane Chriſtian, ſubſtituted in place of the Iudaicll law: ſo the Iudiciarie lawes were cancelled &amp; aboliſhed, without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in any ſort the dutie of charitie. So that all nations<note place="margin">Of ciuill or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue lawes.</note> haue libertie to make for themſelues ſuch lawes as they ſhall thinke expedient for them, called of vs ciuill lawes, which muſt be ſquared according to the eternall rule of charitie, and differing onely in forme, they muſt all haue one end, commanding alwaies honeſt &amp; vertuous things, and contrariwiſe forbidding thoſe that are diſhoneſt and<note place="margin">The diuiſion of ciuill lawes.</note> vitious. Nowe of theſe ciuill lawes, there are two chiefe kindes amongſt vs: The firſt conſiſteth in lawes that are ratified &amp; eſtabliſhed, vpon which euery Monarchie and publike gouernment is firſt grounded, and hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which ought not in any wiſe to be infringed or<note place="margin">What ciuill lawes may not be changed.</note> changed: ſuch are thoſe which we call the lawes of the French-men: namely the Salicke law, eſtabliſhed by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Salick law immutable.</note> who was the firſt that tooke vpon him the name of king ouer them. Such lawes alſo are annexed and vnited to the crowne, and therefore the Prince cannot ſo abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them, but that his ſucceſſor may diſanull whatſoeuer he hath done in preiudice of them: much leſſe are ſubiects permitted to attempt any ſuch matter. Yea all thoſe that go about it, ſeeke nothing but to mooue ſedition in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:8689:314"/>
                     <note place="margin">What ciuill lawes may be changed.</note> and to cauſe ſubiects to reuolt from their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. As for the other ciuill lawes, as conſtitutions, ordinaunces, edicts, and cuſtomes, which haue beene made and receiued according to the condition and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunce of times and places, they are in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſoueraigne Prince, to change and to correct them as occaſion ſhall ſerue. And yet in the general and particular cuſtomes of this Realme, none haue<note place="margin">A Prince may deny the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of his three Eſtates, hauing reaſon and iuſtice on his ſide.</note> beene commonly chaunged, but after the lawefull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of the three generall Eſtates of France, or elſe of the particular Eſtates of euery Prouince: not as if the king were neceſſarily bound to ſtand to their aduice, or might not do contrary to that which they demand, if naturall reaſon and iuſtice ſtand with his will. And then whatſoeuer it pleaſeth him to like or diſlike, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or forbid, is held for a law, an edict, and decree, and euery ſubiect is bound to obey it. But to ſpeake general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the lawes of an Eſtate, the changing and gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is a very pernitious plague in euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.<note place="margin">The change of lawes in a well ſetled Eſtate is dangerous.</note> This ancient rule and Maxime of wiſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, is well woorth the marking: <hi>That nothing is to be changed in the lawes of a Common-wealth which hath a long time preſerued it ſelfe in good estate, what apparant profite ſoeuer a man may pretend.</hi> And for this cauſe in the popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Romanes vnder <hi>Publius Philo</hi> the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that Athenian edict was receiued, and paſt by force of lawe, <hi>whereby it was not lawfull for any to preſent a request to the people, without the aduice of the Senate.</hi> But there was a farre more ſtrict and ſeuere decree amongeſt the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crians. For it was to this effect (as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth<note place="margin">A ſeuere decree of the Locrians againſt ſuch as would bring in new lawes.</note> it) that euery Citizen that was deſirous to bring in a newe lawe, ſhould come and declare it publikely before the people with a halter about his necke, to the end that if his newe lawe was not thought meete to be receiued, and very profitable for the Common-wealth, he might preſently be ſtrangled, as a woorthie reward for his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. In euery ſocietie (ſayth <hi>Aristotle)</hi> that is well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and ordained by lawes, great care is to be taken
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:8689:314"/>
that no part of the lawe, although neuer ſo little, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed or changed: yea, moſt heede is to be had of that which is done by little and little. For if reſiſtance be not then made, it falleth out in the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">Miſchiefs in a commonwealth muſt be reſiſted in the beginning</note> as in the diſeaſed bodie of a man, wherein the diſeaſe, if ſpeedie remedie be not vſed in the beginning thereof, increaſeth by little and little, and that which might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily haue beene cured, through negligence is made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable. Men neuer beginne (ſayed <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> the Romane Conſul) to alter and chang the eſtate of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, by making their firſt entrance with ſome notorious reſiſting of the lawes. And therefore we muſt thinke that the preſeruation of the principall founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a politike Eſtate is left at randon, when men neglect the care of keeping diligentlye the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, howe light, or of ſmall importance ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">The law is the foundation of ciuill ſocieties.</note> they ſeeme to be. For ſeeing the lawe is the ſure foundation of euery ciuill ſocietie, if that fayle, it muſt needes be, that the whole politicall building will fall to ruine. Therefore <hi>Bias</hi> the wiſe ſayd, that the Eſtate<note place="margin">Bias.</note> of that Common-wealth is happie, wherein all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants feare the lawe as a ſeuere Tyrant. For then whatſoeuer it requireth, is vndoubtedly perfourmed. After the lawe is once eſtabliſhed and approoued (ſaith <hi>Iſidorus)</hi> we muſt not iudge of it, but iudge according<note place="margin">We muſt not iudge of the law but according to the law.</note> vnto it. That is the beſte policie (ſayde <hi>Chilon</hi> one of the Sages of Graecia) where the people hearken more to the lawes, than to the Oratours. This alſo was the cauſe that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> the Lacedemonian made this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to one who demaunded of him, why it was not lawefull in their countrie to alter any of their aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lawes. The reaſon is (quoth he) bicauſe the lawes<note place="margin">Why the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian lawes might not be changed.</note> muſt bee Miſtreſſes ouer men, and not men Mayſters ouer the lawes. Moreouer, the antiquitie and profite of lawes are ſo euident, that it is needeles to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long diſcourſe thereof heere. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt<note place="margin">The ancient law-makers.</note> lawe-maker of the Hebrewes; <hi>Mercurius Triſmegistus</hi> of the Egyptians; <hi>Phoroneus</hi> the Kinge, of the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:8689:315"/>
                     <hi>Solon</hi> of the Athenians: <hi>Lycurgus</hi> of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians: <hi>Anacharſis</hi> of the Scythians: <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> of the Romanes. Ten notable men were choſen by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and people of Rome, to tranſlate and to expound the lawes of the twelue tables. We haue already declared how <hi>Pharamond</hi> made ours. The greateſt and beſt part of the lawes of Germanie was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Charles</hi> the great, Emperour and king of France. And ſo all regions haue had diuers lawmakers, according to the condition<note place="margin">No law before the law of God.</note> and circumſtance of time, place, and countrie. True it is, that before the publiſhing of the law of God, there was no law-maker of whome we haue any knowledge: and ſurely not ſo much as one word of a law is to be found in all the works of <hi>Homer,</hi> or <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or of any before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> But Princes iudged and commanded all thinges by their ſoueraigne power, which kind of gouernment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more tyrannicall than kingly, could not be of any continuance or aſſurance, bicauſe there was no bond to knit the great with the ſmall, and ſo conſequently no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.<note place="margin">The neceſſitie and profit of a law.</note> Beſides, this is out of doubt, that all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of an Eſtate ſtand in neede of a law, as of a light to guide them in the darkenes of humane actions: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it is neceſſarie for the terrifieng of the wicked, who might pretend ſome true cauſe of their ignorance, or ſome probable colour of their wickednes, or at leaſt ſome ſhew why they ſhould eſcape the puniſhment, which is not<note place="margin">The vpright and equall diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law maketh a good gouernment.</note> imprinted in our hartes, as things forbidden by nature. Neuertheles it is not the law that maketh a right gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but vpright iuſtice, and the equal diſtribution ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which ought to be ſurer ingrauen in the mindes of good kings and princes, than in tables of ſtone. And it is to ſmall purpoſe to multiply Edicts and Decrees, if they be not ſeuerely obſerued: yea the firſt ſigne that a man<note place="margin">To diſpence with good ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts, and daily to make new, is a token of the decay of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</note> may haue of the loſſe of an eſtate, is when there appeereth an vnbrideled licence and a facilitie in diſpenſing with good ſtatuts, and when new decrees are daily conſulted of. And if the eſtate be already troubled, the heaping vp of lawes vpon lawes is no leſſe dangerous for it, than a
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:8689:315"/>
multitude of medicines in a weake ſtomacke, whereas contrarywiſe, new introductions and abuſes are then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to be taken away, and things brought backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their firſt and ancient forme. Hiſtories teach vs, that when edicts and decrees were moſt of all multiplied, then did tiranny gather greateſt ſtrength. As it fell out vnder the tyrant <hi>Caligula,</hi> who publiſhed decrees of al ſorts<note place="margin">Examples ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Caligula, &amp; in Claudius.</note> both good and bad, and thoſe written in ſo ſmall a letter, that men could not read them, to the end that he might thereby ſnare thoſe that were ignoraunt. His ſucceſſour <hi>Claudius</hi> made twentie edicts in one day, and yet tirannie was neuer ſo cruell, nor men more wicked than at that time. Therefore let the lawes and good ordinances of an<note place="margin">How lawes may be kept inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> eſtate be inuiolable, ſtraightly kept, not ſubiect to diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, not fauourable to great men, but common and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to all, and then ſhall the bond of ciuill ſocietie bee ſurely tied. Now where as I ſaid, that all nations haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to preſcribe and frame ciuill lawes for themſelues, my meaning was not to approoue certaine barbarous &amp; beaſtly lawes receiued of ſome people: as thoſe lawes which alowed theeues a certain reward, which permitted the company of men and women indifferently, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable others more diſhoneſt, which are not onely voyd of all iuſtice, but euen of all humanitie. But theſe two things muſt be kept inuiolably in all lawes, namely, <hi>The</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the keeping of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry law.</note> 
                     <hi>ordinance of the law, &amp; the equitie of it,</hi> vpon the reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ordinance is grouuded. Equitie is alwayes one and the ſame to all people, bicauſe it is naturall. Therefore all<note place="margin">Equitie is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one and the ſame to all people.</note> the lawes in the world, of what matter ſoeuer they are, muſt meete in the ſame equitie. Concerning the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the law, bicauſe it is ioyned with circumſtances, no inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce letteth but that it may de diuers among ſundry nations, prouided alwayes that they all tend a-like to the ſame marke of equitie. Now ſeeyng the diuine law which we call morall, is nothing elſe but a teſtimonie of the law of nature, and of the conſcience that is imprinted in all mens hartes, no doubt but this equitie whereof we now ſpeake, is wholy declared and comprehended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:8689:316"/>
                     <note place="margin">The equitie of the morall law ought to be the end and rule of all other lawes.</note> Therefore it is meete that this equitie onely ſhould be the white, rule and end of all lawes. For (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith in his booke of the citie of God) euery law that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the image of the diuine lawe, is a vaine cenſure. And iuſtice is the end of euery law wel eſtabliſhed, which is the cauſe why S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo greatly extolleth the vigor of the lawe, calling it the bond of perfection. Thoſe lawes then which are ſquared out by this heauenly rule, which tend to this ende, and are limited out by this meaſure, ought to be receiued and followed cheerfully, albeit they differ from the Moſaicall law, or otherwiſe one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For many haue denied (&amp; ſome amongſt vs are yet of that opinion) that no Common-wealth can be well &amp; iuſtly<note place="margin">Their opinion confuted, who would tie all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of Moſes.</note> inſtituted and ordained, if leauing the policie of Moſes, it be gouerned by the common lawes of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: which is ſo abſurd a thing, and would be the cauſe of ſo great confuſion in the policies of the world, that there needeth no great ſtore of arguments to prooue it vaine and friuolous. Moreouer, by that diſtinction of the law which we haue already ſet downe in our diſcourſe, it appeereth ſufficiently, that the opinion of theſe doters is grounded vpon a meere ignoraunce of the will of God. The lawe of God forbiddeth ſtealing and diuers paines<note place="margin">Theft puniſhed diuerſly in diuers nations.</note> and puniſhments are appointed for the ſame in the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Iewes, according to the kind, time, and place of the theft. The ancienteſt lawes of other nations puniſhed theeues by cauſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reſtore double that which they had ſtolne. Thoſe lawes which folowed made a diſtinction betweene open and ſecret theft: others vſed baniſhment,<note place="margin">How falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed among the Iewes.</note> and ſome death. The lawe of God forbiddeth falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes-bearing, which was puniſhed amongſt the Iewes with the ſame puniſhment that the partie falſely accuſed ſhould haue incurred, if he had been found guiltie. In ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries there was no puniſhment for it but publike ignominie and ſhame: and in ſome alſo the gibbet. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, all the lawes in the world with one common conſent, how different ſoeuer they be, tend to one and the ſame ende, pronouncing ſentence of condemnation againſt
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:8689:316"/>
thoſe crimes that are condemned by the eternall lawe of God: onely they agree not in equalitie of puniſhment, which is neither neceſſarie nor expedient. There is ſome ſuche countrey that woulde ſpeedily become deſolate through murders and robberies, if it did not exerciſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible &amp; grieuous puniſhments vpon the offenders in thoſe crimes.

                  <p>In euery diſcipline the beginning is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken from the leaſt partes thereof.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing ſeene that Policie is the order and life of the citie, and that the citie is a multitude of citizens, before we ſpeak of the whole bodie of them, we muſt (as I think) intreat firſt of a citizen, who, although he differ according<note place="margin">The definition of a citizen in a popular ſtate.</note> to the diuerſitie of common-wealths, yet to take him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, may be ſaid to be euery one that hath right to iudge in his citie, &amp; hath a deliberatiue voyce in the generall or common councell thereof. This definition of a citizen
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:8689:317"/>
cannot fitly be applied to all citizens of all Common-wealths, but only to thoſe that are ruled popularly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are all equall, and gouerne themſelues by aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in which euery one hath libertie to ſpeake his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe.<note place="margin">Other definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a citizen.</note> Some define a citizen to be he, whoſe parents are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens: or els, to be a free ſubiect holding of the ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of an other: wherin they adde this word Free, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh him from ſlaues and ſtrangers. But generally we may ſay, that whoſoeuer may beare offices or magiſtracie,<note place="margin">A general defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen.</note> in what forme of gouernment ſo euer, is reputed &amp; taken for a citizen: and ſuch are all the naturall Frenchmen in this monarchie, amongſt whom there is not one, how baſe ſoeuer he be that may not be made noble by vertue, or that may not by skill and integritie of life attaine to the greateſt eſtates of iuſtice, of treaſurie, and of other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like charges. This is not ſeen in all common-wealths. For in the Seignorie of Venice it ſeemeth that none are truely<note place="margin">Of the ſtate of Venice.</note> citizens, but the lordes and nobles, who onely enioy the office of magiſtracie, and may enter into the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell after they haue attained the age of fiue and twentie yeeres. As for the people they intermeddle not with any matter of gouernment, this only excepted, that they may be Secretaries and Chancellors, as <hi>Contarenus</hi> reporteth. The citie of Rome hauing many times ſundry gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Of the ancient eſtate in Rome.</note> the appellation of a citizen was likewiſe diuers therein. For as long as the firſt kings rules, the common people were altogither excluded from publike honors &amp; offices. But after when the regall power was changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gouernment of a certaine number of men, choſen by ſuffrages and common voyces, the people were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to magiſtracies, and to the managing of affairs, being preſent at the publike aſſemblie had in Mars his field, which was diſtributed by tribes, wardes, companies, and centuries, to deliberate of the common eſtate, to create magiſtrates, and to decree new lawes: where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for a citizen in deed, that was a free man, that had both houſe and tribe, and poſſibilitie to attaine to honor, enioying beſides many other priuiledges and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:8689:318"/>
But when the ſoueraigntie came into the emperors hands, thoſe aſſemblies continued onely vnder <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Octautus,</hi> and after were abrogated by <hi>Tyberius</hi> and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to the Senate, and to the abſolute power of the prince, taking away al authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people in publike matters. Now to returne to our former aſſertion, we ſay,<note place="margin">Who are truly citizens.</note> that all they are citizens to whom the gate that leadeth to the gouernment of the citie lieth open, I mean the whole company of them that liue vnder the ſame lawes and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne magiſtrates. Such are all the ſubiects and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vaſſals of our king, of whom the people and the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie<note place="margin">The diuiſion of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into three orders or eſtates</note> are the two orders or eſtates, and of them is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the church compounded, which maketh one part of the common-wealth of France.

one and the ſame thing: namely, one kind of Common-wealth,<note place="margin">What a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power is.</note> wherein the abſolute ſoueraigntie conſiſteth in one onely Prince, who may not be commanded by any, but may command all.

Yea it is certaine, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the greateſt part of them that haue written of ſtate matters, that euery kind of Common-wealth that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed ſimply, and alone by it ſelfe, quickly degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth into the next vice, if it be not moderated and held backe by the reſt: As a kingdome is ſoone changed into a tyrannie, an Ariſtocraty into an Oligarchy, and ſo of the other. But this danger is greater in a Monarchy, (as they ſay that miſlike it) than vnder the rule of many, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is vnlikely, that all of them ſhould be wicked, and if any one be ſo, the good men may bridle him. And ſo they conclude, that it is not ſo dangerous a matter to liue vnder the gouernment of many, as of one, who may more eaſily corrupt his nature, being a Monarch, than many can doe that are elected in an Ariſtocraty, as the Areopagiticall Lordes in Athens, the Ephoryes in Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia, and the Senate in Rome. After the death of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> Monarch of the Perſians, when the chiefe Lords<note place="margin">The Perſian Councell held for the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of their Eſtate.</note> of the kingdome had ſlaine that <hi>Magus,</hi> who vnder the name of <hi>Smerdis</hi> had vſurped the rule of the Eſtate, they deliberated of the affaires, and helde a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, wherein (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth) many very woorthie<note place="margin">Otanes oration.</note> and memorable ſpeeches were vttered. <hi>Otanes</hi> mooued this, that the affaires might be gouerned in common by the Perſians, ſpeaking vnto them in this manner. I am not of opinion, that one of vs from hence forward ſhould be ſole Monarch ouer all, bicauſe it is neither pleaſant nor
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:8689:324"/>
good to haue it ſo. For ye know to what inſolencie <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> was growne, ye haue alſo throughly ſeene the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the <hi>Magus:</hi> and ye may thinke with your ſelues how perilous a thing it is to haue a Monarchy, which may do what it liſt, not being ſubiect to correction. The beſt man in the world placed in this eſtate, will ſoone be cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with his woonted thoughts. Inſolencie poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, bicauſe of preſent proſperitie, and hatred is ſoone bred in ſuch a man. Now hauing theſe two vices, he aboundeth in all iniquitie, and committeth great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, one while through inſolency, another while of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. Although a Tyrant, hauing abundance of all good<note place="margin">The effects of a Tyrant.</note> things, ſhould be farre from enuy, yet the contrary falleth out in him towards his ſubiects. For he hateth good men that liue and proſper well, he delighteth in the wicked, and gladly heareth euill reports of other men. And which becommeth him very il, if you admire and praiſe him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, he is angry that you do it not exceſſiuely: &amp; yet if you doe ſo, he will miſlike it, thinking that you flatter him. Beſides, which is woorſt of all, he changeth the lawes and cuſtoms of the countrie, forceth women, killeth good men, not taking knowledge of their cauſe. Thus did this Perſian Lord conclude, that a Monarchy was to be left, &amp; a Democraty to be choſen. <hi>Megabyſes,</hi> one of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,<note place="margin">Megabyſes ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraty.</note> liked well the aboliſhing of a Monarchy, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Oligarchical gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſaying, that nothing was more ignorant, or more inſolent, than an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude. Therefore it was in no wiſe tollerable, that eſchewing the inſolencie of a Tyrant, they ſhould fall into the handes of an vnbrideled and diſordered people. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others haue noted great dangers and diſcommodities<note place="margin">The dangers of a Monarchy.</note> in a Monarchy, eſpecially in the change of the Monarch, whether it be from ill to good, or from good to better. For we commonly ſee at the changing of Princes, new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, newe lawes, newe officers, newe friends, newe forme of liuing: bicauſe Princes ordinarilye take delight in changing, and in remoouing almoſt all things, that men might ſpeake of them: which manye tymes bringeth
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:8689:325"/>
great diſcommodities to their ſubiects. But if this were not ſo, and the Prince as wiſe as hart could wiſh, yet the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances and leagues made by a mans predeceſſor, end with him: which is the cauſe that the alliances ending, the neighbours betake them to armes, and the ſtrongeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulteth the weakeſt, or elſe preſcribeth him lawes. For many maintaine, that the ſucceſſours of Princes are not bound to the treaties and obligations of their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, if they be not their heires. An other inconuenience to be feared in a Monarchie, is the danger of falling into ciuill warre, through the diuiſion of thoſe that aſpire to the crowne, and namely, if there be right of election, which oftentimes draweth after it the ruine of the eſtate. But put the caſe there were no ſtrife for the Monarchie, yet if the Monarch be a childe, there will be diuiſion for the gouernment of him, betweene the moother and the<note place="margin">A child Prince is a token of Gods wrath.</note> Princes, or betwixt the Princes themſelues. Alſo when God purpoſeth to be reuenged vpon nations, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to giue them children for Princes. And although the child hath a Tutor, by the appointment of the predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, or by cuſtome, yet is there danger of making himſelfe ſoueraigne Lord, of which thing hiſtories ſet downe many examples before our eies. If a yoong Prince freed from Tutors, come to the crowne, his gouernment is no leſſe to be feared. For being then ſet at libertie when his luſts are moſt violent, you ſhall ſee nothing in his Court but foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, maskings, and looſe behauiour. If he be warly, he will hazard his ſubiects, his eſtate, and his perſon, to make triall of his valure. Briefly, a craftie and wicked Monarch will eſtabliſh a tyrannie: a cruell man will make a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe of the Common-wealth: a whore-maiſter will make it a ſtewes: a couetous wretch will pull off both haire and skin from his ſubiects: a prodigall Prince will ſucke the blood and marrow, to glut a dozen of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaches about his perſon: a fooliſh and ignorant Prince will do woorſe, falling eaſily into the moſt of theſe vices, for want of iudgement to knowe and to make choice of counſell, neceſſary for the gouernment of his eſtate. Theſe
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:8689:325"/>
are the chiefe reaſons of them that miſlike a Monarchie. Now we will alleadge the other reaſons in the defence of it, and begin with <hi>Darius</hi> his declaration vpon the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<note place="margin">Darius oration for a Monarchy.</note> of his companions, rehearſed by vs in the generall Councell of the Perſians: bicauſe it is well woorthy to be remembred, according vnto which the Monarchie was concluded of in the Councell. In my iudgement (ſaid he to the aſſemblie) <hi>Megabyſes</hi> ſaid well concerning the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but ill in that which belongeth to an Oligarchy. For although there be three kinds of Policies, a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craty, an Oligarchy, and a Monarchy, and all good, yet I ſay this laſt is farre better than the other, bicauſe there is nothing ſo good as the gouernment of one vertuous man alone, who iudging thereafter, gouerneth his people without reprehenſion. I will not ſpeake of the councels which he taketh in like manner againſt his enimies and ill-willers. But in an Oligarchy, where many buſie them<note place="margin">Againſt an Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy.</note> ſelues with publike affaires, great enmities ariſe betweene them, from whence proceede ſeditions, and from ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons murders, and by murders ſome one attaineth to a Monarchye. Whereby you may eaſily knowe how much better a Monarchy is. As touching the people, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that where they rule, there ſhould be much wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, which increaſing in the euill gouernours of the Common-wealth, breedeth not hatred betweene them, but great friendſhip. For they that are euill affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Common-wealth, hide one anothers counſell, vntill ſome one man being ſet ouer the people, cauſe them to giue ouer. Then is that man admired, and therewithall made a Monarch: whereby alſo it is euident, that a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is beſt. Wherefore my aduice is, that, ſeeing we haue beene ſet at libertie by one onely man, we ſhould maintaine that Eſtate: otherwiſe we ſhall diſanull the lawes of our countrie, that are already well eſtabliſhed, which will not turne to the beſt for vs. <hi>Dionyſius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſaeus</hi> in his antiquities of Rome, affirmeth that the like ſpeech was vſed before <hi>Romulus,</hi> when he firſt eſtabliſhed the gouernment in Rome: where <hi>Amulius</hi> concluded for

                     <note place="margin">A Monarchy concluded vpon in the Councell of the Perſians, of Romulus, and of Auguſtus.</note> the Monarchy, as <hi>Darius</hi> did among the Perſians. The ſame queſtion was deliberated of by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> amongſt his friends, bicauſe he deſired nothing more than to liue in reſt, and to giue ouer the Eſtate: but it was then conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that a Monarchy was beſt for the Common-wealth, and the cuent prooued the ſame. For before the Romans could not liue ten yeeres without ciuill warre or ſedition: whereas <hi>Auguſtus</hi> preſerued them almoſt 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeeres in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace, which continued alſo long time after his death. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> in his firſt Olynthiacke oration, ſheweth the Athenians what aduantage a Monarch hath in the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and execution of great enterpriſes, ſpeaking in this manner. It is greatly auaileable for the ſpeedie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious execution of warlike exploits, when one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath the ouer-ſight of all enterpriſes, both ſecret and open, &amp; withall is Captaine, Lord, &amp; Treaſurer, &amp; alwaies<note place="margin">The commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> preſent at the affaires. But who can deny, that it is not a great deale better for great and mighty nations to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned Monarchically, to the end that they may maintain themſelues in vnity at home, &amp; abroad in reputation? Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe nations where there are Princes, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Barons, &amp; other gentlemen, who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe in the higheſt, loweſt, &amp; midle ſort of iuſtice; Villages, Boroughs, Townes, Caſtles, with vaſſals holding and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them by fealtic and homage: as namely in France, Spaine, and other countries, wherin the Monarch by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power, and force when need is, holdeth in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort with the leſſe, ſtaying the inſolencie of the one, &amp; releeuing others from oppreſſion. Otherwiſe, if they were diuided into many heads, diſagreeing among themſelues, and acknowledging no ſoueraigne Lord, who doubteth but that they would be continually troubled with ciuill warres, ſet vpon by ſtrangers, and ſpoiled of all ſides?

Yea the
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:8689:327"/>
ſauage people newly diſcouered, are in a manner all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der kings. And they that liue in other kinds of Common-wealths, as the Venetians, do retaine an outward ſhewe of<note place="margin">The Dukedome of Venice is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue.</note> a king, whome they call a Duke, who is electiue, and to continue his eſtate as long as he liueth. In other places they haue Gonfalonners, as at Lucques; the like whereof they were woont to haue at Florence, and at Sienna. In ſome places they haue Aduoyers, or Bourg-maiſters, as in the Cantons of Switzerland, and in the free townes of<note place="margin">What this word Emperour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth.</note> Germany, which acknowledge an Emperour. Vpon which name we will note by the way, that it importeth no more than the name of a king, although amongſt the Lawyers and others, there haue beene infinite queſtions as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the authoritie and preheminence of both: namely, that the Emperours haue vſurped ouer other kings vntill this preſent, albeit the power and maieſtie of the Empire is greatly diminiſhed, ſo that nothing elſe remaineth in a manner but the name and ſhadow of it within Germany.<note place="margin">Vpon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the name of Emperour was firſt giuen to a Monarch.</note> As for this title of Emperor, which the Romane Monarks tooke to themſelues, &amp; before vſed to call their Generals in warre by that name, it was vpon this occaſion taken vp. After they had depriued <hi>Tarquine</hi> of the kingdome of Rome, by reaſon of his pride and inſolencie, this name of king became ſo odious amongſt the Romanes, that it was forbidden to be vſed, by an edict and ſolemn oath. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon when their popular Eſtate was changed into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, they would not call their Monarch by the name of King, by reaſon of their ancient oath, but called him Emperour, as <hi>Appian</hi> writeth. But to continue the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of our principall matter, and to anſwer briefly to<note place="margin">The reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged againſt a Monarchie anſwered.</note> the reaſons alleadged againſt a Monarchye, we haue firſt to note, that the moſt part of the dangers mentioned do ceaſe, where the Monarchy goeth by ſucceſſion, as it doth in ours. For there is no cauſe of feare in regard of any that might aſpire to the Crowne, or of the treaties and allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are not broken by the Prince his death, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and confirmed by his ſucceſſor and heire, vnles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were greatly preiudiciall to the Eſtate. That new
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:8689:327"/>
Princes ſeeke after nouelties, it may be ſaid of ſome: but it is much more vſuall in Ariſtocraticall and Popular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. For Magiſtrates that are renued ſo often, would be very ſorowfull that their yeere ſhould run out before they had done ſomething that might cauſe men to ſpeake ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or euill of them. As for the troubles about the gouernment of a yoong king, peraduenture it falleth not out once in a hundreth yeeres: whereas if a Gonfalonner of Genes be choſen but onely for two yeeres, &amp; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth will be all on fire. To put into the ballance the cruelties and robberies of a tyrant, whereby to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpeaze many good Princes, there is no ſhew of reaſon in ſo dooing. For we know well enough, that a peaceable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocratie wiſely guided, if it may be ſo, is better than a cruell tyrannie. But the chiefe matter ſubiect of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is to knowe whether it be not better to haue one<note place="margin">One iuſt Princ: better than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants woorſe than one.</note> iuſt and perfect king, than many good Lords: and by the contrary argument, whether the tyrannie of 50. tyrants is not more perillous, than of one only tyrant. Now, if many Maiſters, Pilots, how wiſe ſoeuer they are, hinder one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when euery one deſireth to hold the Rudder: then ſurely many Lords wil do the like, when they ſeeke al togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to gouerne the Common-wealth, albeit they are wiſe and vertuous. And truly no Ariſtocratical or Popular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate<note place="margin">Monarchies haue continu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>longeſt.</note> can be named, that hath laſted aboue 600. yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and few haue endured ſo long: but many Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies haue continued 1000. and 1200. yeeres in the ſame eſtate. Moreouer, they are agreeable to the vpright lawes of nature, which (as we haue before diſcourſed) do al lead vs to a Monarchy. But there is more to be conſidered of in our French kingdome, which ought to mooue all French harts very much to deſire the preſeruation therof, and to thinke themſelues happy, that they may liue vnder it: I meane that which we touched in the beginning of our ſpeech: namely, the agreement &amp; participation, which it hath with all good policies. Many Politicks haue giuen<note place="margin">The opinion of many Politicks touching a mixt eſtate of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</note> this out, that no Common-wealth inſtituted to continue long, ought to be ſimple or of one only kind: but that the

vertues &amp; properties of the other Eſtates muſt meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in it, to the end that nothing grow out of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might cauſe it to degenerate to the next euill, and ſo conſequently ouerthrow it.

The Carthaginian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth alſo, moſt floriſhing for a long time, was ſo inſtituted in the beginning thereof.

The Romane Common-wealth, during the time of hir greateſt glorie, had theſe 3. parts ſo equally &amp; proportionably tempered, that a man could not tell, whether it were altogither Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical, or Democratical, or Monarchicall. In looking to the power of the Conſuls, a man would haue iudged it Monarchical &amp; Roial: to the Senators, Ariſtocratical: to<note place="margin">The eſtate of Venice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> the Tribunes &amp; common ſort, Democratical. The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth repreſent al theſe eſtates. Their great Councel hauing ſoueraign power, wherof the Senat &amp; the authority of al their Magiſtrats dependeth, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Popular eſtate. The Duke, who is Preſident as long as he liueth, repreſenteth the roial power, bicauſe he eſpecially retaineth the grauity &amp; dignity therof. And the Colledge of ten men, with the Colledge of ancients, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Sages, repreſenteth the Ariſtocraty, as <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus</hi>

As for our French Monarchy, it may wel be ſaid alſo to be partaker of all 3. in regard of the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof, albeit in truth the eſtate therof is a ſimple &amp; pure Monarchy. For the king is the Monarch, beloued, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beied, &amp; reuerenced: who although he haue all power &amp; ſoueraigne authority to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, &amp; to do what he will, yet this great &amp; ſoueraigne liberty ſeemeth in ſome ſort to be ruled &amp; limited by good lawes &amp; ordinances: and by the multitude &amp; great authority of Officers, &amp; Counſellors,
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:8689:328"/>
who are aſwell neere his perſon, as in ſundry places of his kingdom. The 12. Peeres, the ſecret &amp; priuy councels, the Parliament &amp; great Councel, the Chambers of accounts, the Treaſorers, &amp; Generals of charges reſemble in ſome ſort the Ariſtocraty.

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the general Eſtates of the Realme, which are woont to be gathered togither to deliberate (the king being Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) of all matters concerning the Eſtate, doe they not ſufficiently teſtifie the happie order therof, drawing neere to the gouernment of a good Oeconomiſt, when the king (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith) commandeth in his kingdome, as a good father of a familie ruleth ouer his children, with loue, and according to right and iuſtice? Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the authoritie of Officers, Counſellors, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Eſtates, dependeth (as riuers of a fountaine) of the onely power of their king and Prince, yet of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and royall goodnes he granteth them ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that hardly could he do any thing that were very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, or too preiudiciall to his ſubiects. And if ſome ſuch actions may be noted, they come rather through the fault of his Counſellors, than from his Maieſty. Thus let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with <hi>Plato,</hi> that the royall gouernment and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to be preferred before all others policies, as that which draweth neereſt to the diuinitie. But it muſt haue a Senate of good men ioined vnto it, after the forme of an Ariſtocratie, as our kings haue alwaies vſed to haue, of their natural benignitie, which maketh them inclinable to all exerciſes of vertue, pietie, and iuſtice.</p>

<pb n="629" facs="tcp:8689:329"/>
and infamie I will heere diſplay. The firſt and moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<note place="margin">How the firſt Monarchy came vp.</note> kind of Monarchy was that, which was voluntarily offered by the people for ſome heroicall vertue appeering in thoſe men whom they iudged worthie to gouerne them iuſtly and vprightly. And when they continued in this ſort to declare themſelues benefactors of the multitude, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering them togither, in giuing vnto them territories, and in diſtributing lands among them, in finding out of arts, in making of warre, and in the adminiſtration of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice vnto them, their authoritie and power did lawfully deſcend to their ſucceſſors, who had ſoueraigne power in time of warre, and were chiefe in certain ſolemn cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their ſacrifices. <hi>Herodotus, Demosthenes, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, Cicero,</hi> and many others, make mention of this kind of Monarchy. After the floud, when the number of men increaſed, <hi>Noah</hi> perſwaded his children, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his poſteritie, to diſperſe themſelues in diuers countries, to till the ground, and to build townes, and to this ende he aſſigned to euery one his Prouince by lot. <hi>Nimrod</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cuſh,</hi> whoſe grandfather <hi>Noah</hi> was, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode<note place="margin">Gen. 10. 8. of the raigne of Nimrod.</note> with his men in the land of the Chaldeans, and was their firſt king, and the firſt king of Babylon. He was<note place="margin">Nimrod was the firſt king that warred vpon his neighbours.</note> the firſt that beganne to extend his bounds by force vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his neighbours, ſending whole companies of people into many and diuers countries, to laye the foundations of other kingdomes, as hiſtories doe giue vs certaine knowledge thereof. This is the cauſe why many eſtabliſh the firſt Monarchy in Aſſyria vnder him. We read alſo in good authors, that the firſt and ancient kings of Egypt kept themſelues a long time in this heroical vertue, which<note place="margin">Of the happie raigne of the king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Egypt.</note> had procured vnto them their dignitie. They liued not diſorderedly, as thoſe doe, who bicauſe of their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, iudge their owne will to be a iuſt lawe for them, but they followed the conſtitutions of lawes, aſwell in the gathering of their duties and tributes, as in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life. They vſed the ſeruice of Noble mens and of<note place="margin">They vſed the ſeruice onely of Noble mens children, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd they wel learned</note> Princes children onely, who were of the age of twentie yeeres, and were inſtructed in all ſciences. The reaſon
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:8689:330"/>
whereof was, that the king being pricked forward with the ſight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were about him, might beware how he committed any thing woorthie of reproch. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is nothing that corrupteth Princes ſo much as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſeruants, who ſeeke to pleaſe their ſenſuall deſires and affections. When the king aroſe in the morning, he was bound firſt to take and receiue all the letters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts that were brought vnto him, that anſwering neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie matters firſt, all his affaires might be guided by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and reaſon. Then he went to the Temple to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the gods, where the Prelate and chiefe Prieſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">The Prieſts of Egypt vſed to praiſe their Princes in the Temple before the people.</note> the ſacrifice and praiers were ended, rehearſed with a loud voice in the preſence of the people, what vertues were in the king, what reuerence and religion towardes the gods was in him, and what clemencie and humanitie towards men. Moreouer, he told that he was continent, iuſt, noble-minded, true, liberall, one that brideled his deſires, and puniſhed malefactors with a more mild and light puniſhment than the greatnes of their ſinne and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence required, rewarding alſo his ſubiects with graces &amp; gifts that were greater than their deſerts. This done, he exhorted the king to a happie life agreeable to the gods, and likewiſe to good manners, by following after honor and vertue, and therewithall propounded vnto him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine examples of the excellent deedes of ancient kings,<note place="margin">The diet of the ancient kings of Egypt.</note> thereby to prouoke him the rather therunto. Theſe kings liued with ſimple meates, as with veale &amp; birds for all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes: they kept very exactly all the lawes and ordinances of their countrie in euery point of their life, which was no leſſe directed euen in the leaſt things, than the ſimpleſt of their ſubiects. And truly ſo long as the kings of Egypt were ſuch zealous obſeruers of their lawes, and of iuſtice, &amp; raigned peaceably among their ſubiects, they brought many ſtrang nations into their ſubiection, &amp; gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither infinite riches, whereby they adorned their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie with great buildings and ſumptuous works, and dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note place="margin">Of the ſecond kind of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> their townes with many gifts and benefits. The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian kingdomes were the ſecond kinde of Monarchy:
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:8689:330"/>
namely, the ancient Monarchies of the Aſſyrians, Medes, and Perſians, whoſe Princes vſurped Lordlie rule ouer their goods and perſons, and gouerned their ſubiects as a father of a familie doth his ſlaues. Which kind of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſauoureth more of a tyrannie, than of a kingdome: beſides, it is directly againſt the law of nature, which kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth euery one in his libertie, and in the poſſeſſion of his owne goods. Notwithſtanding when by the law of Arms, and of iuſt warre, a Prince is made Lord ouer any people, they properly belong to him that conquereth, and they that are ouercome, are made his ſlaues by the ancient<note place="margin">The difference betweene a Lord-like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and a ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ranny.</note> conſent of all nations: and this maketh the difference betweene the Lord-like Monarchy, and a tyrannic, which abuſeth free ſubiects as ſlaues. Of this ſecond kinde of Monarchy was the kingdome of Perſia (as <hi>Plato</hi> writeth) vnder <hi>Cambyſes, Xerxes,</hi> and other kings, vntill the laſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> For vſurping more abſolute authoritie to rule, than<note place="margin">Marks of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> was conuenient, they began to contemne their Vaſſals, and to account of them as of ſlaues: and putting no more confidence in them, they intertained into their ſeruice mercenarie ſouldiors and ſtrangers, whereby they made their owne ſubiects vnfit for warre, and ſo in the end loſt their eſtate, when it ſeemed to haue attained to the top of worldlie proſperitie. Such is the eſtate of the Turke at this<note place="margin">Of the eſtate of the Turke.</note> day, wherein he is ſole Lord, commanding ouer his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in rigorous manner, aſwell ouer the Muſulmans, as Chriſtians, and Iewes. He vſeth in his principall affaires, which concerne peace and warre, and matters of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſeruice of runnagate ſlaues, whom he placeth in authoritie, changeth or depoſeth as he thinks good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peril and enuie: yea he ſtrangleth them vpon the leaſt ſuſpition or diſlike conceiued of them, not ſparing his owne children and others of his blood, if they anger him. So did <hi>Sultan Solyman</hi> deale with <hi>Hibrahim Baſcha,</hi> who was<note place="margin">The death of Hibrahim Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha.</note> almoſt of equall authoritie with him: inſomuch that he was there called the Seignour, king of the Ianitzaries, the <hi>Baſcha,</hi> and king of the men of Armes. Neuertheles in one night, wherin he made him ſtay &amp; ſup with him, &amp; lie in his
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:8689:331"/>
owne chamber, he cauſed him to be ſlaine, and his bodie to be caſt into the ſea. The morrow after he ſeazed vpon his goods, as confiſcate, and caried them away: and yet no man euer knewe the cauſe of his death, except it were this, that he was growne too great, and conſequently ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of his maiſter, who was a Tyrant, rather than a<note place="margin">The Turke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of all Lordſhips at his pleaſure.</note> King. Likewiſe he keepeth in his hands all the Lordſhips of his kingdome, which he diſtributeth to men of warre, who are charged to maintaine a certaine number of men of Armes, and of horſes, according to the rate of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenew: and when it pleaſeth him he taketh them away againe. Neither is there any man in all the countries vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his obedience, that poſſeſſeth Townes, Caſtles, and Villages, or dwelleth in ſtrong houſes, or that dare build higher than one ſtorie, or than a Dooue-houſe. The great<note place="margin">Of the Eſtate of Moſcouia.</note> Knes, or Duke of Moſcouia, exceedeth for ſeueritie and rigour of commanding, all the Monarchs in the world, hauing obtained ſuch authoritie ouer his ſubiects both Eccleſiaſticall and ſecular, that he may diſpoſe of their goods and liues at his pleaſure, ſo that none dare gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay him in any thing. They confeſſe publikely, that the will of their prince is the will of God, and that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">Of the king of Ethiopia.</note> he doth, is done by the will of God. The king of Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia is alſo a Lordlike Monarch, hauing (as <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> affirmeth) 50. kings no leſſe ſubiect vnto him than ſlaues.<note place="margin">The king of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his Lords like ſlaues.</note> And <hi>Frauncis Aluarez</hi> writeth, that he hath ſeene the great Chancellour of that countrie ſcourged ſtarke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with other Lords, as the very ſlaues of the prince, wherein they thinke themſelues greatly honoured. The<note place="margin">Of the kingdom of Peru.</note> Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, hauing brought vnder his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience the kingdome of Peru, made himſelfe ſoueraigne Lord thereof in regard of goods, which the ſubiects haue not, but as they farme them, or for terme of life at the<note place="margin">Of the third kind of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> moſt. The third kind of Monarchy, whereof the Ancients made mention, was that of Lacedemonia, wherein the king had not abſolute power, but in time of warre out of the countrie, and a certaine preheminence ouer the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. We made mention of their gouernment before. The
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:8689:331"/>
firſt kings in Rome were ſacrificers alſo, and afterward, the emperors called themſelues <hi>Pontifices,</hi> that is, chiefe bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: and thoſe of Conſtantinople were conſecrated, as<note place="margin">What kings took vpon them ſoueraigntie in religion.</note> our kings of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are. In like maner the Caliphaes of the Saraſins were kings and chiefe biſhops in their religion: the one in Bagdet, the other in Cayre. The king of Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuth is chiefe of his religion, and for this cauſe goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other kings of India in dignitie, and is called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> that is to ſay, God on earth. The Pope commandeth ouer the temporalties of the church, called S. <hi>Peters</hi> patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, as king: and is reaſt of the latin chriſtian churches, as head of the religion, I meane in thoſe places, &amp; of thoſe perſons, where he is ſo taken and acknowledged. The king of England certaine yeeres paſt tooke vpon him the title of king and ſupreme gouernor of the Church. The fourth<note place="margin">Of the 4. kind of monarchie which is electiue</note> kind of monarchie is electiue, not hereditarie: in ſome places for terme of life, as the empire of Almaigne, the kingdom of Polonia, of Bohemia, and of Hungaria: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places for a certaine time, as was the Dictatorſhip at Rome. Theſe eſtates are not commonly ſo ſure and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as thoſe that are hereditarie, bicauſe of the practiſes &amp; foreſtalling of voyces, which are for the moſt part vſed, wherupon ſeditions ariſe, to the great detriment of thoſe kingdomes.

it was prooued, that at ſundry tumults mooued at this election, they had ſlaine an hundreth and ſixteene men.<note place="margin">In the empire of Germanie.</note> As touching the Empire of Almaigne, their hiſtories are full of impoueriſhmentes fallen vpon them through the election of their Emperours, as well by ciuill warres, as by murders and poiſonings.

This eſtate hauing continued about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeeres, was not long ſince quite ouerthrowen by Sultan Selym king of the Turkes, who tooke the laſt Souldane, and cauſed him to bee caried vpon an olde<note place="margin">The great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta electiue, and that alſo of Pruſſia.</note> Cammell all a-long Cayre, and then to be hanged vpon one of the gates of that Citie.

By which moderation his power is not leſſened, but made ſurer, more durable, and leſſe burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to his ſubiects, being wholy ſeparated from tiranny, which is hated of God and men, as we may haue further knowledge by diſcourſing thereof particularly. So that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and beſides thoſe fiue kindes of monarchies mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of vs, tiranny may be put for the ſixt, which we may call that, wherein the monarch treading vnder foote the lawes of nature, abuſeth the libertie of free ſubiects, as if they were ſlaues, and other mens goods as his owne.

In this reſpect therfore was this dominion &amp; rule called tyrannical, bicauſe it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned in lord-like maner without right ouer free men, compelled and forced to obey. But generally we may call that a tirannie, when the prince accounteth all his will as a iuſt law, and hath no care either of pietie, iuſtice, or faith, but doth all things for his owne priuate profite, reuenge, or pleaſure. And as a good king conformeth himſelfe to<note place="margin">The difference between a good king and a tyrant.</note> the lawes of God and nature, ſo a tyrant treadeth them vnder foote: the one ſtriueth to enriche his ſubiects, the other to deſtroy them: the one taketh reuenge of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like iniuries, and pardoneth his owne, the other cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuengeth iniuries done to himſelfe, and forgiueth thoſe that are offered to others: the one ſpareth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of chaſte women, the other triumpheth in their ſhame: the one taketh pleaſure to be freely admoniſhed, and wiſely reprooued when he hath done amiſſe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſliketh nothing ſo much, as a graue, free, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man: the one maketh great account of the loue of his people, the other of their feare: the one is neuer in feare but for his ſubiects, the other ſtandeth in awe of none more than of them: the one burtheneth his as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as may be, and then vpon publike neceſſitie, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppeth vp their bloud, gnaweth their bones, and ſucketh the marrow of his ſubiectes to ſatiſfie his deſires: the one giueth eſtates and offices to meete with briberie and oppreſſion of the people, the other ſelleth them as deare as may bee, and careth not for the oppreſſion of his ſubiectes: the one in time of warre hath no recourſe but to his ſubiects, the other warreth againſt none but them: the one hath no garde or garriſon but of his owne people, the other none but of ſtraungers: the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth in aſſured reſt, the other languiſheth in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feare: the one is honoured in his life tyme, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for after his death, the other is defamed in his lyfe, and rent in pieces after his death.

They ground this vpon a fooliſh and fond ſuperſtition which they haue in cauſing the Queene to bee defloured by ſome young prieſt called Bramin, in whoſe cuſtodie ſhe remaineth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after, ſo long as the King is abroade. Whereuppon they preſume, and peraduenture not without good cauſe, that the children which deſcend or are borne of that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, hold more of the prieſt than of the prince. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning kingdomes that goe by election, we haue ſpoken of them alreadie. Now bicauſe it is a very harde matter to
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:8689:336"/>

But where the prince is by nature and not by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, men muſt labour by carefull induſtrie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to bring him vp, and to inſtruct him well by reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his mind with ſound opinions from his infancie, and by caſting vpon his new ground ſeedes of vertue and honeſtie, which by little and little may growe and waxe ripe with age, and hauing once taken roote, may abide ſtedfaſt and firme to his liues ende. For there is no time<note place="margin">When a prince may beſt be corrected.</note> better and fitter to frame and to correct a prince in, than when he knowes not that he is a prince. For if he learne to obey from his infancie, when hee commeth to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of commaunding, he applieth and behaueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a great deale better with his ſubiectes, than they that from their youth haue been alwayes free and exempted from ſubiection. For by ſuch education or bringing vp, a Prince addeth to his royall greatneſſe, and to thoſe faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which great men haue by nature, curteſie and gentle behauiour, which cannot but bee very acceptable to his people, and containe them more willingly in their duetie of obedience. Therefore the prince in his yong and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeeres muſt bee diligently imployed, not onely in with-drawing him from diſhoneſt things, but alſo in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to taſte of vertue, and to haue ſome preceptes thereof ingrauen in his brayne, vntill in the ende he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all that belongeth to his duetie, and whatſoeuer elſe may helpe him forward to leade a good and happie life. If wiſe fathers with great care bring vp, and inſtruct their children, who ſhall ſucceed them but in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome litle houſe in the countrey, how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care and labor ought to be taken in teaching him well &amp; wiſely, who is to ſucceed in the Empire ouer much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and whoſe life ought to be the diſcipline of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners &amp; conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? For this cauſe a good &amp; prudent prince muſt take pains in cauſing his children to be brought vp, that he remember he hath begotten them for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,

And truely it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of an excellent prince to rule in ſuch ſorte, as if hee would ſtriue, that his like for goodneſſe and iuſtice<note place="margin">How a prince ought to liue himſelfe, and to bring vp his children.</note> coulde not ſucceed him, and ſo to bring vp his children, as if hee deſired that they ſhoulde ſurmount him in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. To this ende therefore let him make choice of all his ſubiectes, yea from what place ſo euer, and gather together vertuous and ſincere men, vncorrupted, graue, and ſuch as are learned not onely through preceptes, but alſo through the experience of manye thinges, to whome their age breedeth reuerence, their good lyfe authoritie, and their mildeneſſe and gentle behauiour<note place="margin">What teachers a yong prince muſt haue.</note> loue, and good-will: that the tender ſpirite of the yong prince, offended with the rough dealyng of his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, may not beginne to hate vertue before he know it, nor yet corrupted through their ouer-great gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, degenerate and ſtarte aſide where it ought not.

And when he perceiueth that his tender nature inclineth to honeſt and commendable things, or to ſuch vices as will eaſilie change into vertues in princes well brought vp, as to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and prodigalitie, he muſt pricke him forward, and helpe his good nature by diligent trauel. Neither muſt he vſe precepts onely to withdraw the prince from diſhoneſt<note place="margin">How a yong prince muſt be taught.</note> things, &amp; to procure in him a longing deſire to doe thoſe things that are vertuous, but he muſt labor to imprint and

to roote them in his memory by diuers formes, now by ſentences, another while by fables, after by compariſons, then by examples, or by ſome notable ſayings, ingrauen in rings, and painted in tables. Briefly, if there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing wherein this age taketh pleaſure, let that be a meane to worke in him a taſte of vertue. Aboue al things ſpeciall regard is to be had, what opinions are ingrauen in the prince his braine. For the whole order of his life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from that fountaine. And therfore he muſt labor immediately to imprint in his mind holy and good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may ſerue for a counter-poiſon againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errors of the ignorant people: but chiefly to inſtruct him throughly in gods truth, &amp; in that which concerneth his ſaluation. He muſt perſwade him, that whatſoeuer is<note place="margin">Deu. 17. 18. 19 The law of God belongeth to the prince.</note> taught in the law of God, belongeth to none ſo much as to the prince, and that as he is to raign by him, ſo likewiſe it belongeth to his office to raigne according to his will, that he may enioy proſperitie in this world, and eternall felicitie in the bleſſed life to come. Let him be taught to loue vertue as the only good, and to hate vice as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euil: let him know that the one is folowed no leſſe with ſhame and diſhonor, than the other with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, eſpecially in a prince, in whom if vertue take place, as it were in a high watch-tower, it ſhineth ſo cleerely, that the brightnes thereof remaineth long after his death. As for all worldly pompe, antiquitie of petigree, images and riches, they are but meere vanitie and folly, not woorthie to be cared for, or to be admired by a vertuous prince. Let him be perſwaded that dignitie, greatnes and maieſtie are not to be ſought after by the helpe of fortune, or by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means, but by wiſdome, integritie of life &amp; maners, and by vertuous and noble deeds. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith not without<note place="margin">When a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is happy.</note> cauſe, that a Common-wealth will neuer be happie vntill princes play the Philoſophers, or Philoſophers take the rudder of the Empire in hand. Now his meaning is not to cal him a Philoſopher, that is learned in Logike, in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philoſophie, and in the Mathematicks, but him, who with an vntamed hart deſpiſeth the vaine ſhadowes of

things, and followeth after true goods. A philoſopher and<note place="margin">The agreement between a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and a Chriſtian.</note> a Chriſtian differ but in name: and a prince wel inſtructed in piety, is truly both the one and the other. Therefore he ought to learne nothing ſooner (next to the law of God) than the morall philoſophie of the auncients, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all vertue. Is there any thing more fooliſh than to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme highly of a prince if he vaute well, if he play well at tenniſe, if he be ſtoute and ſtrong: briefly, if he be cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſome things, which peraduenture a peaſant would doe better than he, and in the meane while he is puffed vp with pride, he polleth his people, and ſporteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in all kind of diſſoluteneſſe and pleaſure? What ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is it for a prince to go farre beyond the common ſort in precious ſtones, gold, purple, traine of ſeruants, and in other ornaments of the body, and in euery thing that is falſly called good, and in the meane while to be farre inferior in the true goods of the ſoule to many of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thoſe of loweſt calling? Theſe opinions, as holy and inuiolable lawes, muſt bee ingrauen in the hart of a young prince, and muſt bee, as it were the firſt lines that are to be drawen in the voide table of his ſoule, namely, that he muſt ſtriue that none excell him in the goods of the ſoule, in wiſdome, magnanimitie, temperance and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.<note place="margin">Wherin a prince ought to excell others.</note> Frugalitie, modeſtie, and ſobrietie in other men may be attributed either to pouertie or to niggardlines, but in a prince they cannot but be a note of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance, I meane, when he vſeth goods modeſtly, who hath as much as he will. Ancient men called that prudence miſerable, which was gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the experience of things, bicauſe it is bought with publike loſſe &amp; calamity. But ſuch kind of experience ought to be fartheſt off from a Prince, bicauſe the longer it is a learning, the greater cauſe is it of many euils vnto al his people. If <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> had reaſon to ſay, that this ſpeech, <hi>I had not thought it,</hi> did not beſeem a wiſe man, how much more vnſeemely is it for a Prince, who cannot vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame without his great harme, and greater to the Common-wealth? For as in a voiage the fault of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mariner (ſaide <hi>Agapetus)</hi> doth but little hurte,

This is the cauſe why the mind of a prince muſt eſpecially be inſtructed with good reſolutions &amp; ſentences, to the end he may be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">A prince ought to be skilfull by reaſon and not by vſe.</note> by reaſon and not by vſe. For then the counſel of aged men will ſupply that experience of things which is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in him. He muſt be giuen to vnderſtand, that his life is in the face of all the world, that he can do nothing that will be hid, and therfore if he be good, it muſt needs turne to the great benefit of many; if wicked, to their hurt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: bicauſe the prince is always the very portrature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſubiects conforme themſelues. He muſt know that the greater honour is giuen vnto him, the more he is to ſtriue that he may be woorthie of it, looking more to his owne doyngs and actions, than to the prayſes that men giue him, which he muſt beleeue and receiue, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">How a prince is to receiue the praiſes that are giuen him.</note> as he behaueth himſelfe. For if hee rule well, they are due vnto him; if ill, he is honoured and praiſed, either through conſtraint, or of flatterie: or els it is to ſhew him vnder hand what he ought to bee. Let him know that as God hath placed the Sunne and the Moone in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens for a reſemblaunce of his diuinitie: ſo a prince is the like repreſentation and light in a kingdome, as long as he hath the feare of GOD, and the obſeruation of iuſtice imprinted in him. For theſe two things make their life diuine and celeſtiall, that are placed in high degree of power and authoritie: as contrarywiſe, the contempt of pietie and iuſtice, maketh it beaſt-like and ſauage. As God the giuer of all things ſtandeth not in neede of any mans ſeruice to receiue a good turne of him: ſo it is the dutie of a worthie prince, who repreſenteth the figure of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note place="margin">Good precepts for princes ſet out by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.</note> king, to profite euery one with-out reſpect of his owne commoditie and glory. As God is not touched with any affections or paſſions, but ruleth and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all thinges perfectly by his prouidence: ſo after his example a prince laying aſide the perturbations
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:8689:339"/>
of his ſoule muſt follow reaſon onely in all his dooings. As there is nothing more common than the ſunne, which imparteth of hir light to all the celeſtiall bodies: ſo a Prince muſt be alwaies readye to profite the Common-wealth, and haue within him the light of wiſedome, to the end that if others looſe their brightnes, yet he may neuer be ouertaken with darknes. As the Sunne when it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Zodiacke mooueth ſloweſt: ſo the higher that a Prince is lift vp in greatnes and authoritie, the more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and gratious he ought to be, keeping himſelfe from dooing any thing that beſeemeth not a Prince. Therefore let him thinke, that nothing is more vile and abiect, than for him that is called a king and Prince of free men, to become a ſlaue to riot, choler, couetouſnes, ambition, &amp; other vices of like qualitie, which are moſt vile and cruell maiſters. He muſt be ſo affected towards his ſubiects, as a good father of a familie is towards thoſe of his houſhold: bicauſe a kingdome is nothing els but a great familie, and<note place="margin">A kingdome is but a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</note> a king the father of a great many. For although he paſſe them in greatnes and authoritie, yet he is of one and the ſame kind with them, a man commanding men, and free ouer thoſe that are free, not ouer beaſts or ſlaues, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſaith very well. And if he would haue that excellent title, which we giue to God the Prince of all men, calling him <hi>Our father,</hi> he muſt procure it not by threatnings and feare, but by good deedes, by meekenes and humanitie, which will ſtand him in ſteede of a ſure Gard to preſerue his eſtate. For the loue and loialtie of his ſubiects will<note place="margin">The ſafetie of Monarchies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of the loue and loialtie of ſubiects.</note> greatly encreaſe thereby, of which the aſſurance of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies dependeth. When the nobilitie and common-people vſe to feare, not him, but for his ſake that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them, then he ſeeth with many eies, heareth with many eares, and perceiueth a farre off whatſoeuer is done. Let the Prince haue this ſaying of <hi>Plutarke</hi> alwaies engrauen in his ſoule: <hi>That nothing heere below pleaſeth God more, or draweth neerer to his diuine nature, than to rule well in all iuſtice and equitie,</hi> which is the chiefeſt charge of his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that vnto which he is ſtraightly bound in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:8689:340"/>
                     <note place="margin">The mutuall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Prince and his ſubiects.</note> of his ſubiects. For as the ſubiect oweth obedience, aide, and reuerence to his Lord: ſo the Prince oweth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, defence, and protection, to his ſubiects. When a Prince ſheweth himſelfe vpright, indifferent, and true of his word to all, it is the greateſt felicitie that can happen to a Common-wealth, and that which crowneth the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch<note place="margin">What praiſe a Prince is to ſeek after.</note> thereof with greater glorie and honour. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Prince ought to be more carefull to obtaine that praiſe and reputation which proceedeth of goodnes and vertue, than that which commeth of ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For as the diuine nature, vnto which kings muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to conforme their woorks and actions, excelleth all other eſſences and natures chiefly in three things, that is, in immortalitie, power, and goodnes: ſo a Prince muſt ſtriue to excell his ſubiects, not ſo much in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of his name, or in power, as in goodnes, which vertue is certainly much more venerable, and draweth<note place="margin">The whole world is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in reſpect of ſubſtance, but not of qualities.</note> neereſt to the diuinitie. For to be incorruptible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, the fower Elements, and the whole frame are indued with that qualitie, as naturall Philoſophers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. And as for ſtrength and power, earthquakes, lightnings, tempeſtuous whirlewinds, flouds and inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of waters, are full of force and might: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is partaker of iuſtice, vprightnes, and equitie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be diuine, and that by the meanes of reaſon and vnderſtanding. So that (as the ſame <hi>Plutark</hi> ſaith) we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are capeable of that Good of vertue that commeth from God. To be ſhort, let the Prince be diligently taught whileſt he is yoong, and labour to knowe how he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne his name with works anſwerable to thoſe excellent Epithits and titles, wherewith <hi>Iulius Pollux,</hi> who was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour to the Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> in his yoong yeeres,<note place="margin">Excellent titles of a good Prince.</note> ſetteth foorth a good king.

Therefore a wiſe Prince will not thinke himſelfe the happier, bicauſe he ſucceedeth in a greater Empire and kingdome, but remember rather, that he lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo much the more care and paine vpon his ſhoulders, and that he beginneth then to haue leſſe leaſure, leſſe reſt and happines in paſſing away his time. In other perſons, a fault is pardoned in youth, and growing old, they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:8689:342"/>
to take their eaſe. But he that is Head of a Common-wealth, bicauſe he is to trauell for all, muſt be neyther yoong nor old. For he can-not commit a fault how ſmall ſoeuer it be, without the hurt of many men, nor yet reſt from his dutie, but it will turne to the miſerie of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. This cauſed the Philoſophers to ſay, that a Prince ought not to dedicate the Common-wealth to himſelfe, but to addict himſelf to the Common-wealth, and for the profit thereof alwaies to be diligent, vertuous, and wiſe, &amp; ſo to gouerne his Empire, that he may be able eaſily to giue a reaſon of his charge. And bicauſe no man asketh an<note place="margin">The Prince muſt giue account to none but to God.</note> account of him in this life, he ought to be ſo much the more ſtirred vp to demand a ſtraighter reckoning of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being aſſured that the time wil come, and that ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, wherein he muſt yeeld it vp before him, with whome there is no reſpect of Princes, except in this, that they ſhal haue the Iudge more rigorous againſt them, that haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed greater power and authority. To begin therfore to handle the duty and office of a Prince: firſt, he muſt haue<note place="margin">The firſt and principall dutie of a Prince is to haue the law of God before his eies. Pſal. 119.</note> the lawe of God continually before his eies: he muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue it in his ſoule, and meditate vpon the wordes and ordinances thereof, all the dayes of his life, deſiring of God to graunt him the ſpirite of vnderſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them well, and according to that diuine rule to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all his intents and actions to the glorie of that great, eternall, and Almightye Kinge of Kinges: aſwell for the ſaluation of his owne ſoule, which he ought to preferre before the rule of the whole worlde: as for the good of thoſe that are committed to his charge to gouerne, teach and iudge them. For it is moſte certaine, that of the knowledge of the truth in the Prince his hart, all good order of his Eſtate dependeth: and that his pietie is of<note place="margin">The pietie of the prince is of great force with his ſubiects to ſtirre them vp to their dutie.</note> great force to awaken his ſubiects in their dutie: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they ſee him followe and cleaue to true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without faining and diſſimulation. Therefore he muſt carefully prouide, that falſe doctrines, hereſies, blaſphemies agaynſt the name of GOD and his truth, with other offences in matters of religion, be not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:8689:343"/>
broached &amp; ſowne amongſt the people, but that ſome publike forme of Chriſtian religion may alwaies be ſeene in his kingdome, which is the ſure foundation of euery well eſtabliſhed Monarchy. But heerein that which I ſaid before, is diligently to be noted: namely, that the Prince through wiſedome craued before at the hands of God,<note place="margin">The Prince muſt be ſure that the religion he maintaineth is the iuſt will of God.</note> muſt be well aſſured of his diuine, iuſt, and eternall will, and according to that, take order that true pietie may not be publikely violated and polluted by an vncorrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted libertie. Next, we will briefly comprehend all thoſe points, which ancient men both Philoſophers and Chriſtians<note place="margin">The duties of a Prince compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in three points.</note> haue required in an abſolute and perfect Prince, in three principall duties and actions: that is, in ruling, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and in defending. He muſt rule by good lawes, and by good example; iudge by wiſedome, prouidence, and iuſtice; and defend by prowes, care, and vigilancie. Theſe duties, that excellent greek Orator and Philoſopher <hi>Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſeemeth to haue couertly contained in theſe words,<note place="margin">Iſocrates argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoreby he prooueth the good raigne of a Prince.</note> which he wrote to <hi>Nicocles</hi> the Prince: <hi>This may prooue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee that thou hast raigned well, if thou ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt that the people, which is ſubiect vnto thee, encreaſe in modestie and wealth vnder thy gouernment. For good lawes, iustice, and good example of life, make ſubiects better, and prudence ioined with fortitude and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, richer.</hi> Now that a good Prince (I call him good and iuſt that imploieth all his power to be ſuch a one, being ready to ſpend his bloud and life for his people) may attaine to theſe excellent qualities, his loue, and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">A Prince muſt loue his ſubiects.</note> his ſubiects, is very neceſſarie, as that which is able to preſerue the indiſſoluble bond of mutuall good will betweene them &amp; him, which is one of the ſureſt meanes<note place="margin">He muſt begin reformation at himſelfe.</note> to maintaine great Eſtates and Monarchies. Next, he is to begin the good ordering of his Eſtate at himſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme firſt of all, all diſorder in his owne life and maners, &amp; correct thoſe things that are moſt ſecrete in his court: knowing that from thence forward he muſt liue as it were in an open Theater, where he is ſeene on euery ſide, ſo that his life will be a diſcipline and inſtruction of good or ill liuing vnto others. Therefore let him ſtriue to excell
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:8689:343"/>
thoſe whom he ruleth, &amp; to ſurmount them as far in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as he ſurpaſſeth them in riches &amp; honor. Amongſt al thoſe that followe him, he muſt alwaies haue the wiſeſt<note place="margin">He muſt haue the wiſeſt next his perſon.</note> next his perſon, &amp; cal others from al parts neere vnto him, not refuſing or contemning any man of skill &amp; reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He muſt often heare them, learne of them, &amp; being a Iudge amongſt ſuch as are leſſe skilfull, ſtriue to go beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the beſt learned through diligence and ſtudye. By which kind of exerciſes he ſhal knowe how to gouerne the eſtate of his kingdom vprightly, &amp; cannot but do ſuch things as are praiſe-woorthy. And foraſmuch as common tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity &amp; publike quietnes is one principal end of ciuil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">The firſt dutie of a king to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</note> the firſt duty of a good king towards his ſubiects, is to maintaine them in peace &amp; concord. For it is vnpoſſible that a Common-wealth ſhould flouriſh in religion, iuſtice, charitie, integrity of life: briefly, in all things neceſſary for the preſeruation therof, if the ſubiects enjoy not an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great &amp; aſſured peace. Let the Prince then without intermiſſion, ſeeke after the ſafeſt meanes to keepe his kingdome in quietnes &amp; reſt: let him deliuer his ſubiects from calamitie: let him be careful of al things which may<note place="margin">Good precepts for a Prince.</note> be profitable &amp; commodious vnto them, &amp; let him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them with mildnes, &amp; teach them obedience by the vprightnes of his commandements. Let him not ſuffer his people to be ouer inſolent, nor yet to be troden vnder foote and oppreſſed: but let him take order, that ſuch as are moſt honeſt may be preferred to honors &amp; offices, &amp; that the reſt may not any way be wronged. He muſt alter thoſe ciuill lawes and cuſtoms of liuing, which being ill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, are preiudiciall to his ſubiects, and ordaine all<note place="margin">What manner of lawes are to be eſtabliſhed in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> iuſt and profitable lawes, agreeing with themſelues, and ſuch as breeding but fewe ſuites among his people, may briefly iudge and decide them according to right and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. In this point a good Prince muſt vſe great care and diligence that iuſtice may be well adminiſtred, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of euery mans right, and to the puniſhment of the wicked. This is that which the ſpirite of God ſo often commandeth: namely, to <hi>execute iudgement and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ierem. 22. 3.</note>

                     <hi>to deliuer the oppreſſed from the hands of the oppreſſor, not to vexe the ſtranger, the fatherles, nor the widow, to doe no violence, nor ſhed innocent blood.</hi> And theſe ſelfe ſame things muſt he cauſe to be obſerued by them that are appointed to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe iuſtice in his name. Which bicauſe it was neglected by many kings, they loſt both life and kingdome, as we<note place="margin">Philip loſt his life bicauſe he delaied iuſtice.</note> read of <hi>Phillip</hi> king of Macedonia, a very mild Prince, and of an excellent nature, who was neuertheles ſlaine by <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> bicauſe he delaied a long time to let him haue right and iuſtice, concerning an iniurie which an other<note place="margin">Demetrius threw the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of his ſubiects into a water.</note> had offered him. <hi>Demetrius</hi> alſo loſt his kingdome, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not abide to heare his ſubiects, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for this matter. One day when many ſupplications were preſented vnto him, he put them into the plaites of his cloake, and paſſing ouer a bridge he threwe them all into the water, and would not once vouchſafe to read them: whereupon the people being filled with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rebelled againſt him. On the other ſide, a good Prince ought freely, and at all howers of the day, to heare the complaints of his ſubiects, and to prouide thereafter, as one that is truly zealous of iuſtice, clemencie, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which are rather diuine than humane qualities, and moſt proper to him that will conforme himſelfe aſmuch as may be (as it becommeth him) to that heauenlye ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is alwaies iuſt and mercifull, and (as <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith) ruleth all things without compulſion, mollifieng the neceſſitie of obeying by admonition and perſwaſion of reaſon. Nothing is more conuenient for a Soueraigne than gentlenes, for a Prince than clemencie, for a King than mercie: and yet ſeueritie and rigour of iuſtice are no leſſe neceſſarie ornaments, for the diſcharge of his dutie,<note place="margin">A prince muſt execute iuſtice vpon the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours of the law of God and of nature.</note> and the good of his ſubiects. Therfore in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth diuine and naturall right, &amp; the puniſhment eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the tranſgreſſion therof, he muſt alwaies vſe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and beware leaſt his facilitie in granting fauor &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, make him a promoter of euill, which (as <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> ſaith) if he leaue vnpuniſhed, is transferred vnto his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie. But when the Prince onely is offended through
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:8689:344"/>
ſome light contempt, or excuſable breach of his Edicts, it cannot but be commendable in him to vſe pardon &amp; pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.<note place="margin">When it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in him to ſhew mercie.</note> Theſe are thoſe ſtrong and mighty chaines, which (as <hi>Dion</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the king of Syracuſa) will preſerue his kingdom in a happy, flouriſhing and peaceable eſtate, I meane goodnes and iuſtice. For force, feare, &amp; the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his gard, aſſure not the eſtate of a Prince ſo well, as the good wil, affection, fauour, and loue of his ſubiects, which he may obtaine by goodnes and iuſtice. They one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">How a Prince may preſerue his kingdome a great while without danger.</note> (ſaid <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> inſtructing his ſonne) are to hold a kingdom long time without danger, who by good behauiour and iuſt dealing imprint in the harts of their ſubiects, not a feare of their power, but a mutuall loue of their vertue. For thoſe ſubiects are to bee ſuſpected that ſerue through conſtraint and extremitie, not they that obey being mooued with reaſon and gentlenes. Theſe holie precepts were ſo well put in practice by this<note place="margin">Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius ſtood not in feare of his ſubiects.</note> good Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> that all his ſubiects had very eaſie acceſſe vnto him: inſomuch that albeit he were a great Monarch, yet he neuer had any gard, no not ſo much as a Porter to his Pallace. Likewiſe king <hi>Numa</hi> put<note place="margin">Numa refuſed the gard of three hundred archers which Romulus had.</note> from him thoſe three hundred Archers, which <hi>Romulus</hi> vſed to haue for his gard: ſaying, that he would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt that people which put their truſt in him, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer that people that diſtruſted him. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when <hi>Plato</hi> ſawe the aboue-named <hi>Dionyſius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed<note place="margin">Plato his ſpeech to Dionyſius concerning his gard.</note> about with many ſouldiours of his Gard, he ſayd vnto him, What? Haſt thou committed ſo many euils, that thou ſtandeſt in neede of ſuch a Gard of armed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes? Nowe it is moſt certaine, that the obedience of the ſubiect ſpringeth and proceedeth from the loue of his Lord, as alſo that the loue of the Lord increaſeth through the obedience of the ſubiect. But bicauſe the wickednes of men is ſo great at this day, that they which ſtriue to be very gratious, are contemned and deſpiſed, it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Prince ſhould ſhew foorth a certaine kind of grauitie and ſeueritie, and according to the times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Grauitie and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie requiſite in a prince.</note> perſons, and occaſions that are offred, cauſe his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

Thus the gentlenes of the Prince accompanied with ſeueritie, his bountie mingled with rigor, and his facilitie<note place="margin">The effects of harmonicall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> with auſteritie will be the meanes that his vertue ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to a harmonical iuſtice, which diſtributeth vprightly that which appertaineth to euery one: reward to whome reward, &amp; puniſhment to whome puniſhment belongeth. From theſe duties &amp; offices of a good Prince towards his ſubiects, already mentioned, proceedeth the fatherly care which he hath of their proſperitie in the preſeruation &amp; encreaſe of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities &amp; riches, ſo far off is he from all headlong deſire to inuade &amp; ſpoile them.

When <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> was in Aſia, he doubled the taxe, and laid a ſecond charge vpon them, that he might haue wherewith to furniſh his immoderate<note place="margin">Hebreas free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſpeech in reproouing Antonius.</note> expences. The Eſtates of the Countrie ſent <hi>Hebreas</hi> to ſhewe him howe the caſe ſtoode with them, who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a maruellous freedome of ſpeech, ſpake vnto him in this manner.

power to giue vs two Summers and two Autumns, two Harueſts and two Vintages. Further, he added this; Aſia hath paied thee 200000. Talents (that was ſix ſcore millions of gold) if all this ſumme came not into thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, call them to account that haue receiued it. But if thou haſt receiued it, and yet haſt nothing left, we are caſt away and vndone. Theſe words ought to be well noted of a prudent Prince, that he may throughly conſider with himſelfe, and keepe a regiſter of all that is leauied of the poore people in his name, leaſt ſome few about him fat themſelues with the oppreſſion and ouerthrow of many, as it commonly falleth out: and let him be ſo carefull of the blood and ſubſtance of that bodie wherof he is head, that he profit all the members equally. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> crieth out againſt ſuch Princes as deuoure the ſubſtaunce of their Vaſſals by loanes and taxes. <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſaith, that the gold<note place="margin">Some gold more vile and baſe than iron.</note> which is taken from ſubiects by tyrannie, is more vile than iron, bicauſe it is wet with the teares of their poore ſubiects. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſaid, that it was a great deale more ſeemelier for the Maieſtie of a king to giue, than to take by polling, and to cloath than to vncloath; the one belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to theeues, and not to Princes and Kings, vnles they will falſifie ſtaine their name.

                     <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, that it was the dutie of a good king to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to his friends, and of his enemies to make good friends, to which purpoſe nothing will helpe him more than liberalitie.

But a ſoueraigne Prince muſt eſpecially haue an eie to this, that the rewards of vertue due to woorthy men be preferred before all his gifts and good turnes, and that he recompence ſuch as haue deſerued any thing, before he giue to them that haue deſerued nothing.

Neither is the eſtimation of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and of a good-turne all one: bicauſe a reward is giuen for deſert, and a benefite by grace. Beſides, a Prince muſt be alwaies true, and as good as his promiſe, that men may giue greater credite to his bare word, than to another mans oath. For it ought to bee as an Oracle, which looſeth his dignitie, when men haue conceiued ſuch an euill opinion of him, that he may not be beleeued vnles he ſweare. And if he pawne his faith at any time, he muſt account it ſacred and inuiolable: bicauſe faith is the foundation and ſtaie of iuſtice, vpon which the eſtate of great men is grounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we diſcourſed elſe-where.<note place="margin">The ſaying of Theopompus.</note> That ſaying of <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of Sparta, is alſo to be well noted by the Prince.

Likewiſe in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he muſt vſe reaſon as a heauenlie guide, hauing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away the perturbations of his ſoule, and eſteeme it a greater and more royall matter to command himſelfe, than others.

If priuate men, borne to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are willing many times to die, that they may purchaſe honour: much more ought kinges to doe thoſe thinges which will procure them honour, feare, and eſtimation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where, during their life, &amp; alſo through their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<note place="margin">A Prince muſt be skilfull in warre, and yet loue peace.</note> ſhine a great while after their death.

Aboue all things<note place="margin">A Prince muſt carefully auoid ciuill diſſention.</note> he muſt feare ciuill diſſentions, as moſt pernitious to his Eſtate, and take aduice prudently concerning the meanes wherby all occaſions of their entrance may be taken from his people.

Therefore to enter into this matter here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and to leaue iudgements to be conſidered of hereafter, we muſt firſt know that the ordinarie Councell of an eſtate, which the Ancients commonlie called a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:8689:348"/>
is the lawfull aſſemblie of counſellors of eſtate, to<note place="margin">What a councel is.</note> giue aduiſe to them that haue ſoueraigne power in euery Common-wealth. When we ſay a lawfull aſſemblie, it is to be vnderſtood of that power which is giuen vnto them by the ſoueraigne to meete togither in time and place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. And where as we call them counſellors of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, it is to diſtinguiſh them from other counſellors and officers, who are often called to giue aduiſe to Princes, euery one according to his vocation and qualitie, and yet are neyther counſellors of eſtate, nor ordinarie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours. Of this councell all the reſt of the publike go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment<note place="margin">The profit of a councell.</note> dependeth, and by this all the partes of the Common-wealth are tied, vnited, and knitte togither, through that direction of religion, iuſtice, warre, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, lawes, magiſtrates and maners which proceedeth from it. Therefore the Senate is very well called by <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A councell or Senate is the ſoule of the common-welth.</note> the ſoule, reaſon, and vnderſtanding of a Common-wealth: whereby he meaneth, that it can no more bee maintained without a councell, than a bodie with-out a ſoule, or a man without reaſon. The Hebrewes likewiſe<note place="margin">The Hebrewes compared it to a foundation.</note> called the councell a foundation where-upon all goodly and commendable actions are built, and without which all enterpriſes are ouerthrowen. Now foraſmuch as there hath been, and are at this day among ſundry nations, ſundry ſortes of gouernments and policies, ſo there is no leſſe difference in the eſtabliſhment of a councell in them, as alſo many alterations in the inſtitution and power thereof. And namely, among the auncient Graecians, beſide the ſeuerall councell of euery Common-wealth, there was the ſacred councell of the Amphictions, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, bicauſe it was inſtituted by <hi>Amphiction</hi> the ſonne of<note place="margin">The councell of the Amphicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                     <hi>Deucalion.</hi> This councell was as it were the generall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of the eſtates of all Graecia, and was helde twiſe a yeere, in Spring time, and in Autumne, at Delphos in the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> for the commoditie of the ſeate thereof, beyng as it were in the middeſt of all Graecia. The authoritie thereof was ſo great, that whatſoeuer was concluded vpon there, the Graecians obſerued and kept it
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:8689:349"/>
inuiolable, whether it were in matters concerning religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pietie towards their gods, or peace and vnitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues. The Lacedemonians and Meſſenians met togither certaine dayes in the yeere at the temple of <hi>Diana</hi> vpon the borders of Laconia, and there after ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, conſulted of their waightieſt affaires. And yet both they and the reſt of Graecia had certaine general councels concerning the gouernment of their eſtate, beſides thoſe<note place="margin">The Senate of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> that were particular, which they vſed daily. The Senate of thirtie counſailors eſtabliſhed by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> when he refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Lacedemonian eſtate, obtained the ſoueraigntie not long after, and of Senators became abſolute lordes.<note place="margin">The Senate of the Athenians.</note> 
                     <hi>Solon</hi> ordained amongſt the Athenians, beſides the Senate of 400. which was changeable euery yeere, a priuie &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual councell of the Areopagites, compounded of three ſcore of the wiſeſt, and of ſuch as were blameles, who had the managing of thoſe affaires that were moſt ſecret. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Senate of the Romanes.</note> the firſt founder of Rome, compounded the Senate of 100. of the notableſt citizens: and hauing receiued the Sabines into his protection, he doubled the number of Senators, which afterward <hi>Brutus</hi> encreaſed with an other<note place="margin">The power of the Conſuls of Rome.</note> hundred. As long as the happy popular gouernement of the Romanes laſted, the Conſuls, albeit in dignitie they repreſented a royall perſon, yet they had no other power but to lead the armies, to aſſemble the Senate, to receiue the letters of captains, and of their allies, and to preſent them to the Senate, to heare embaſſadors before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or before the Senate, to aſſemble the great eſtates, and to aske the people aduiſe concerning the creation of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,<note place="margin">The power of the Senate of Rome.</note> or publiſhing of lawes. But the Senate diſpoſed the reuenues of the Empire, and the common expences: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed lieutenants to all gouernors of prouinces, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of the triumphs, ordered religion, receiued and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced embaſſadors of kings and nations, and tooke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for ſuch as were ſent to them. The puniſhment of all offences committed throughout Italy, which deſerued publike execution, as treaſon, conſpiracie, poyſoning, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full murder, belonged to the Senate. If any priuate perſon
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:8689:349"/>
or any citie ſtood in need of ſome ſpeciall fauour, or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or of ſuccour and protection, the Senate had all the charge thereof. It was forbidden vnder paine of high treaſon to preſent any requeſt to the people without aduiſe taken of the Senate. Neuertheleſſe, the ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie always belonged to the people, who might confirme<note place="margin">The power of the people of Rome.</note> or infringe the decrees of the Senate. Since that time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſundry alterations of their eſtate and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, the councell varied in forme. <hi>Augustus</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a particular councell of the wiſeſt Senators, &amp; thoſe but few in number: and after that another ſtrict councell of <hi>Mecaenas</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> with whom he decided the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt matters. In Turkie the councell is kept foure daies in<note place="margin">Of the councel of the Turke.</note> a week by the Baſſaes whereſoeuer the prince ſoiourneth. If it be in time of peace at Conſtantinople, or in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towne within his dominion: if in warre, it is kept within his pauilion. In this councell called <hi>Diuan,</hi> where audience is open to euery one, they conſult of embaſſages and of anſwers to be made vnto them, of matters of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and of ſoueraigntie, of the meanes how to prouide for decaied prouinces, of murders and condemnations. The ſuppliant, complainant or ſuter ſpeaketh without an aduocate, and is forced to anſwer preſently to the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his aduerſarie if he be preſent, or to prooue his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by witneſſes: and foorthwith the definitiue ſentence is giuen, which may not be reuoked. When the councell hath continued 7. or 8. houres, the <hi>Baſſa Viſir</hi> maketh true relation to the prince of all that hath been handled: if he lie it is preſent death. For the prince oftentimes liſteneth at a window, called <hi>daungerous,</hi> right againſt the <hi>Diuan,</hi> which is made in ſuch ſort, that he may heare and ſee, and not be perceiued: and although he were neuer there, yet they thinke that he is alwayes there. After he hath heard the diſcourſe and aduiſe of his councell, he ſeldome gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaieth, but confirmeth or moderateth the ſame. Theſe things being thus ordered, they are written and regiſtred by officers appointed thereunto. Concerning his treaſure the Baſſaes meddle not there-with, but two generall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:8689:350"/>
are ouer-ſeers and chiefe dealers therein, the one being of Romania, the other of Anatolia. Two Cade liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers haue the adminiſtration of all iuſtice, who ſit with the Baſſaes in the <hi>Diuan:</hi> neither doth any other ſit there but the twelue Bellerbeis, the Prince his children beyng Preſidents in their fathers abſence. The Muphtie is chief of the religion, and looketh vnto matters of conſcience.<note place="margin">Of the councell of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> At Venice the generall aſſemblie of Lordes and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is called the great councell, which hath the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power of the eſtate, and of which the Senate and the authoritie of all their magiſtrates dependeth. Beſides this great councell and Senate compounded of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skore perſons, there are foure other councels, that is, the councell of Sages for ſea matters, the councell of Sages for land matters, the councell of tenne, and the councell of ſeuen, where the Duke maketh the ſeuenth, and this is called the Seignorie. If there ariſe any hard matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sages, it is referred to the councell of tenne, and if they be diuided, the councell of ſeuen is ioyned to the councel of tenne. But if the matter be of great waight, the Senate is called, and ſometime alſo (albeit rarely) the great councell of all the Venetian Gentlemen, in which<note place="margin">Of the councel of Rhaguſium.</note> the laſt reſolution is made. At Rhaguſium they create a Preſident from moneth to moneth, who dwelleth in the pallace, and hath twelue counſailors, which aſſembly is called the little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>councell. There is alſo an other councell called the councell <hi>de Pregadie,</hi> into which a hundreth of<note place="margin">Of the councel of Genes.</note> the ancienteſt citizens may enter. Next, there is the great councell, at which all the nobilitie aboue twentie yeeres of age are preſent. At Genes the whole common-wealth is gouerned by them that are borne of eight and twentie families: neither is any man called to beare any office whatſoeuer, vnleſſe he be of this aſſemblie, which they call an <hi>Aggregation.</hi> Out of this are taken foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, which make the great councell, that hath all the power and authoritie of the eſtate, and is choſen from yeere to yeere. They create the Duke and the eight go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the Common-wealth, who are renued from
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:8689:350"/>
two yeeres to two yeeres. In Switzerland there are two<note place="margin">The councel of Switzerland.</note> councels in euery Canton, a little one and a great one. But if any great matter fall out, that is common to all the leagues, they hold their generall councell, called a Iourney, or a Diet. The like is vſed in Almaigne, where<note place="margin">The councel of Germanie.</note> the Emperour can ordaine nothing that concerneth the common benefite of Germanie, or the authoritie and preſeruation of the Empire, without the counſell and conſent of all the eſtates, eſpecially of the ſeuen Electors. Hee may not of him-ſelfe vnder-take any warre at his pleaſure, neither leuie tributes, nor rayſe ſouldioures of that nation, nor call in any forraine ſouldioures. They haue alſo a councell eſtabliſhed at Spira, which is called the Imperiall chamber beyng as it were a Parliament of Almaignes for the adminiſtration of iuſtice among them.<note place="margin">The aſſemblie of eſtates in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia.</note> In Polonia there is an aſſemblie of eſtates euery yeere, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciallie for theſe two cauſes: the one, to adminiſter iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in ſoueraigntie, vnto which are brought appeales from all the iudges of the countrey: the other, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the defence and ſafetie of the Countrey againſt their next enimies, namelie, the Tartares, who make often incurſions vppon them. None is receyued for a Senatour amongſt them, if hee bee no Palatine, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, Gouernour of ſome Forte, or other Captaine, or hath not beene Embaſſadour. In Spayne there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Of the councel of Spaine.</note> councels, beſides the priuie councell, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neere the King in ſeuerall Chambers vnder one roofe, that the king may be the better infourmed of all affaires. Their names are theſe, the councell of Spayne, of<note place="margin">Seuen ſeuerall councels in Spaine.</note> the Indies, of Italie, of the lowe Countreys, of Warre, of the Order of Saint Iohn, and of the Inquiſition. In the Realme of Englande there is a priuie Councell,<note place="margin">Of the councell of England.</note> which neuer exceeded the number of twentie perſones. The firſt eſtabliſhment thereof was but of fifteene: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appeareth by the concluſion of a peace made betweene <hi>Lewes</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> king of England, that ſeuenteene of the priuie Councell ſware vnto it, namelie, one Archbiſhop Chauncellour, one Biſhop,
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:8689:351"/>
ſix earles, and ſix other lordes, beſides the high Treaſurer, and the two magiſtrates, whom they call the chiefe iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of England. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three yeeres to three yeeres they hold a parliament, where all the eſtates are called togither to deliberate about the affaires of the kingdom. But enough of ſtrangers. Let vs now come to the eſtabliſhment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the councell in this French Monarchie, where we ſhal ſee that it is not inferior (if it go not beyond them) in excellencie and good order to all that are alreadie ſet<note place="margin">Of the ſecret councell of France.</note> downe, or that euer were. Firſt we know, that the king hath all ſoueraigntie by right of the eſtate, as heretofore we haue diſcourſed. The firſt councell neere about him is the ſtrict or ſecret councell, called the councell of ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, which is commonly held in the morning after his maieſtie is vp. None haue entrance into this, but a fewe whom the king iudgeth wiſeſt, of greateſt experience, and moſt truſtie to his maieſtie, with whome he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his waightieſt affaires as they fall out, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with them of ſuch principall matters as were delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of before in the priuie councell, and in the councell of the treaſurie, if they be ſuch as deſerue to bee brought thither. In the ſecret councell the letters of princes, of embaſſadors, of gouernors and captains are opened: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and matters agreed vpon are commended to the Secretaries of the eſtate: gifts &amp; rewards granted with the rolles and records thereof, letters and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">Of the priuie councell of France.</note> ſigned with the kings hand. The priuie councell is compounded of diuers great perſonages called thereunto by his maieſtie, either for the nobilitie of their bloud and greatnes of their houſe, or for their woorthines, wiſedom, knowledge and experience, who haue places and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue voyces in the councell as long as it pleaſeth him. Sometime the king ſitteth among them when any great matter is in queſtion: in his abſence the firſt prince of the bloud is Preſident. The Conſtable and Chancellour, two chiefe officers of the crowne, haue great authoritie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the one being principall of warre, the other of iuſtice: They ſit on each ſide in equall degree, being alwayes one
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:8689:351"/>
right before another. This councel is held either for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">What matters are handled therein.</note> belonging to the treaſurie, or for other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſtate-affaires of the kingdom, and then none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein but the Secretaries of the eſtate, the Treaſurer of the priuie treaſure, the Ouer-ſeers of the treaſures, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to take knowledge of the leuying and laying out of money, and the Secretaries belonging to the ſame: or elſe it is held for parties, that is, for the affaires of iuſtice depending of the ſoueraigntie.

And many times their counſell is firſt demaunded, then the aduice of the counſellours of eſtate, ſo that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt lordes giue their opinion laſt, to the end that freedom of ſpeech may not be taken away by the authoritie of the princes, eſpecially of factious and ambitious men, who neuer ſuffer any contradictions but againſt their wils.

But <hi>Phillip</hi> the faire made it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie court, and granted vnto it iuriſdiction and ſeat at Paris, but tooke from it the knowledge of ſtate-affaires. For, as we haue alreadie declared, there are no counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of eſtate amongſt all the magiſtrates of Fraunce, but thoſe that are ordinarie of the priuie councel. But beſides the councels ſpecified by vs, Princes haue alwayes had a<note place="margin">Of the ſtrict councell.</note> ſtrict councel of two or three of the deareſt and truſtieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, wherin the reſolution of the aduiſes and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:8689:352"/>
of other councels is had, yea many times of the greateſt affaires of the eſtate, before others haue delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of them. Neuertheles, this auncient cuſtome of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the general eſtates of the realme togither when they ſaw it neceſſarie, hath been always obſerued by kings and princes. Our firſt progenitours the Gaules, before either Romanes or kings ruled ouer them, aſſembled togither out of Aquitane, out of the prouince of Narbone, of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of other quarters, about the number of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skore nations, to take aduiſe and counſell of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affaires. Since that tyme our ancient kings of France haue vſed oftentimes to hold the eſtates, which is the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of all their ſubiects, or of their deputies. For to<note place="margin">What it is to hold the eſtates.</note> hold the eſtates is nothing elſe, but when the king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his greateſt affaires with his ſubiects, taketh aduiſe and counſell of them, heareth their complaintes and griefes, and prouideth for them according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This was called in olde time the holding of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which name it retaineth yet in England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But at this day the name of Parliament belongeth<note place="margin">The name of parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate courtes in France.</note> onely to priuate and particular courtes of Audience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a certaine number of Iudges eſtabliſhed by the king in ſundry of his Prouinces, and the publike and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall courtes of Audience haue taken the name of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.

King <hi>Phillip</hi> was not Preſident, not beyng at that time king, and beſides a partie. No doubt but the people receiue great benefit by this aſſemblie of eſtates.
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:8689:353"/>
For this good commeth vnto them, that they may drawe neere to the kings perſon, to make their complaints vnto him, to preſent him their requeſts, and to obtaine reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and neceſſary prouiſion for redreſſe. Whereby we may eaſily iudge, that many, who haue written of the duetie of magiſtrates and ſuch like treatiſes, are greatly deceiued in<note place="margin">The aſſembly of eſtates is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the prince.</note> maintaining this, <hi>That the estates of the people are aboue the prince:</hi> which laieth open a gappe to the rebellions of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects againſt their ſoueraign, ſo that this opinion can haue no reaſon or good ground to leane vpon. For if this were true, the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth would not be a kingdom or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but a pure Ariſtocratie, as we haue declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. Yea, what ſhew of reaſon is there to maintaine this error, ſeeing euery one in particular, &amp; al in general bowe their knees before the king, vſe humbly requeſts &amp; ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which his maieſtie receiueth or reiecteth, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth beſt vnto him? But in this caſe we except a king that is captiue, beſide himſelf, or in his infancie. For that which is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> decreed by the eſtates, is authorized as from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraign power of the prince. Moreouer we may ſee what great good commeth to the king by the aſſemblie of his eſtates, in the firſt ſpeech, which maſter <hi>Michael de l' Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Chauncellor of France made at the laſt aſſemblie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates at Orleans. Where he confuteth at large their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſay, that the king after a ſort diminiſheth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by taking aduiſe and counſell of his ſubiects, ſeeing he is not bound ſo to doe: as alſo that he maketh himſelfe too familiar with them, which breedeth contempt, and abaſeth his roiall dignitie. But we may aunſwere them<note place="margin">Theopompus anſwer to his wife.</note> as <hi>Theopompus</hi> king of Sparta did his wife, who obiected this vnto him by way of reproch, that by bringing in the Ephories, and minglyng their gouernement with his, he would leaue his authoritie and power leſſe to his children than hee receiued it from his predeceſſours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay (ſaid this Prince vnto hir) I will leaue it greater, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall be more aſſured.

ſea, or fire kindled to the daunger of publike profite, no<note place="margin">An excellent compariſon.</note> mans ſeruice or ſuccour is reiected, how baſe ſoeuer his calling is: ſo it cannot but be profitable for the Eſtate, when it is threatned with ruine, and the affaires therof are of greateſt importance, to receiue the counſell of all that haue intereſt therein, laying the opinions in the balance, rather than the perſons from whom they come. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſoueraigne maieſtie and prudence of a Prince is knowen, when he hath both power and skill to waigh and to iudge of their aduice that giue him counſel, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the ſoundeſt, not the greateſt ſide. But to go forward with that which remaineth, let ſo many as haue this honour to be ordinarie counſellors to Princes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſaying of <hi>Solon</hi> the wiſe, <hi>That they are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>

As for feare, danger, or threatnings, they muſt neuer ſtay them from doyng their duetie, but let them conſtantly propound and maintaine that which they iudge to be good and profitable for the Common-wealth. We read that the Thaſiens making warre with great vehemencie againſt the Athenians, publiſhed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that whoſoeuer counſelled or ſpake at any time of concluding a peace between them, ſhould die the death.<note place="margin">Examples hereof.</note> Within a while after one of the citizens conſidering what great hurt his countrey receiued by that warre, came one day into the aſſembly of the people with a halter about his necke, and cried with a loud voyce, that he was come thither to deliuer the Common-wealth by his death, that they ſhould put him to death when they would, and that for his part he gaue them counſell to abrogate that law, and to make peace: which was done, and he pardoned.<note place="margin">Conſidius an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Caeſar.</note>

For the authoritie of the ſoueraign magiſtrate, in whoſe name they are made, is ſo much the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible amongſt his ſubiects, as they know that they are leſſe obeied: as though the fault proceeded from his inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of skil to command. He that leadeth well before, is the cauſe why he is wel folowed: &amp; the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the art of a good Querie of the ſtable, conſiſteth in making the horſe obedient, &amp; in bringing him to good order: ſo the principall effect of the knowledge of a king is to iuſtruct wel his ſubiects in obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. To this purpoſe the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good iudges ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil help well, that they may take knowledge of ſuch as gain-ſay and reſiſt the publike<note place="margin">Iudgements are the ſinews of an eſtate.</note> lawes and ordinances of his maieſtie, who is to authorize their iudgements, as the chiefe ſinewes of the whole body of his eſtate. For nothing euer cauſed Common-wealthes to flouriſh ſo much as the conſtant keeping of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie lawes, and the ſtrict execution of iudgements agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto them. And (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) thoſe eſtates that are neer their ouerthrow, all things beyng in a deſperate caſe, fall into this miſerable iſſue, that men condemned by the<note place="margin">A certain token of the ruine of an eſtate.</note> lawes, are reſtored, and iudgements giuen are cancelled: which things when they come to paſſe, euery one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that their ruine is at hand without all hope of ſafetie. Moreouer, foraſmuch as the Prince knoweth that he is as it were bound and indebted for iuſtice, he ought to be ſo much the more careful that it may be rightly adminiſtred<note place="margin">The prince ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="691" facs="tcp:8689:355"/>
no doubt but all kind of publike felicitie will iſſue from the ſame. But let vs briefly conſider what iudgement is, the diuiſion of iudgements, their adminiſtration, &amp; what manner of Iudges ought to exerciſe them. Iudgement is<note place="margin">What iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis.</note> properly that which is ordained by the Magiſtrate, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the tenor of the law. But foraſmuch as through the infinit varietie of cauſes, times, places, and perſons, which cannot be comprehended in any lawes or ſtatuts whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, puniſhments were referred to the will and power of the Magiſtrates, and the dammages of ciuill matters to the conſcience &amp; religion of the Iudges; that which they determine by reſolute ſentences according to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is alſo called Iudgement, although more properly it may be called a Decree. For this cauſe we ſay, that as there are two principall pointes in euery Common-wealth, which Magiſtrates muſt haue before their eies, that is, the<note place="margin">Magiſtrats muſt alwaies haue the law &amp; equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie before their eies.</note> law and equitie: ſo alſo there is the execution of the law and the duty of the Magiſtrate, which conſiſteth either in commanding, in decreeing, or in executing. Of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, ſome are called priuate, ſome publike, ſome cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall,<note place="margin">The diuiſion of iudgements.</note> others ciuill. Priuate iudgements are of bonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, preſcriptions, Gardianſhips, Wardſhips, contracts, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, ſucceſſions, mariages. Publike iudgements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne hainous offences againſt God &amp; man, as ſacriledge, treaſon, reſtitution of monie, or other bribes taken by Magiſtrats, robbery of the kings treaſure, forgeries, theft, wilfull and conſtrained murders. <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaketh at large of theſe in his booke of lawes, and it would be an infinite matter, and ſmally to our inſtruction, to ſeeke out the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kinds of iudgements, which either haue beene, or are among men. But this is well woorth the noting, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the ancient Grecians and Romanes, all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both priuat and publike, were from point to point followed, and with all rigor obſerued, and they that ſtood againſt them were proſecuted and ſet vpon with fire and ſword. Among other examples <hi>Diodorus</hi> rehearſech a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Phocians, a people of Grecia, condemned by the iudgement of the Amphyctions in a certaine ſumme
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:8689:356"/>
                     <note place="margin">A rigorous iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Phocians.</note> of monie, bicauſe they had tilled a great deale of ground that was conſecrated to the gods. Which ſumme when they refuſed to paye, they pronounced their countrie as confiſcate and conſecrated to the gods: wherupon aroſe a warre, called the holie warre, made by the reſt of the Grecians againſt them, and in the ende their vtter ruine &amp; ſubuerſion. Whoſoeuer was once accuſed of any crime before the Iudges in Lacedemonia, although he were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, yet he abode a certaine time after in that eſtate of a criminall perſon, during which time enquirie might be made againe of him, and newe iudgement giuen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſert. If the Ephories condemned their kings in any ſumme, yea if it were to death, their iudgements<note place="margin">Of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Romanes.</note> were executed with all rigor. The iudgements of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes were for a long time in the hands of three Orders or Eſtates: namely, of Senators, Knights, and Tribunes<note place="margin">Who were Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amongſt them, and how they were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</note> of the treaſure. Neuertheles, the ſame perſons did not alwaies iudge, but the Pretors, who were annuall Iudges, and chief amongſt them, tooke a certaine number of Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by lot out of thoſe three Eſtates. And if they that were firſt taken were refuſed by any one of the parties, others were choſen by an after-lot, who being agreed vpon and<note place="margin">Three kinds of Pretors in Rome.</note> ſworne, were diſtributed by decuries or tens. There were three ſorts of Pretors, the Pretor of the Citie, who tooke knowledge of particular cauſes: namely, of ciuill and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal matters amongſt the citizens of Rome: the Pretor eſtabliſhed for matters betweene ſtrangers &amp; citizens: &amp; the Pretors appointed for publike cauſes. The Senators were once the only Iudges of all proceſſes: but <hi>Tiberius &amp; Caius Gracchus</hi> being popular perſons, to diminiſh the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Senate, and to encreaſe the peoples power, ioined vnto them 300. Knights, according to the number of the Senators, &amp; brought it ſo about, that the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of al cauſes were diuided betweene theſe 600. men. Vnder <hi>Sylla</hi> all authoritie of iudging was reſtored againe to the Senate: but <hi>Pompey</hi> after that brought in the Knights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, &amp; all iudgements were equally communicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the three Orders aboue mentioned. Afterward, when
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:8689:356"/>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> was Dictator, he reduced them to two Orders only, that is, to Senators, &amp; to Knights. <hi>Buda</hi> in his annotations vpon the Pandects, hath obſerued many good things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Romane iudgements, which curious ſpirits may looke into: among the reſt, of the great reſpect &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that was giuen to Magiſtrats. Concerning which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we may vſe as a good teſtimony, that which we read in<note place="margin">Of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which was giuen to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</note> 
                     <hi>Plutark,</hi> of <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> his ſon, who ſeeing a far off his father come towards him on horſe-backe, &amp; that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants in regard of fatherly reuerence had not cauſed him to alight, commanded him to ſet foot on ground. Which the father preſently obeied, &amp; imbracing his ſonne, made greater account of him, than if he had done otherwiſe. The ſame author writeth, that one <hi>Vectius</hi> was preſently ſlaine, bicauſe he aroſe not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Tribune of the people paſſed before him. And <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ſaith, that the Cenſors did note with ignominy, &amp; withall diſfranchiſed a citizen of Rome, bicauſe he breathed &amp; yawned a little too loud in their preſence. But what? Eſtats &amp; dignities were then giuen to vertue, &amp; not to him that offred moſt. And often times the places of iudgement were neceſſarily, and as it were by force laid vpon Iudges, being more honourable than profitable, yea very incommodious to ſuch as would<note place="margin">An excellent way to decide all controuerſies betweene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at diſcord.</note> diſcharge themſelues vprightly therein. I remember an excellent iudgement giuen by <hi>Archidamus</hi> the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian, when he was choſen Arbitrator to decide a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine contention betweene two friendes. After he had brought them both into the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> and made them ſweare vpon the aultar, that they ſhoulde obſerue preciſely whatſoeuer he determined, wherunto they yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I iudge then (quoth he) that none of you depart out of this Temple, before you haue ended your ſtrife. Thus were they both conſtrained to agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and <hi>Archidamus</hi> freed from perill of looſing one of their friendſhips, againſt whome he muſt needes haue giuen iudgement. By this meanes he put in practice that ſaying of <hi>Pittacus, That a man muſt not be ludge or Arbitrator in the controuerſie of two friendes, least by iudging profitably for</hi>
                     <pb n="694" facs="tcp:8689:357"/>
                     <hi>one, he looſe the friendſhip of the other.</hi> But let vs ſpeake of our<note place="margin">Of the ancient reputation of iudgements in France.</note> own Eſtate. In old time (as many hiſtories report) iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſo well adminiſtred in France, that ſtrangers did willingly ſubmit themſelues vnto them. <hi>Frederick</hi> the 2. ſubmitted to the iudgement of the king and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the deciding of many contentions and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies betweene him and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth. In the time of <hi>Phillip</hi> the Faire, the Earle of Namure did the like, albeit that <hi>Charles</hi> of Valoys the kings brother, was his aduerſe partie: ſo great confidence had he in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of thoſe Iudges. At the ſame time <hi>Phillip</hi> Prince of Tatentum willingly accepted for Iudge, the king ſitting in his Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, about the controuerſie that he had with the Duke of Burgundye, for certaine charges which he ſhould defraye towardes the recouerie of the Empire of Conſtantinople. The like did the Duke of Lorraine in the ſuite which he had againſt <hi>Guy</hi> of Caſtillon his brother in law, for their diuiſion of lands. And in the yeere 1402. the Kinges of Caſtile and of Portingale ſent an agreement made and paſt betweene them, that it might be publiſhed and proclaimed in the Court of Parliament, to haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authoritie thereby. Truly theſe teſtimonies are as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the glorie of iuſtice vſed in France, as any that can be alleadged by the Grecians or Romanes, for the proofe of their iuſt iudgements, of the reputation of their lawes, and renowne of their Magiſtrates. But let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">The iuſtice of France fallen from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent glorie.</note> how farre iuſtice is fallen at this day from that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opinion and credite, iudgements being now brought to that length, and intangled in ſo many formalities, that it is a thing greatly to be pitied, and full of calamitie, to ſee this Realme ſo infected, as it were with a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe, wherein ſuch an innumerable companie of men liue by that miſerable exerciſe of pleading, called<note place="margin">Tokens of a corrupted E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</note>

There
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:8689:357"/>
was neuer any nation of which this might be more truly ſpoken than of ours, as it is notoriouſly knowne to euery one. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> writeth, that in the beginning, Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch<note place="margin">The proceeding of iuſtice in France from time to time.</note> men behaued themſelues ſimply and plainly in matters of iudgement, reſting in the determinations giuen by the Bailiffs and Seneſhals, who had the adminiſtration almoſt of al right and iuriſdiction, and thinking it vnſeemely and void of honeſtie, to ſeeke a farre off for right by meanes of appeale. But after that ſlanders aroſe amongſt them, and ſuites were multiplied, ſoueraigne iuſtice began to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed once a yeere, and that for a few daies togither: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, twice a yeere, alwaies changing the place. In the end it was determined, that the chiefe iudgements ſhould be held in a certaine place, and that a houſe ſhould be built for that purpoſe at Paris, the principall citie of the kingdome. Whereupon, in the raigne of <hi>Phillip</hi> the Faire, the Pallace was erected according to that greatnes and magnificence wherein you now ſee it, with hals &amp; cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, into which were diſtributed by certaine companies thoſe Iudges that gaue the laſt ſentence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale might be made, both in ciuill and criminal matters. The erection of this Parliament into an ordinarie Court, doth giue vs to vnderſtand that there ſhould be one or<note place="margin">The officers of the Court of Parliament in Paris.</note> two Preſidents. The firſt Preſident was the Earle of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, a Prince of the blood: as in the Imperiall Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Preſident is alwaies one of the Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And it was a cuſtome for a certaine time, that the chiefe Preſident ſhould be a man of warre, as in deede to this day he taketh vpon him the eſtate of knight. Beſides, there were eight Clearks, and twelue Lay men, foure Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the blood for Requeſts, two Chambers of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where there were eight Lay men, and eight Clearks Iudges, and foure and twentie Relators.

thoſe verball appellations that are made vpon the Pleas of the Aduocats, or if they cannot be readily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, they are remitted to the Councell, for which there is a Chamber appointed. Next, there are fiue Chambers of Inquiries, wherein proceſſes in writing are examined and determined. There alſo is the Tournel, or place where criminall actions are iudged, and the Treaſure-chamber for cauſes touching the kings reuenues. There is the court of Requeſts, wherin chiefly matters of priuiledges belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the kings traine and to others, are iudged.

On the other ſide is the Chamber of accounts, and that of the generall Receiuers. Some of the counſellours are married, others are Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by Chambers according as the Court is furniſhed. In the great Chamber there are for the moſt part foure Preſidents, vnto whom the neceſſitie of times haue added two others, who may be ſuppreſſed when there is no need of them. In the other Chambers there are but two Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Moreouer, there is one Procurator for the king, &amp; two Aduocats, to looke to the kings prerogatiues, and to all ſuch matters: two Scribes to collect, inroll, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer both ciuill and criminall deedes: foure Notaries and Secretaries to eaſe them, beſides a great number of other writers. <hi>Budaeus,</hi> a very skilfull man, and a diligent<note place="margin">Of the ancient eſtate of the Parliament.</note> ſearcher out of all antiquitie, hath obſerued in his firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations vpon the Pandects, that there were three ſorts of Iudges in the time of <hi>Phillip</hi> the Long.

They did not then ſtudie the Romane lawes, as they haue done ſince: whereupon they haue erected at this day Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the lawe in the beſt Townes of France: from whence many thinke that the multitude of ſuites haue proceeded, bicauſe they learne by this meanes the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation or craft of pleading, as the Lorde Chancellour <hi>de l'Hoſpital</hi> declared in his ſecond Oration which he made<note place="margin">Ferdinando for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad that any Lawyers ſhould go into the Weſt Indians.</note> to the Eſtates at Orleans.

For they commonly ſee the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt cauſe fruſtrated by delaies, which are granted at their pleaſure that are fauoured, and by infinite other vniuſt meanes. Sometimes many iudgements are giuen vpon one matter, and yet nothing concluded: or if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny definitiue ſentence, it is by and by ſuſpended from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, vpon the leaſt obiection that is made, or elſe it is called into doubt by ſome ciuill requeſt, or by a writ of error. Thrice happie were we, if we might continue in that ancient ſimplicitie and naturall goodnes, rather than after this manner to infold our ſelues in ſo many proceedings and captious ſubtleties, which haue corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and extinguiſhed the light of iuſtice, imprinted in the hartes and mindes of all men well borne. We ſee<note place="margin">The great abuſe of iuſtice in France.</note> that ſuites are heaped vp one vpon another, and made immortall: that nothing is ſo certaine which is not made vncertaine: that no controuerſie is ſo cleare, which is not obſcured: no contract ſo ſure, which is not vndone: no ſentence or iudgement ſo aduiſedly giuen, which is not made void: all mens actions open to the ſlanders, craft, malice, redemptions, and pollings of Lawyers: the maieſtie and integritie of ancient iuſtice loſt: and laſt of all, that in the dealings of men nowe a daies, no ſhewe of vpright iuſtice, but onely a ſhadowe thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.

For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) in a corrupt Common-wealth<note place="margin">How a corrupt Common-wealth muſt be corrected.</note> defiled with many vices, if a man ſhould thinke to bring it backe againe to hir firſt brightnes and dignitie, by correcting ſmall faults, and by curing the contagion thereof by little and litle, it were all one as if he ſhould cut off one of <hi>Hydras</hi> heades, in whoſe place ſeuen moe did

ſpring vp: but that alteration and diſorder whereby all euill &amp; vice was brought into the Common-wealth, muſt be plucked vp by the rootes. Therefore let vs not thinke it ſtrange, if they that haue the raines of the gouernment of this Eſtate in their hands, find ſo many difficulties and ſo ſmall meanes, in the reformation therof. For, as <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> ſaid, they gouerne nothing but the ſhipwracke of the Common-wealth.

Nowe, if thoſe three things, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in all good Iudges and Magiſtrates, did abound in them that ſhould heerafter be called to adminiſter iuſtice and iudgement: namely, a loue to the preſent Eſtate, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie to exerciſe thoſe duties that are required in their office, with vertue and iuſtice, we might yet ſee ſome Idea and forme of that golden age, wherein our Predeceſſors liued, we might ſee pietie and iuſtice flouriſh, to the great benefite and felicitie of this French Monarchie. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that which may be further required in the duties, qualities, and conditions of good Iudges, we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by our other treatiſe, wherein we entreated of Counſellors of Eſtate, and alſo by calling to mind the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſes of vertue and iuſtice. I onely will adde heere, that it were very commendable and full of profite, yea neceſſarie for the Eſtate, that all the companies of

Iudges ſhould be compounded of ſuch notable old men<note place="margin">Iudges ought to be ſuch old men as haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ioined with their knowledge.</note>, as with their knowledge haue experience of many things. And in deede this title of Senator, which was giuen them in ancient time, ſignifieth an olde man: neither did the Grecians or Romanes call any to that degree, but olde men.

Surely in this election of Iudges, it behooueth Kinges to vſe great prudence, and (as <hi>Iſocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſaide) to take triall of them, to knowe whether they are of good iudgement, whether they haue a ſharpe ſight in affaires, and whether they are not troubled with the change of their life, but behaue themſelues wiſely in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery eſtate, both in proſperitie and in aduerſitie: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<note place="margin">Magiſtrats muſt not be couetous</note> to take good order that they be not ſuch as are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to lucre, from whence all iniuſtice proceedeth. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cicero</hi> would haue the contempt of temporal goods, from whence all quietnes of our mindes commeth, to be no leſſe in Magiſtrates, than in true Philoſophers. Yea, he ſaith, that they ought to be more carefull and laborious to attaine vnto it, than the others, bicauſe worldlie affaires toucheth them neerer, ſo that they haue greater cauſe to ſtand in feare of the alteration of fortune, of aduerſitie, and of pouertie.

                     <hi>is more excellent than to deale in publike affaires, and to do iuſtice, whereby they practice that which philoſophers teach.</hi> But out of queſtion, the forme and manner, which of late time hath beene vſed in calling Iudges &amp; Officers to their charges, is ſo farre from that which we deſire heere, that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a man may call it the mother of all corruption and iniuſtice. For when a Iudge is made, his knowledge is not<note place="margin">A corrupt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Iudges.</note> examined, his integrity &amp; vprightnes of life is not weighed his long experience is not conſidered, his age &amp; vertue is not regarded, but only his crownes are viewed to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are weight.

although they are found inſufficient, yet they obtaine ſo many letters of commandement, ſo many Mandatums one in anothers necke, that in the end they are receiued whatſoeuer they are, to the great preiudice of the whole Common-wealth.

So that if the King and his Councell would aduiſedly conſider of theſe things in the eſtabliſhing of Iudges and Magiſtrates in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and would ſtrengthen them in the execution of their iudgements, the obedience of his ſubiects; would be greater, and the foundation of all good order and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie more ſure.</p>

                  <p>If we conſider, how God minding to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Adam</hi> for his ingratitude and diſobedience, made his owne members rebell againſt the ſpirite, vnto which they obeied before, whereby he became captiue vnder<note place="margin">The originall of all ſedition.</note> the lawe of ſinne, no doubt but we may ſay, that after the ſame manner he chaſtiſeth Kings, Princes, and Heads of Common-wealths, that haue no care to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:8689:362"/>
and to cauſe others to keepe them, by the rebellion of their owne ſubiects, not without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of depriuation from all authoritie by them, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the law at their hands to whome they ſhould giue it, as it hath beene ſeene practiſed in many Eſtates and<note place="margin">The cauſe of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</note> gouernments. Religion and the loue of God bringeth with it all vnion and concord, preſerueth Kingdomes and Monarchies in their integritie, and is the nurſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">The fruits of the contempt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> of peace and amitie amongſt them. But the contempt of religion bringeth diſcord and confuſion, ouerturneth all order, treadeth vertue vnder foote, giueth authority to vice, and ſoweth quarrels and diſſentions amongſt men, from whence ſeditions and priuate murders proceed, and in the end ciuill and open wars, which are as flaming fires to take hold of, and to conſume moſt flouriſhing Eſtates. For without doubt, if men had in them the true loue and feare of God, which cannot be without the loue of our neighbour, no ſuch effects would euer proceed from their works and actions. Politicks haue labored infinite waies to maintaine the people in peace, and to cauſe ciuill iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to flouriſh. They haue made many Lawes and Edicts, many Statutes, appointed many puniſhments, to bridle the boldnes of ſeditious fellowes, to repreſſe extorſions, wrongs, and murders: but bicauſe they built without a<note place="margin">Peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord effects of the feare of God.

Beſides, it is the profeſſion of godlines to ſuffer, and not to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, neither can it bring foorth euill effects contrarie to their cauſe. This deſerueth to be handled at large, but our preſent ſubiect leadeth vs to diſcourſe of the nature of ſeditions, and to ſet before our eies the euils that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede thereof, both by reaſons and examples, referring
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:8689:362"/>
the conſideration of their cauſes vnto ſome other time heereafter. Sedition then being taken generally, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">What ſedition is.</note> elſe but ciuill warre, ſo hurtfull to all Eſtates and Monarchies, that it is the ſeede of all kinde of euils in them, euen of thoſe that are moſt execrable. It engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth<note place="margin">The fruits of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> and nouriſheth want of reuerence towards God, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, corruption of manners, change of lawes, contempt of iuſtice, and baſe eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of learning and ſciences. It cauſeth horrible reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, forgetfulnes of conſanguinitie, parentage, &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, extorſions, violence, robberies, waſting of countries, ſacking of townes, burning of buildings, confiſcations, flights, baniſhments, cruell proſcriptions, ſauage mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, alterations and ouerthrowes of Policies, with other infinite exceſſes and intollerable miſeries, pitifull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and ſorrowfull to rehearſe. Sedition armeth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the ſon, the brother againſt the brother, kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man againſt kinſman, men of the ſame nation, prouince, and citie, one againſt another. Heerupon the fields, which before were fertile, are left vntilled, ſumptuous and rich houſes remaine emptie &amp; forſaken, famous and wealthie townes ſtand deſolate, by reaſon of the loſſe of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ornaments, I meane their priuate and publike buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and their notable Inhabitants and Citizens. And, which is woorſt of all, no man will acknowledge a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, but euery Prouince will ſeeke to withdraw it ſelfe, and to be made a Canton. In the end, the bodie thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and the parts thereof infected with the ſame poiſon of diſcord, deſtroy themſelues: that the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Ieſus Chriſt, who is the truth it ſelfe, might be fulfilled, where he ſaith: <hi>That euery kingdome diuided in</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 25. 2. Sam. 24. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>it ſelfe, ſhall be deſolate.</hi> Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> did rather chuſe a plague amongeſt his ſubiects, than warre or tumults. And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſayde, that three thinges were by all meanes to be remooued: <hi>a diſeaſe from the bodie, ignorance from the ſoule, and ſedition from the Citie. Plato</hi> alſo affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that no euill is woorſe in a Citie than that which diuideth it, and of one maketh it two: and that nothing
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:8689:363"/>
is better than that thing which tieth and vniteth it togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">What commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie Plato re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in his Common-welth</note> Whereupon he wiſhed, that there might be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, not onely of all goods, but alſo of that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath appropriated to euery one, as of eies, eares, and hands, to the end that whoſoeuer ſaw, heard, or did any thing, he might imploy all to common profite and vſe, thereby to maintaine better the mutuall loue of Citizens, who hauing nothing priuate, would by this meanes be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies touched with the ſame ioy and griefe, praiſing and diſliking all iointly togither the ſame things. There are<note place="margin">Two kinds of warre.</note> two ſorts of warre mentioned alſo by <hi>Plato,</hi> who calleth the one ſedition, which is the woorſt, and the other which is more gentle, is that againſt ſtrangers. <hi>Nestor,</hi> a wiſe and prudent counſellour among the Grecians, ſaid in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell (as <hi>Homer</hi> reporteth) that he which loueth ciuill war, is a moſt wretched, cruell, and deteſtable man, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthy to liue. And truly if we looke to the examples of thoſe fruits, which haue alwaies proceeded of ciuill wars, we ſhall ſee that they haue beene guided after a moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and horrible kind of hoſtilitie, and that their iſſue hath beene the loſſe and ouerthrow of many flouriſhing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths.<note place="margin">The fruits of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil warre among the Grecians.</note> 
                     <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſpeaking of the generall diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt the Grecians for diuerſity of gouernments, which they ſought to bring in amongſt themſelues, ſome deſiring to be gouerned in a Democraty, others is an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligarchy, rehearſeth incredible euils which aroſe of that warre. As ſoone (ſaith he) as any inſolencie was knowne to be committed in one place, others were encouraged to do woorſe, to enterpriſe ſome new thing, and to ſhewe that they were more diligent than others, or more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and hot in reuenging themſelues. They diſguiſed all the euils which they committed with commendable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, calling raſhnes <hi>Magnanimitie,</hi> and modeſtie <hi>Baſenes of mind:</hi> head-long indignation <hi>Manlines</hi> and <hi>Hardines,</hi> prudent counſell and deliberation <hi>Coloured back-ſliding.</hi> Whereby it came to paſſe that whoſoeuer alwaies ſhewed himſelfe furious, was accounted a loial friend, and he that gain-ſaid, was ſuſpected. If any one of the contrarie facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:8689:363"/>
gaue any good and honeſt counſell, it was not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but if they could withſtand it by any notorious deed, they had rather be reuenged ſo, then they would not giue occaſion to others to offer the like wrong to them. When any agreement was made and confirmed with a ſolemne othe, it laſted vntil one of the parties grew to be the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he might breake and violate the ſame, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme wickednes ouercome the other, which proceeded of couetouſnes and deſire of other mens goods. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe factions and part-takings were kindled, which procured infinite euils to the whole countrey of Graecia, wherein there was no quietneſſe, vntill it was quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen by ſeditions and ciuill warres. This is that which <hi>Demades</hi> obiected to the Athenians by way of reproche,<note place="margin">Demades re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth the Athenians.</note> that they neuer intreated of peace but in mournyng gownes, namely, after they had loſt many of their kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes and friends in battels and skirmiſhes. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> king of Lacedemonia bewailed this miſerie when he ſawe ſuch cruell warres betweene the Athenians and Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, people of one countrey, and although he had wonne a great battell neere vnto Corinth with great loſſe to his enimies, and ſmall hurt to his owne men, yet not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioicing, but rather being very ſorowfull, he vttered theſe words with a loud voyce: <hi>O poore Graecia, how miſerable art</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ageſilaus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waileth the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil diſſention of Graecia.</note>

For after they had kindled the fire in one nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they maintained one ſide a certaine time, vntill in the end they ouerwhelmed both the one and the other. Thus they deceiued the Carthaginians, the Aſians, the Gaules, and Graecia. Onely England was not quite ſubdued, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">The prudence of Engliſhmen.</note> it knew their practiſes, and turned all domeſticall choler againſt the enemie when the danger was common. <hi>Traian</hi> the emperour writing to the Senate of Rome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt<note place="margin">Traians letter to the Senate of Rome.</note> other things ſent theſe wordes: <hi>I recommend vnto</hi>

                     <hi>you aboue all things, friendſhip and brotherhood among your ſelues: bicauſe ye know that in great Common-wealths home-warres are more hurtfull than thoſe that are made against ſtrangers. For if kinſmen and neighbours had neuer begun to hate one another, &amp; to war one vpon another, Demetrius had neuer ouerthrowen Rhodes, nor Alexander Tyrus, nor Marcellus Syracuſa, nor Scipio Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantium.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Romane Empire decaied through ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> And in deed the Romane Empire fell from hir greatneſſe by the ſame meanes of ciuill warre which they had long time nouriſhed among others. Yea it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that in no place part-takings full of all kind of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, were ſo vſuall and ſo long time practiſed, or factions and ſeditions were more cruell than in Rome. The firſt<note place="margin">The original of the Romane ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> occaſion thereof was their gouernement, wherein the people alwayes ſet themſelues againſt the Senate and the Nobilitie, the Senate ſeeking to rule without meaſure, and the people to encreaſe their libertie. During theſe diſſentions, it came to paſſe that at one time foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and fiue hundreth ſlaues and baniſhed men inuaded the Capitoll, and wanted litle of making themſelues lords of Rome. <hi>Appian</hi> hath written at large of their ſeditions and partialities, and ſaith that through ambition and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes one ſide daily ſought to diminiſh the authoritie<note place="margin">M.

He ſaith that <hi>Martius Coriolanus</hi> being vpon this occaſion, and in theſe diſſentions driuen out of the citie contrary to right and reaſon, went to the Volſci, and warred on their ſide againſt his countrey, being the firſt baniſhed perſon that tooke armes againſt Rome. And in deed, neither in the councell, nor in the citie, there was no ſword drawen, nor man ſlaine in ciuil ſedition, vntill<note place="margin">T.

                     <hi>Tyberius Gracchus</hi> fauouring the people, &amp; making lawes in their behalf, was killed, and many others that were with him in the Capitoll neere the Temple. Whereupon hatred and rancor increaſing openly amongſt them, infinite mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders followed, and many of the chiefeſt euen the Conſuls were ſlaine, the contempt of lawes and iudgements enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in the end open war, armies &amp; troupes one againſt another with incredible thefts and cruelties. At laſt <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Sylla,</hi> one of the ſeditious perſons, ſeeking to redreſſe

For when they twaine ſought by their plat-formes and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to commaund all, they could not abide one another within a while after, <hi>Pompey</hi> being vnwilling to haue an equall, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> a ſuperiour.

Which when <hi>Onias</hi> a holy man did wel fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, he with-drew himſelfe into a ſecret place, and would not take part either with the one or the other ſide. And being taken by <hi>Hircanus</hi> his men, they required him, that as once he obtained raine by his prayers in the tyme of a drought, ſo he would now curſe <hi>Aristobulus</hi> and all thoſe of his faction: but he contrarywiſe lifting vp his hands to<note place="margin">Onias prayer.</note> heauen, vttred theſe wordes. <hi>O God, king of the whole world, ſeeing theſe men among whom I ſtand, are thy people, and they that are aſſailed, thy Priests, I beſeech thee humbly, that thou wouldest harken neither to theſe men against the other, nor to the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst theſe:</hi> for which holy prayer he was ſtoned to death, ſuch was the poiſoned rage of this people one againſt an<note place="margin">Ciuil warres in Italy between the Guelphes and the Gybel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.</note> other. Was there euer any folly, or rather fury like to that of the Guelphes and Gybellines in Italy, of whome the one ſide held with the Pope, and the other with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour? The Italians vpon no other occaſion but only in fauour of theſe two names, entred into ſo extreme a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell throughout the whole countrey, that greater crueltie could not be wrought between the Infidels and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than was committed amongſt them.

It was a pitifull thing to ſee France cruelly tormented both by hir owne ſubiects &amp; by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to ſee it void of right &amp; equitie, without magiſtrates, without iudgements, without lawes, which had no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place amongſt fire and force, where violence onely raigned.

Now if France hath heretofore ſuffred ſo much by ciuill warres, and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeditions, if all forraine eſtates haue receiued ſo many ſundry alterations, and incredible wounds by the ſame means, how can we looke for leſſe, nay rather haue we not already ſeene the like or greater calamities amongſt vs, through our diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; priuate quarels between certain<note place="margin">Ambition and deſire of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment the chiefe cauſe of the troubles in France.</note> houſes contending one with another, being chiefly moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with ambition and deſire to gouerne?

Euery euill (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) in the firſt ſproute thereof may be eaſily ſtopped, but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterate, is more ſtrong and vneaſie to be ſuppreſſed. So that if it be mette withall before it appeare and breake foorth, the danger is leſſe, although it proceed firſt from the neceſſitie of naturall corruption, which is in all things that are created, and is to be ſeene euen in things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">Corruption is naturall in all things.</note> ſenſe, as Mil-dew in wheate, rottenneſſe in wood, ruſt in braſſe and iron: yea euery thing is corrupted by it own euill, howſoeuer it eſcapeth all outward harmes.

They are the matter of<note place="margin">The materiall cauſe of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> ſeditions againſt whome they are raiſed, as princes and magiſtrates, who are ſuperiours, and ſometime their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, beyng inferiours.

For men are commonly mooued to ſedition either through hope of profit &amp; honor, or elſe through feare of loſſe and diſhonor towards themſelues or their friends, ſo that they deſire the one &amp; ſhun the other. Vnto profit we referre riches: to honor, magiſtracie, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like offices &amp; charges: to loſſe, pouertie: to diſhonor, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thereore let vs handle the cauſes which mooue the people to murmure, and lead them from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and ſecret grudging, to publike and open ſedition, from which the changes, alterations, and finall ruines of eſtates and monarchies proceed.

Contempt alſo is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe greatly to be feared in euery eſtate and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, as that which oftentimes breedeth their change and ouerthrow. It is very daungerous in two conſiderations eſpecially: firſt when ſome are contemned and excluded from publique offices and dignities which they deſerue, and yet ſee them wholy in the power and diſpoſition of ſome particular men. Whereupon both the one and the other are mooued to ſedition, the contemned perſones through enuie and deſire of reuenge; they that haue the great charges in their handes, through contempt of the others, whome they ſeeke vtterly to exclude, and to driue them further off from all publique ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and authorities. Secondly, contempt is verie<note place="margin">Who are moſt ſubiect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> pernitious, when inferiours contemne their ſuperiours. They are commonly deſpiſed that haue neither vertue,
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:8689:371"/>
courage, nor fortitude, that are not able to profite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or others, that are not laborious, painfull, nor any manner of way carefull. Where contempt is, there no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is to be had. This maketh the ſonne diſobedient<note place="margin">Contempt brec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> to the father, the wife to the husband, the learner to the teacher, the ſeruant to the maiſter. The opinion of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, iuſtice, conſtancie, knowledge, goodnes, modeſtie, and of other vertues, nouriſheth and preſerueth the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of ſubiects towards their Princes, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vices prouoke them to rebellion. Therefore as policies proſper when they are gouerned by prudent, iuſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, valiant, and moderate men: ſo they are troubled<note place="margin">Cauſes that mooue ſubiects to contemue their Princes.</note> with ſeditions through the ignorance, cowardlines, and intemperancie of Princes, or elſe when they are too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with their inferiors, or when they are ſuddenly lift vp from baſe eſtate, or ſeem too aged, or too yong, or poore, or miſerable, all which things breede contempt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is ſet downe as a good rule to preſerue the eſtate<note place="margin">A rule of Eſtate.</note> of a Monarchy: <hi>That the Prince must procure to himſelfe loue, without the contempt or hatred of any, if it may be.</hi> For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining whereof, there is no better way, than the iuſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of rewardes.

and ſeditions, as Hiſtoriographers haue noted of Genes, Florence, and Flanders, with many other things may be ſaid to be cauſes of ciuill warres, of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, changes, and ruine of Eſtats and Policies. Among which we note that ſhame is ſometime a cauſe of change<note place="margin">Shame is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time cauſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</note> in the gouernment of Common-wealths, but it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tumult or ſedition. Thus it fell out in Herea, a towne of Arcadia, which was gouerned popularly, where men of no account were elected Magiſtrates by others like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: whereupon beeing mocked, they changed their manner of election into chuſing by lot, that ſo they might haue a more lawefull excuſe. There was ſeene not long ſince in the Councell of France ſuch a number of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Requeſts, and of Secretaries of the Treaſure, that very ſhame cauſed them to be ſent away, bicauſe it was not meete to entreat of great and waightie matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a multitude. Negligence likewiſe breedeth the<note place="margin">Negligence a cauſe of chang. Two ſorts of negligence.</note> change and ouerthrow of a politike Eſtate. There are two ſortes of negligence, the one in thoſe that call, chuſe, or receiue into any great office, ſuch men as are vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, and care not for their charges; or that ſuffer ſuch perſons to aſcend to the chiefeſt places of Magiſtracie, that are enimies to that forme of Common-wealth, as if the chiefe men in Bearne ſhoulde chuſe an Auoyer, which office is contrarie to their manner of liuing: or if the Venetians ſhould chuſe a Duke, or the Cardinals a Pope, that were not of their religion: or if the King of Fraunce ſhould create a Conſtable or Chancellour, that liked not a Royall and Monarchicall Eſtate. The other kinde of negligence, which is much more common, is in them that are called to a dignitie, office, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, and ſhewe them-ſelues retchles in that admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and exerciſe, as we ſee that moſte Biſhops and<note place="margin">Biſhops neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their charg to deale in worldly affaires, bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> Prelats neglect the dutie of their charges, to imploie or beſtowe their tyme in worldlie affaires, for which cauſe they growe into miſliking and contempt. From hence haue proceeded great offences, and maruellous troubles, which may more eaſilye bee lamented, than
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:8689:373"/>
taken away, or reformed, being ſuch abuſes as haue taken deepe roote. Moreouer, the alteration of policie is bred by other meanes by little and little, as when through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation or otherwiſe, men ſuffer ſome part, albeit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo little, of the lawe or politike Eſtate to be cut off.<note place="margin">An Eſtate is not changed all at one time, but by little and little.</note> Changes ſeldome fall out all at one time, if they are not very violent, but for the moſt part go on by litle and litle, as the ſeaſons of the yeere ſlide away ſoftly from great heates to hard froſts, and from the froſt and cold of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the heate of ſommer. A lingring feuer afflicteth the patient ſo eaſily, that he hardly perceiueth himſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: but if it be ſuffered to continue, without redreſſe in due time, it will turne to a hectick feuer, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently become incurable. So fareth it with an Eſtate and Policie, whoſe authoritie waxeth contemptible, and is loſt by little and little, when men are negligent in preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame in due time. He that will conſider the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration happened in France within theſe thirtie yeeres, ſhall find it to be very great, aſwell in regard of religion, as of manners and lawes, which neuertheles came by little and little, and ſo continueth ſtill, greatly threatning a change of the eſtate. Heere therefore I will diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the chance of lawes, cuſtomes, religion, &amp; place, which is properly but an alteration, and the change of an eſtate, which is when the ſoueraigntie goeth from one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Diſſimilitude a cauſe of chang.</note> the power of another. Diſſimilitude alſo is the cauſe many times of ſedition, and of change in the Common-wealth, which commeth to paſſe when the Inhabitants of a place are not of the ſame nation, but many ſtrangers are receiued into it, who perceiuing them-ſelues to be the ſtronger part, haue many times thruſt the naturall Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens out of their towne: whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alleadgeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples that fell ſo out in the Grecian cities.

Now in receiuing of ſtrangers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard muſt be had to the number, that it be not ouergreat, and that their authoritie be not vnmeaſurable. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is neceſſarie for trafficke ſake, and for many other publike commodities, that ſome be receiued of others. Many other kinds of diſſimilitude are found in common-wealths,<note place="margin">Diuers kinds of diſſimilitudes in Common-wealths.</note> as diſſimilitude of linage betweene the Nobilitie and Common-people: of offices, betweene Iudges, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, Souldiors, Prieſts: of profeſſions, betweene Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Phiſitions, Diuines, and Philoſophers: of occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, betweene Bakers, Butchers, Shooemakers, Painters, Smithes, Carpenters: without which diſſimilitudes no Common-wealth can conſiſt.

Through the diuerſitie heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they that are neereſt of kinne looſe their naturall loue, they that are of the ſame country and language, perſecute one another as mortall enimies, and ſundry nations ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre one another for the ſame. Theſe things are too well knowne amongſt vs to require proofs thereof. And truly<note place="margin">Diuerſitie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion among ſubiects, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</note> in reſpect of ſedition and tumult, nothing is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, than for ſubiects to be diuided in opinion, whether it be in matters of eſtate, or of lawes and cuſtoms, or for religion. For if they be of diuers opinions, ſome labour for peace, and ſeeke to make others agree vnto it, who wil neuer agree amongſt themſelues. And in truth it is a very hard matter to maintaine publike exerciſes of any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoeuer, when it is contrary to the religion of the people, or of the moſt of them, who many times cannot be kept within compaſſe neither by lawes nor Magiſtrats, vnleſſe the force appointed to keepe them in bee very<note place="margin">Thomas Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople ſlaine for pulling downe of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> great. For we ſaw that <hi>Thomas,</hi> Emperour of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was cruelly ſlaine by the people amidſt a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in the Church, bicauſe he went about to pull downe Images. But I am of this opinion (yet readye to yeeld to a better iudgement) that if men were honeſt and vpright, and walked in their calling holily, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fight among themſelues for religion. And if there had beene no other cauſe mingled therwith in our ciuill wars, we ſhould not haue had experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thoſe miſeries which daily ouer-whelme vs. The authoritie of a holie and free Councell may by the grace of God end all theſe diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:

in the meane time let euery one ſeeke by good life and amendment of manners, to ſerue for a light to thoſe that are out of the way, laying aſide all part-takings, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all iniuries, and taking vp againe our firſt vnitie, concord, &amp; friendſhip. Yea I doubt not, but that a Prince embracing with a true zeale the opinion of his religion, and neglecting the contrarye, would aboliſh it without force or conſtraint, if God maintain it not. For the minds of men reſolued in a religion, are more confirmed therin if they be reſiſted, but ſhrinke of themſelues if compulſion be not vſed. Now for the end and concluſion of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, laying a part the cauſes of ſeditions and ciuil wars, which bring alteration, and ouerthrow many times to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Monarchies, whereof we haue particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, we will heere comprehend, and reduce to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number the cauſes of the changes of all Common-wealths:<note place="margin">The cauſes that brcede the change of all Common-wealths.</note> namely, when the poſteritie of Princes faileth, and the greateſt amongſt them enter into ciuill warre for the Eſtate: when moſt of the ſubiects are extreme poore, and a few exceeding rich: when the diuiſion of offices and honors are vnequall: or elſe through extreame ambition and deſire of commanding: through the reuenge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries: through the crueltie and oppreſſion of tyrants: through the feare of chaſticement, which ſome haue that deſerue it: through the change of lawes and religion: through the greedie deſire that ſome haue to enioy at wil thoſe pleaſures which they ſeeke after: laſtly, through the expulſion of ſuch as defile the places of honor with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue and beaſtly pleaſures. All theſe things breede the change, corruption, and finall ouetthrow of flouriſhing Eſtates and great Monarchies, and therefore all Princes, Gouernors, and politike Rulers ought carefully to looke vnto them.</p>

in his time, reaſoned with them about their gouernments, that hee might knowe which of them had the beſt policie, and was furniſhed with the beſt lawes and moſte commendable cuſtomes.

But <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being deſirous to bee inſtructed by them in the beſt and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt pointes, neceſſarye for the preſeruation of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, prayed them to propounde euerye one three of thoſe cuſtomes and lawes that were moſte perfect in his<note place="margin">Choice cuſtoms of ſeuen flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Eſtates.</note> Common-wealth. The Embaſſadour of the Romanes beganne, and ſayde: <hi>Wee haue the Temples in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reuerence: wee are very obedient to our Gouernours: and we puniſh wicked men and euill liuers ſeuerely.</hi> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian Embaſſadour ſaid: <hi>In the Common-wealth of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, the Nobles neuer ceaſe fighting, nor the Common-people and Artificers labouring, nor the Philoſophers teaching.</hi> The Sicilian ſayd: <hi>In our Common-wealth iustice is exactly kept, merchandiſe exerciſed with truth, and all men account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues equall.</hi> The Rhodian ſayd: <hi>At Rhodes old men are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, yoong men ſhamefast, and women ſolitarie, and of fewe wordes.</hi> The Athenian ſayd: <hi>In our Common-wealth rich men are not ſuffered to be diuided into factions, nor poore men to be idle, nor the Gouernours to be ignorant.</hi> The Lacedemonian ſayd: <hi>In Sparta enuie raigneth not, for all are equall, nor coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, for all goods are common, nor ſlouth, for all labour.</hi> In <hi>our Common-wealth</hi> (ſayd the Embaſſadour of the Sicyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians) <hi>voyages are not permitted, that they ſhoulde not bring home newe faſhions at their returne: Phyſitions are not ſuffered, least they ſhould kill the ſound: nor Orators to take vpon them the defence of cauſes and ſuites.</hi> If all theſe good cuſtomes were iointly kept in any one Eſtate, I doubt not but the greatnes of it might be continued long, and all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſeditions cut off.

For I praie you, what vice is not grounded vpon an vnſatiable deſire of hauing, as may appeere in all them that can-not content them-ſelues with their preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, nor appoint an ende in that which they haue, but place it alwayes in that which they would haue.

For (ſaid he) when they perceiue that they draw neere the end of their office, the double their polling, and a newe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour doth as much: whereas other-wiſe, when they are once full gorged and ſatisfied, they are at the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned thereby to ceaſe from rauening, and to eaſe their people: namely, when they know that they ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies enioy their power and authoritie.

                     <hi>Aurelius Seuerus</hi> vſed, is much more praiſe-woorthie. For when he ſent Gouernours into the Prouinces, he cauſed their names to be publiſhed many daies before, to the end that whoſoeuer knew any thing in them woorthie of reprehenſion, he ſhould giue notice thereof: and they that reported truly, were promoted to honour by him, and ſlanderers grieuouſly puniſhed.

degrees of honor than their condition deſerueth. Again, they ought not to reſpect their owne valure and deſert ſo much, as to thinke that great eſtats and honors are a due and neceſſary reward for their vertue: and that vpon their deniall, they haue iuſt cauſe to make ſome commotion in the Common-wealth. But let them rather conſider that<note place="margin">Of whome a Prince holdeth his ſoueraigntie.</note> the Prince holdeth his ſoueraigntie of God, and of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lawes of the Eſtate, and that al his ſubiects in reſpect of him are but as a ſet of counters, whereof he maketh<note place="margin">Subiects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a ſet of counters.</note> one to be one in value nowe, then to ſtande for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, by and by for a hundred thouſand, and afterward for nothing.

But as contrarie Eſtates ought to be gouerned by contrarie meanes, ſo it is neceſſarie that in a Monarchie ſome offices ſhould be perpetuall, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutable.

Let them that are to care for the ſafetie of the Eſtate, watch alwaies, and ſtand vpon their gard, and often times propound cauſes of feare, to make the ſubiects more attentiue and heedefull to that which<note place="margin">The twelfth.</note> they ſhould doe. Let there be no contentions or quarrels betweene the Nobles, and let others be preuented that are not yet ioined to thoſe diſſentions, before they enter into them. This is the chiefeſt thing at this day, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our kings and Princes ought eſpecially to looke. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt their traines there is nothing but leagues and part-takings, from which nothing will proceede in the end but trouble and hurt to their Eſtate.

<pb n="739" facs="tcp:8689:379"/>
applied to incurable diſeaſes. For when all the people, or the moſt of them are culpable, to puniſh all, is as much as to ouerthrow the common-wealth. It is alſo a good mean and moſt vſuall for the auoiding of ſeditions, to take from<note place="margin">The fourteenth.</note> the people their armour, and to haue fortreſſes fenſed and furniſhed with all things neceſſarie for them. For the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of this giueth occaſion to troubleſome heads, and to ſuch as deſire nouelties to execute their wicked purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to trouble the eſtate: and the libertie of armour maketh them more fierce and inſolent therein. Moreouer we may comprehend that which is requiſite and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">Fiue neceſſary things for the preſeruation of euery common-wealth.</note> for the preſeruation of euery good Common-wealth vnder fiue things: namely, let it be loued faithfully, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended manfully, adorned with nobilitie, ordred profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and gouerned prudently. It is naturally ingrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery liuing creature, to loue that place where it tooke beginning. The ſauage beaſtes (ſaith <hi>Caſſiodorus)</hi> loue woods and foreſts: birds loue the ayre: fiſhes the ſea and<note place="margin">All liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures loue the place of their birth.</note> riuers: men loue the originall place of their birth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: in a worde, both men and beaſtes loue thoſe places where they purpoſe to liue and to continue long. He that is more in loue (ſaith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> with his priuate profite, than with publike wealth, looſeth the name of a good ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, and taketh vnto him the name of a wicked ſubiect. Therfore euery one both great and ſmall ought to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all good gifts in them to the benefit of their country, louing their fellow-ſubiects, &amp; exerciſing their charges &amp; callings faithfully. It is their dutie alſo manfully to defend the common-wealth againſt all forraine incurſions: and he that defendeth his countrey, defendeth himſelfe and his: He that refuſeth to die (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) in the defence of his countrey, dieth togither with it: which being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,<note place="margin">It is the dutie of euery ſubiect to defend his countrey.</note> the inhabitants are therewithall deſtroyed. No man therefore ought to feare daunger in defence of his countrey: and it is better to die for many than with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. They that die (ſaid <hi>Iustinian</hi> the emperour) in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Common-wealth, liue alwaies by glorie. Therefore euery one ought to arme himſelfe with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:8689:380"/>
which is one kind of Heroicall fortitude, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philoſophers ſay, that he may be ſeruiceable for the ſafegard of his countrey in time of need, and of a iuſt war.<note place="margin">The nobilitie is the ornament of a Common-wealth.</note> The nobilitie is the ornament of euery Common-wealth. For commonly the nobles are of greater abilitie, of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter behauior &amp; more ciuill than the common people, than artificers, and men of baſe eſtate, bicauſe they haue beene brought vp from their infancie in al ciuilitie and amongſt men of honor. Moreouer to haue a noble hart &amp; inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt the enimie, great to exerciſe liberalitie, curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and honeſt in talk, bold to execute, gentle to forgiue, are graces &amp; vertues proceeding from honeſtie, which are not ſo commonly found among men of baſe condition, as among thoſe that come of good &amp; ancient ſtocks. For this<note place="margin">Of the law <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapia.</hi>
                     </note> cauſe there was in Rome a law called <hi>proſapia,</hi> that is to ſay, the law of linage, wherby it was ordained, that they which deſcended from the race of the <hi>Fuluians, Torquates, &amp; Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> ſhould haue the Conſulſhip, when it ſo fell out, that the Senate diſagreed about the election of Conſuls. In like maner they that came of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in Lacedaemon, of <hi>Cato</hi> in Vtica, of <hi>Thucidides</hi> in Galatia, were not onely priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their own Prouinces, but alſo greatly honoured of<note place="margin">To whom the defence of a countrey chiefly belongeth.</note> all nations. The defence and preſeruation of the countrey belongeth chiefly to the nobles, as they that haue greater vſe and practiſe of weapons, than the common people haue, whom God &amp; nature haue ſubiected to them, that they ſhould be their defendors &amp; protectors. In this ſort then is the Common-wealth decked and adorned of the nobilitie, &amp; by their means honored of neighbor-friends, and feared of hir enimies. Next it muſt be ordred profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Where no order is, there is all confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore as a good father of a familie taketh order in his houſe, and a Pilote in his ſhip: ſo the magiſtrate muſt appoint an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his citie &amp; common-wealth. For all communitie is confuſion, if by order it be not brought to vnitie. Order<note place="margin">What order is.</note> is the due diſpoſition of all things. The order of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, times &amp; ſeaſons teacheth vs among other things the wiſdom of the Creator, who hath appointed all diuine, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:8689:380"/>
and earthly things by a wonderful diſpoſitie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any thing make magiſtrates of common-welths more admired &amp; commended, than the good order which they eſtabliſh in them. The end of all good order tendeth<note place="margin">The end of order.</note> to profit, as the end of confuſion to loſſe and deſtruction. And if profit be to be conſidered in any thing, it is chiefly to be thought vpon in a politike body. <hi>The more common &amp; generall a good thing is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aristotle) ſo much the more is it to be esteemed aboue another.</hi> Therefore if it be a good thing and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable to appoint a profitable order in a houſe or ſhip: it is a great deale better, yea moſt excellent, to order a Common-wealth profitably. Laſt of all a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth muſt be gouerned prudently. Gouernment preſuppoſeth order, bicauſe no man can rightly and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gouerne without order. Gouernement is a right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition<note place="margin">What gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</note> of thoſe thinges of which a man taketh charge vpon him to bring them to a conuenient ende. Euery Monarch, Emperour, King, Prince, Lord, Magiſtrate, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, Iudge and ſuch like, may bee called a Gouernour: in whom wiſedome, patience, and diligence are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie required for the diſcharge of their dueties. Neither may ignoraunce or any errour be receyued for ſufficient<note place="margin">Ignorance is no ſufficient excuſe for a magiſtrate.</note> excuſe of him that hath taken vpon him a publike charge, and much leſſe if he required and ſought for it himſelfe. Yea he may bee charged with the leaſt fault, eſpeciallie when it concerneth the eſtate, or ſome great matter wherein the Common-wealth hath intereſt. For this cauſe wee ſayd, that the Common-wealth muſt bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned with Prudence. But Prudence (ſayth <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle)</hi> preſuppoſeth wiſedome, and is the right reaſon of<note place="margin">What prudence is.</note> thinges that are to bee done. Without Prudence (ſaith <hi>Xenophon)</hi> wee can haue no vſe at all of vertue. For in the adminiſtration eyther of priuate or publique mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wee can come to no good ende, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Prudence, which teacheth vs to prouide for thinges to come, to order thinges preſent, and to call to minde thinges paſt. Wee haue heretofore diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more at large both of that vertue, and alſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:8689:381"/>
requiſite in euery magiſtrate for the faithfull execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his charge. Whereunto we wil adde this thing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that euery gouernor muſt remember, that lordſhip, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, kingdom, maieſtie, dominion and power are rather heathen than chriſtian wordes: and that the empire of a<note place="margin">What a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an empire is.</note> chriſtian prince is nothing elſe but a iuſt adminiſtration, protection and meane to do good. Therfore when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth an innumerable multitude of his ſubiectes, he is to thinke that ſo many millions of men depend of his carefulnes, not to do with them what pleaſeth him, but to labour and trauell to make them better than when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them. And in all things wherein the ſafetie of the common-wealth conſiſteth, whether it be in preuenting the cauſes of change therein, or in redreſſing ſeditions which trouble it, he muſt always reſolue with himſelfe to bring his purpoſe to paſſe, how difficult ſoeuer the way be, releaſing rather ſomewhat of the extremitie of right, (as <hi>Lucius Papinius</hi> ſaid) ſeeing the quietnes and ſafetie of the people is the chiefeſt, and moſt vpright lawe among men that can be. So that when the Common-wealth is in danger or in neceſſitie, we muſt freely beſtow vpon that bloud and name, which is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs with all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the politike body, whatſoeuer cannot bee kept backe without violating that common kindred, and the eſtate of the common-wealth. So that if he hinder pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like benefit, and hurt the eſtate, it is not to be called right any longer, as <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> ſaid, ſpeaking of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie<note place="margin">We muſt ſpare no coſt to help the common-wealth.</note> of the Tribunes among the people of Rome. And it is a point of true and naturall prudence ſometime to giue place to the times, but to neceſſitie always. A good Pilote neuer oppoſeth himſelfe wilfully againſt a tempeſt, but ſtriketh ſaile and keepeth himſelfe ſtill: then waighing his anchors, he floteth ſafely vpon the waues, which not long before were ſwollen and lift vp to drowne him. If a man ſtriue againſt a tempeſt and againſt heauen, doth he not euen blindfold caſt himſelfe downe headlong, and as it were deſperately ſeeke his owne deſtruction? Now if all theſe things hetherto mentioned by vs be diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:8689:381"/>
there is no doubt (God proſpering all) but that the preſeruation of Eſtates and Monarchies, with good remedies to keepe them from trouble and ſedition will follow after.</p>

                  <p>WE ſaw before (my companions) that a citie or ciuill company is nothing elſe but a multitude of men vnlike in eſtates or conditions, which communicate togither in one place their artes, occupations, workes and exerciſes, that they may liue the better, &amp; are obedient to the ſame lawes and magiſtrates.

                  <p>As we ſee that in the body of this vniuerſall frame, there is (as the Philoſophers ſay) matter, forme, priuation, ſimplicitie, mixture, ſubſtaunce, quantitie, action and paſſion, and that the whole world being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded<note place="margin">All things ſtand by proportion.</note> of vnlike elements, of earth, water, ayre and fire, is notwithſtanding preſerued by an Analogie and proportion, which they haue togither: and as we ſee in a mans body, head, hands, feete, eyes, noſe, eares: in a houſe, the husband, wife, children, maſter, ſeruaunts: in a politike body, magiſtrates, nobles, common people, artificers; and that euery body mingled with heate, cold, drie and moyſt, is preſerued by the ſame reaſon of analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and proportion which they haue togither: So is it in euery common-wealth well appointed and ordred, which conſiſting of many and ſundry ſubiects, is maintained by their vnitie, being brought to be of one conſent &amp; wil, and to communicate their works, artes and exerciſes together for common benefit &amp; profit. For euery one is beſt in his own arte, neither can all men do all things. And if it be a very hard matter to bee excellent in any one vocation, it is impoſſible to excel in al, &amp; to exerciſe them duly. Now we ſay that ſixe things are neceſſarily required to frame a happy citie &amp; ciuil ſocietie, namely, ſacrifices, iudgements, armes, riches, artes, and Aliments: vnto which ſixe things<note place="margin">Six ſundry cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in euery good common-wealth.</note> and works, ſix ſortes of men are anſwerable, Paſtors, magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, nobles, burgeſſes, artificers, and husbandmen. Therfore to begin the particular handling of the dutie &amp; office of theſe callings, and that as briefly as I can, we are firſt to note, that neuer any nation in all the world was ſo barbarous, or ſo farre eſtranged from ciuilitie, that did not acknowledge and adore ſome diuine nature, and vſe<note place="margin">No nation but adoreth ſome diuinitie.</note> ſome kind of ſacrifices and ſo conſequently that had not ſome prieſts to exerciſe them, &amp; ſome proper ceremonies.<note place="margin">The ſacrifices of Chriſtians.</note> 
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Politikes ſaith expreſly, that it is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to haue prieſts in euery city, to take care of the worſhip of the gods and of ſacrifices. Euery worke that we
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:8689:382"/>
do (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> to be ioyned neerer to God by a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſocietie, is a ſacrifice. There are three general ſorts of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices:<note place="margin">Three ſorts of ſacrifices.</note> the firſt is the ſacrifice of the ſoule, which we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to God by contrition, deuotion, contemplation and prayer: the ſecond is of the body, which we offer to God by faſting, abſtinence, or by ſuffring martyrdom to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his law, iuſtice and truth. The third ſacrifice is of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goods, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we offer them vnto him in the works of charitie according to his holy ordinance. So that if ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and prieſts always took place among the Barbarians, much more careful ought they to be to maintaine this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine myſterie, that adore and perfectly know God. And as men haue liued vnder three lawes, the law of Nature, the written law, and the law of Grace, ſo there were ſacrifices and prieſts vnder euery one of them. <hi>Melchizedech</hi> liued<note place="margin">Of prieſts and paſtors.</note> vnder the law of Nature, <hi>Aaron</hi> vnder the written lawe, and vnder the law of Grace, vnder which we liue at this preſent, Ieſus Chriſt that great and eternall Prieſt and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer, who hath offered himſelfe a ſacrifice for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and hath left vs his diſciples and Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours to be our paſtors in the guiding of our ſoules vnder his Teſtament and new couenaunt, which is the infallible rule of his holy and iuſt will. Therefore let them that boaſt, that they are called of God to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent charge, looke to diſcharge themſelues faithfully,<note place="margin">Wherein the office of true paſtors conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</note> by teaching the truth and leading a life agreeable to their doctrine.

He performeth theſe<note place="margin">Iuſtice diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into 7. parts.</note> duties perfectly by the diſtribution of iuſtice into ſeuen partes: <hi>by procuring that God may be worſhipped, that reuerence be giuen to ſuperiours, that concord be amongst equals, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline bee vſed towards inferiours, patience towardes enimies, mercy towards the poore, and that integritie of life proceede from himſelfe.</hi> Nowe let vs conſider of Armes, and of Nobles.<note place="margin">Of armes and of the neceſſitie of them.</note> Armes (as <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith) are all warlike inſtrumentes, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing both to ſet vpon our enimies, and to defend our ſelues from their aſſaultes and enterpriſes. They are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in a Common-wealth and citie for theſe three cauſes, to reſiſt the outward force of enimies, and to keepe them in feare: to repreſſe naughtie citizens, both
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:8689:383"/>
by compelling them to obey magiſtrates and lawes, and by puniſhing the guiltie: and laſt of all, to defend the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of ſubiects. The exerciſe and vſe of armes, warres and battels, hath from all antiquitie been committed to the noble men. Nobilitie (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith) is a glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">What nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is.</note> excellencie proceeding from aunceſtors, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that commeth from an auncient linage and ſtocke. Or, (according to <hi>Boetius Seuerinus)</hi> nobilitie is a prayſe that proceedeth from the deſerts of our Elders, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. Many make three kindes of Nobilitie: one that<note place="margin">Three kinds of nobilitie.</note> is bred of vertue and of excellent deedes: the ſecond that proceedeth from the knowledge of honeſt diſciplines and true ſciences: and the third that commeth from the ſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions and armes of our aunceſtors, or from riches. But to ſpeake truely, there is no right Nobilitie, but that<note place="margin">Which is right nobilitie.</note> which ſpringeth of vertue, and good conditions. For as he is a thiefe that ſtealeth, and he vniuſt that doth vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo he is a vile and baſe perſon, that dealeth vilanouſly. He boaſteth in vaine of his great linage, and ſeeketh to be eſteemed for the nobilitie and vertue of his aunceſtours, that hath no goodneſſe in him, nor commendable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic of his owne to ioine with thoſe of his predeceſſors. Let no man pleaſe himſelfe too much (ſaith <hi>Agapetus)</hi> in the nobilitie of his anceſtors, for all men haue dung for their ſtock from whence they come: both they that are pricked vp in purple and fine linnen, &amp; they that are afflicted with pouertie and ſickneſſe: as well they that are decked with crownes, as they that lie naked vpon the ſtrawe. Let vs not therfore brag of our earthly race, but let vs glory in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of maners. Although vice be in one that commeth of noble bloud, yet is it always lothſome and infamous: yea it doth ſo much the more appeere ſhameful &amp; odious, as it is ioyned with greater nobilitie. But vertue is the very liuely colour &amp; ornament of nobilitie, and cauſeth it to be honored for loue of it ſelfe only. <hi>All kings and princes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Plato) came of ſlaues, and all ſlaues of kings. What profite is there</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Macrines letter to the Senate of Rome touching nobilitie.</note> (ſaith <hi>Macrine</hi> the Emperour writing to the Senate of Rome) <hi>in nobilitie, if the hart of a prince be not repleniſhed with</hi>
                     <pb n="748" facs="tcp:8689:384"/>
                     <hi>bountie and gentlenes towards his ſubiectes? The goods of fortune come oftentimes to the vnwoorthie, but the vertue of the ſoule al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways maketh a man woorthie of the greatest praiſe. Nobilitie, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſuch like, come from without a man, &amp; are ſubiect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: but iustice, bountie, and other vertues, are not only wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bicauſe they come from the ſoule, but procure alſo to him that hath them &amp; vſeth them vertuouſly, a perfection of all felicitie. Yea it is far better and more commendable in a man, to leaue to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie a good beginning of nobilitie by vertue, than to defame by villanie &amp; wicked behauior that praiſe which he hath receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his predeceſſors.</hi> Therefore we ought not to be puft vp with pride bicauſe we come of a great race, ſeeing that honour belongeth more to our progenitors tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs, if we be not<note place="margin">Malach. 2. 10.</note> noble by our owne vertue. Is not one God (as <hi>Malachie</hi> ſaith) father of vs all? He made the firſt kings of a poore &amp; baſe ſtock, to teach vs, that men ought not through arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, &amp; vaine boaſting of their nobilitie, eſteeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues better than others, but ſo far forth only as his holy gifts and graces are more abundantly in them. <hi>Saule</hi> was choſen king as he was ſeeking his fathers aſſes: <hi>Dauid,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was a ſheepheard, and the yongeſt of his brethren. The brier and the roſe came of one and the ſame roote: ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men and vile perſons came of one maſſe and lumpe. The brier is reiected bicauſe it pricketh, &amp; the roſe for hir good ſmel is eſteemed and held in mens hands. So he that maketh himſelfe vile through vice, ought to be reiected, and he that is odoriferous and ſmelleth ſweetly by good vertues and noble actions, ought to bee eſteemed, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and accounted noble of what race &amp; ſtocke ſoeuer he<note place="margin">When nobilitie of birth is to be eſteemed.</note> commeth. True it is, that ancient nobilitie ioined with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue, is very commendable among men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in euery monarchie wel eſtabliſhed, of which the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie is the chiefeſt pillar, being appointed by God, and approoued by the law of man, for their fidelitie towardes their kings, and defence of their ſubiects, wherein the true<note place="margin">Of riches and burgeiſes.</note> dutie and office of noble-men conſiſteth. Riches are the fourth thing neceſſary in euery common-welth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently citizens, who commonly poſſeſſe them, and are
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:8689:384"/>
ſetled from all antiquitie in towns, hauing rents, reuenues and poſſeſſions, and being as it were the ſtrong pillars of cities, and of the whole political body. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are the ſinews of battels. For as the whole body of a<note place="margin">Riches are the ſinewes of war.</note> man feeleth &amp; moueth by the ſinewes: ſo the body of the common-wealth receiueth ſtrength &amp; power by riches, to gather men of war togither in defence of hir libertie. For this cauſe <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his plat-forme of a happy common-welth<note place="margin">They are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</note> requireth abundance of wealth and money to help publike affairs at home, &amp; warlike matters abroad. And in another place he ſaith, that a happy life conſiſteth in the perfect vſe of vertue, aſſiſted with bodily &amp; external goods, as with inſtruments that ſerue to execute honeſt actions wel &amp; vertuouſly. It is certain that gold &amp; ſiluer in reſpect of the ſoule, are neither good nor ill, but by good vſage they are made profitable for this life, &amp; the abuſe of them is hurtful both to the body &amp; ſoule. And in deed riches of their own nature are not to be condemned. <hi>Abraham, Lot, Iacob, &amp; Iob</hi> were rich &amp; holy men. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">The exceeding riches that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid left to Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> any king, either of the Hebrews, or of any other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, left ſo great riches to his ſucceſſor, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> For he left him to build the temple withal, 10000. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of gold, &amp; 100000. of ſiluer, beſide infinite ſtore of ſtuffe, of wonderful coſt and value, which he had cauſed to be prepared &amp; made readie. The ſumptuouſneſſe of that Temple, as it is deſcribed by this Hiſtoriographer, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull. He ſaith that it was made and finiſhed in ſeuen<note place="margin">The number of workmen about Salomons tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> yeeres by 80000. Maſons, 3200. Ouerſeers, &amp; 30000. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes that hewed wood in the foreſt, and 70000. others that brought ſtones and ſuch like matter for the worke. If the riches of the Romane Empire had not been great, I meane both the publique and priuate wealth, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that it had not ſo long time maintained it ſelfe in ſuch a glorious and flouriſhing eſtate, as the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before, cauſing the fartheſt and moſt vnknowen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſtand in feare of hir weapons. Hereof wee haue<note place="margin">Auguſtus main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained yeerely 44. legions of ſouldiors.</note> good proofe by that which we read of <hi>Augustus Caeſar,</hi> who ordinarily defrayed the charges of 44. Legions, which
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:8689:385"/>
amounted yeerely to twelue millions of gold. But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane<note place="margin">The limites of the Romane Empire in the time of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus.</note> empire was then come to the top of hir greatneſſe, hauing for hir bounds the riuer of Euphrates on the Eaſt ſide, the Ocea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſea on the Weſt, on the South ſide the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full region of Africa, and on the North ſide the riuers of Rhine and Danubius. At this day 50. kingdoms &amp; eſtates are diuided out of that monarchy. Therfore if the citizens of the common-wealth poſſeſſe riches, if they imploy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon good workes, and that liberally for the tuition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſetting foorth of their countrey, they behaue<note place="margin">Of Artes and Artificers.</note> themſelues like good citizens, borne to do good, and to profit the Common-wealth. The fift thing neceſſary in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good Common-wealth and citie, are occupations<note place="margin">What an Arte or occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is.</note> and conſequently craftſ-men. An arte is a habite of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king according to right reaſon, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith. Or elſe an arte is the knowledge of ſome certain thing gotten by vſe, inſtruction or reaſon, tending to neceſſary vſes for mans life. Some artes conſiſt in Speculation, and others in practiſe. We call Speculation Theoricall, that is to ſay, Speculatiue: and Action practicall, that is to ſay, Actiue. This word Artificer is deriued of the worde Arte. Nowe bicauſe that nature is moſt perfect next to God, the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer that arte approcheth to nature, the better and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter it is, as appeereth in images and pictures: ſo that arte<note place="margin">Arte is an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature.</note> is nothing elſe but an imitation of nature. Thoſe Artes that are commonly called Mechanicall, or handy-craftes, whereby they differ from liberall Artes, of which we haue alreadie diſcourſed, are of diuers ſortes. For the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them wee will preſuppoſe that man hath<note place="margin">Three things neceſſary for the life of man.</note> need of three temporall things for the maintenaunce of this life, namely, of <hi>Alimentes, Houſes,</hi> and <hi>Clothing.</hi> He ſtandeth in neede of Alimentes to reſtore the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of radicall moyſture, waſted away by naturall heate,<note place="margin">The vſe of Aliments.</note> (as the weeke conſumeth the oyle in the Lampe) I ſaye to reſtore it agayne by moyſt nouriſhment, as by breade, wine, fleſh, and other aliments, without which a man could not liue. Theſe nutrimentes are prouided and prepared by men of Occupations, as by Butchers, Fiſhmongers,
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:8689:385"/>
Bakers, Cookes, Vintners, and other handycraftſ-men, which ſerue and looke to the prouiſion of victuals. Next, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue need of houſes, that euery one may haue his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate place of refuge to keep his body, familie, &amp; goods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der couert: &amp; theſe are edifices and frames erected by the<note place="margin">The vſe of houſes.</note> arte of building, &amp; made by Maſons, Carpenters, Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians, Sawyers, Ioiners, &amp; other handycrafts that are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in caruing. Likewiſe a city, in reſpect both of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; of defence, ſtandeth in need of wals, towers, bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, rampires, andother things of defence, as alſo of temples and other common places: all which cannot be made without the artes of building and of Maſonry. The third thing which men ſtand in need of, are garments to<note place="margin">The vſe of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> clothe themſelues withall, to preſerue natural heat, and to keep out external cold: &amp; theſe are prouided by Mercers, Drapers, Tailors, Hoſiers, &amp; ſuch like. Beſides the aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named things we ſtand in need of armour &amp; of horſes to defend our libertie, and for our greater commoditie: and ſo conſequently Armorers, Glazers, Sadlers, Spur-makers, Smithes and ſuch like, are neceſſarie. Likewiſe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and recouerie of our health, we muſt honor the Phyſition, Chirurgion, Apothecarie, Drug-ſeller and ſuch like. The dutie and office of all artificers, is to auoyd idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">The dutie of all artificers.</note> ſlooth, and negligence, and eſpecially to vſe no deceit in their artes, but to referre the end of their labours more to common profite than to their priuate gaine. And for the auoiding of Ingroſſers, it is very expedient that the craftſ-men ſhould be diuided into diuers parts of the city,<note place="margin">Artificers of one Science, ought not to dwell all togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> and not placed all on a rowe in one quarter therof, as they do in the townes of Afrike, and in many cities of Europe. For beſides the diſcommodities in great townes, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery quarter hath not in it ſuch artificers as are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, it is to be feared that there wil be amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ingroſſers to fore-ſtall the merchandiſe and wares: or elſe iealouſie and quarels are to be feared, if one ſell better cheape than another, euen before his eyes that refuſed to take that money. It is true, that ſuch artificers as are leaſt required, as men that liue by the hammer, may be ranged
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:8689:386"/>
in one quarter, that thereby they may be ſeparated from men of learning and quietnes. The ſixt and laſt thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a Common-wealth remaineth to be conſidered<note place="margin">Of Aliments &amp; labourers.</note> of, namely, Aliments, and conſequently labourers. We haue already ſpoken of Aliments: but as for that which<note place="margin">The prayſe of husbandry.</note> concerneth husbandry eſpecially, there is no other arte, that doth more awaken the minde of man, that rauiſheth his ſences more, that affoordeth greater pleaſure, or is more neceſſarie and profitable for the life of man, than husbandry. Moreouer nothing ſauoureth of greater anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, nothing doth better diſcouer the greatnes of the<note place="margin">The antiquitie therof.</note> works of God, nothing doth caſt forth more liuely marks and beames of a wonderful diuinitie, than husbandry. For moſt of other arts were inuented long time after man was created of God, and augmented ſince by the induſtrie of many. Onely husbandry gaue ſufficient teſtimonie of it ſelf, &amp; of the incomprehenſible power of God, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the creation of the elements there came out of the bowels of the earth all kinds of herbes and plants garniſhed with their proper vertues for the ſeruice &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie<note place="margin">Men haue been always more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry than to any other vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> of man. Man himſelf alſo by a diuine and natural inſtinct hath been from the beginning more enclined and diſpoſed to the tillage of the earth, than to any other ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die &amp; vocation whatſoeuer: as we read of our firſt fathers who commonly called themſelues Laborers of the earth, and feeders of cattell. Husbandry and the countrey life were ſo much commended &amp; eſteemed of the auncients, that many of them haue written ſundry bookes therof in<note place="margin">Princes haue forſaken their diademes to fall to husbandry. <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                     </note> Greek &amp; Latin: and many monarchs haue heretofore left their great palaces, &amp; contemned their purple robes and diademes, that they might giue themſelues to the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of countrey co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was neuer better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and contented, than whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he might be dreſſing of ſome goodly piece of ground, and ſetting of a certaine number<note place="margin">Diocleſian.</note> of trees checker-wiſe. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> forſook the ſcepter of his empire, that he might with-draw himſelfe into the fields, and trim with his owne hands, trees, graffs, ſeuerall plots of ground, and gardens. Beſides in husbandry and the
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:8689:386"/>
countrey life, profite aboundeth with pleaſure and gaine<note place="margin">Profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure are ioyned togither in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</note> with delight. As for profite it is very euident. For a good husbandman is alwais prouided of bread, wine, fleſh, fruit, wood, and other Aliments. And concerning pleaſure, it is incredible to one that hath skill and will to conſider of the maruels of nature, beſides a thouſand delights, with exerciſes as pleaſaunt and profitable for his health as can be. And that benefit which is moſt excellent and chiefeſt of all, I meane tranquillitie of mind may more eaſily bee obtained by the Muſes darlings, and louers of knowledge<note place="margin">The countrey fitter for ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents than the citie.</note> in the midſt of the open fields and pleaſaunt ſound of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than amongſt the noiſe of ſuites &amp; diſſentions wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with cities are repleniſhed. It belongeth to the dutie of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers to liue in their ſimplicitie, and to do their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor<note place="margin">The dutie of husband men.</note> in tilling the fields. For the performing hereof they ſtand in need of 3. things: of skill to know the nature of<note place="margin">Three things neceſſary for them.</note> the ſoile, and the ſeaſons of ſowing and gathering: of will to be diligent and carefull to continue in their countrey labour: and laſtly, of abilitie to prouide oxen, horſes, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, &amp; other inſtruments of husbandrie. By this diſcourſe therefore we may ſee what things are moſt requiſite and neceſſarie for the inſtitution of a happy common-wealth, and that no man is ſo induſtrious, wittie or prudent, that of himſelfe without the helpe of another he can liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſocietie, and miniſter to himſelfe all neceſſary things. For this cauſe the fellowſhip of many togither was found out, that by teaching, iudging, defending, giuing, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, changing, ſeruing and communicating their works and exerciſes one with an other, they might liue well and commodiouſly togither. Which thing will vndoubtedly come to paſſe in euery Common-wealth, when euery one walking in his vocation, directeth his will and worke to the ſeruice of God, his prince and countrey.</p>

Lawes and good politike ſtatutes are neceſſary for it in time of peace, that the Prouinces may be quietly gouerned: but in time of warre it muſt alwayes haue armour readie and coueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forces, to helpe friends, to reſiſt enimies, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diſobedient ſubiectes within compaſſe.

But this law-maker referred all his lawes to warre and to victorie, and kept his ſubiects in continuall exerciſe of Armes, not ſuffering them to learne any other ſcience or handi-craft, vnto which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Ilotes onely, who were men brought in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection by the right of warre. Whereby <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſeemeth to haue beene of this mind, that force ought to be miſtres in all worldly matters, and that other things ſerue to no purpoſe if they want Armes, which by a certaine right of warre that ſhall alwaies continue amongſt men, bring in ſubiection to Conquerours the perſons &amp; goods of thoſe whome they ouercome. It ſeemeth alſo he thought, that there was neuer any true peace amongſt men, but onely in name, and that all Princes and people liue in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſtruſt one of another, and doe nothing elſe for the moſt part but watch how to ſurprize each other, (as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tark</hi> elegantly ſetteth it out) notwithſtanding all leagues and goodly agreements that paſſe betweene them. <hi>Numa</hi>

                     <hi>Pompilius,</hi> ſecond king of the Romanes, cleane contrary to <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> was ſo farre in loue with peace, and referred all his lawes in ſuch ſort thereunto, that during his raigne, there was neither warre, nor ciuil diſſention, nor any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of noueltie in the gouernment of the Common-wealth.

For not onely at Rome the people were tractable through the example of the iuſtice, clemencie, &amp; goodnes of king <hi>Numa,</hi> but alſo in the townes round about there was a maruellous alteration of manners: inſomuch that as the beames of a cleare Sunne are diſperſed abroad, ſo there was ſhedde in the hartes of men a ſecrete deſire to liue in peace, to labour the grounde, to bring vppe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren quietly, and to ſerue and honour their gods. And <hi>Plutarke</hi> writeth in his life, that in his time there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but feaſtes, plaies, ſacrifices, and bankets through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Italy: ſo that a man might ſay, that the wiſedome of <hi>Numa</hi> was a liuely fountaine of all goodnes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, out of which many riuers iſſued to water all Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that his peaceable prudence was communicated as it were from hande to hande vnto the whole worlde. Nowe, although theſe two men haue beene greatly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and commended for ſundrie rare vertues, yet all men approoue not the extremities which they followed in this forme of gouernment. For as he is pernitions that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and continueth warre onely to ſubdue his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to inlarge the borders of his countrie, and to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe<note place="margin">The diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of a long peace.</note> other mens right, which ſauoureth more of brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, than of humanitie: ſo a long peace bringeth with it many diſcommodities, making men inſolent common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through too great proſperitie, as alſo nice, lauiſh, and effeminate, through abundance of wealth and idlenes. Therefore <hi>Plato, Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Polybius</hi> reprooue <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> bicauſe he propounded onely the exerciſe of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of warre to his Citizens, which is the leaſt of thoſe foure, that are neceſſarie for the eſtabliſhment and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of euery Empire: ſaying, that all his lawes were wel ordained to make men valiant, but not iuſt, temperat, and prudent. On the other ſide, they that are too much affected to peace and quietnes, weaken themſelues by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little before they be aware, and by their example mollifie the courage of youth, whereby they lie open to
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:8689:388"/>
the iniuries of thoſe that will inuade them, and ſo looſe their libertie, not being able to defend their perſons and goods. But as the world is compounded of 4. elements, by<note place="margin">Excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the compoſition of the world, and of euery happy Common-wealth.</note> whoſe mixture it is ſo made, that it is both ſeene and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, &amp; withall is preſerued in ſuch loue &amp; concord, that it cannot be diſſolued by any other tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by him that made it: ſo euery publike Eſtate muſt be eſtabliſhed by 4. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, by whoſe harmony &amp; agreement it is preſerued. And as the fire &amp; the earth were firſt created to make the whol frame ſubiect to ſight &amp; feeling, and then the water &amp; the aire mingled with them, that the diſſimilitude of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames might be tempered according to proportion: ſo fortitude and iuſtice are firſt required in the ordaining of Common-wealths, bicauſe they cannot continue without law and ſtrength, and next prudence and temperance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioined with them, moderate the rigour and remiſnes of both. Againe, as by theſe natures of which all things are made, being diſperſed aboue and beneath, and on all ſides, the world is preſerued and continued, ſo that light things are kept from aſcending through the waight of heauy things, &amp; contrariwiſe heauy things held aloft, that they fal not: ſo by theſe 4. vertues diſperſed amongſt men, a Common-wealth wel inſtituted &amp; guided by diſcipline, is maintained. And although by reaſon of the varietie and change of humane affaires it cannot continue ſo long, &amp; ſo adorned as the worlde, yet it will abide many yeeres. Moreouer, as the elements are bred one of another, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to &amp; fro, going into, &amp; returning continually from the firſt matter, which receiueth them into it ſelfe, for which cauſe they cannot be ſeene ſimple, but mixed: wherupon ariſeth ſuch a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature of al things, that they wither not by drougth, nor burne with heate, neither are ouer-whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with too great moiſture, nor grow ſtiff with exceſſiue cold: ſo theſe vertues whereby cities are inſtituted, muſt be mingled one with another, &amp; agree togither for their mutuall preſeruation, wiſedome beeing Preſident ouer them in which they are all contained. For they cannot maintaine them-ſelues one without another, nor keepe

Iuſtice without temperance is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour: fortitude ſeparated from iuſtice is raſhnes and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and without prudence iuſtice is but craft and ſuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. To conclude, temperance without fortitude ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called cowardlines and nicenes: whereby we ſee that they are ſo interlaced, and depend in ſuch ſort one of another, that they cannot be ſeparated. If it fal out otherwiſe, that eſtate wherein ſuch diſorder taketh place, muſt of neceſſitie be vtterly ouerthrowne or changed. Out of theſe learned Philoſophicall diſcourſes we will draw a very good leſſon: namely, that in euery Eſtate wel inſtituted for continuance, this temperature of the foure vertues muſt neceſſarily be kept, that men may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted howe to gouerne themſelues well both in time of peace and of warre, and obſerue ſuch a moderation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that knowing how to deale in both times, they may be ready and fit for warre when neceſſity vrgeth, hauing this<note place="margin">Peace is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warre.</note> end before them to attaine to peace, which muſt alwaies be preferred, as reſt is before trauell, and good before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, as we ſhal eaſily vnderſtand by conſidering their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects. It is certaine that Philoſophie is beſt exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">The effects of peace.</note> in time of peace. For when there is no trouble of war, the ſpirite is quiet, and fit for euery honeſt kind of reſt, ſo that arts and ſciences go well forward, lawes are in force, iuſtice flouriſheth, vertue ſheweth hir effects better, vice languiſheth, the zeale of pietie encreaſeth, the diſcipline of the Church is authoriſed, both the noble and meane man preſerueth and augmenteth his wealth, trade and trafficke is free: briefly, euery one receiueth good &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,<note place="margin">The effects of warre.</note> and ſo conſequently the whole bodie of the Common-wealth. But if we looke to thoſe effects, which the time of warre commonly bringeth foorth, the deſire of hauing is awakened, couetouſnes encreaſeth, iuſtice fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the ground, force and violence beareth ſway, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling raigneth, riot is ſet at libertie, wicked men are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, good men oppreſſed, innocencie troden vnder foote, maidens and wiues defloured, countries waſted, houſes burnt, Churches deſtroied, tombs broken downe,
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:8689:389"/>
goods ſpoiled, murders committed, all vertue baniſhed from among men, vice honoured, the lawes contemned and broken, the ſeruice of God forſaken, the eſtate of the Church derided, the nobilitie and people burdened with infinite charges and coſtes, all kinde of trade hindered: briefly, there is no calamitie or miſerie that aboundeth not in the Common-wealth in time of warre. We may<note place="margin">What kingdom is happie.</note> iudge that kingdome happie, wherein the Prince is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the lawe of God and nature, Magiſtrates to the Prince, priuate men to Magiſtrates, children to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſeruants to their maiſters, and ſubiects being linked in loue one with another, &amp; all of them with their Prince, enioy the ſweetenes of peace, and true quietnes of mind. But warre is cleane contrary thereunto, and ſouldiors are ſworne enimies to that kind of life. For war maketh men<note place="margin">Warre maketh men cruell, and peace gentle.</note> barbarous, mutinous, and cruell, as peace maketh them curteous, and tractable. We read that Engliſhmen were in times paſt ſo ſeditious and vntameable, that not onely their Princes could not do what they would, but alſo the Engliſh merchants were of neceſſity lodged apart by them ſelues. For ſo the towne of Antwarpe was conſtrained to do, where there was one houſe common for all merchant ſtrangers, except Engliſhmen, who had a houſe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, bicauſe they could not abide to be ioined with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The chiefe cauſe of that ſtrang qualitie was bicauſe their countrie bordered vpon two Eſtates and Nations that were their enimies: namely, vpon the Frenchmen and Scots, with whome they had continuall warre: but ſince they concluded a peace, and ioined in league with France and Scotland, they became very mild and ciuill. And contrariwiſe the Frenchmen, who were inferiour to no nation whatſoeuer, in curteſie &amp; humanitie, are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed from their naturall diſpoſition, and become ſauage ſince the ciuill warres began. The like (as <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith) happened to the Inhabitants of Sicilia, who by meanes of continuall warre grew to be like brute beaſtes. <hi>Archidamus</hi> king of Lacedemonia, knowing well the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of peace and warre heere briefly touched by vs, and
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:8689:390"/>
hearing that the Elians ſent ſuccors to the Archadians to<note place="margin">Archidamus let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Elians.</note> warre againſt him, tooke occaſion to write vnto them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Laconicall manner, in ſteede of a long diſcourſe. <hi>Archidamus</hi> to the Elians: <hi>Peace is a goodly thing.</hi> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time he gaue a notable teſtimonie how farre he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred peace before warre, when he made this anſwer to one that commended him, bicauſe hee had obtained a battell againſt the fore-ſaid Archadians: <hi>It had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if we had ouercome them by prudence rather than by force.</hi> The ſelfe ſame reaſon of louing peace, and of abhorring<note place="margin">Cato miſliked Caeſar for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of peace.</note> the breakers thereof, was the cauſe why <hi>Cato</hi> in a full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate oppoſed himſelfe againſt the requeſt which <hi>Caeſars</hi> friendes made, that the people ſhould offer ſacrifices by way of thankſ-giuing to the gods, for the notable victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which he had gotten againſt the Germanes, of whom he had ſurprized and diſcomfited 300000. I am (ſaid <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)</hi> rather of this opinion, that he ſhould be deliuered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands whome he hath wronged without cauſe by violating the peace, which they had with the people of Rome, that they may puniſh him as they thinke good, to the ende that the whole fault of breaking faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with them, may be caſt vpon him alone, and not be laid vpon the citie, which is no cauſe at all thereof. And to ſay truth, wiſe men are greatly to feare all beginnings of warre. For being in the end growne to ſome ripenes, after that ſome men wanting experience in worldly affaires, haue raſhly and vnskilfully ſowne the ſeede thereof, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can the greateſt and wiſeſt kings plucke it vp againe without great labour and perill. Therefore they that are too deſirous and haſtie to begin warre, peruert the order of reaſon: bicauſe they beginne by execution and force, which ought to be laſt, after due conſultation. But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth greater honour and praiſe that procureth peace, and winneth the enimies harts by loue, than he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth victorie by ſhedding their blood cruelly. For this<note place="margin">Wherefore and when we muſt begin warre.</note> onely reaſon (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> we muſt begin warre, that we may liue in peace, and not receiue wrong: but this muſt be done after we haue required ſatisfaction for the iniurie

offered. It was for theſe conſiderations that <hi>Phocion,</hi> that great Athenian Captaine laboured to ſtoppe the warre, which the people of Athens had determined to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Macedonians, at the perſwaſion of <hi>Leosthenes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phocion diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from warre.</note> And being demanded when he would counſell the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians to make warre, when I ſee (quoth he) that the yong men are fully reſolued not to leaue their rankes, that rich men contribute monie willingly, and Oratours abſtaine from robbing the Common-wealth. Neuertheles the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was leauied againſt his counſell, and many woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at the greatnes and beautie thereof, asked him howe he liked that preparation. It is faire for one brunt ſaid <hi>Phocion,</hi> but I feare the returne and continuance of the warre: bicauſe I ſee not that the citie hath any other meanes to get monie, or other Veſſels and men of warre, beſide theſe. And his foreſight was approoued by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. For although <hi>Leosthenes</hi> proſpered in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his enterpriſe (whereupon <hi>Phocion</hi> being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whether he woulde not gladly haue doone all thoſe great and excellent things, anſwered that he would, but not haue omitted that counſell which he gaue) yet in the end he was ſlaine in that voyage, the Grecian armie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi> two Macedonians, and the citie of Athens brought to that extremitie, that it was conſtrained to ſende a blanke for capitulations of peace, and to receiue within it a garriſon of ſtrangers. Thus it falleth out commonly to thoſe that ſeeke for war by all meanes, either by right or wrong.

Moreouer, we ſee that famine and the peſtilence commonly follow war. For the abundance of all things being waſted, want of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals muſt of neceſſitie ſucceede, whereupon many diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes grow. Briefly, it bringeth with it nothing but a heape of all euils and miſeries, and eaſily draweth and allureth the violence and euill diſpoſition of many to followe the<note place="margin">Malcontents are glad of war.</note> ſtate of the time. For they that deſire a change, are very glad of ſuch an occaſion to ground their plat-formes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which they could not doe in time of peace, bicauſe men are then of a better iudgement and affection, aſwell<note place="margin">Cauſes why the exerciſe of arms muſt alwaies continue.</note> in publike as in priuate matters. But whatſoeuer we haue ſpoken of the miſeries that followe warre, warlike diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline muſt not be ſuffered to degenerate in a Common-wealth well eſtabliſhed: ſeeing there is neuer want of euill neighbours that are deſirous to incroach vppon other mens borders, and ſeeing the lawes, iuſtice, ſubiects, and the whole ſtate, are vnder the protection of Armes, as it were vnder a mightie buckler. And foraſmuch as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our life, &amp; purſuite of theeues is warranted both
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:8689:391"/>
by the lawe of God, of nature, and of man, it followeth that the ſubiects muſt needes be trained vp in feates of Armes, both defenſiue and offenſiue, that they may be a buckler to the good, and a barre to the bad. Wherein the<note place="margin">Auguſtus kept 40. legions in continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of warlike diſcipline.</note> example of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is very notable, who in time of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured peace would not diſſolue and diſmiſſe the fortie le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, but ſent them to the Prouinces &amp; borders of thoſe nations that were moſt barbarous to keepe them in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſcipline, and withall to take away as neere as he<note place="margin">Conſtantine the Great.</note> could all occaſion of ciuill warre.

For the concluſion therfore of our diſcourſe, let vs learn to deſire peace rather than war, the one being a certaine ſigne of the bleſſing of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, and the other of his wrath and maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for a Prince.</note> Let the Prince thinke with himſelfe (as <hi>Traian</hi> wrote to the Senate) that he is called not to warre, but to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne: not to kill his enimies, but to roote out vices: not ſomuch to goe foorth to warre, as to tarie in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: not to take another mans goods from him, but to doe iuſtice to euery one, eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that in warre a Prince can fight but in the place of one, at which time he is wanting to many in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.

                  <p>If we appoint to euery one (ſaith <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plato)</hi> his ſeuerall arte whereunto he is apteſt by nature, and which he muſt vſe all his life time, forſaking all other trades, to the ende that obſeruing opportunities, he may diſcharge it the better, there is no doubt but that in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſcipline, which is great deale more excellent than any other trade, greater leaſure, greater cunning and<note place="margin">It is not the weapon that maketh a warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note> practiſe is neceſſarily required. For if a man take a tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, or ſome other warrelike weapon and inſtrument in his hande, he is not by and by fit to fight, much leſſe of ſufficient courage to ſerue manfully, if he be not long before prepared there-vnto by ſound reaſons and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. It is no woorke of an hower, or of a daie, to perſwade men, that if they will get praiſe, they muſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them-ſelues to ſuſtaine all trauels, to aſſaie all perils, and to holde this opinion conſtantly, that it is more to
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:8689:392"/>
bee deſired to die fighting in a good and iuſt quarrell, than to eſcape with life by flying away. But that which<note place="margin">From whence valure procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</note> breedeth and nouriſheth ſuch thoughts in mens harts, is the good education and inſtitution of youth in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of vertue, and in the knowledge of Fortitude and Magnanimitie, which are inſeparably followed of honor and immortall glorie: whereby all feare of enimies is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and watching, trauelling, ſuffering, obeying, well liked of, that they may bring to paſſe their noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes. The Aſſyrians, Perſians, Grecians, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, whoſe deedes of Armes are almoſt incredible, had alwaies in ſingular recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation the maintenance of warlike diſcipline: but their chiefe deſire was to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print<note place="margin">Three things neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in men of warre. Good will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from good inſtitution.</note> theſe three things in the hartes of their ſouldiours, <hi>Willingnes, Reuerence,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> of which things the happie conduct of all warre dependeth. They that were well brought vp and inſtructed in vertue, could not want good will to execute vertuous actions. Thoſe Heads and<note place="margin">Reuerence from the wiſedome and experience of Captaines.</note> Leaders of armies that were well choſen, and had wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and experience, did by their woonderfull vertue prouoke euery one to reuerence them. Moreouer, this Maxime of warre was diligently practiſed of the Heads:<note place="margin">Obedience is wrought in them by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Heads.</note> namely, to make their ſouldiours more deuout and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, than affectionated to any other thing, howe gainefull ſoeuer it were. At this daie, as the former education and inſtruction is wanting, ſo the Heades and Captaines are inſufficient. And from thence proceedeth the diſorder and diſobedience of men of warre, whereuppon loſſe of the battell, and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the armie followeth in ſteede of victorie. But that we may beginne to conſider of this ancient warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſcipline, wee will heere onely waigh the order of the Romane armies and battels, who excelled all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in feates of Armes: and then wee will looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that great obedience and ſeuere rule of liuing, that was obſerued among the men of warre. We ſhall not finde in all the Romayne Hiſtories anye battayle of greater or more importaunce betweene the people of
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:8689:393"/>
Rome, and any other nation, than that which they had with the Latines, when <hi>Torquatus</hi> and <hi>Decius</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls. For as the Latins by looſing the battel were brought<note place="margin">The vertue of the Captaines is much in war.</note> into bondage, ſo ſhould the Romanes haue beene, if they had not woonne it. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> is of this opinion, who maketh both the armies in all reſpectes alike, both for number, vertue, reſolution and order, and putteth the difference onely in the vertue of the Captaines, which he ſuppoſeth was greater on the Romanes ſide, &amp; ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cauſe of their victory. The likenes &amp; equalitie of theſe two hoſts proceeded of this, bicauſe they had long time followed &amp; practiſed feates of armes togither, vſing the ſame order, language, &amp; weapons; &amp; keeping the ſelfe ſame maner of ordring their battels, inſomuch that both<note place="margin">The ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane armie.</note> their orders &amp; their Captaines had the ſame names. Now this was the order of the Romane army. Their whole hoſt was diuided into three principall parts, whereof the firſt conſiſted of pike-men, the ſecond of the chiefe gentlemen &amp; Lordes, the third was called the rereward, &amp; euery part was chiefly compounded of foot-men, being accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">The Romanes diuided their armie into three parts.</note> with a certaine number of horſemen. Their battels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordered in this ſort, they placed pike-men in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, right behind them were the noblemen, and in the third place behind they appointed their rereward, which they called by the name of <hi>Triariẏ.</hi> They had alſo certaine troups of horſemen, both on the right &amp; left ſide of euery part of their army, whom they called wings, in reſpect of the place which they had, bicauſe they ſeemed to be the wings of that body. They ſet the foreward cloſe togither in the fore-front, that it might both breake in vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimy, &amp; ſuſtaine the on-ſet. The battel, bicauſe it was not to fight firſt, but to ſuccour the fore-ward when it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put to the woorſt or driuen backe, was not ioined ſo cloſe, but kept their ranks wider aſunder, ſo that it might without diſorder to it ſelfe receiue the foreward within it, if by any miſhap or breach of aray, it ſhould be conſtrained to retire. The rereward had their ranks farther diſtant one from another than the battel, that it might be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:8689:393"/>
within it both the foreward and the battell when neede required. Their battels then being thus ranged, they began the skirmiſh, and if their pikemen were driuen backe and vanquiſhed, they retired into the diſtances and void ſpaces of the noble-men. Then both of them being knit togither in one, made one bodie of two battels, and ſo began the fight againe. But if they both being ioined togither were put to the worſt, they gathered themſelues togither in the wide and large rankes that were left for them in the rereward of the <hi>Triariẏ.</hi> And then theſe three parts ioined in one renued the fight, and ſo either loſt or woonne the battell, being vnable to repaire them-ſelues againe. Therefore when the rereward entered into the conflict, the armie was in danger: whereupon aroſe that prouerbe, <hi>Res redacta eſt ad Triarios,</hi> which is aſmuch to ſay in Engliſh, as <hi>the matter is brought to the Rereward,</hi> &amp; to the extremitie. Now the Captaines of theſe our times, hauing<note place="margin">The benefite of this Romane order.</note> forſaken all order of ancient diſcipline, make no account of this ordinance of warre, although if it be well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it will be found a matter of great importance. For he that ordreth his hoſt ſo that he may repaire himſelf thrice in one battell, muſt haue fortune his enimie three ſundry times before he can looſe it, and be vtterly ouerthrowne. Whereas he that truſteth onely to the firſt encounter, as the moſt do at this day, offereth himſelfe raſhly vnto dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and loſſe. For one onely diſorder, one ſmal vertue may cary the victorie from him. Now that which hindreth our armies from repairing themſelues thrice, is the lack of skil to gather one battel into another. We alſo appoint onely a foreward and a maine battel for the moſt part, &amp; lay the hope &amp; ſtrength of the armie vpon the horſemen: wheras the Ancients made moſt account of the footmen. So that if the horſe-men receiuing the onſet ſhould haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, and their aray broken, the reſt were eaſie to be delt withall: beſide, that commonly the foote-men are diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by their owne horſemen, being compelled to retire. For this cauſe the Switzers, called by ſome maiſters of theſe late warres, when they purpoſe to fight, eſpecially
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:8689:394"/>
                     <note place="margin">The wiſedome of the Switzers fighting on the Frenchmens ſide.</note> on the Frenchmens ſide, are very carefull to haue the horſemen on the one ſide, and not to followe next after them, to the ende that being wide of them, if by miſhap they ſhould be repulſed, yet they might not ouer-runne<note place="margin">Frenchmen loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, looſe alſo the victorie.</note> and diſorder them. And this hath beene often-times no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Frenchmen according to the aduantage or diſcommoditie of the firſt brunt giuen by their foreward or battell, haue been partakers of the like iſſue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent afterward: ſo that if they were put to the woorſt in the firſt encounter, their enimie was in a manner aſſured of the victorie. This cauſed <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> to write in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, that Frenchmen in the beginning of a battell<note place="margin">Some armies are furious, and yet keepe good order.</note> are more than men, but in the ende leſſe than women. But that which cauſeth them to breake their order ſo quickly, may be better knowne, if we ſet downe heere two kindes of armies, the one where there is furie and order, as there was in the Romane armie, in which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the teſtimonie of all hiſtories, good order through continuance of time had planted ſuch a warlike diſcipline, that nothing was doone among them but by rule. They did neither eate, nor ſleepe, nor deale in any other warlike or priuate action, without the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Conſul, or Head of the armie. So that all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue being thus ſetled amongſt them, they exerciſed their furie by meanes, and as time and occaſion ſerued: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any difficultie ariſe, that could quaile their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution well begunne, or cauſe them to be diſcouraged,<note place="margin">Good order in armies is neuer without hope of victorie.</note> by reaſon of their good order, which refreſhed them and ſtrengthened their courage that was nouriſhed with the hope of victorie, which is neuer wanting as long as good orders are truly obſerued. But in the other kind of armie<note place="margin">In the French armies is furie without order.</note> where furie beareth ſway, and not order, as it falleth out often in the French armies, if victorie doth not followe their firſt aſſaie. For their furie, wherein their hope conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, is not ſuccoured with ſetled vertue, neither haue they any other confidence but in their furie, ſo that as ſoone as they are ſomewhat cooled, and ſee neuer ſo little diſorder and breach of aray, they are preſently diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:8689:394"/>
Contrariwiſe, the Romanes being leſſe afraid of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, bicauſe of their good order, fought firmely and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely togither without any diſtruſt of the victorie, being as courageous and vertuous in the ende as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: yea the harder they were charged with weapons, the more were they inflamed and ſet on fire. Moreouer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their warlike diſcipline, it may eaſily be knowne by that ſpeech which <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> rehearſeth of <hi>Papirius Curſor,</hi> who complained of the corruption that began to growe in their armie, for the which he would haue puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed<note place="margin">The ancient warlike diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> 
                     <hi>Fabius</hi> Generall of the horſemen. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beareth any reuerence either to men, or to the gods. The Edicts of the Captaine, of the Coronell, and of the Soothſaiers, are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. The ſouldiours goe wandering vppe and downe like vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, both in countries that are at peace with vs, and alſo in our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies lands: they diſcharge themſelues at their pleaſure, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their oath. The Enſignes are deſolate, and not followed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they ioine not togither as they are commanded, nor conſider whether it be by day or by night, whether in a place of aduantage, or of diſaduantage. They fight without the Captaines commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they keepe not their rankes and ſignes. Briefly, whereas war was woont to be ſolemne and ſacred, it is diſordered, inconſiderate, and guided at all aduenture, after the manner of theeury.</hi> But as<note place="margin">What manner of campe the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes had.</note> long as warlike diſcipline tooke place among the ancient Romanes, their campe was a ſchole of honor, of ſobriety, of chaſtity, of iuſtice, &amp; of all vertue, ſo that no man might reuenge his owne iniuries, or proceed of himſelf peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily. They knew not what it was to liue at diſcretion, much leſſe to go a foraging, to rob, ſteale, beate or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">Of the ancient obedience of ſouldiors to their captains.</note> as men do now a daies. And as touching obedience towards their Captaines, it was very wonderfull. For they feared not to preferre it before the ſafetie of their owne liues, and before all victorie. At the battell of Cannas the Romane knights ſeeing the Conſull alight and certaine others with him bicauſe he was hurt, and thinking that he had commanded them all to doe ſo, they preſently left their horſes, which was the cauſe of their ouerthrow. And this did <hi>Hannibal</hi> then declare with a loude voice,
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:8689:395"/>
ſaying: I would not deſire rather to haue them deliuered to me bound, than as they be. The executions that were ſhewed vpon the diſobedient and offenders were ful of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,<note place="margin">Of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was ſhewed vpon ſouldiors that offended.</note> and the qualitie of their puniſhments maruellous ſtrange. For the Heads of armies ſometime ſticked not to cauſe a whole legion to paſſe through the pikes, (which conſiſted of 6000. footemen, &amp; 500. horſemen) for ſome<note place="margin">The tithing of armies was moſt ſeuere.</note> notable fault committed by them. But among all their terrible executions, the tithing of armies was moſt ſeuere, when euery tenth man throughout a whole hoſte was by lot put to death. No kinde of puniſhment could be found that was more fearefull for the correcting of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude than this, which they practiſed eſpecially when the chiefe author, and they that were the procurers of ſome notorious fact, were not knowne. For then it had beene too much to haue chaſticed the whole companie: and if ſome had beene corrected, and others left vnpuniſhed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents peraduenture ſhould haue ſuffered, and the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie eſcaped ſcot-free. Whereas by tithing they that were puniſhed, could not complaine but of the lot: and the reſt were kept in feare, leaſt the like faults ſhould fall out againe amongſt them. Whereupon they obſerued one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that as many as did not their dutie might bee<note place="margin">How Captaines were puniſhed if they offended</note> knowne and chaſticed. The Captaines and Heads of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were no leſſe rigorouſly handeled by them that had the ſoueraigntie of the Eſtate, if they did capitulate, or make any agreement with the enimies, to the detriment and diſaduantage of the Common-wealth. For they ſent them backe againe naked, and not the Heads onely, but alſo all that had any charge in the armie, and conſented to the compoſition, that the enimies might returne vpon their Heades all the ſinne of breaking that oath which they had taken, and that appointment which they had ſworne to. The Emperour <hi>Aurelius</hi> laboured earneſtly to bring in againe the ancient diſcipline of warre, and to<note place="margin">Aurelius letter to a Tribune touching war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſcipline.</note> cauſe it to be ſtrictly obſerued: whereof his letter is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient teſtimonie, being written by him to a Tribune of warre, in theſe words. <hi>If thou wilt be a Tribune, or rather if</hi>

And truely the vnmeaſurable licence that is granted them, cauſeth the ſouldior to enter into the field onely to ſpoile and rob, and to eſchew the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And in ſtead of helping one another, and taking care euery one of his owne horſe, there is not a ſouldiour ſo begger-like, but will haue his foure Lackeis: ſo that a thouſand ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors in theſe dayes will be more chargeable to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than twentie thouſand that are well ordered would<note place="margin">Aurelius puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed adulterie and theft committed by his ſouldiors, with death.</note> be. If a Romane ſouldiour had committed adulterie with his Oaſts wife, <hi>Aurelius</hi> cauſed him to be torne in ſunder with two trees bowed downe one againſt another. It was death alſo to take an egge. If hee went out of his ranke whileſt the armie marched, he had the baſtonnado. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes for one ſimple fault a whole Legion was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and the captaine ſeuerely puniſhed: and yet for all this rigor, the ſouldiors loued the Emperour as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For ſouldiours alleage this as an excuſe for all their wicked deedes, <hi>that they are not payd,</hi> and many would not bee payd, that ſo they might cloke their robberies. When the ſmall taxe, and ſince that the payment of fiftie thouſand footemen, was layed vpon the ſubiects, the king promiſed to imploy that mony vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other vſe, than vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paiment of his men of war, as alſo to keepe that money apart from his ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts. But bicauſe this is not duely obſerued, the people are doubly vexed: for they pay their money, and yet are polled on all ſides. Notwithſtanding all theſe ordinarie charges, the poore peſants would thinke themſelues hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie if they were diſcharged by erecting victualing tents for the men of warre, as they haue been forced to doe of late yeeres. Now what good iſſue can be hoped for, when the ſouldiors through an vnbrideled licence, ſack, ſpoile, and burne the poore ſubiects?

It muſt be haſtned forward by the diligent enquirie of thoſe things that haue fallen out both before &amp; ſince our time, that we may become wiſe by other mens perils. For this cauſe it is very neceſſarie, that whoſoeuer taketh vpon him the honor of guiding an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſhould exerciſe his minde as much in ſcience, and in the knowledge of hiſtories, as he doth his body in all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall actes, that ſo he may diligently obſerue the deedes of famous perſonages, ſee how they gouerned themſelues in warres, and examine the cauſes of their victory, thereby to flie the one and to follow the other. And bicauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon, that a well armed man ſhould obey him that is vnarmed, or that they ſhould take the rudder out of the Pilots hand to ſaue the ſhip in a ſtorme, that haue no skill in ſea-faring matters; it is very requiſite that whoſoeuer<note place="margin">No man ought to be generall before he haue obtained the renowne of a valiant man.</note> vndertaketh to commaund an army, ſhould firſt haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a good report of all men for his valure and greatneſſe of courage, whereby his authoritie will be reuerenced, as being beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one that is woorthy of it: foraſmuch as titles of dignitie do not honor men, but men are an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament

to titles. Now if ſouldiors haue conceiued a good opinion of the deſert and valure of their captaine, it will be as a ſharpe ſpur to pricke them forward in well doing, and cauſe them to honor &amp; to loue his commandements. For true zeale of vertue, that is to ſay, the deſire to imitate it, is not imprinted in mens harts, but through a ſingular good will &amp; reuerence towards that partie that worketh the impreſſion. It was not then without good cauſe, that the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts greatly eſteemed the dignity of a General, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioined with prowes, knowledge &amp; experience: ſeeing the happy or vnhappy euents of warre ordinarily depend therof (next to the chief cauſe proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God) as we ſhewed yeſterday what <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> wrote of the battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<note place="margin">Cimon prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an army of Harts before an army of Lions.</note> the Romans &amp; the Latins.

Now if we deſire to vnderſtand in few words what maner of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are moſt woorthy of ſuch charges, we may learne it by the anſwere that one of the wiſe Interpreters made to <hi>Ptolomie</hi> concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:<note place="margin">What captains are woorthieſt of their charge.</note> 
                     <hi>They</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that excell in proweſſe and iustice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the ſafetie of mens liues before victorie.</hi> But to diſcourſe more particularly of the dutie and office of the head of an armie, <hi>Valerius Coruinus</hi> Generall of the Romans againſt the Samnites, to whom he was redy to giue battell, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his ſouldiors to do well in few words, and taught e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one how he ſhould proceed to obtaine the place and<note place="margin">Coruinus Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors.</note> degree of a captaine. <hi>A man must conſider well</hi> (quoth he vnto them) <hi>vnder whoſe conduction he entreth into battell: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnder one that can cauſe himſelfe to be heard as if hee were ſome goodly Oratour, that hath a braue tongue, but otherwiſe is a Nouice and vnskilfull in all points of warre, or vnder ſuch a one as hath skill himſelfe to handle his weapon, to marche first before the enſignes, and to doe his duetie in the hottest of the fight. I would not, Souldiours, that yee ſhould follow my wordes, but my deeds. I ſet before you an example ioyned with instruction and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as he that hath gotten three Conſulſhips with this arme, not without exceeding prayſe.</hi> Hereby we learne, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

This faſhion is now loſt togither with the reſt of warlike diſcipline: at leaſt wiſe there is no account made of it in France, whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that many great men are but badly followed and ſerued in warre. For as he that ſtandeth in neede of the faithfull ſeruice of men ought to winne them rather by gentleneſſe and good turnes, than by authoritie and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour:<note place="margin">Captains ought to make much of their ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</note> ſo he that would haue prompt and reſolute ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours for warre, that hee may vſe their ſeruice in tyme of neede, muſt make much of them, and allure them to his obedience by liberalitie, and by good and gracious ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For in truth they muſt be good friends and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate ſeruitours vnto a man, that ſetting all excuſes aſide (of which there is neuer any want) are to fight for him: they muſt neither be enuious at his proſperitie, nor trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous in his aduerſitie. And there is no doubt but that in a matter of great importaunce, the graue exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">The benefit of making Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to ſouldiors.</note> of a Generall, grounded vpon good reaſons and examples greatly encourage and harten a whole armie, in ſo much that it will make them as hardie as Lions, that before were as fearefull as ſheepe. Moreouer, if he that is eſteemed and iudged to be valiaunt and noble-minded, ſheweth foorth effectes aunſwerable thereunto, he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the courage and ſtrength of his armie: as contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the leaſt ſhew of cowardlineſſe, diſcouragement or aſtoniſhment ſhewed by him, draweth after it the vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of his ſouldiours. But to returne to the duetie and office of a good Captaine of an armie, as the beſt worke that a man can doe, is firſt to bee honeſt and vertuous: and than to take order that himſelfe and his familie may haue aboundantly all things neceſſarie for this life: ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery wiſe and well aduiſed leader of men of warre, muſt<note place="margin">A good captain muſt be alwayes furniſhed with munitions and victuals.</note> diſpoſe and prepare himſelfe to the ſame ende, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that nothing be wanting vnto them, neither munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of warre, nor victuals.

Wherby taking away all occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaining from the ſouldior, he ſhall be better beloued and obeyed, and more feared and redoubted of his enimies.

                     <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaid to his chiefe men of warre: <hi>My friends I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce greatly that you and your men are contented that ye haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things, and that we haue wherewith to do good to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one according to his vertue.

Therfore ye muſt ſhew your ſelues vertuous alſo hereafter, holding this for certaine, that ye ſhall obtaine great ſtore of riches and contentation of mind by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, constancie, vertue, ſuſtaining of trauell, and by courage in</hi>

                     <hi>vertuous and perillous enterpriſes.</hi> Moreouer a good captaine of an armie muſt be very carefull, that he neuer ſuffer his hoſt to be idle, but cauſe his ſouldiors either to annoy the enimie, or to doe themſelues good. It is a burthenſome thing to nouriſh an idle body, much more a whole family, but eſpecially an armie, and not to keepe them occupied. His meaning that warreth of neceſſitie, or through ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to get or to keep that which is gotten, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſuch ſort, that he may in-rich, and not impoueriſh his countrey. Therfore both for conquering, and for the maintenance and preſeruation of that which is his owne already, he muſt neceſſarily beware of vnprofitable expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and do all things for common commoditie. So that who ſo euer would throughly put in practiſe theſe two<note place="margin">Warre ought to be ſpeedily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> points, he had need to follow that cuſtome, which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romanes vſed, namely, at the beginning to make them ſhort and terrible, as we vſe to ſay. For entring into the field with great power and ſtrength, they diſpatched their warre ſpeedily within few dayes: inſomuch that all their iourneis made againſt the Latines, Samnites, &amp; Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans were ended, ſome in ſix, others in ten, and the longeſt in twentie dayes. And although afterward they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to keep the fields a longer time, by reaſon of the
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:8689:399"/>
diſtance of places and countreys, yet they did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giue ouer the following of their firſt purpoſe, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as ſoone as they could, their enterpriſes of warre by quick battels, according as place and time ſuffred. True it is, that a prudent captaine muſt be skilfull to take the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie at aduantage: but if it be ſo that he cannot, the better<note place="margin">A good captain muſt not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer venturous.</note> and more vertuous man he thinks himſelfe and thoſe that follow him to be, ſo much the more paines is required of him for his owne and their preſeruation, as men vſe to keep ſafely thoſe things which they account deereſt, and to lay them vp in a ſure place. The dignitie of a Head of an armie, is in truth greatly to be accounted of, eſpecially when it is ioyned with proweſſe and experience, the chief point whereof is to ſaue him that muſt ſaue all the reſt. Therefore <hi>Timotheus</hi> an Athenian captaine, (and <hi>Chares</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A General muſt not raſhly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard himſelfe.</note> alſo an other captaine) ſhewed one day openly vnto the Athenians, the skarres of many woundes which he had receiued in his body, and his ſhield alſo that was ſpoyled and thruſt through with many puſhes of a pike: but now (quoth he) I am of another minde. For when I beſieged the citie of Samos I was very much aſhamed that an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe ſhotte from the walles fell harde by me, being then too venturous a yong man, and hazarding my ſelfe more raſhly than became the Head of ſo great an armie. And yet when it greatly profiteth the whole enterpriſe, and is<note place="margin">When he ought to venture him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> a matter of no ſmall importance, that the Generall of the armie ſhould put his life in daunger, then he muſt yeeld, and imploy his perſon, not ſparing himſelfe, or giuing place to their wordes who ſay, that a good and wiſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ought to die of age, or at leaſt to be olde. But where ſmall benefit ariſeth if he proſper well, and contrarywiſe, an vniuerſall loſſe and generall hurt to all, if any thing but well betide him, no wiſe man will require it, or be of the opinion, that he ſhould venture himſelfe as a common ſouldiour doth, whereby he being the Generall ſhould be in daunger of deſtruction. And yet in the meane while he muſt not be leſſe carefull ouer the ſafetie of thoſe valiaunt men that follow him, or thruſt them into danger but very

And in deed there is no greater victory than that which is gotten without ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud. <hi>Sylla, Tiberius, Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> had no skill, but to commaund and to kill: but that good <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus, Titus</hi> and <hi>Traian,</hi> were always ready to ſollicite, to<note place="margin">When Auguſtus would haue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell giuen.</note> requeſt, and to agree by forgiuing. <hi>Augustus</hi> alſo ſaid, that although a prince were mightie, yet if hee were wiſe, hee would neuer giue battell vnleſſe there were more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant profite in the victorie, than loſſe if the enimie ſhould ouercome. And in deede he neuer gaue battell but vpon<note place="margin">Narſes always wept the night before he gaue battell.</note> neceſſitie. We reade of that great captaine <hi>Narſes,</hi> who ſubdued the Gothes, vanquiſhed the Bactrians, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Germaines, that he neuer gaue his enimies bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, but he wept in the Temple the night before. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the Emperor ſuffred not his men to aſſault any towne, nor to lay ſiege vnto it before tenne dayes were paſt, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this proclamation to be made vnto them, that hee graunted theſe tenne daies to the ende they might accept and taſte of his clemencie before they had experience of his power. It is a common ſaying, that it is not enough for a Captaine to know how to leade his men well to the fight, vnleſſe he foreſee alſo the meanes to retire and to<note place="margin">Two faults to be eſchewed of euery captain.</note> ſaue them in tyme of neede. And it is no leſſe fault in a Captaine to fall into an inconuenience vnlooked for, than through too much miſtruſt to let ſlippe an occaſion of doyng ſome great exploite when it is offred.

<pb n="779" facs="tcp:8689:400"/>
cauſe the ancient Generals of armies, both Greekes and Latines neuer marched but in armour, nor incamped, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were farre from their enimies, but they clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their campe round about with a trench. And when <hi>Leonidas</hi> was demanded the reaſon hereof, he aunſwered, <hi>bicauſe as the ſea hath his ſandes, gulfes, and rocks, ſo hath war his,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">I had not thought it, a dangerous ſpeech in a captaine.</note> 
                     <hi>among which none is more perillous and hurtful than this of, I had not thought it.</hi> Among other things neceſſary in a captaine, the knowledge of nature, and of the ſituation of places is very requiſite: which is to know how the mountaines are lift vp, how the valleis hang, how the Champian fields are<note place="margin">A good captain muſt haue skill to diſcerne the ſituation of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> couched togither, and to know the nature and courſe of riuers, &amp; the bredth of mariſhes. This is profitable in two reſpects. Firſt a man learneth thereby to know his owne countrey, &amp; ſo to be more skilful to defend it. Secondly, hauing by that means had good practiſe of the ſeat of that countrey, he may eaſily conceiue the ſituation of another place, of which ſometime he muſt neceſſarily conſider. So that if a General be wanting herein, he is deſtitute of the chief vertue which a good captain ought to haue. For it is that which teacheth him to find out the enimy, to encamp<note place="margin">The benefit of Geometry in a General.</note> himſelf, to guide an hoſt, to ſet his men in aray for the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and to take the aduauntage at the ſiege of a towne.

This noble Prince ſhewed well that his<note place="margin">Hunting is an image of warre.</note> exerciſe of hunting was not vnprofitable vnto him (as in deede it is a true paterne of warre) but that it did helpe him greatly to iudge of the nature and ſeate of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he frequented in his countreys. And bicauſe all landes are like in ſome things, the perfect knowledge of one countrey (which often vſe of hunting bringeth) may<note place="margin">P.

to the Generall of his enimies, who willed him to come out of his campe to battell, if he were ſuch a great captain as men reported him to be. Not ſo (quoth he) but if thou art the great captaine compell me to it whether I will or no. This is one thing alſo wherein the Head of an armie<note place="margin">The captains of an armie muſt be very ſecret.</note> muſt be very vigilant, that all ſecrecies be cloſely kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the captaines of his hoſt. For great affaires neuer haue good ſucceſſe when they are diſcouered before they take effect. To this purpoſe <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſaith, that no man euer heard <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> ſay, <hi>To morrow we will do that, and to</hi>

                     <hi>day this thing: but, we will doe this nowe, and as for to morrow we will conſider what is then to be done.</hi> And <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith in his treatiſe of Policie, that <hi>Lucius Metellus</hi> beyng demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">L. Metellus.</note> by a Captaine of his when hee would giue battell, ſayde, <hi>If I were ſure that my ſhirte knew the least thought in my hart, I woulde preſently burne it, and neuer weare any other.</hi> Therefore affaires of warre may be handled and debated<note place="margin">Affaires of war muſt be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many, but concluded by few.</note> of by many, but the reſolution of them muſt be done ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and knowen of few men: otherwiſe they would be ſooner diſcloſed and publiſhed, than concluded. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is very neceſſarie, that the General ſhould oftentymes call a councell, ſo that it be of expert and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men, and of ſuch as are prudent and voyde of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.<note place="margin">Vrgent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in warre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</note> But in all caſes of neceſſitie a man muſt not ſtand long in ſeeking for reaſon, but ſuddenly ſet vpon them. For many tymes ſundry captaines haue vndone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in warres vpon no other occaſion, but bicauſe they lingred in taking counſel, when they ſhould without loſſe of tyme haue wrought ſome notable enterpriſe. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, for the inſtruction and patterne of the dutie and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a good Head and captaine of an armie, we can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage<note place="margin">Cato a notable paterne for all captains to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> none more woorthy to be imitated than <hi>Cato</hi> of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, a Conſul of Rome, who had the guiding of a legion when he firſt tooke charge vpon him. For from that tyme forward he thought, that it was not roial or magnificall to be vertuous alone, being but one body: &amp; therfore he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to make all that were vnder his charge like himſelfe. Which that he might bring to paſſe, he took not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:8689:402"/>
the feare of his authoritie, but added reaſon thereunto, ſhewing and teaching them their dutie in euery point, and always ioyning to his exhortations reward, for thoſe that did well, and puniſhment for ſuch as did euill. So that it was hard to ſay, whether he had made them more apt for peace or for warre, more valiant or more iuſt, bicauſe they were ſo ſtout and eger againſt their enimies, and ſo gentle and gracious to their friends, ſo feareful to do euil, and ſo<note place="margin">Pompey.</note> ready to obtaine honor. The vertue of <hi>Pompey</hi> is alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be followed of euery great captain, f or the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that was in him, for his skil in armes, eloquence in ſpeech, fidelitie in word, as alſo bicauſe he was to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with, and ſo louingly entertained euery one. And if<note place="margin">How Cato diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſpoiles.</note> with theſe things the example of the ſame <hi>Cato</hi> be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his prudent liberalitie, and diuiſion of the ſpoils and riches of the enimies, that captaine that ſo behaueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhal deſerue eternal praiſe, and pleaſe all thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. For when this vertuous captaine had taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny townes in Spaine, he neuer reſerued more for himſelfe than what he did eate and drinke there. He deliuered to euery one of his ſouldiors a pound waight of ſiluer, ſaying that it was better that many ſhould returne to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the warre with ſiluer, than a few with gold: and as for the captains he ſayd, that during their charges and gouernements they ſhould not grow and increaſe in any thing but in honor and glory. For the concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of our ſpeech, we note, that a Generall of an army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to bee obeyed (which is neceſſarie) muſt behaue himſelfe ſo, that his ſouldiors may thinke him woorthy to prouide and care for their neceſſary affaires. Which thing will come to paſſe, when they ſee that he is courageous &amp; carefull, that he keepeth his place and the maieſtie of his degree well, that he puniſheth offenders, and laboureth not his men in vaine, but is liberall, and performeth his promiſes made vnto them.</p>

Alſo after they had done ſome<note place="margin">Souldiors ought to begin their war with prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and end with praiſe &amp; thankſ-giuing.</note> great exploite, they were not ſlouthful to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thanks, by offrings and hymnes ſong to their praiſe.

                  <p>If we conſider diligently of the cauſes, from whence came the ruine of the Romane Empire, we ſhall find, that thoſe meanes which the wiſeſt Emperors inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſafetie and preſeruation thereof, turned in the end to the deſtruction of it. Firſt the ordinary armies pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Augustus</hi> neere to Rome, &amp; in the borders of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,<note place="margin">Three cauſes from whence proceeded the ruine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane empire.</note> ouerthrew many of his ſucceſſors, &amp; euen the empire it ſelf, which they would ſometimes ſet to ſale, &amp; deliuer vp to him that gaue moſt for it. Next, the tranſlation of the empire, which <hi>Constantine</hi> the great made from Rome to Bizantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, afterward called by his name <hi>Constantinople,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make it more ſure againſt the Perſians &amp; other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Aſia, greatly haſtned forward the ouerthrow of the ſame. For when he caried thither the chief ſtrength and<note place="margin">The diuiſion of the empire weakened the ſame.</note> wealth of Rome, &amp; diuided the empire into the Eaſt and Weſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e weakned it very much, ſo that the Weſt was firſt deſtroyed, and then the Eaſt: which if they had continued vnited and knit togither, might for a long time, and in a maner for euer, haue reſiſted all inuaſions. Thirdly, when the Emperours thought to ſtrengthen themſelues with ſtrange, hired, &amp; forrain power, called to their ſuccour, as
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:8689:403"/>
namely the Gothes, thereby weakening their owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and naturall ſtrength of the Empire, they put ere they were aware, Rome and Italy, and conſequently the other Prouinces into the hands of the Barbarians. Yea we find, that the greateſt calamities that euer happened to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths diuided, was when the Citizens were ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Dangerous to an Eſtate to call in forraine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</note> among themſelues, and called in ſtrangers to helpe them, who vſing often to goe that way, at the laſt made themſelues maiſters ouer them. The Germanes called by<note place="margin">As appeereth by the <hi>Sequani.</hi>
                     </note> the <hi>Sequani</hi> to their ſuccour againſt thoſe of Autun, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to deliuer halfe their land vnto them: and at length they drooue away all the naturall people of the countrie, and became Lordes of the greateſt part of the Gaules territorie. But not to go ſo farre off, it is high time for vs to grow wiſe by our owne perill. The factions of the<note place="margin">By the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> houſes of Orleans and of Burgundy, called in the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into France, who by this meane ſette ſuch footing therein, that they poſſeſſed a great part therof a long time after. What lacked in our time why the Frenchmen blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; caried away with partialities (and God grant they may throughly knowe it) did not bring their countrie to that extremitie of miſeries, as to ſubmit it to the ſeruice and ſlauerie of a ſtrange yoke, vnder the colour of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging helpe at their handes? What letted why there was not plaied among vs, of vs, and by vs, the cruelleſt &amp; moſt ſorrowfull tragedie that euer was, when men came hither from all quarters to behold the ſight? Would not a man haue thought, that both great and ſmall had wittingly purpoſed to ouer-throw the goodlieſt &amp; moſt noble king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world, and themſelues withall, and ſo in the end haue ſhamefully loſt the glorie and renowne, which their Anceſtors had woorthily gotten for them? Now, if any good hap hath turned this tempeſt from vs againſt our wils, at the leaſt let vs call to mind the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into we had willingly caſt our ſelues, and let vs not forget the admonition that was giuen vs by thoſe barbarous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, whoſe Captaines and Counſellors asked vs why we called them in, when a little before their departure out of
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:8689:404"/>
this kingdome, they were complained vnto for the extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions<note place="margin">The end that forraine ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours propound to themſelues.</note> and cruelties which their men practiſed. <hi>What thinke you</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>is the intent and purpoſe of our men in following vs, but to enrich themſelues with your ouerthrow? Agree among your ſelues, and neuer call vs more, except ye minde to taste of that which ſhall be woorſe.</hi> But let vs enter into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſideration of the perill and hurt that commeth by forraine and mercenarie ſouldiours, that we may knowe whome wee ought rather to vſe. The armes where-with a Prince defendeth his Countrie, are either his owne, or hired of ſtrangers, or ſent to his ſuccour by ſome Prince his friend, or elſe mingled of both togither. They that maintaine, that it is neceſſarie for the proſperitie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of euerie happie Common-wealth, not to vſe<note place="margin">Reaſons why forraine force is woorth nothing.</note> forraine helpe, ſay, that hired force and ſuccour of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers is woorth nothing, but rather dangerous, and that if a Prince thinke to ground the aſſurance of his Eſtate vpon forraine force, he cannot ſafely doe it. For they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not eaſily togither, they doe all for profite, and will be neither well ordered nor obedient. On the other ſide, they are not ouer-faithfull, they are all in their bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie amonge friendes, but hartleſſe amonge enimies. They neither feare God, nor are faithfull to men. The reaſon heereof is this, bicauſe no loue, nor anye other occaſion holdeth them but paie, and hope of ſpoyle. Which is no ſufficient cauſe to mooue them to die wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly in his ſeruice, whoſe ſubiects they are not, and<note place="margin">The cauſe of the laſt deſtruction of Italy.</note> whoſe ruine they deſire, rather than his increaſe. The laſt deſtruction of Italy came by no other thing, than bicauſe it truſted a longe time to forraine and hyred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which brought ſome thinges to paſſe for ſome men, but as ſoone as another ſtranger came, they ſhewed what they were. Heereuppon it came, that Kinge <hi>Charles</hi> the eight eaſily ouer-ranne all Italy with chalke, as we vſe to ſpeake, that is to ſaye, that without reſiſtance he ſent before to take vp his lodging, bicauſe they that ſhoulde haue withſtoode him, and were called in to keepe the Countrie, did of their owne accord take his parte. But
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:8689:404"/>
there is a further matter. Strange hired Captaines either are excellent men, or haue nothing in them. If they be<note place="margin">The diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of bringing in hired Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> valiant, the Prince is not to truſt them. For out of doubt they will ſeeke to make themſelues great, either by his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe that is their Maiſter, or by deſtroying others againſt his will. And if the Captaines haue no valure in them, he cannot hope for any thing but for the cauſe of his owne perdition. Succour is moſte hurtfull to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, when ſome Potentate is called in with his forces for aide and defence. Thoſe ſouldiours may well be good and profitable for themſelues, but are alwaies hurtfull to ſuch as call them in. For if a man looſe the fielde, he is ouer-throwne: if he winne it, he is their priſoner. Such ſuccour is a great deale more to bee feared, than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtrength, which obeieth the Prince that calleth them, and requireth their helpe. But when a man receiueth in an armie vnited, and accuſtomed to obeye the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that conducteth and bringeth them in, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction<note place="margin">Dangerous for a Prince to call in a Potentate to ſuccour him.</note> is alreadie prepared, and cannot be auoided, who openeth the doore of his owne houſe to let in an enimie ſtronger than himſelfe. Therefore it were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for euerye Prince to trye all waies before he haue recourſe to ſuch men for helpe and ſuccour. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall reade and conſider well the times that are paſt, and runne ouer the preſent ſtate of things, he ſhall ſee, that whereas one proſpered well, an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were deceiued and abuſed. For a Common-wealth, or an ambitious Prince, coulde not wiſh to haue a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion whereby to get the poſſeſſion of a Citie, Seignorie, or Prouince, than when hee is required to ſend his armie to defende it. But what? The ambition, deſire of reuenge, or ſome other affection of men is ſo great, that to accompliſh once their preſent will, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all dutie, and caſt behind them the care of all danger and inconuenience whatſoeuer, that may light vppon them. The Herules, Gothes, and Lumbards by theſe<note place="margin">Examples of the change of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats by meanes of forraine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</note> meanes became Lordes of Italy: the Frenchmen of the Gaules Countrye, the Engliſhmen of greate Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:8689:405"/>
the Scots of Scotland after they had driuen out the Britons and Picts, who called them in for ſuccour. The Turks made themſelues Lords of the Eaſt Empire, and of the kingdom of Hungary, being likewiſe required of help by the Emperours of Conſtantinople, and by the States of Hungary. Not long ſince <hi>Cairadin</hi> a Pirate, being called by the Inhabitants of Alger to driue the Spaniards out of the fortreſſe, after he had vanquiſhed them, he ſlew <hi>Selim</hi> Prince of the towne, and made himſelfe king, leauing the Eſtate to his brother <hi>Arradin Barberoſſa.</hi> And <hi>Saladine</hi> a Tartarian Captaine, being called by the <hi>Calipha</hi> and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Caire to driue the Chriſtians out of Soria, after the victorie ſlew the <hi>Calipha,</hi> and became abſolute Lorde thereof. The foreſight which the Princes of Germany had<note place="margin">Charles the fift, bound by oath not to bring any forraine ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors into Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> of the perill and hurt that all ſtrangers bring to an Eſtate, cauſed them to bind the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, by the twelfth article of conditions, vnto which he ſware before he receiued the Imperiall crown, that he ſhould not bring in any forraine ſouldiors into Germany. And yet through the great number of Spaniards, Italians, and Flemmings that came into the countrie, beeing called in againſt the Proteſtants, there wanted little of changing the Eſtate of Almaigne into an hereditarie kingdom. Which had bene ſoone doone if king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond had not ſtaied it by his French power, for which cauſe he was called by books publiſhed, and arches erected in their country, <hi>Protector of the Empire, and deliuerer of the Princes,</hi> who ſince haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded amonge themſelues, that they will neuer chuſe a<note place="margin">Charles 7. made decrees for French ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</note> forraine Prince. <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth king of France, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by his great good ſucceſſe and vertue, deliuered France of Engliſhmen, and knowing well that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for him to be furniſhed with his owne forces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the decrees of horſemen, and of the companies of footemen. After that, king <hi>Lewes</hi> his ſonne aboliſhed his footemen, and began to leauy Switzers: which being<note place="margin">What inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences France is fallen into by hiring Switzers.</note> likewiſe practiſed by other kings his ſucceſſors, many men haue noted, that by countenancing the Switzers, they haue cauſed their owne forces to degenerate and growe
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:8689:405"/>
out of vſe, diſanulled the footemen, and tied their horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to other footemen: inſomuch that ſince they haue been vſed to fight in company of the Switzers, they think that they cannot obtaine the victorie, nor yet fight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. Therfore the prudence of king <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt,<note place="margin">Francis 1. eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſeuen legions of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> muſt needes be honored with exceeding great praiſe, in that he eſtabliſhed ſeuen legions of footmen, accounting 6000. men to a legion: ſo that there could be no better deuice for the maintenance of warrelike diſcipline, nor more neceſſary for the preſeruation of this kingdome, if thoſe good ordinances that were made to this end be wel marked. Neuertheles they were aboliſhed in his raigne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed againe by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond his ſucceſſor, and after that abrogated. I am of opinion, that if theſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inſtitutions both of horſemen and footemen were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uined, they would be a good mean, whereby we might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue men of warre to defend this kingdom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer that which is taken from it, and to helpe our friends: whereas nowe we are faine to vſe the ſeruice of vnskilfull men that are made Captaines before euer they were ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors, or elſe of neceſſitie compelled to begge and to buy very deare the ſuccour offorraine nations. My meaning is not, that a Prince ſhould neuer vſe the helpe of others, but alwaies take his own forces collected among his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Nay I ſay to the contrary, that it muſt needs be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable<note place="margin">How a Prince may vſe the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note> for him to vſe the ſuccors of his Allies, ſo that they be ioined with him in league offenſiue and defenſiue. For by this meanes, he doth not onely make himſelfe ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but withall taketh away both that aide from his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which he might otherwiſe haue drawne from thence, and occaſion alſo from all men to make warre with the one, except they will haue the other alſo their enimie. But aboue all things, let no Prince truſt ſo much to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of his Allies, except himſelfe with his ſubiects be of greater ſtrength. And if Allies are to be feared when they are ſtronger in another countrie, what aſſurance may a man haue of forraine ſouldiors, that are at no league ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offenſiue or defenſiue with vs? Now if vpon the due

conſideration of theſe things, ſouldiors be carefully trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp in good diſcipline of warre, which may be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of many inſtitutions that are extant, and if the guiding of them be giuen to good, vertuous, and expert Captaines, ledde onely with a deſire to doe their dutie to their King and Countrie, this kingdome will be feared of ſtrangers, and without feare it ſelfe of their aſſaults and enterpriſes. Eſpecially if in the Prince his abſence, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authoritie of commanding abſolutely in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, be committed into the hands of a Captaine woorthy his charge, as we haue diſcourſed, who is able to win the<note place="margin">How a Captain ſhould exhort his ſouldiors.</note> harts of men, and to prouoke them to their dutie by liuely and learned reaſons: as namely, <hi>That all men muſt die, and therefore that it were too great follie in a man to refuſe to die for publike profit, which bringeth vnto vs immortall glorie, ſeeing he muſt once of neceſſitie yeeld vp his life: that a glorious death is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be preferred before a ſhamefull life ſtained with reproch: briefly, if he can ground his exhortations vpon the occaſion of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king armes, of time, place, eſtate and condition of the enimies, and of the good that will come to them, if they obtaine the victorie.</hi> But in all theſe things the iuſtice and equitie of the cauſe of war, is that which moſt of all maketh good men courageous, who otherwiſe neuer ought to fight. We may read a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goodly Orations made in time of warre, &amp; ſet forth in one volume, with which euery wiſe and prudent Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine may helpe himſelfe according as occaſion is offred. Now, if that ancient order &amp; diſcipline, of which we haue hitherto diſcourſed, and which may be learned more at large in their excellent writings, were renued &amp; imitated by our armies, as the late vſe and practiſe of Armes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed at this day, is apt and fit for the ſame, being more terrible than that of the Ancients, who had no gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, no doubt but great obedience of ſouldiors towards their Captaines would ariſe of it, whereas now a daies in ſteede of commanding, they haue nothing left but an humble requeſt to be vſed towards their ſouldiours, who neuertheles turne it into contempt and want of courage. But if true obedience were ioined with good order, the
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:8689:406"/>
hope of proſperous ſucceſſe in our enterpriſes would be farre greater. Nowe, when our affaires ſucceede happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">How victory is to be vſed.</note> ſo that wee haue our enimies at aduantage, or haue gotten ſome victorie, wee muſt beware leaſt inſolencie blind vs in ſuch ſort, that truſting to our good happe, we goe beyond our bounds, and looſe the occaſion of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſure benefite, through hope of ſome greater good as yet vncertaine. <hi>Hannibal</hi> after the diſcomfiture of<note place="margin">Examples of ſuch as knew not how to vſe victorie wiſely, and to take op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> the Romanes at Cannas, ſent men to Carthage to carie newes of his victorie, and withall to demand a newe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie. Whereupon the Senate was long in deliberating what was to be doone. <hi>Hannon,</hi> a prudent old man was of opinion, that they were to vſe the victorie wiſely, and to make peace with the Romanes, which they might obtain of them with honeſt conditions, and not to expect the hazard of another battell. He ſaid that the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to bee ſatisfied with this declaration alreadie made to the Romanes, that they were ſuch men as could ſtand againſt them: and therfore ſeeing they had woonne one victorie of them, they ſhould not venture the loſſe of it, in hope of a greater. This prudent counſell was not followed, although afterwarde the Senate did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it for the beſt, when that occaſion was loſt. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great had already conquered all the Eaſt, when the Common-wealth of Tyrus, being great and mightie, bicauſe the Citie was ſituated in the water, (as Venice is) and aſtoniſhed at the greatnes &amp; fame of that Monarches power, ſent their Embaſſadors vnto him to offer what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience &amp; ſubiection he would require, vpon condition that neither he nor his men would enter into the Citie. <hi>Alexander</hi> diſdaining that one citie would ſhut their gates againſt him, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole world was open, ſent them backe again without accepting their offer, &amp; went thither to pitch his Campe againſt it. After he had continued the<note place="margin">The Tyrians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</note> ſiege 4. moneths, he thought with himſelf, that one onely Towne would ſhorten his glorie more than all his other conqueſts had done before: wherupon he purpoſed to try an agreement by offering that vnto them which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:8689:407"/>
had required before. But then the Tyrians were waxen ſo luſtie and bold, that they did not only refuſe his proffers, but alſo executed as many as came to conclude with them. Whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> being mooued with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, cauſed an aſſault to be made with ſuch heate and violence, that he tooke and ſacked the towne, put ſome of the Inhabitants to the edge of the ſwoord, and made the reſidue ſeruants and ſlaues. Agreement and compoſition is alwaies to be preferred before continuance of warre. And howſoeuer a man may ſeeme to be aſſured, and as it were certaine of the victorie, yet ought he to doubt the vncertaintie of humane things. That courageous and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Hannibal,</hi> being called out of Italy by his Countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſuccour them againſt the Romaines, by whome they were beſieged, when his armie was yet whole, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded peace of them before he would enter into battel, bicauſe he ſaw that if he loſt it, he brought his Countrie into bondage. What then ought another to do, that hath leſſe vertue and experience than he? But men fall into the error of vnmeaſurable hope, vpon which ſtaying them ſelues without further conſideration, they are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.<note place="margin">It is not good to fight with deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate men.</note> Sometimes when we contemne our enimie too much, and bring him into a deſperat eſtate, we make him more venturous to vndertake, and violent to execute any dangerous matter. Deſpaire (ſaid <hi>Tubero)</hi> is the laſt but the ſtrongeſt aſſault, and a moſt inuincible tower. For this cauſe the ancient Romane Captaines were very diligent and carefull to lay all kind of neceſſitie to fight vpon their men, and to take it from their enimies by opening vnto them paſſages to eſcape, which they might haue ſhut vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Iohn king of France taken by the Engliſhment.</note> them. K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> bicauſe he would not make peace with the Engliſh hoſt, which deſired to eſcape onely with life, was taken and caried priſoner into England, and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie conſiſting of fortie or fiftie thouſand men, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited by ten thouſand Engliſhmen, ſome ſay more,<note place="margin">Gaſton de Foix.</note> ſome leſſe. <hi>Gaston de Foix,</hi> hauing woonne the battell at Rauenna, and following after a ſquadron of Spaniards that fled, loſt his life, and made all that a praie vnto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie,

By this alſo we ſhall be<note place="margin">Valiant men are full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> perſwaded to vſe victorie mildly, ſeeing it is the propertie of valiant men to be gentle and gratious, ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, and to haue compaſſion of them that ſuffer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure affliction. There is no true victorie (as <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> wrote to <hi>Popilion</hi> Captaine of the Parthians) but that<note place="margin">No true victorie without cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie.</note> which carieth with it ſome clemencie: ſo that a rigorous and cruell man may not in reaſon be called victorious. And it is moſt true, that to ouercome is humane, but the action of pardoning is diuine. As touching the ſacking and ouerthrow of townes taken in warre, carefull heede (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> muſt be taken, that nothing be done raſhly or cruelly. For it is the propertie of a noble hart to puniſh<note place="margin">Ringleaders of euill are to be puniſhed, and the multitude to be pardoned.</note> ſuch onely as are moſt guiltie, and the authors of euil, and to ſaue the multitude. Briefly, to obſerue in all thinges whatſoeuer is right and honeſt, to be valiant and gentle, to be an enimie to thoſe that doe vniuſtly, fauourable to the afflicted, ſeuere to quarrellers, and full of equitie to ſuppliants, are thoſe praiſe-woorthie qualities for which <hi>Alexander, Iulius Caſar, Scipio, Hannibal, Cyrus,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both Greeke and Romane Captaines are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, who ought to be imitated in the arte of warre by all excellent men.</p>

                  <p>WE haue hitherto diſcourſed (my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions) of vertues &amp; vices, for which the life of man is praiſed or diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all Eſtats and conditions, whereunto the varietie of maners, and inclinations to ſundry ſtudies and works cal men, and make them fit.

Let vs nowe come to the ſeconde point. Although the lawe of God compriſed in ten Commandements, and thoſe ten alſo contained onely in two, hath a moſt excellent methode and well ordered diſpoſition, whereby to direct our life, &amp; to make it happy, yet it hath pleaſed our good Maiſter, his eternall ſonne, to frame them that are his by an exquiſite doctrine, according to that rule which he had giuen vnto
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:8689:409"/>
them in his lawe. The beginning of that way which he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, is after this ſort: namely, to teach them that it is the<note place="margin">What the dutie of euery faithful man is. Rom. 12. 1. 2.</note> dutie of euery faithful man, to offer his body a liuely, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and acceptable ſacrifice to God, wherin conſiſteth the chiefeſt point of that ſeruice which we owe vnto him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he goeth on to exhort vs, that we would not faſhion our ſelues to this world, but be changed by the renewing of our mind, that we may prooue what is the good will of God. That is no ſmall reaſon to ſay that we muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate<note place="margin">What it is to conſecrate our ſelues to God.</note> and dedicate our ſelues to God, that from hence forward we ſhould neither thinke, ſpeake, meditate, or doe any thing but to his glorie. For it is not lawefull to applye any thing that is conſecrated to a prophane vſe. Nowe, if we be not our owne, but belong to the Lorde, we may thereby ſee both how to auoid errour, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee muſt direct all the parts of our life: namely, to the rule of his holie and iuſt will.

Which thing wil haue place amongſt vs, when we take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">The effect of true charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour.</note> vs their perſons that ſtand in neede of ſuccour, when we pitie their miſerie, as if we felt and ſuſtained it, &amp; when we are touched with the ſame affection of mercie to help them, that is in vs to helpe our ſelues. As for that which onely concerneth our dutie towards God, the deniall of our ſelues will make vs patient and meeke. And when our affections pricke vs forward to ſeeke how we may liue in reſt and eaſe, the Scripture alwaies bringeth vs backe to this, that reſigning our ſelues and all that we haue, into the hands of god, we ſhould ſubmit the deſires of our hart to him, that he may tame them, and bring them vnder his yoke. We are led with a furious kind of intemperance, &amp;<note place="margin">The naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of men</note> with an vnbrideled luſt, in deſiring credite and honour, in ſeeking after power and might, in heaping vp of riches, and in gathering togither whatſoeuer we iudge meete for pompe and magnificence. On the other ſide, we maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly feare and hate pouertie, baſenes, and ignominie, &amp; flie from them as much as we can. Heereupon we ſee in what diſquietnes of minde all they are that order their liues after their owne counſel, how many waies they aſſay to attaine to that, vnto which their ambition &amp; couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes carieth them. But they that ſubmit themſelues wholy vnder the yoke of Gods wil, neuer entangle themſelues in theſe ſnares. For firſt, they neither deſire, hope, or imagine of any other meanes to proſper by, than the bleſſing of God: and therefore they ſtay and reſt themſelues aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therupon, as vpon that which is able to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a good iſſue in all things, and true felicitie, which cannot in any wiſe be in the dooings of wicked men, what falſe proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſoeuer appeereth in the eies of fleſh. Heereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that they aſpire not through iniuſtice or other ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter meanes to any worldly goods, but contemne them, ſeeking after the onely true goods which turne them not aſide from innocencie. For they are aſſuredly perſwaded
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:8689:411"/>
that the bleſſing of God is not extended vpon the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquitie, but onely vpon ſuch as are vpright in their thoughts and works. Moreouer, it ſerueth for a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to reſtrain them, that they burne not with a diſordred deſire of worldly goods, bicauſe they holde this for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the bleſſing of God cannot helpe them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which is cleane contrary to his word, whereby we are commanded to withdraw our whole hart from this world, that we may lift it vp in the meditation of eternall happines. The Lord (ſaith <hi>Iuſtine Martyr)</hi> will not honour<note place="margin">Corruptible things are no ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for vertuous men.</note> his children with worldly happines, for a reward of their pietie. For thoſe things that are ſubiect to corruption can not be a recompence to good men for their vertue: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are circumſcribed and limited by the change of the mortall eſtate of vertuous men, who are depriued altogither of them at the time of their death. And as good men are not ſaid or accounted to be of the world, ſo their glorie, riches, and wealth, are not in the earth. So that in what eſtate ſoeuer a Chriſtian man is, he feeleth him ſelfe alwaies mooued to giue glorie to God, &amp; iudgeth that all things are appointed by him in ſuch ſort, as is moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> for his ſaluation. If aduerſitie preſſe him, &amp; the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of mans life ſeeke to make him diſtruſt the grace and fauour of God, or to murmure againſt him through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie, he ſtriueth ſo much the more on the other ſide to conſider of his heauenly iuſtice and goodnes, in that he chaſticeth him iuſtly, and for his benefite: and arming him-ſelfe with patience, he expecteth with a quiet and thankefull mind the iſſue of God his ordinance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he wholy ſubmitteth himſelfe. Beſides, he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth howe God calleth all his to beare their croſſe, and<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 24. 25.</note> teacheth them to prepare them-ſelues to ſuſtaine a hard and laborious life, full of trauell and of infinite kindes of euils, vnto which Ieſus Chriſt their Head was firſt made ſubiect. Where this conſolation followeth preſently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> it, that ſuch a life is a preparation to follow him into his eternall glorie. Yea the more we are afflicted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure miſeries, the more is our ſocietie with Chriſt Ieſus
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:8689:411"/>
certainly confirmed vnto vs. Now the chiefe rule propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs by the ſpirite of God concerning this matter is, that with what kinde of tribulation ſoeuer we are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, we ſhould looke to this ende, to acquaint our ſelues with the contempt of this preſent life, that we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be brought on to meditate vpon the life to come. But bicauſe this diuine wiſdome knoweth full well that we are enclined and led with a blind &amp; euen brutiſh loue of this world, it vſeth a very apt reaſon to draw vs backe and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken our ſluggiſhnes, that our harte ſhoulde not bee too much ſetled vpon ſuch a fooliſh loue. There is none of vs that will not ſeeme to aſpire throughout the whole courſe of his life to a heauenly immortalitie, yea to ſtriue for the obtaining of it. For we are aſhamed not to excell the brute beaſtes in ſome thing, whoſe condition would ſeeme to be more happy than ours, if we had no hope of eternitie after death. Neuertheleſſe, if a man examine the counſels, deliberations, enterpriſes and workes of euery one, he ſhall find nothing but earth in them, being ſuch as tend altogither to the commoditie of this life. Now this blockiſhnes proceedeth from hence, that our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is as it were dimmed with that vain brightnes which riches, honors and powers haue in outward ſhew, wherby it is hindred from looking farther. In like maner our hart being preſſed with the affections of the fleſh, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto it couetouſnes, ambition, and all other carnal deſires, our ſoule is at length perſwaded to ſeek for hir fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie vpon earth. The Lord therefore to meete with this<note place="margin">How God tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to know the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this life.</note> miſchief teacheth his ſeruants to know the vanitie of this preſent life, by exerciſing them daily with diuers miſeries. He ſendeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no proſperitie, which is not mingled with greater aduerſitie, that by learning to condemne altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this earthly life, they may frame their harts to deſire and to meditate vpon the life to come. Wherefore when they trie by afflictions, that this preſent life, conſidered in it ſelfe, is full of diſquietnes, of troubles, altogither miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and in no reſpect happy, that all the wealth thereof had in ſo great eſtimation, is tranſitorie and vncertaine,
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:8689:412"/>
vaine and mingled with infinite miſeries, they conclude therupon that nothing is to be ſought or hoped for in this world but calamitie, and that the crowne of glory &amp; true<note place="margin">We muſt not hate the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life.</note> felicitie is to be looked for elſe-where, namely, in heauen. Notwithſtanding as long as they enioy this life, he would not haue them ſo to contemn it, as to grow into a hatred therof, or to be vnthankful to God for the benefits which they daily receiue therin of his maieſtie, but rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a ſpeciall gift of his heauenly clemencie, in that through the midſt of thoſe tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which they endure, he maketh a way and entrance for them vnto eternal life. For which, &amp; for thoſe infinit bleſſings which they receiue alſo in this life of his goodnes, they acknowlege that they are bound to yeeld vnto him immortal thanks, labouring only to vnfold themſelues out of this ouer-great deſire of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, caried away with the diſordinate loue of this life, that they may tranſferre their chief affection to the celeſtial &amp;<note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 22.</note> heauenly life. And ſeeing it is ſo, that al the faithful, as long as they remain vpon earth, are as ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter, to the end they might be made conformable to their head Chriſt Ieſus, ſurely they ſhould bee accounted paſſing wretched, if they did not lift their mindes on high to ſurmount all that is in the world, and to go beyond the regard and care of things preſent. On the contrary ſide, if they haue once lift vp their thoughts aboue the earth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall ſee the vniuſt proſper in the world, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues<note place="margin">The comfort of the godly in the midſt of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> ſhalbe vngently handled by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure reproch, when they ſhalbe polled or afflicted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of iniurie, their comfort in al theſe euils will be to<note place="margin">Math. 25. 34.</note> haue the laſt day before their eies, in which they know that the lord wil gather his faithful ones togither into the reſt<note place="margin">Iſai. 25. 8.</note> of his kingdom, that he wil wipe away the teares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their<note place="margin">Apoc. 7. 17.</note> eies, crown the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with glory, clothe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with gladnes, ſatiſfie them with the exceeding ſweetnes of his delicacies, exalt them vnto his high manſion, in a word, make them parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his happines. In the meane time going on in their courſe with all tranquillitie &amp; ioy of ſpirit, they are cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to giue vnto God that homage &amp; worſhip that is due
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:8689:412"/>
vnto him, ſubmitting themſelues wholy to his greatneſſe, &amp; receiuing with all reuerence his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. Next,<note place="margin">The ſumme of our dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</note> they muſt put that truſt &amp; hartie aſſurance in him, which they haue receiued by knowing him aright, attributing to him all wiſdom, iuſtice, goodnes, vertue &amp; truth, &amp; making this account, that all their happines is in communicating with him. Inuocation foloweth, wherby their ſoules muſt haue recourſe vnto him as to their only hope, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are preſſed with any neceſſity. In the laſt place is thankſgiuing which is that acknowledgement, wherby all prayſe is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him. Vnder theſe 4. points of worſhip, truſt, prayer, and thankſgiuing, all thoſe innumerable duties which we owe to God, may well be comprehended. Moreouer, the contempt of this preſent life, and the meditation of that which is immortal &amp; heauenly, will teach vs the right vſe of earthly goods created of God for the ſeruice of man, as neceſſary helpes for this life. Which things we muſt not<note place="margin">The true vſe of temporal things</note> neglect in ſuch ſort, that we neuer vſe them but vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint &amp; neceſſity, taking no delight in them as if we were ſenceleſſe blocks. Much leſſe may we abuſe them by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great luſt in ſuperfluity &amp; delights, but apply them to that end for which God hath created &amp; appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our good, &amp; not for our hurt, namely, that they ſhould ſuſtain, nouriſh, preſerue &amp; delight our nature, vſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in al tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance &amp; mediocritie with thankſgiuing. So that we are to vſe theſe goods as though we vſed them not, that is to ſay, our chief affection and deſire muſt be ſo ſmally ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them as if we were wholy depriued of them: and we muſt be diſpoſed and affected as well to ſuſtaine pouertie pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently &amp; with a quiet mind, as to vſe abundance moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Eſpecially let vs referre the true and holy vſe of all our earthly commodities to the works of charitie, as we haue already touched: knowing that all things are ſo giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs by the goodnes of God, &amp; appointed for our commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to our truſt, of which we muſt one day giue account before his maieſtie. For the concluſion therfore of our ſpeech, we learn that thelife of a Chriſtian is a perpetuall ſtudie and exerciſe of the mortification
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:8689:413"/>
of the fleſh, vntil it be ſo throughly dead, that the ſpirit of God may raigne fully in his ſoule. We learn alſo, that our whole life ought to be a meditation and exerciſe of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, bicauſe we are called to ſanctification: that true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines<note place="margin">Wherein a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py life conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</note> of life in this world conſiſteth therein, namely, when being regenerated by baptiſme and the ſpirit of God, we haue the loue of righteouſnes throughly imprinted in our harts, and follow the diuine rule thereof by framing and directing all our actions to the glory of our God and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of our neighbors. Wherfore euery one of vs muſt take his vocation and calling for a principle and ground, &amp; for a ſtation aſſigned of God, vnto which we muſt direct our leuell, withdrawing our mindes from the yoke and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of thoſe naturall perturbations that are in vs. Wee muſt not be led with ambition and deſire to take hold of many ſundry matters at once, being aſſured, that euery worke done according to our calling, how contemptible ſoeuer it be among men, ſhineth before God and ſhall be rewarded by him, beyng accounted very precious in his ſight.</p>

immortalitie of the ſoule.</hi> Now then ought not theſe men to bluſh for ſhame, that dare doubt of the ſecond life and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture iudgement, when they heare this diſcourſe of an Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike and Pagan, deſtitute of that true light of God, and ſincere religion which is manifeſted to vs in Ieſus Chriſt? Truly nothing is more cleere in all the holy ſcripture, than that as before the firſt day me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in Geneſis, all things were poſſeſſed of Eternitie, ſo that there was neither time, nor yeere, nor moneth, nor ſeaſon, but all things were in that Eternitie, ſo when the laſt day ſhal come, all ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall for the felicitie of the good, &amp; torment of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. But to returne to our ſpeech of death, the worde of<note place="margin">Three kinds of death.</note> God giueth vs to vnderſtand of three kinds of death: the one is the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, with the diſſolution of the body vntill the reſurrection, and of this is our preſent diſcourſe. The ſecond is the death of ſinne, as it is ſaid oftentimes, that they are dead that nouriſh themſelues in ſinne. The third is called in the Apocalyps,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 6.</note> the ſecond death, and ſometimes eternal death, vnto which the wicked ſhalbe condemned in the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

It belongeth to him that will not goe vnto Ieſus Chriſt to feare death: and to be vnwilling to goe to Chriſt, is a badge of ſuch a one as wil not raign with him. What traueller hauing paſſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous wayes, reioyceth not when he draweth neer to his countrey? And who is not content to depart out of an olde ruinous houſe? What pleaſure haue wee in this world, which draweth neere to an end euery day, &amp; which ſelleth vnto vs ſo deere thoſe pleaſures that wee receiue<note place="margin">What the life of man is.</note> therein? What other thing is this life but a perpetual bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and a ſharpe skirmiſh, wherein we are one while hurt with enuie, another while with ambition, and by and by with ſome other vice, beſides the ſuddaine onſets giuen

But to whome is death ſweete if not to them that labour? The poore hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is well at eaſe when hee hath done his dayes woorke. So death is alwayes ſweete to the afflicted, but to them that put their truſt in wordly things, the remembrance thereof is bitter. Now then the children of God are not afrayd of death, but (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> writeth in an Epiſtle ſent to the Martyrs of Chriſt) hee that hath once ouercome death in his owne perſon, doth daily ouercome him in his members: ſo that we haue Ieſus Chriſt not onely a beholder of our combates, but alſo an aſſiſtant and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with vs. And by his grace abounding in the harts of the faithfull, they are ſo much the more bent to meditate vpon the benefites of the future and eternall life, as they ſee that they are inuironed with greater ſtore of miſeries in this fading and tranſitorie life. Then comparing both togither they find nothing more eaſie than to finiſh ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their race, and to value the one as litle, as they account the other abſolute in all felicitie. Moreouer, ſeeing heauen
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:8689:416"/>
is our countrey, what is the earth elſe but a paſſage in a ſtrange land? And bicauſe it is accurſed vnto vs for ſinne, it is nothing elſe but the place of our baniſhment. If our departure out of this world be an entrance to life, what is<note place="margin">A compariſon betweene this life and that which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> this world but a ſepulcher? And to dwell heere what is it elſe but to be plunged in death? If it be libertie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered out of this bodie, what is this bodie but a priſon? And if it be our chiefe happines to enioie the preſence of our God, is it not a miſerie not to enioie it? Now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we go out of this world, we ſhal be as it were ſeparated from God. Wherefore if this earthlie life be compared with the heauenlie, no doubt but it may be contemned, and accounted as it were doung. True it is that we muſt not hate it, but ſo far foorth as it keepeth vs in ſubiection to ſinne. And yet whileſt we deſire to ſee the ende of it, we muſt not be careleſſe to keepe our ſelues in it, to the good pleaſure of God, that our longing may be far from all murmuring and impatiencie. For our life is as a ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein the Lord God hath placed vs, that we ſhould abide in it vntill he call vs backe againe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeed bewailed his eſtate, bicauſe he was kept as it were bound<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> in the priſon of his body longer than he would, &amp; groned with a burning deſire vntill he was deliuered: but withall to ſhew his obedience to the wil of God, he proteſted that he was ready for both, bicauſe he knew himſelfe indebted for the glorifieng of his name, whether it were by death or by life. For it belongeth to him to determine what is expedient for his glorie. Wherefore if it behooueth vs to liue and die vnto him, let vs leaue both our life &amp; death to his good pleaſure, but yet ſo that we alwaies deſire rather to die than to liue, &amp; be ready cheerfully to renounce this life, whenſoeuer it pleaſeth the Lord, bicauſe it holdeth vs vnder ſin. And let vs hold this Maxime, that no man hath throughly profited in the ſchool of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> but he that with ioy &amp; gladnes expecteth the day of death, and of the laſt reſurrection. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> deſcribeth al<note place="margin">Titus. 2. 13.</note> the faithful by this mark: &amp; the ſcripture when it propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <hi>Reioice</hi> (ſaith the Lord in <hi>Luke) and lift vp your heads, for your redemption draweth neere.</hi> It were abſurd that that thing ſhould breed nothing but ſorow and aſtoniſhment in vs, which Chriſt thought was fit matter to worke ioy in vs. Now than ſeeing death is dead to them that beleeue in him, there is nothing in death which a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to feare. It is true that the image thereof is hideous and terrible, bicauſe that beſides the violent taking away of life, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth vnto vs the wrath of God, which biteth like a ſerpent: but now the venome of it is taken away and can not hurt vs. And as through the braſen ſerpent which Moſes lift vp in the wilderneſſe, the liuing ſerpents died,<note place="margin">How death can not hurt.</note> and their venome hurt not the Iſraelites: ſo our death di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is not able in any ſort to hurt vs, if we behold with the eyes of faith the death of Ieſus Chriſt. Briefly it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an image and ſhadow of death, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and entrance vnto true life. Wherefore concluding our preſent ſpeech, let vs learne that as our miſerable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had brought vs to the like condition of death: ſo the grace of God maketh this difference, that ſome, namely the wicked, die to their deſtruction; and others, which are the children of God led by his ſpirit and word, die to liue<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 15.</note> more happily, ſo that their very death is precious in the ſight of God. And although the luſt of our fleſhe, beyng blind and earthly, ſtriueth continually againſt the deſires of the ſpirit, ſeeking to ſeparate vs as far as it can from our ſoueraigne <hi>Good,</hi> yet let vs haue this ingrauen in our harts, that they are happy that know the vanitie of this world, more happy that ſet not their affections vpon it, and they moſt happy that are taken out of it to be with GOD in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
