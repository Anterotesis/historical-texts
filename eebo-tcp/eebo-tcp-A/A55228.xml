            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE concurrence of severall reasons, (each of
which were sufficient) have moved me to offer
to your gracious acceptance this Essay. First,
my duty to your Lordship as my Diocesan, who
may justly challenge from me some account of my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Secondly, that gratitude which obligeth me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
your Lordships many favors extended to me and
mine. And thirdly the need of patronage and protection that
this Work hath, in regard that there is in it much stress
laid on such part of Learning, (the Orientall I mean,)
which of late, if not all along, hath had that unhappiness, as
to be scarce able to keep it self, not only from neglect,
but contempt, as needless; at least of not great use or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
In some places abroad where it formerly found great
encouragement, (if we may beleive generall complaints,)
it hath now little regard, although I doubt not but that it
will in good time recover its honor. That it may not be so
<pb facs="tcp:101621:3"/>
among us at home, it must ow to the favour and countenance
of men excelling as in authority and dignity, so in learning
and judgement; in which rank none being more eminent, so
none will be more ready to afford it then your Lordship,
who have your self alwaies been a lover of those Studies,
and by long experience know and have made known the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of them. I shall not here trouble your Lordship with
giving an account of what is in these Annotations done, that
being the proper work of the Preface. I shall only adde that
besides the former motives, I have a strong encouragement
to make this address to your Lordship from an assured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that whatsoever it be that I bring, being the
best that I have at present, and proceeding from those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
with which it is offered, it shall by your Lordship
be favouredly accepted from the hands of him who is</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE main thing in these Annotations endeavoured, is to settle the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
aud literall meaning of the Text. Seeing it is often very different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rendred by Interpreters, according to their different judgments, from
what we read in our <hi>English.</hi> Bibles; and that in them also we have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
readings in the Margin, I have laboured as far as I could to find out the
truth among them, by examining such as I have occasion to take notice of, by
the Original <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which is the standing rule which was at first by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God for such delivered to us by the Prophets and holy men divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
and hath ever since, by his wonderful Providence, been preserved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt
and sincere.</p>
            <p>Of any that shall question it, we may ask when it was corrupted, whither
before Christs time or since? If it be said before, and as an argument alledged
for it, that there is a Translation of greater antiquity then his time, <hi>viz.</hi> in
<hi>Greek,</hi> which so much differs from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies which we now have, as
to shew that in the Copy which the Authors thereof had, many things were
read otherwise then in these, we are not to be moved by it, except three things
be first made evident, 1. That the Copy which they had was a truer Copy then
any reserved among the Jews which might be derived to us from them. 2. That
those Interpreters strictly and precisely followed the letter of their Copy, and
did not give themselves liberty of expressing what they conceived to be the sense
and meaning, either more largely or in different words, or had not some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the words which are not now so usually known. 3. That the Copies
which we have of their Version be genuin and uncorrupted, as they proceeded
from them, without mixture or alteration. Which things have not yet been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proved, and I suppose cannot be.</p>
            <p>Againe, if it had been before Christs time corrupted, it can scarce be doubted
but we should have heard of it from him, who so often reprehending the Jews
for their perverse Interpretations of it by the Glosses of their Traditions, we
cannot think but he would much more have reprooved them if they had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Text it self.</p>
            <p>And after his time it is no way probable that it could be altered or corrupted
by any concurring malice of the Jews, (as it must have been done by a general
conspiration for corrupting all the Copies, or else would have been a vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt)
seeing it cannot be doubted but that among so many thousands of them,
of whom many were converted to Christ, and among them divers others (we
may well suppose) like <hi>Apollos,</hi> mighty in the Scriptures (<hi>Act.</hi> 18. 24.) many
had in their hands true Copies of it, by which they would have discovered any
forgery. And from them, that there were Copies imparted to other Christians
also we have reason to think, when we find that among them for many years
after Christ the Scriptures of the Old Testament were read in their Churches
in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> language: for that it was so among the <hi>Syrians</hi> we have from a
learned<note n="a" place="bottom">All Tacriti c. 29.</note> man of that Nation, who in a Book that he wrote in <hi>Arabick,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divers heads of the Christian Religion, speaking of their manner of reading
the Scriptures in the Church, saith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
i. e. <hi>In ancient time the Books of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:101621:4"/>
were read in the Hebrew Tongue, till S. Ephraim forbad it:</hi> which we cannot
think was for any other reason, but because they looked on the Hebrew as more
genuine and authentick then any Translation, not that they had not then Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of the Scripture in their own Language, as we shall by and by shew to
be more then probable.</p>
            <p>For these and other reasons, even the care that the Jews themselves (as is by
all known and confessed) alwaies took of writing it exactly true, as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own preservation depended, we cannot on any probable grounds que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the integrity thereof. Yea a learned<note n="b" place="bottom">Lud. Capell. in Crit. desens. p. 572.</note> man, who is looked on to have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
as much as any to question the integrity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that in Christs time, and <hi>Ionathans</hi> the Paraphrast, the Hebrew Books that
they then had were the same that we now have. And what then have we farther
to be sollicitous about in this matter? For of those was then the Book that our
Saviour stood up to read in the Synagogue, and expounded by the same Spirit
which first dictated what was therein written. <hi>Luc. 4. 16, 17. &amp;c.</hi> and the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which he justified by asking the Lawyer, who would know what he might
do to inherit eternal life, <hi>What is written in the Law? how readest thou? Luc.</hi> 10.
26. Those the Scriptures, which he bad the Jews to search, as in which they
thought to have eternal life, and as which testified of him, <hi>Io.</hi> 5. 39. and the
same th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se of which he saith, that <hi>He came not to destroy but to fulfill them: and
that till Heaven and Earth pass, one jote or title should not pass from them, till all were
fulfilled, Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18. and which he so often cites and refers the Jews to, and
the fulfilling of which he made the rule of what he did and suffered. Which his
divine approbation of them, without questioning the Copies they then had of
them, may justly seem to us a testimony of the integrity of them at that time, of
greater validity then any human testimony from any different reading in any
Translation, to make us question it. However these arguments may be eluded by
such as will be contentious, yet they are such as may well sway with a sober mind,
that neither before nor after Christs time the Hebrew Copies were corrupted,
and so ought to be our undoubted rule.</p>
            <p>The forecited<note n="c" place="bottom">Id. p. 625.</note> Author saith that Translations are to be examined by the
original Text, if any Copy of it be uncorrupted, and not that by translations:
and that is that therefore, which not doubting those Copies that we have to be so,
I have endeavored in part to do, so far at least as may serve to justify, or to give
account of, that Translation of our own which we follow; (and deservedly, it
being such and so agreeable to the Original, as that we might well choose among
others to follow it, were it not our own, and established by authority among
us:) which could not well be done without comparing it with others also, and
bringing all to the original Hebrew, as the test, as hitherto it hath had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be esteemed, and will so still have, having on it that divine impress which
will maintain its right and dignity against all that can be opposed.</p>
            <p>For the end proposed it was oft necessary to look into the signification of
the words in that Tongue, and what several senses they are capable of, that
it may accordingly appear which of such as by several Interpreters are fastened
on them, will be best agreeable to the place in which they occur, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the construction they are used in. For by the different understanding of
them is that great variety which is amongst Interpreters, of which account
cannot be given, much less they be though oftentimes reconcilable, or that
all their different Versions proceeded from one Fountain, or at least one read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but looking thereinto it will be made apparent that the variety proceeded
not from any variety in their reading, but from the variety of significations of
one word: among which some have, according to their different judgement,
<pb facs="tcp:101621:4"/>
preferred one, some another, yet so as that all have thought themselves to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the same Original, and ought not presently to be condemned, as disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to it. According to this respect, several places in the new Testament cited
out of the old, which according to the usual Translations seem to differ from
them, as there now read in the old, will be found not to differ at all from
them, according to another signification which the word, in which the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is placed, is as capable of as that by modern Translators usually given it,
and by them that follow those Translators looked on as having no other. As
for example's sake. Where we find, <hi>Heb. 8. 9. And I regarded them not, saith the
Lord,</hi> cited out of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> c. 31. 32. where is in ours and other Translations read,
<hi>Although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord:</hi> a man would think that
these proceeded not from the same reading of the Hebrew Text, till enquiring
into the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Baalti</hi> in that Language, he find that that hath both these
significations <hi>to be an husband,</hi> and <hi>to despise, loath,</hi> or <hi>not have regard to;</hi> and
so (to omit other examples) in that signal place in this Prophecy of <hi>Micah,</hi> c.
5. 2. which being cited <hi>Matt. II. 6. Thou Bethlehem Ephrata art not the least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Princes of Iudah,</hi> will seem to flow from another reading then what
now is read in the Prophet, <hi>Though thou be little among the thousands of Iudah;</hi>
till upon enquiry it be found that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Tsair,</hi> used by the Prophet
doth signify as well <hi>great</hi> or <hi>illustrious,</hi> as <hi>little.</hi> Then will the difference appear
to be from the Interpreters taking, some the one signification, others the other:
and that therefore these places might be rendred in the old Testament to the
same purpose, that they are in the new. One Translation therefore is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to be condemned, because it differs from another, but both are to be
tried by the Original; and when they may both be found to agree to that,
neither is rashly to be condemned, but with due deliberation and discretion,
that to be followed which may give the most convenient meaning to the place;
which may oft be so doubtful a case, as that a man, though of good judgement
and a discerning spirit, may be put to a stand, and will not dare rashly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
on either side.</p>
            <p>This having been observed by our Translators, they have with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and ingenuity, we see, put various readings or rendrings in the Margin
of our Bibles, as doubting which to prefer, and leaving it to the prudent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which to choose; as if the one and the other were (as the Jews in such
cases use to speak) <hi>both the words of the living God;</hi> both true and agreeable as
well to the original words as to the analogy of Faith. And such modesty is by
all in interpreting the Scriptures very imitable, and being observed would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
many quarrels, in which the truth, by rashly contending for it, is lost,
and such uncharitably censured, as forsaking the truth, which did heartily seek
it, and perhaps did not err from it.</p>
            <p>Now for these ends, <hi>viz.</hi> both of finding the one or several significations of
some words, where there was any dubiousness or difficulty, and the convenientest
meaning of them in the place, agreeably to the scope or context, I have made
use of (according to my skill) the best helps as I could meet with, and those of
several kinds. Such are, The comparing of such places, as the word or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that is to be explained, occurs in, elsewhere in the Scripture. 2. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
of several of the most approved Translations. 3. The use, either of
such Books as give the signification of single words, as, <hi>Dictionaries,</hi> &amp;c. or
else labour to give the meaning of them as joined with others, as, Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Expositors. The Translations that have been looked into are both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and modern; the more ancient, the Greek, (commonly called the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint</hi>)
and the Latin, (known by the name of the vulgar Latin) and the Syriack
and the Arabick Versions. The Greek and Latin have been so long known in
all places in this Western part of the World, and so much by many hath been
<pb facs="tcp:101621:5"/>
said of them, that it will be needless to give any account of them: but the
other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Syriack and Arabick, though well, and only, known in the
Eastern parts, so unknown among us, till the late noble Editions of the Polyglot
Bibles at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> that it may seem requisite to give some. That
the Syriack had anciently a Translation of the Scripture into their Language, is
manifest, and such as may challenge priority of the Greek it self, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them. But for making the matter more clear, we may observe that they
have two Translations, the one done out of the Hebrew, the other out of the
Greek. <hi>Gregorius Abul Pharajius</hi> in his History, (which was printed at <hi>Oxford</hi>
in Arabick and Latin) thus tells us, that the Greek Version made by the
LXXII Elders in <hi>Ptolemeus Philadelphus</hi>'s time, which was received not only
by the Greeks, but by most Sects of the Christians, yet was not followed by
the Syrians, especially the more Easterly ones: For that they had a Translation
which was called the Simple or plain Version, because the Translators did not
in it so much labour for elegance of words, which was conformable to the Copy
of the Jews: but (saith he) the more Western have two Translations, that Simple
one, which was translated out of Hebrew into Syriack, after the coming of
Christ, in the time of <hi>Addaeus</hi> (or <hi>Thaddaeus</hi>) the Apostle; or as others affirm, in
the time of <hi>Solomon</hi> the son of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Hiram:</hi> and another more florid made
according to that of the LXXII out of Greek into Syriack, a long time after
the Incarnation of our Saviour. For better understanding what he saith, and the
opinion of those of that Nation, we may farther take notice of what an ancient
Bishop (<hi>Soaded</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hadetha,</hi> cited by the learned <hi>Sionita</hi> in his Preface to
his Edition of the Psalms in Syriack and Latin) saies, That as to the Translation
of the sacred Books it was thus, the <hi>Law, Iosue, Iudges, Ruth, Samuel, David,</hi>
(or the <hi>Psalms</hi>) the <hi>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> were done in the
time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> at the request of <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyrus</hi> his friend. The other Books
of the old and new Testament in the time of <hi>Abagar</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> by the care
of <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> and other Apostles. Their later Version I suppose to have been
made by <hi>Thomas Heracleensis:</hi> for so I find in a Syriack MS (of which account
is given in the Preface to the second Epistle of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in Syriack, Greek and
Latin, printed at <hi>Leiden,</hi> An. 1630.) a distinction made betwixt the Translation
which was made in ancient daies, and the Translation of <hi>Thomas Heracleensis.</hi>
And so in the old Testament in the MS. Syriack Copy, is there prefixed to
one Version of the Story of <hi>Susanna,</hi> that it was according to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>the Translation of Heracleensis,</hi> (for there are two Versions of
that Story in the Copy, but neither of them may be supposed to belong to the
ancient simple Version, as neither probably any of the Apocryphal Books; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some of which (as the first book of <hi>Esdras</hi>) is put, <hi>That they were conformed
to the Tradition of the LXXII,</hi> and at the end of it, <hi>that it was not found in the
simple Version,</hi> and so likewise before <hi>Tobit.</hi>) When this <hi>Tho. Heracleensis</hi> lived I
have not yet met with any certain Narration, only I find him signalized in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Calendar among their Saints or holy men, by having his name among those,
to whose memory the 26. day of <hi>Haziran,</hi> or <hi>Iune,</hi> is consecrated, which makes
it probable that he is not of late standing; which will farther be confirmed, if
he be the same (as I suppose he was) of whom <hi>Schultingius</hi> makes mention in his
<hi>Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica,</hi> tom. 3. pag. 106. by the name of <hi>Thomas Harchalanus,</hi>
giving account of him out of a Catalogue of Missals made by <hi>Ignatius</hi> Patriarch
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that he translated out of Greek into Chalde (as he calls the Syriack)
the Missals of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist and of <hi>Clement,</hi> about four hundred and seven
years after Christ. But when the Syrians contend for the Antiquity of their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
we see it is for that other more ancient. But besides what they say for
themselves, wherein perhaps they may seem to go too high, we have not only
from the Greek Fathers, but from all our Copies of the LXXII it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb facs="tcp:101621:5"/>
proofs of the very great antiquity of some Syriack Version. In all the
Editions that we have of the LXXII, (except the Complutensian) as well that out
of the very ancient Copy in the Kings Library, as the rest from other Copies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
we have at the end of <hi>Iob</hi> these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c.
<hi>he is interpreted out of a</hi> (or <hi>the) Syriack Book, i.e.</hi> the Bible, (for out of no other
Book would they have taken words for authentick Text.) Which shews that there
was a Syriack book (or Translation) ancienter then any of them: and that it was
so written in those ancienter Copies, out of which any of them were transcribed;
they all of them, though in other things differing between themselves, agreeing
in it. And this plainly gives us to look on the Syriack Version as very ancient,
which is that which at present we say, and withall seems a sufficient proof, that
(as we above intimated) there was before S. <hi>Ephraims</hi> time such a Translation
among the Syrians in their own Tongue, which they might have used, if they
had not thought the Hebrew more authentick, and as so, given that honour to it,
as to use only it in their Churches. If they had not then had any, his forbidding
them to use the Hebrew had been a depriving them of any use of the Scriptures
of the old Testament, which we suppose was not his mind to do, but only to
cause them to be read in a more intelligible Language, in which he is said to
have written Comments on it.</p>
            <p>But although this be as much as may suffice to our present purpose, yet having
fallen on the mention of this matter, it may perhaps not be amiss by the way,
to endeavor to give farther some little account of it, which if any think not
to be of much concernment, he may pass it over.</p>
            <p>Whereas the last Chapter of <hi>Iob</hi> in the Hebrew Text and such Translations,
as follow it, ends with the 17. verse, and these words, <hi>So Iob dyed being old and
full of daies,</hi> in the Greek called the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> are added to the quantity of
several verses more, and that so anciently that some of the Greek Fathers have
commented on them as authentick Text.<note n="d" place="bottom">Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> saith that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
as so from the Apostles themselves, and <hi>Polychronius</hi> that they were so
accounted by the Fathers. There is first added, <hi>It is written that he should rise
againe with those whom the Lord should raise.</hi> Then follows what we mentioned,
<hi>He</hi> (or <hi>this man) is interpreted out of the Syriack book, dwelling</hi> (or <hi>that he dwelt</hi>)
<hi>in the Land of Ausitis</hi> (or <hi>Vz) in the borders of Idumea and Arabia: and his name
was Iobab,</hi> with other things concerning his wife and a son, and his Genealogy,
as that he was of the posterity of <hi>Esau,</hi> and the fifth from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and reigned
in <hi>Edom</hi> after <hi>Balat,</hi> &amp;c. as likewise concerning his friends that came to visit
him; after which in the Copy printed according to that very ancient MS. in the
Kings Library is repeated again a briefer account of <hi>Iob</hi> himself, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
to it as before, <hi>He is interpretted out of the Syriack book,</hi> but in other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
this is not found. What use to make of this we shall after see. And it is
by diverse ancient and modern taken notice that <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> who
translated the old Testament out of Hebrew into Greek, concluded that Book
as the Hebrew doth, but that <hi>Theodotion,</hi> who likewise so translated them, and
lived about 180. years after Christ, concluded it as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> doth, with
Additions out of the Syriack Version.</p>
            <p>But here may be objected against what we would thence infer concerning
the antiquity of that Syriack Version, what is by some of the Greeks said that
by the Syriack, named in those Additions to <hi>Iob,</hi> is meant the Hebrew Tongue;
to that purpose makes what in an Anonymous Greek Author, (whose words
were imparted to me by my Reverend and most learned friend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas
Marshall</hi>) prefixed in a MS Copy to <hi>Ioannes Melala,</hi> is said, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was
<hi>Origens</hi> opinion that it is so. Of what credit that Author is I know not, for it
is not likely that <hi>Origen</hi> thought or should say so. In that Commentary on <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101621:6"/>
which goes under his name, it is said that that Book was written first in Syriack,
and then done into Hebrew, being polished and completed by <hi>Moses.</hi> If so,
then the Syriack and Hebrew in his opinion were looked on as different. But
that Book is looked on as spurious, and the opinion a groundless conjecture.
What <hi>Origen</hi> thought may easily be collected out of his Epistle to <hi>Africanus,</hi>
part of which is set forth before the Text of <hi>Iob,</hi> by the learned <hi>Patricius Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
printed according to the MS copy in the Kings Library, where he saith
that those words which follow in the Greek after the 17. verse of the last Chapter
are not found among the Hebrews, and therefore neither in <hi>Aquila,</hi> but in the
LXXII and <hi>Theodotion.</hi> Had he thought that by Syriack, out of which it is
expresly said they were taken, had been meant Hebrew, he could not have
said they had been wanting in the Hebrew Books. However, by others it is so
said. For so <hi>Nobilius</hi> in his various readings o the Greek tells us, that the
Greek Scholiast saith that he calls the Hebrew dialect, Syriack, because of the
affinity betwixt them, and endeavors to prove it. Of that Greek Scholiast,
I can give no account but from him. But in <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> in the <hi>Catena</hi> on
<hi>Iob,</hi> we have the same expresly affirmed, who having observed that <hi>Aquila</hi> and
<hi>Symmachus</hi> end where the Hebrew doth, but <hi>Theodotion</hi> hath the same addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that the LXXII, then gives his opinion thus, <hi>The Hebrew dial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct he
calls in this place Syriack;</hi> then confirms it with those very loose and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
arguments; <hi>because, the Syriack language is of very nigh affinity with the
Hebrew, having the same number of letters</hi> (VIZ. 22.) <hi>and then because Iudea is
comprehended under the name of Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though this be by him and others, who perhaps looked not much into
those Tongues, affirmed, we cannot be much moved by it. For besides that
no such words are found in any Hebrew copy, which he himself confesseth, and
so destroys what he would affirm, if Hebrew and Syriack be one, we cannot
think it an opinion generally received by the Fathers. Some of them certainly
knew, that to say Syriack and Hebrew were different things, and would
not confound them by calling one the other. Besides, what we have already
said from <hi>Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> (who living long at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> could
not but know what was meant by the Syriack language,) on the 48. Psalm,
according to the Greek division, in one verse, cites both the Syriack and
the Hebrew, and as distinct readings; and so <hi>Theodoret</hi> on Psalm 115. and on
<hi>Ionah</hi> 3. 4. to omit many other testimonies, several of which are found in the
Greek Scholiast, and <hi>Nobilius</hi>'s Notes thereon.</p>
            <p>And whereas, as the same <hi>Nobilius</hi> observes, some say that by Syriack is
meant Chalde, that signifies nothing, for it will be no more then to say,
<hi>by Syriack is meant Syriack:</hi> for these are at most but two Dialects of one
Tongue, however it hath obtained that that which the Jews retained after
their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they learned it, and lost much of their own,
and framed much to the rules of the Hebrew, be peculiarly called Chalde,
as any that would know more of it may see in the learned Preface of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus
de Dieu,</hi> to his Grammar of the Oriental Tongues. To this day di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Syrians call themselves Chaldeans, and their Tongue Chalde, and
that which we call Chalde the Jews call '<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Arami,</hi> Syriack. And what then
would, if this were granted, be thence concluded, but that either the book of
<hi>Iob</hi> was written in the Chalde Dialect, or else that there was in it a Translation
of that Book in which those additions were read as authentick Text when the
Seventy translated it into Greek, and they followed its authority. Neither of
which I supposed will be granted; for besides that, in the Chalde Paraphrast that
we now have, no such additions are found, it is manifest that that is of much
later date then <hi>Ptolomaeus Philadelphus</hi> his time, and that there was any other in
his time in that Dialect, which is now lost, none can prove, nor will any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb facs="tcp:101621:6"/>
easily grant, although<note n="e" place="bottom">R. Azarias. See Buxt. de punctorum antiq. part. 1. c. 9. p. 126. &amp;c. and R. Gedaliah cited by Hotinger. Philol. Sac. p. 205.</note> some Jews contend for it, and would have the
Greek of the Seventy to have been translated out of that, and not out of any
genuin Hebrew copy, which is too great a slurre to be cast upon it. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nothing said except they mean it is the Hebrew which is called Syriack, and
who should mean so? surely not the Seventy, who by all are said to have been
Jews; they would not so far have profaned their <hi>holy Tongue</hi> (as they all call
it, by way of excellency to distinguish it from all others and<note n="*" place="bottom">Cozari l. 2. c. 68.</note> peculiarly Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack)
as to call it so, nor taken for authentick Text any thing that they had
not found in it, no, nor <hi>Theodotion</hi> himself, so long after them, having that skill
in Hebrew which he had, have confounded those names, nor any ancient
Greek who knew so much of it as to be able to translate it.</p>
            <p>There was a time (as we have intimated) after the Jews return from <hi>Babylon,</hi>
when their Language had so much of Chalde, or Syriack, mingled with it, as
that it might have been as well called Syriack as Hebrew; yet even then was
it rather called Hebrew then Syriack, as appears in the new Testament. But
sure the ancient proper Hebrew, such as we now speak of, none could so call
who had any insight in those Tongues, except for some design; so that to say
that by Syriack is meant the Hebrew, must be the assertion of some Greeks,
who were either ignorant of those Languages, or else were unwilling to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
too much to the Syriack, or give preference to it, above the Greek
Version, as ancienter then it. They might as well tell us that <hi>Iacob</hi> spake Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack,
when he called the heap <hi>Galeed</hi> as well as <hi>Laban,</hi> who called it<note n="f" place="bottom">Gen. 31. 47.</note> 
               <hi>Iegar Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadutha.</hi>
But if it be granted them that by Syriack in those words in the Greek
was meant Hebrew, how then will they unriddle how that, which, according
to them, was anciently a part of the Text in the Hebrew, and thence as so,
taken into the Greek, is now wanting in all the Copies in that Language,
and was likewise omitted by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> who undertook the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the whole that was looked on as authentick? they will not be able
to give any rational account of this. But to us, who look on as meant by Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack
that Language properly so called, it will be no difficulty. For if it be
asked how it should come to pass that those additions should so anciently come
into the Greek Version, being not in the Hebrew, but said to be taken out
of the Syriack book, the answer, I suppose, will be easy. Some anciently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Syrians, (whose custome of inserting Notes or <hi>Scholias</hi> in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
may be perceived out of such as are taken notice of, in the various read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Syriack in the Polyglot Bibles, gathered by the learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>)
had somewhere in his Copy of the Syriack Translation to the book of
<hi>Iob</hi> added for explication sake, according to what he had either by Tradition,
or out of some History then extant, received concerning the person of <hi>Iob,</hi> that
brief account of him, not unlike to which, though not quite the same, there
are found prefixed to it in two Copies in that Language, which were made use
of in the Edition of those Polyglot Bibles, two in something different terms, and
one shorter then the other; as he that pleaseth, may see in the various readings
of the Syriack in that Book. This, those that copied out anciently, those
Versions of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Theodotion,</hi> (for it will be too much to say the
Authors of them themselves, especially of the first, if they were truly the Seventy,
who commonly bear that name) finding in some such old Syriack copy, thought
worth while to translate into Greek, and add in their own at the end. (Yea so,
as if in differing Copies they found such account given in differing terms, to
take notice thereof also, as appears by what is done in the ancient MS of the
Kings Library, as we have mentioned.) Which other transcribers after conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
till what was so added was in time taken in as part of the genuine Text;
<pb facs="tcp:101621:7"/>
with inanimadvertency enough, seeing the Appendix, as is well noted in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Lections to the <hi>Francfort</hi> Greek Edition, doth not <hi>redolere stilum Canonis,</hi>
savour of, or any way agree with, the style of the Canonical Text. And this being
observed, the meaning of those words, <hi>He</hi> (i. e. <hi>Iob,</hi> his <hi>person</hi> not the <hi>book,</hi>
as the Author of the Comment, called <hi>Origen's,</hi> seems to think) <hi>is interpreted,</hi> will

               </gap> 
               <hi>His
Methtargam, He is thus interpreted, i. e.</hi> account is thus given of him.</p>
            <p>This conjecture is abundantly confirmed by what we read in <hi>Polychronius</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
who witnesses that those additions to <hi>Iob,</hi> however by many received
into the Text, whose opinion himself followed because of the authority of the
Fathers, yet were by others rejected; <q>They (saith he) reject the Genealogy
which is in the end, because it is not in the Hebrew, and the Book is concluded
with those words, <hi>And Iob dyed being old and full of daies,</hi> and say that the
likeness of the name in the Genealogy of <hi>Esau,</hi> which is in the book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi>
where mention is made of <hi>Iobab,</hi> gave occasion of error to some, and of
making that Scholion, or Note, and that in tract of time afterwards, that which
was written in the Margin (or elsewhere) was by others taken into the Text.</q>
            </p>
            <p>However it were, yet these things which have been said, taken at the least ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
give testimony to the antiquity of the Syriack Version. That which was
mentioned in the ancientest Copies of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Theodotion,</hi> which were
seen and used by the Greek Fathers, and had such credit when they were written as
to be taken notice of as of great authority, and little less authentick then the Text
it self, must needs be ancient. I hope none will think this to be eluded by saying
that <hi>Iob</hi> alone was then translated into Syriack, and not other Books of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
this would be a supposition contrary not only to the testimony of Syriack
Writers and others, which ought not rashly to be contemned, but to all reason.</p>
            <p>Something to this purpose may be collected also out of the conclusion of the
Book of <hi>Iob</hi> in the printed Arabick Version, in which that which makes the 18.
verse in the Greek, <hi>viz. It is written that he should rise, &amp;c.</hi> is not found, nor
that which follows, <hi>He is interpreted out of the Syriack Book,</hi> but most of the rest,
(after a breach made) is, though somwhat different from what is in Greek: for
whereas in it, is said, that he was the fifth from <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Arabick saith he
was the sixth, with some other differences in the Arabick it self, but made more
by the mistake of the Latin Translator, as he that shall look into it shall easily
perceive, as where instead of <hi>Asom,</hi> a proper name, he puts <hi>nomen,</hi> because the
word, so signifying, hath the same letters with the other. And then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
saying that the Author of the Copy, out of which he wrote it, saith, that
this Book was translated out of Syriack into Arabick. Whether that Author
meant it of the whole Book, or only of the additions, may be doubted as also some
other things which cannot be farther determined without sight of his MS Copy.
However, it appears that the Syriack Version was then in great authority and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
I have been long in this digression, not seeking to attribute more to
the Syriack Version then may in reason be due to it, but to vindicate to it that
which it may justly challenge, as to its antiquity. To return and proceed,</p>
            <p>We reckon likewise among the ancient Translations, the Arabick, though all
of much later date then the former. In that Language there are several Versions,
some done out of the Hebrew, some out of Greek, some out of Syriack, and
perhaps one of late years done and printed at <hi>Rome</hi> out of the vulgar Latin; as
<pb facs="tcp:101621:7"/>
I was told by one of that Church, was intended, and I have seen some Sheets of
it, but I know not whether it were completed. However, that is none of those
we speak of. Those that I had to deal with are two, the one, that which is found
in the Polyglot Bibles, which when, or by whom, done is uncertain; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
mostly to the Greek; in this part, I mean, of the <hi>Minor Prophets;</hi> for
the whole Bible is apparently not of one Texture, but in some parts seems more
conformed to the Hebrew, (as in the <hi>Pentateuch</hi>) in others to the Syriack, in
others to the Greek, as he that peruseth it will find. The other is a Manuscript,
the use of which I had out of the store of my learned and very good friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Robert Huntington.</hi> There is no name of the Author expressed (that I find) in
the Copy. Whither it be the work of <hi>R. Saadiah Haggaon</hi> (a Jew famous as for
his other Works, so for his Translation of the Books of the old Testament, out
of Hebrew into Arabick) I have reason to doubt, seeing the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
which is in the same Volume, differs from what I find in another Copy of that
Prophecy, which bears his name. And it is certain that others of the Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
him, did translate the Scriptures (or part of them) into that Language,
and therefore if it be any where by me cited as his, it is not positively affirmed,
and I almost think it is not his. Whose ever it be, it seems to be of some antiquity,
for it is not of late years that the Jews have used to write in Arabick, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they did, as is shewed in the Preface to <hi>Porta Mosis.</hi> Whither we should
reckon <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who made a Paraphrase of the Prophets, among Translators
or Expositors, I something doubt, because taking liberty of a Paraphrast, he
rather makes his business to give the meaning then the particular signification of
the words, which is more the business of a strict Translator; although every
such Translator too may not amiss be looked on as an Expositor or Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator.
This Paraphrase is of great authority with the Jews, and is constantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to have been made much about Christs time; and I know not why we
should question it. For those allegations against it, whcih are brought out of that
Paraphrase of the Law, which goes under the name of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the difference of the style, many things in it savouring of greater novelty,
signify nothing, that being confessedly none of this <hi>Ionathans</hi> work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is as the other Paraphrases, on the other Books, of much less authority (if any
at all) then that of <hi>Onkelos</hi> on the Law, or the true <hi>Ionathan</hi> on the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Besides these ancient Versions, it was convenient to look on others more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern;
such are those of <hi>Pagnin,</hi> the <hi>Tigurin, Munster, Castalio, Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi>
in Latin, and <hi>Diodati</hi> in Italian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will be found sometimes cited.
These often differing among themselves, and from the ancienter, and from ours,
give us occasion to examine the words in the Hebrew, and to enquire more
narrowly into the grounds of the difference, and to see what the Original will
bear, that so we might be able to judge between them, which not seldom will
be an hard matter to do, and force us to leave the Reader to prefer that which
seems to him best in his own judgement, seeing that will bear more, by reason of
the different use and signification of the words that occur in it, and all making
a good sense. When I have occasion to cite the vulgar Latin, I have mostly chosen
to give it in the words of the <hi>Doway</hi> Translation into English out of it, as that
which perhaps would be judged more authentick then any rendring of mine own.
In the use of our English Translation I would desire the Reader to have an eye
to the marginal reading, together with what is in the Text.</p>
            <p>Now for finding of the signification of the Hebrew words, besides the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Dictionaries, which are more common, the Reader will somtimes find cited
<hi>R. David Kimchi's Radices,</hi> or Roots, a Dictionary in Hebrew by him compiled
for the words used in the Scripture, from whom our ordinary Lexicographers
borrow much, and again <hi>Abu Walid,</hi> an ancienter Author then he, whom he often
cites by the name of <hi>Rabbi Ionah,</hi> as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> doth by the name of <hi>R. Marinus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101621:8"/>
his name at length being <hi>Abu Walid Marun Ebn Iannahi Cordubensis,</hi> a very learned
man, and of great credit among them, called, <hi>Prince of Grammarians,</hi> who wrote
divers Tracts about Grammatical matters, the last of which is his Book of Roots
or Dictionary expounding the Hebrew in Arabick, in which Language he wrote
all. There is nothing of his, that I know, printed, that which is cited is Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script;
so is also another Dictionary of <hi>R. Tanchum,</hi> which we made use of, though
not properly composed for Scripture words, but for such as occur in the <hi>Misnaioth</hi>
(or Text of the <hi>Talmud</hi>) and <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and an old Hebrew and Arabick Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
Add to these the Heads of the Hebrew Concordance compiled by <hi>R. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
which have been translated into Latin by <hi>Antonius Reuchlinus,</hi> and also by
the learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Nicolas Fuller,</hi> whose Translation is not printed, but in his own
hand writing remains in the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library. Under this Head may come also some
Arabick Lexicons, which it was necessary to make use of, for seeking after the
signification of divers Hebrew words, by comparing them with the same Roots
in the Arabick: a way necessary to be taken in regard that that copious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
continuing in greater latitude then the Hebrew (from which it had its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
and retains that affinity to that in the opinion of<note n="*" place="bottom">See Notae Miscell. ad Portam Mosis, c. 1. p. 5.</note> some of the learnedest Jews,
it may pass rather for only a Dialect of it then a distinct Language from it) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
often the genuine significations of divers Roots, which are now lost in the
Hebrew, and of severall words which occur so seldome in the original Text,
(which is all that we have left of that Language in its purity, and cannot contain
all words) that it will be hard to find the right meaning of them without that
help, which therefore the most learned of the Rabbins take and direct to, by
making search into that neighbouring Language wherein they will be often found
more common, and the meaning of them be manifestly declared by the known
use of them therein. What is said of the Arabick Language, is to be said of the
Syriack and Chalde, they also, together with the Hebrew, being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>of one family,</hi> as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> speaks, only that they are not, as now left, so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
as the forementioned.</p>
            <p>These helps being used for finding of the signification of single words, on which
the sense mainly depends, it was yet farther convenient for giving the meaning
of them in the context or sentence in which they are placed in construction with
others, to consult Expositors or Commentators, and those of several sorts, Jews
and Christians: The Jews because, though they have now so far lost their own anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Language, that it is not any more common to them as a <hi>vernacula,</hi> or Mother
Tongue, but, what they have of it, they learn, as others that study it do; yet do
those of them who will get any Learning, so make that their whole study from their
child-hood, that they are more then ordinary versed in it, and get more skill in the
Letter of the Scriptures, then usually any others; at least did so, when those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which we have to deal with flourished; so that their Comments are, and have
been alwaies thought to be, very helpful for attaining the literal meaning of the
Text, except in such places as are Prophesies concerning Christ, or make for the
Christian Religion against them: in such they being obstinatly set on maintaining
their Traditions received from their Fathers, and with them combining against
Christ, will be sure to wrest them as far as they can from the right meaning. But
then, that is another reason why we should look narrowly into them, that where
they pervert any such Text, we may vindicate and rescue it out of their hands,
that they may not securely triumph among themselves, as if they had the Scripture
on their side against us. And that hath been indeed no small part of my business in
such places, which hath made me perhaps somtimes so long to dwell on them, as to
make me seem tedious to the Reader: but I knew not how well to avoid it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
betraving the cause, or giving up the buckler to them.</p>
            <p>Those that we especially make use of, are <hi>Rabbi Salamo Iarchi,</hi> R. <hi>Abraham Ezra,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101621:8"/>
R. <hi>David Kimchi,</hi> and <hi>Isaac Abarbinel,</hi> (or as some call him, <hi>Abrabaniel</hi>) who are
all well known by name, as being printed and given account of by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> and
others, whose Expositions, where they might seem to the purpose, I have as far as
I could, labored to give a faithful account of, though to prolixity, that if we be
not alwaies directly holpen by them in finding the truth, we might see how and
wherein they err from it, and so by the discovery thereof, be more earnestly stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to seek after it and embrace it. Besides these, the Reader will find often
cited one R. <hi>Tanchum,</hi> an <hi>Hierosolymitan,</hi> who is less known, because never yet
Printed, although as far as I can judge, he might as well deserve to be so as some of
the rest, as as much conducing in divers places to the understanding of the Text, as
any of them. He wrote Notes in the Arabick Language on the whole Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as himself declares) though I have not had the happiness to see them on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Books thereof; on the Prophets (all but <hi>Isaiah</hi>) I have. When he lived
I know not, only it appears he was after the time of <hi>Moses Maimonides,</hi> whom he
often cites, and follows in many things. To these may be added <hi>yalkut,</hi> a Book
so called, being a collection of divers Allegorical Expositions on the Scripture.
What other Hebrew Books are cited, and are Printed, I shall not need give parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
account of, seeing any that desires it may have it in <hi>Buxtorfes Bibliotheca Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binica,</hi>
and others. The Christian Expositors, or other Writers, Greek, Latin,
or others that are made use of and cited, are such as are well known to all that look
into such Books, and any may know what concerns their Works by looking into
them, and seeing what account they give thereof in their Prefaces. That they are
of different Professions, it matters not in this business. We had to examine how far
they help for finding out the true meaning of the Text, not what their Opinions
otherwise were, it being more to be regarded what is said, then who said it, and
the truth abstracted from consideration of the person and his authority, to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at any hand. Their difference in their Expositions sends us again to look more
narrowly into the Text, and to see what that will bear, and which of them best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to that by which all must be tried. And that they should so much differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves is no wonder, if we consider how great variety of Opinions in
explication of things there often is, where they are uttered in the plainest terms,
and the most known Language and usual phrase of the Times: how much more
then, when this Original Language here used, is so long time since grown out of
use, and many expressions in it, then doubtless, even by the vulgar well understood,
seem now as so many riddles, and much of the History and Customs of those times
quite forgotten? and even then in the Prophetick Writings, there were some things
that seemed dark, according to what we read, <hi>Ezek. 20. 49. Ah Lord, they say of
me, Doth not he speak parables?</hi> So that all helps for the making things plain that we
have, though improved to the highest, are little enough, if at best sufficient. One
may perhaps do more then another, yet none so much as not to leave more for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to do. It may not seem strange therefore, that after so many Learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
written, others should yet endeavor to make some things plamer, at least,
and more known, by the help of their labors, and by addition perhaps of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
helps which they had not the use of; there will be room in this field while the
World lasteth, till we come where that Tongue which is now so far lost, shall as some
think, be again the Universal Language.</p>
            <p>As to this present Work, the thing first proposed was to have given the meaning
of the Text in brief Marginal Notes; but upon second thoughts, it was deemed
more convenient, that first a larger Exposition, wherein things might be discussed,
and the reasons and grounds of differing Opinions, as to the Interpretation of
doubtful places, laid open, lest what should be otherwise positively said, might seem
too magisterially spoken; which being done, out of it may shorter Notes (if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
serve) be taken, and the Reader be referred for the justifying of them to
the larger; and in them perhaps he may in some places find that I dare not pass
<pb facs="tcp:101621:9"/>
judgment for preferring one Exposition before another, and there it is referred to
him to take his own choice, or make use of either as occasion shall serve, when
more are agreeable to the words and analogy of Faith, and give a good meaning.</p>
            <p>I have not medled with drawing from the Words inferences and conclusions.
That will be every mans own work when he hath a setled meaning to ground on,
without which, they will be as a superstruction without a foundation. But what
I have done, the Reader, whose candor I beg wherein I have erred, or been defective,
or superfluous (as oft having to deal with so many different Expositors, whose Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
I had to look into and give account of, I have, I doubt, been inforced to be)
will judge. If I have contributed any thing, though never so little, in this kind,
which may be to Gods glory and the Churches good, I have the utmost of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and humbly thank God alone for so far inabling me.</p>

                     <q>The word of the Lord that
came to Micah the Morasthite, in
the daies of Iotham, Ahaz and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,
kings of Iudah, which he

                  </head>
                  <p>THIS Prophet is by the same
name and title mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Ier.</hi> XXVI. 18. called
the <hi>Morasthite</hi> from the
name of his City or place,
where he was born or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
which, whether it were
<hi>Moresheth</hi> mentioned <hi>ver.</hi>

and <hi>Ios.</hi> XV. <hi>ver.</hi> 44.<note n="b" place="bottom">Rab. Tanchum.</note> as many Others will
have it, or some other place of that name, as
'tis hard to determine, so not very material.
That it was pertaining to the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and
not of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as<note n="c" place="bottom">Christophorus à Castro.</note> Some think, is more then
probable, because in assigning the time of his
Prophecy, he nameth only such Kings of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
under whom he Prophesied, not any King
of <hi>Israel,</hi> which, if he had been a subject to them,
'tis probable he would have done, (as<note n="d" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Iew</hi> notes) especially seeing his Prophecy
concerneth not <hi>Iudah</hi> alone, but the ten Tribes
also, as those of <hi>Hosea</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> do. Another<note n="e" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> 
                     <hi>Iew</hi>

chief City of the Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> or the ten
Tribes, the other of the Kingdome of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two Tribes, viz. <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and so
under them is comprehended the whole of both
Kingdoms. God being provoked by their sins
declares, that he will proceed with great severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in judgment against them, and doth it in such
terms, as might justly rouze them up from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
and awaken them to a speedy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

this expression, that Mountains and Rocks

those molten mountains, or, shall be rent and
broken into pieces. By some it is rendred,

here literally to be understood, and according

which are said, should really so be done, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
but by way of similitude, to expresse,
that as great things should be done, as those
mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> that God should in executing
his judgments appear with such irresistible
power, that no persons, or places, tho they

in such a place. By <hi>Mountains</hi>

Tribes here meant, and that they are named
because they were most in number. It will not
much concern us nicely to dispute about this,

it is said, <hi>of their Silver and their Gold have they
made them Idols.</hi> These expressions being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
it will appear that by <hi>hires,</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
understood all their wealth and good
things, which they looked on as the gifts of

or, those pretious things and rich donaries,
which having receiv'd and gain'd from their

with them in their Idolatry, they dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

them and their Temples with. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this last interpretation<note n="l" place="bottom">Abarb. Vatab.</note> Some will
have the Idols to be compared to <hi>harlots,</hi> and
the Idolaters to <hi>their Lovers,</hi> who bestow gifts
on them for their <hi>hire</hi> and recompence of their

because otherwhere in Scripture the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters
are compared unto Strumpets, which
prostitute themselves and their Idols to their
Lovers, or such to whom they prostitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
This scruple will be taken out of the
way, if we consider what is said <hi>Ez.</hi> XVI. 31,
34. (concerning <hi>Ierusalem) Thou hast not been
as an Harlot, in that thou scornest hire. And the
contrary is in thee from other Women in thy whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
in that thou givest a reward</hi> [or <hi>hire] and no
reward is given thee:</hi> and again <hi>ver. 41. I will
cause thee to cease from playing the Harlot, &amp; thou
also shalt give no hire any more.</hi> The same word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in those places used that is here, makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that 'tis used not only for such gifts and
<hi>hire,</hi> as adulterers give to Harlots, but for
such also as more unsatiable Harlots give to
Men, to hire them to commit lewdness with
them: and so if it be here understood of such
gifts as <hi>Israel</hi> gave to, not received from, her
Idols, she may still be looked on as the
<hi>Harlot,</hi> and the Idols <hi>her Lovers,</hi> and the gifts
<hi>the hire of an whore,</hi> not received, but given
by her. These <hi>shall be all burnt with fire,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
such as the enemy shall see fit to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
And so the meaning of the following words
will either be, <hi>and all the Idols thereof will I lay
desolate,</hi>

the wealth that they looked on as a reward of
their Idols to them, shall return or be given to

which Beast is, to gather together in the night,
and to answer one another in crying and howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so that <hi>wailing</hi> is compar'd to the noise
that they make. Much like he notes on <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi>
cap. IX. ver. 11. where what is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>a Den of Dragons,</hi> according to him ought
to be, <hi>an habitation of Iakales</hi> (as there likewise
the <hi>Syriack</hi> hath it, as also <hi>cap.</hi> X. 22.) and on

so rendred <hi>Iakales,</hi> not <hi>dragons of the wilderness;</hi>
as likewise <hi>Lam.</hi> IV. 3. <hi>Those wild beasts,</hi> not <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monsters</hi>

in both those places the <hi>Syriack</hi> renders it by

the same with that which signifieth a <hi>dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>

But the simpler interpretation will be to look
on it, as a proper name, as the Text of our
Bibles doth. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> long since noted
these passages of the Prophet in the preceeding,
this, and the following verses, to contain such
difficulties as that there is great need of the
assistance of the holy Spirit to explain them.
He knew not how to reconcile the <hi>Greek</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and his own, and fit them to the Original,
which were all that he had them to do with.
How much more difficult will it be to reconcile
so many Translations as have since come forth?
The diversity between them ariseth from the
different acception of the words, some taking
them to signifie one thing, some another, and
from their different placeing them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Our Translators endeavour to
keep as near the words in the Original as they
can, and the meaning of them according to
their rendring seems this, That when <hi>Beth-ezel.</hi>
(which was first taken by the Enemy)
was led away <hi>mourning, the Inhahitants of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anan
came not forth</hi> to bewail with them, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101621:13"/>
comfort, or help the, as standing on their
own guard for fear of the Enemy, or,<note n="u" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi.</note> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the same calamity should quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
themselves, and so they should have enough
to do to bewail themselves. [For] <hi>He shall
receive of you his standing,</hi> of you, <hi>O Inhabitants
of</hi> Zaanan, though you remain longer then
those of <hi>Beth-ezel,</hi> [yet] <hi>he,</hi> that is, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<hi>shall receive his standing,</hi> that is, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for his labour, and time spent in beseig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and taking you: your spoil shall be his
recompence.<note n="y" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi. Michlal Yophi. Vatabl. Drus. &amp;c.</note> So both among the learned of
the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> do diverse explain these
words. And according to this exposition <hi>Beth-ezel</hi>
is look'd upon as first taken and destroy'd.
There is by<note n="z" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> another learned <hi>Iew</hi> another
rendring given, whereby <hi>Zaanan</hi> is said to be
first destroy'd: he with some alteration, thus
gives the meaning: <hi>The Inhabitants of</hi> Zaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan
<hi>came not forth in the mourning of</hi> Beth-ezel,
[or had not opportunity to <hi>come forth
&amp;c.] which received its standing more then you,</hi>
or remained longer then you, or after you,
that is, whereas they of <hi>Zaanan</hi> expected to
have seen those of <hi>Beth-ezel</hi> gone before them,
and to have bewailed their calmity, 'tis come
to pass otherwise, and they retain their <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
more than you of <hi>Zaanan,</hi> or after you,
and shall see your ruine and bewail you. He
also citing <hi>Aben Ezra's</hi> exposition gives this
sense of it, <hi>the Inhabitants of</hi> Zaanan <hi>went not
forth to mourning</hi> [and also] <hi>Beth-ezel shall take</hi>
or learn of you its <hi>standing, that is,</hi> to keep it
self at home, and not go forth to bemoan, or
help its neighbour; but he rejects it, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to <hi>Grammar,</hi> and the punctation,
in separating <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Lemispad to mourning</hi>
from <hi>Beth-ezel</hi> in construction, beside that
<hi>Beth-ezel</hi> keeping, or kept in by reason of its
seige, as he supposeth it to be, cannot be so
properly said to learn, what it did not of its
own choise, but was forced to. But this seems
different from what our Printed Copies of <hi>Aben
Ezra</hi> have. There is yet another exposition,
which offers it self thus. <hi>The Inhabitant of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anan
shall not go free</hi> or <hi>escape,</hi> for so the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Yatsa</hi> is used also to signifie; <hi>the

then reason either from it's situation, or it's
strength, or beauty, why it was so called, tho

be, <hi>Shall the portion of my People change them,</hi>

his permission, or, as in the Margin, <hi>in stead
of restoring, he hath divided</hi> (or, <hi>divideth) our
fields.</hi> The words in the Original being in this
verse very concise, are for that reason obscure;
the latter words as to a verbal translation ly
thus, <hi>how shall,</hi> or <hi>how doth he remove to me,
to turn,</hi> or <hi>to return, our Fields he divideth:</hi> which
words though then, when they were spoken,
and when the <hi>Hebrew language</hi> was in common

known to all, they were doubtless well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
yet now that they may be put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
language, and in it made plain and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
will require some change of order, or a
supply of somthing understood. In that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
which is in the Text<note n="d" place="bottom">and so Jun. Trem.</note> of our <hi>Bibles,</hi>
there is not much alteration, only to <hi>turn</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
it expresseth by <hi>turning away,</hi> i. e. <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by
turning away,</hi> and the sense is plain; except it
be made a doubt, whether it be meant, <hi>turning
away our Fields,</hi> or <hi>turning away himself</hi> from us.
As to that in the margin, there is intimated, and
briefly expressed in the word <hi>instead</hi> a supply
of what<note n="e" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi. Vatablus &amp; Michlal Yophi.</note> is by some in more words given, thus,
when I expected, that he should have restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>our fields, he hath divided</hi> them (to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or given them to the enemy that <hi>divideth</hi>
them,) or, How is it, that <hi>he,</hi> (that is, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy)
<hi>taketh away that which is mine? Instead
of restoring our fields,</hi> as we hoped, <hi>he divideth
them</hi> among his own Soldiers or People. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

such translations as are in the hands of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
some ancient ones depart farther
from the words in the Original, so that they
cannot be easily reconcil'd; as the <hi>Greek</hi> which
renders, <hi>we are made very miserable, the part</hi> or
lot <hi>of my People hath been divided by cord,</hi> or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
line, <hi>and there was none that hinder'd him,
that he might turn away,</hi> or, <hi>that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store,</hi>
as the <hi>Arabick:</hi> and the <hi>Syriack</hi> as wide,
<hi>the Robber shall spoil us, and shall with a measur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

there any that restoreth our part by a measuring
line.</hi> Those that are in <hi>Latin,</hi> and more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

is there no small variety among them. The
Ancientest <hi>Latin</hi> renders,<note n="i" place="bottom">Doway Bible</note> 
                     <hi>part,</hi> or, the part, <hi>of
my People is changed. How shall he depart from
me, whereas he returneth, that will divide our
regions!</hi> Others differ from it, and among
themselves, yet all so as to look on the words to
have in their root the same significations. But
then in rendring them as here placed Actively
or Passively, or applying them to different sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or making their pauses or distinctions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly,
make some difference in the sense.
When the reader shall have viewed them all,
he will probably find good reason to like those
rendrings in our <hi>English</hi> Bibles given, as well
as any, and acquiesce in them having his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
given him of chusing either that in the Text

or <hi>Refractory.</hi> Some other learned <hi>Iews</hi> will
have it here to be taken in that sense, and to be
an Epithet of the spoiler, or enemy.<note n="l" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> So one of
them, taking these as the words of such as were
oppressed and had their <hi>fields</hi> and houses by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence

great variety among Interpreters, the ground
of which will be seen by considering the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

little difference in the form, as <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                     <hi>Al Tattiphu Yattiphun Lo Yattiphu,</hi>
the prime signification of which word accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its root, is <hi>to drop,</hi> or <hi>distil</hi> and <hi>flow,</hi> and
<hi>to carse to drop</hi> or <hi>flow;</hi> and, from fluid things
translated to speech, it signifies <hi>to instill words,
to speak to,</hi> and particularly <hi>to Prophesie to,</hi> as
much as to say <hi>to drop words one after another to,</hi>
and in this sense 'tis manifestly here, as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
oft used. In the first place 'tis put in
the second person as a command given to some,
<hi>do not ye speak,</hi> or <hi>Prophesie;</hi> in the second place
in the third person, as spoken of what some did,
or would, or, should do: and so in the last
place also with a negative put before it, as
shewing what they did not, or would not, or
should not do: and signifie, put together, barely
thus much, <hi>do not,</hi> or <hi>ye shall not, speak,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie;
they do, will</hi> or <hi>shall, say,</hi> or <hi>Prophesie; they
shall not,</hi> or <hi>do not, speak,</hi> or <hi>Prophecy,</hi> without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
by whom these words are utter'd, or to
whom directed. Concerning the signification
therefore of the words, there is not much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
amongst Interpreters, but in applying them
to the persons by whom they should be utter'd,
and to whom directed, and of whom spoken, and
for what reason, is much difference; and so
the supplies, which they add to make the sense
clear according to their mind, divers. Some
take them to be partly the words of the People,
partly the words of God, or the Prophet
from God, but then differing in the parting
them. Ours, as it appears by their adding
<hi>say they to them that,</hi> make the first words
to be the words of the People, loath to hear
Gods judgments denounced against them for
their sins, and therefore forbidding them that
Prophesied, that is the Prophets of God, to speak
or Prophecy to them such things as they did;
and the next words they seem to take for Gods
saying by way of concession to what they would
have, <hi>they shall not prophecy to them:</hi> but then
the latter words rendred, <hi>that they shall not take
shame,</hi> are somwhat obscure, Whether do they
mean, they shall not say to them, as their false
Prophets did, that shame and confusion should
not come upon them, though they continued
in their evil waies; or that <hi>they may not take
shame,</hi> and so repent of their wicked course,
and prevent that confusion which shall fall
upon them; or, that they themselves, viz. the
Prophets <hi>may not take shame,</hi> i. e. be shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
or contumeliously used: for this sense
some<note n="a" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi.</note> Interpreters give. In the margin we
have another reading, <hi>prophesie not as they,</hi> viz.
the false Prophets, <hi>prophesie,</hi> and then the words
will be to be looked on as Gods words, and
the following to be understood in the first sense
with a change of the person, as if God forbad
his Prophets to sooth them up in their sins. A
<note n="b" place="bottom">Jun. Trem.</note> much approv'd Latin translation takes them
all as the words of the People, and thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them, <hi>Instill not,</hi> say they, i. e. the People to
the true Prophets, <hi>Let these, viz.</hi> the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>instil, they do not instill</hi> or <hi>prophesie</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, i. e. as our Prophets, the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
who say, <hi>that shame shall not cleave to the
people,</hi> i. e. that they shall not be put to that
shame, which Gods Prophets threaten to them.
In which translation are many things supplied
which make it somwhat harsh; from which
<note n="c" place="bottom">De Dieu.</note> a late very learned Man so far differs, as to take
them all for the words of God, or his Prophet,
and those directed either to the false Prophets,
to this sense, <hi>prophesie not; should they prophesie?
they shall not prophesie to these, shame shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from them,</hi> i. e. they shall not Prophesie,
for shame is decreed to them, which shall not
depart or be remov'd from them; or else to the
true Prophets, to this purpose, <hi>prophesie not my
prophets to this rebellious people; should they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
to them? They shall not prophesie to them,
least shame should be removed or depart from
them,</hi> which ought not to be removed. He
gives both these Expositions, but prefers the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
But it may be consider'd that as yet no
mention hath been made of false Prophets.
This learned Man also differs from the former,
in that he takes the word <gap reason="foreign">

God of them for their rebellions, as else where
he saith <hi>Amos.</hi> V. 10. <hi>they hate him that rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

them, <hi>prophesie ye not,</hi> i. e. that they forbad the

which he saith of them, <hi>they do or will speak,</hi> or

i. e. to him will they hearken and give ear, to

he saith the meaning will be, They that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie

which they would put on them. In this
multitude of opinions and judgments, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will see it necessary to use his own, and
that without danger of great error, none of
these expositions being contrary to the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy

we are forced to be tedious, be farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that some ancient Versions take the
word, which all these render <hi>speaking,</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying,</hi>
in an other sense, viz. to signifie
<hi>weeping.</hi> So the Greek, <hi>Weep not with tears,
neither let him weep over these: for he shall not
put away shame.</hi> And so the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi>
as to that word. And indeed <hi>weeping</hi> is not
far from that notion of <hi>dropping,</hi> or <hi>flowing,</hi>
which we said the root of the word hath. But
no Modern Interpreters think it meet to
follow them in this place.</p>

The <hi>Syriack</hi> joins the last words to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

is spoken or denounced to the house of Iacob.</hi>

The meaning of these words as consequent on
the former will be in a brief Paraphrase thus,
<hi>O thou that art named the house of Iacob,</hi> but
dost not in thy doings make good that name,
<hi>Is the Spirit of the Lord straitned?</hi> Is his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
his will or power of promising by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
good things and effecting them, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
more then formerly, when he did both,
that now thou receivest only threatning messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
by his Prophets? <hi>Are these his doings?</hi> was
he wont thus to deal? or, Are these punishments
and judgments that he denounceth, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
workds, or those that he delighteth to do?
<hi>Do not my words do good to him that walketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly?</hi>
Doth he not promise good things and
give them to him that is upright and walketh
in good waies? Do ye not perceive by his diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
dealings, in that he wrought wonderful
things for you while you walked in obedience
to him, and now forsaketh you and giveth you
up to evil, now that ye forsake him and rebel
against him, that the cause, of this change is
from your selves, and that he alwaies doth
good, but to them that strive to do good,
and walk in his right waies? And even now if
ye would by these menaces of the Prophets be
wrought on to amend your waies, for which
they are intended, would not these also be for
good to you, and a means of saving you from
that destruction which you for that end are
warned of by them? The words so understood,
are plainly inferr'd from the foregoing words,
as an answer to them who forbad the Prophets
to speak to them such harsh things as they
did, as if either they deliver'd not to them
rightly Gods message, or had not receiv'd a
full measure of his Spirit, or that 'twere in
their power to speak otherwise then God bad
them speak: and so their folly is discover'd, in
that they laid it not to heart, that the cause why
such severe things were by Gods Prophets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounded
to them contrary to such gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
which had been made formerly to the
true house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> was not from any ill mind
in the Prophets, nor any change in God, who
still continued to do good to them that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to walk uprightly in his waies; but from
themselves, who were so changed, that they
retain'd nothing of <hi>Iacob</hi> but the bare name,
and by their wickedness made themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of receiving better messages, or that
God should deal better with them. And this
seems the plainest meaning of the words. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
differently interpret them, as Some, who
in rendring the words agree, but then give the
meaning thus,<note n="u" place="bottom">Dutch Notes, Diodat.</note> 
                     <hi>Is the Spirit of the Lord strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>

the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast seems so to take it, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
<hi>Is it right which the house of Iacob say?</hi>
And the author of the Vulgar Latin seems to

One exposition given by some learned
<hi>Iews,</hi> runs thus,<note n="k" place="bottom">R. Tanchum. Abarb.</note> 
                     <hi>But Yesterday,</hi> or before now,
<hi>my People</hi> i. e. <hi>Israel</hi> behaving themselves as
my People, <hi>stood up against the Enemy,</hi> were able
to resist and prevail against him, <hi>but now having
forsaken God, you are so far from this, that at the
sight of a garment at a distance,</hi> taking it for
the Enemies colours or ensign, or for an Enemy
coming to set on you, <hi>you strip off your clothes,
and cast from you your garments, that you may fly
the lighter. And if you espy and but passing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
and quietly on the way, you presently flee
for fear of them with all speed, as Men that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
flying from Warr,</hi> or the Battel, <hi>for fear of
the Enemie pursuing them.</hi> And so may it be
compared with what is said, <hi>Levit.</hi> XXVI. 36.
<hi>The sound of a shaking leaf shall chase them, and
they shall flee as fleeing from a sword, and they shall
fall where none pursueth;</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> or, <hi>you taking them for
such as return from War, take fear and flee before
them.</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="bottom">Ar. Mont.</note> A learned Christian also embraceth this
interpretation; only that the latter words he
expounds, that <hi>those that pass on quietly in their
way, seem such as return from War,</hi> i. e. You for
fear casting away your garments, the traveller
that mindeth no such thing, finding them in the
way, cometh home with them as if he returned
loaden with spoils from the Warr. To this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
may our translatours seem to point in their
Marginal reading, viz. <hi>over against a garment.</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> Another Exposition is this, That God having
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101621:18"/>
before declared that his <hi>words do good,</hi> that he
promiseth and giveth good things <hi>to him that
walketh uprightly,</hi> sheweth now how incapable
they are of hearing or receiving good from
him, by describing their waies contrary to his:
as if he should say, But not to you (whom yet
he termeth <hi>my People</hi>) who are <hi>become as enemies
to me,</hi> resisting or setting your selves against my
Commandments both before and till now; viz.
in that you do wrong and violence <hi>for a robe or
garment,</hi> which injuriously ye <hi>take away from
them that pass on in the waies,</hi> thinking themselves
<hi>secure,</hi> as if they <hi>fled in the time of war,</hi> and
were gotten out of the reach of the Enemy;
or, who are glad when they are escaped out of
your hands alive, after you have taken those
goods they had, as they use to do who are
fled out of wars. And this exposition is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by what follows after in verse 9. <hi>The
Women of my People ye cast out,</hi>  as if
he said, These injuries ye do abroad in the
waies; but within the Cities ye do them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way, <hi>destroying Houses</hi> through whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
To the same scope tend generally the
modern translations, as taking the words for a
description of the perverseness, violence and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
of that People, though among themselves
they somthing differ in expounding and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.<note n="o" place="bottom">Calv. Gro.</note> Some, <hi>They that were Yesterday</hi>

differently, <hi>being quiet from VVar,</hi> thinking

may thus be render'd, <hi>But of late he,</hi> i. e. God,
<hi>hath given up my People to the Enemy. Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the mantel take away the robe from those

some of these forementioned I suppose will be
reduceable what other modern translations any
shall meet with. Some more ancient, as the

from them, that they will not easily be adjusted

to these two,<note n="a" place="bottom">Abarb. See Vatabl.</note> First, that they did by violence
cast out the Wives or Widows of those poor
Men whom they oppressed and spoiled of their
possessions &amp; inheritance, or had slain, or driven
away from their houses, wherein they had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their Husbands and Children with

which God in his law had given them,
or that glorious inheritance, which God had
given them for a perpetual possession, and
brought them to so low and contemptible a
condition, that the honour of being Gods
Children and People did no more appear in
them: Or as Others, by depriving them of their
substance and patrimony, by enjoying of which
they should have had occasion to give praise

being deprived thereof to curse you, &amp; murmur

the words differently, and otherwise
reads the latter part thus, <hi>The women of my

<hi>shall ye take</hi> (possess, or retain) <hi>my glory for ever?</hi>

in my chosen land my glory the glory of
all Lands? No: as ye have cast out others from
their pleasant houses, so will I cast you out
from my land, <hi>Arise ye and depart, &amp;c.</hi> The

translation render them, <hi>Arise and be gone,
this is not a resting place</hi> for you; <hi>because it
is polluted it shall be in pangs, and the pangs shall
be sharp.</hi> And the meaning thus will be good
and agreeable to the Scripture way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
punishments to a sinful Nation, viz.
that the land defil'd by their Idolatries and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
lewdness and all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
shall be pained as it were a woman in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
and in pangs, desirous to be eased of them her
burden, and not be at quiet till she be delivered
of them, and they cast forth of her. By the
pains and sorrows attributed to the land are
noted those evils that<note n="z" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> shall sease on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
thereof. The like expressions see

here denounced, either according to the first or
this last interpretation it may be compared
with <hi>Lev.</hi> XVI. 11. 25, 28. and chap. XX. 22.
the meaning is, that this land, which God had
given them for a rest, and they promised to
themselves for a sure resting place, now being
by them contrary to his command defiled,
should no longer bear them, but as a foul
Stomack corrupting what it hath in it, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
vomit and cast them forth, or, as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
at her full time desirous to be eased of her
burden, should be grievously pained, till it
were rid of them, as being weary of them.</p>

This way of expounding these words is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
agreeable to them in the Original, that
to enquire after others would rather make
them obscure, then add light to them. For as
for that rendring of the Vulgar Latin:<note n="e" place="bottom">Doway Transla.</note> 
                     <hi>would
God I were not a Man having the Spirit, and that
I did speak a lie?</hi> it can hardly be fitted to the
words in the Original. The particle <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Lu,</hi>

But then, what ground is there to add the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<hi>I were not?</hi> it would in this sense rather
found, <hi>would God I were a Man, &amp;c.</hi> Again
by what interpretation can this be made a
wish befitting the Prophet? He might perhaps
wish, that no such severe message had bin sent
by him, as of destruction to those his People,
out of his compassion to them; but to wish that
what by Gods command he spake, were a lie,
would be an injury, not to himself only, but
to the Spirit by which he spake, the Spirit of
truth, with whom falshood is not to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
much less either in word or wish at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to him. If he had only wished, that
himself by his suffering might have redeemed
them, it had been an act of charity; but not
to wish that God had sent a lie by him. S.
<hi>Paul</hi> saith he could wish himself, <hi>even accursed
from Christ for his Brethrens sake, Rom.</hi> IX. 3.
i. e. suffer any evil to save them, and win
them to Christ, but not that the Gospel or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

Very different opinions are there concerning
the Scope and meaning of these two verses,
Some taking them as a denunciation of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and utter destruction to them, as both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after is threatned by the Prophet
from the Lord: Others as a promise of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and restauration after dispersion, as 'tis
usual in the Prophets to mingle promises of
mercy with threatnings of judgment. Others
thirdly make them the words of the false lying
Prophets mentioned in the foregoing verse,
bidding them not believe the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
threatning them with severe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but telling them, that however they
threatned the contrary, it should be well with
them. The first of these waies is taken by
divers learned Men, both<note n="f" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi, Calvin. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus, Drusius, De Dieu, Tirin. Gro.</note> 
                     <hi>Iews</hi> and Christians;
and the words must then be expounded to
this purpose, That God threatens, that he
will <hi>gather together</hi> the whole posterity of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
and the <hi>remnant of Israel,</hi> (for many of
them had already been destroyed, or carried
away captives) i. e. all that remained both
of the ten Tribes, and also the two other of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> in great multitudes, as
flocks <hi>of Sheep in Bozrah,</hi> a place noted for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Sheep; that as a flock are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>into their fold,</hi> and there shut up, so they
should be gathered into their Cities and
Towns, that they might be taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and there, <hi>by reason of the multitude of them</hi>
that were shut up, besieged, and distressed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

                     </gap> of the Enemies that in
such great number surround them,) <hi>should
make great noise,</hi> and be much troubled, as a
great flock of Sheep shut up in a fold, are
disturbed<note n="i" place="bottom">De Dieu.</note> when any comes in upon them:
viz. because <hi>the breaker,</hi> i. e. the Souldiers of
the Enemy, who should break down their
walls, should <hi>come upon them,</hi> and make free
passage for themselves, by breaking open their
gates, <hi>to pass in and out;</hi> or for themselves
to enter, and to lead them out to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity:
<hi>and their King,</hi> viz. the Enemies
King, <hi>should pass before</hi> his Army to
lead <hi>them</hi> on; and not only so, but <hi>the Lord
himself in the head of them,</hi> to give them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over those whom he hath given up
to be destroyed by them: and so this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
may be looked on as fulfilled in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101621:20"/>
taking of <hi>Samaria</hi> by the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> 2
<hi>Kings</hi> XVII. 6. and of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
2 <hi>Kin.</hi> XXV. 1. &amp;c. Others, who yet
look upon it as then fulfilled, do differently
expound the last verse, to wit, that<note n="k" place="bottom">Tarn</note> by the
<hi>breaker</hi> should be understood the Enemy, but
then that for fear of him they should make
breaches themselves in their walls to get out at,
and pass out at the gates, to escape if they
could by flight, <hi>their King himself leading them
the way,</hi> (as<note n="l" place="bottom">Jer. XXXIX. 4. and see Ezek. XII. 12.</note> of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> 'tis said, 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
XXV. 4.) but being taken should be carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and they after him; and all this because
<hi>the Lord was in the head of them,</hi> i. e. the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to execute the judgments that he had
denounced against that People. But this seems
harsh to interpret <hi>them,</hi> in <hi>before them,</hi> first of
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> then in the same continued sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>on the head of them,</hi> of the Enemies. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
therefore expound it, <hi>shall</hi>

                     <hi>be on the
head of them,</hi> i. e. over them for evill, and to
execute his vengeance on them, and to see that
they shall not escape. Others, <hi>and the Lord

them, and withdraw his presence, by
which he was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them; which<note n="n" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> a learned <hi>Iew</hi> notes to be a far
fetch'd interpretation.</p>
                  <p>The second Exposition, viz. that in these
words is a gracious promise of restauration to
<hi>Israel</hi> after their dispersion, is preferred<note n="o" place="bottom">Chald. Paraph. R. Sol. Jarchi. R. Tanch. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb.</note> by
many learned Men both Jews and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
with this difference, that the <hi>Iews</hi> (the
modern at least) understand it as a temporal
restoring of the Kingdom of <hi>Israel;</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of a Spiritual deliverance by Christ, and
the calling them into his Kingdom, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
them into his Church, together with
the called of the Gentiles, <hi>as one flock into one
fold under one Shepherd.</hi> See <hi>Ioh.</hi> X. 16. The
words being so taken, we need not (saith<note n="p" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> a
learned <hi>Iew</hi>) look after any connexion with
the foregoing, or following, it being not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
to have gracious promises so mingled
with threatnings of judgments, where seems
no coherence betwixt them. Or else the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
may be made thus,<note n="q" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> saith another,
God having before threatned severe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the People, both in this and the former
chapter, as that their inheritance should be laid

carried away captives; least they should ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
despair of deliverance or Salvation, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingles
this merciful promise of a gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,
that he will again after the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion
with which he hath threatned them, <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them together in as great multitudes, as the sheep

                     <note n="r" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> according to one sense of

Christian Interpreters, who look upon these
words as a Prophecy of good things, do look,
as taught in the Gospel, after a more Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
meaning, interpreting them as made good
by Christ's calling, and gathering together,
into his Church, his fold, the <hi>Israel</hi> of God,
his dispersed flock, who were before as Sheep
going astray; in which they should grow into
great numbers, like the flocks of <hi>Bozrah.</hi> The
comparing with these words the x. chap. of
<hi>Ioh.</hi> to the 18. verse, will serve much for the
illustration of them in this sense understood.
And in what numbers they came at first into
the Church, the History of the first times, as
<hi>Act.</hi> II. 41. and chap. IV. 4. and elsewhere,
and of succeeding times all the world over,

breaking as it were, and passing through the
gate, by his preaching repentance laid open,
that they might go in and out: and it will be
easy to apply to him this title of <hi>the breaker:</hi> &amp;
so shall we have in the words, a most illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prophecy of Christ, and his forerunner
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, which it will be no reason to
let go, seeing the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves so readily
yield it to us. Especially, when the words
most nicely examined, will be more punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appliable to this exposition then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is brought, observing only to look
for these promises to be Spiritually perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which the <hi>Iews</hi> expect only as Carnal;
and because they have not yet had any such
temporal deliverance, think the Prophecy not
yet fulfilled. Neither is it by divers Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
looked upon as yet compleatly fulfilled,
but, in another regard, viz. because it respects
Christs calling, and gathering of his, not only
here, into the fold of the Church militant, the
Kingdom of Grace,<note n="a" place="bottom">Christ. à Castro.</note> but hereafter into the
Church triumphant, the Kingdom of Glory,
in the Heavenly Jerusalem. This needs not
be looked on as a new exposition, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
of the former, which it necessarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth.
The third way of expounding the
words is, of a learned<note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>i</hi> b. Ezra.</note> 
                     <hi>Iew,</hi> who taketh the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the 2 verses, to be the words of that lying
Prophet, spoken of in the foregoing verse, as
if he should say to them, Drink and be merry,
and fear not, for the Lord hath put into my
mouth to say unto you, that he will surely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together all that are dispersed of you,
and you shall be in your Cities in great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,
as flocks of Sheep in their proper
folds and pastures; and thus the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
leading them the way, they follow like
Sheep one after another, when one of them
hath gone out of a gap, and even their King
likewise doth the like, the Lord, at their first
breaking out from his obedience, removing
his presence, and providence from them. Thus
he is explained, by another<note n="c" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> of his Nation,
who yet rejects his opinion, because these
words were spoken before the dispersion of the
<hi>Israelites</hi> by Captivity; so that if they had
been a promise from their false Prophets, they
should rather have told them, that they
should not be scattered, nor go at all into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
as the true Prophets denounced, and
not have prophesied to them of a return after
captivity. Yet, do<note n="d" place="bottom">Jun. Trem. Grot. &amp;c.</note> Some Christians interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
also so far follow him, as to think the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the two verses, to contain the words of
the false Prophets, but so as retorted by God
upon them; that whereas they promised them,
that they should be gathered together, he
would indeed so gather them, but not
for good, as they falsly promised them, but
for evill, and a general destruction. It may
be here observ'd, that whereas the most take

according to the outward sound, the
Christians acknowledge to have been already

we have much the like expressions as here, as
if one of these Prophets had borrowed words
from the other. Whether one did make use of
the others expressions, as of words already
known to the People, or for what end, we need
not further enquire; tis sufficient to know,
that Gods Prophets did not steal his word

viz. to shew what great respect, and regard,

place more eminent and desirable then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by reason of the Glory that God shall
confer on it, and the priviledges that he shall

promised are so great, as<note n="d" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> that the <hi>Iews,</hi> mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
temporal concerns, do not acknowledge to
have been under the second Temple after their

yet expect the coming of a <hi>Messiah,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whom they shall enjoy them. But <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
looking on them as concerning Spiritual
things, acknowledge them to be already made
good by the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> and setting up
his spiritual Kingdom by the preaching of the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> and the gathering of People to it. If
we look on the place here called <hi>the mountain
of the house of the Lord</hi> according to the sound
of the letter, even that was highly exalted and
made illustrious, filled with his Glory at his
coming, the glory of the latter house standing on
that (according to what is Prophesied <hi>Haggai</hi>
II. 9.) <hi>greater then of the former,</hi> made so,<note n="e" place="bottom">See Grotius in Haggai.</note> not
so much by the external pompe of it, as by his
presence, and the miracles by him and his
Apostles wrought, and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and
many graces by him confer'd in it. And with
what respect People may be said <hi>to have looked
up to it</hi> and <hi>flowed unto it,</hi> appears by that early
conversion of so many out of every Nation
under Heaven, as are reckon'd up, <hi>Act.</hi> II.
5, 9, 41, 46, 47. Chap. IV. 4. This, if
we should so far restrain the name of <hi>the mount

are to propose in their coming into the Church,
is here shewed to be, not that they may obtain

that they may learn his will, that they may

they must resolve to walk in his waies, which
lead to Salvation and true happiness, which he
alone teacheth. They seek not Temporal but
Spiritual good things; <hi>for his Kingdom</hi> (as he

proceed the true and clear knowledg of God

necessary for times of peace, (an expression
contrary to what is us'd, <hi>Ioel</hi> III. 10. for
expressing times of Warr and tumult, <hi>Beat
your Plow-shares into Swords, &amp;c.</hi>) This
being promised as the effect of Christs reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the Preaching of the Gospel, which
we call the Word of God, the <hi>Iew,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
not Christ to be yet come, requires
us to shew how this hath been made good
under the Gospel, that so we may prove this
Prophecy to have been made good, and so
Christ to be come? For answer to which obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
several things are said, as first<note n="z" place="bottom">Tar.</note> that these
words are figurativly to be understood, not
precisely according to the sound of the letter,
not so much of outward peace in the World,
as of inward peace of Conscience, that
peace <hi>which being justified by Faith we have
in God, Rom.</hi> V. I. that which Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to his, that they shall have in him <hi>though
they have trouble in the World, Ioh.</hi> XVI. 33.
and this peace have Christians alwaies found,
and shall find in Christ: he left it with his and
will continue it to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Gospel is a Doctrine of
peace, commending it to Men and disposing
their minds to it; so that whosoever as much as
lieth in them live not peaceably with all Men
<hi>Rom.</hi> XII. 18. live not according to the
rules thereof, and Animosities, Wars, and
dissensions argue a deficiency of Faith in Men,
and that they<note n="a" place="bottom">Paraeus.</note> have not ascended up to the
Mountain of the house of the Lord, nor learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as they ought) his waies to walk in them.
But seeing the word of Christ instructeth to
bear wrongs and not to revenge, &amp;c. and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
to peace, and requireth it, it may be
well said, that by the preaching thereof Men
should be so dispos'd, as that<note n="b" place="bottom">See Sanc.</note> they <hi>should beat
their Swords into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> low-shares, &amp;c.</hi> that they
should not leavy Warr any more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some<note n="c" place="bottom">Rib. See Christ. à Castro.</note> think this made good in that
about the time of Christs coming, there was
peace in the known World under <hi>Augustus,</hi> in
token of which the gates of the Temple of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
at <hi>Rome</hi> were shut, as after again under
<hi>Nero, &amp;c.</hi> but that peace seems to others
not much to respect this peace, as not being
an effect of Preaching the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it may seem rather to have been
fulfilled in what is said, that when great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
were converted to Christ by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel,<note n="d" place="bottom">See Act. II. 42. and 44. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>they were all of one heart, and

among all those many and of different

by the unbelieving Heathens, who were

it continued not so, it argues (as we said) in

the last daies, 2 Tim.</hi> III. 1. &amp;c. They that
faithfully adhere to Christ, and sincerely love
him, will still be known to be his by their lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another, and living peaceably as far as
is possible with all Men: and of such only<note n="f" place="bottom">Ribera.</note> to
some seems this Prophecy to be spoken, and to
have respect not generally to all Men, but to
the Godly, and true Believers, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
endeavoured, and alwaies will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make it good, and shew it fulfill'd in
themselves. If any think not these answers
sufficient, but expect a more literal fulfilling of
the words by a general peace in the World,
they must expect<note n="g" place="bottom">See Grot. de Veri.</note> what time will hereafter
produce; and if they be the <hi>Iews,</hi> that this
answer may suffice them, and that there is no
force from the Argument to prove that the
<hi>Messiah</hi> is not yet come, will appear from
what diverse of their own Doctors say, that the
time or Kingdom<note n="h" place="bottom">Chelec. page 361. edit. Cochi.</note> of <hi>Messiah</hi> lasteth on Earth
many thousand of Years, (doubtless to the end
of the World.) So that if ought spoken as
concerning his time be not yet fulfill'd, it may
be longer expected without denying him to be
yet come. Again as to them, their Doctors
also say,<note n="i" place="bottom">See Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

interpret these words, as that they are to
have their full completion in the World to
come after the second coming of Christ. But
the Prophecy may seem rather to respect what
shall be done in this World then that to come,
and we may well rest satisfi'd that it is already
perform'd, even in respect<note n="m" place="bottom">S. e Jerom. to Junia and Fratella.</note> of that outward

learned Man gives the meaning thus, No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
that God should have so singular a care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us: for other Nations, for performance of

our God the true God.<note n="p" place="bottom">Sanct.</note> Another, No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
that we shall be safe, or secure, seeing we
have God for our Protectour, against whom
neither our Enemies, nor any other Gods can
prevail. The sense, I suppose, according to
them, must thus be made up, As long as we
adhere to the true God, no fear but we shall
have his promises of security made good to us;
seeing the Nations that are against us trust in
false Gods, which can neither help them, nor
annoy or hurt us, under the protection of our
God, to whom we constantly cleave. Some
of the<note n="q" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi Mss. and see Aben Ezra.</note> 
                     <hi>Iew</hi> Doctors thus expound the words,
Till that time all People shall walk in the name
of their Gods, for they shall not return to the
right way, till that time when the King <hi>Messiah</hi>
shall turn them into the right way: but we of
the house of <hi>Israel</hi> will walk in the Name of
our God for ever; though the Temple be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and we led captives out of our Land,
yet will we not change our God for another,
but walk in his Name alwaies.<note n="r" place="bottom">Abarb. So Montanus also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth the words, and compares Galatians IV. 8. and 9 and Ephesians II. 11, 12.</note> Another thus,
For all People, which now walk every one in
the Name of his God, and we also the Sons of
<hi>Israel,</hi> all of us, both we and they, in that
time will walk in the Name of our God, &amp;c.
The connexion of Inference, I suppose, in all
these must still be the same, viz. that therefore
they will faithfully expect that those blessings
of peace and security, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
shall be made good to them: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
the Prophet makes in the name of those
that are spoken of, that shall come in to God,
as joyning himself to them.<note n="s" place="bottom">See Montanus and Sanctius.</note> Some give the

worship other Gods, yet the faithful believers
will constantly acknowledge and worship the

consider how it is the usual custom of the
Scriptures to call Gods People, his Sheep, and
to compare such as are distressed, or go astray
among them, to silly weak or lost Sheep, as <hi>Ier.</hi>
L. 6. <hi>My People hath been lost Sheep,</hi> and
ver. 17. <hi>Israel is a scattered Sheep:</hi> considering I
say, these things, it may seem very agreeable
to understand here likewise, Sheep, or, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
the weak or distressed of <hi>Israel</hi> (Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
flock:) and then will this Prophecy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
manifestly to be fulfilled in what Christ
saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> XV. 24. that he was <hi>sent to the

his Apostles to <hi>go to the lost Sheep of the
house of Israel, and to preach to them, saying, the
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; and to heal the
Sick, to cleanse the Lepers, to raise the Dead,
and to cast out Devils. Matth.</hi> X. 6. &amp;c.
This his bringing them into his fold, the Church,
by his own Preaching, and that of his Apostles
and Disciples, was a more signal and illustrious
assembling of her that halted, and gathering
her that was driven out and afflicted, then any
restauration of theirs, or bringing them home to
their own Country from among the Nations
where they were dispersed. That did but
make way for this greater healing of their brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

but to prepare and make way for greater

making good of what is here promised; for it
follows, <hi>and the Lord shall reign over them in

this hath not been according to the letter, and

rise and beginning in or from them, and
thence spread it self; so that these, and other

indeed, they more deservedly agree to that

by some little transposition of the words,
and understanding the last as a repetition of
the former, that this Kingdom or Dominion
should come to the Daughter of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But
this makes no great difference or difficulty.
It is to be enquired what is meant by <hi>the first
Dominion,</hi> &amp; how that came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or in
whom what is promised was to be made good.
By <hi>the first Dominion</hi> may be understood such
a Dominion and Kingdom as was at first to
them under <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> (so the <hi>Iews</hi>
mostly understand it;) or the chief Dominion;
or thirdly that the Dominion should in that first
place come to the Daughter of <hi>Zion</hi> or <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
Now how in any of these senses or all of
them, it came, or it was to come to them, and
in whom it was seated, or in whom it was to
be, or is, made good to them, is the main en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.

                     <hi>Iews</hi>)
and under the second Temple it was made good
to them. But sure <hi>Zorobabel</hi> never ruled in
that greatness and splendour as to be compared
to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> or that his Dominion
might be equalled to theirs over <hi>Israel.</hi> And he
that relates that opinion of theirs, confesseth
that in these prophecies are greater things (as
those in the first verse) spoken, then can be said
in him to have been fulfilled, or under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Temple, though this and some other passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
he thinks to belong to those times, but that
the other are yet to be expected; and saies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that by Some all these Prophecies are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as belonging to the times of <hi>Messiah,</hi> the
speedy coming of whom he and they earnestly
desire. And that indeed seems the opinion of
most of them, viz. that these are things not
yet fulfilled, looking on them as carnal and
temporal promises of an Earthly glorious reign
of <hi>Messiah</hi> on Earth, wherein he shall rule over
all <hi>Israel,</hi> all the twelve Tribes, as<note n="f" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Solomon</hi> did, having his seat at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which
shall never more be destroyed, which state of
his power they look on as signified by <hi>the first</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Kimchi.</note>
                     <hi>Dominion.</hi> And that this Prophecy was antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
looked on as respecting the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared by the Chaldee Paraphrast (of great
antiquity and authority among them) who
makes him by the Name it self <hi>of Tower of the
Flock</hi> to be described, thus rendring it, <hi>And thou,
O the Messiah,</hi> or Christ of <hi>Israel,</hi> which art
hidden because of the Sins of the congregation
of <hi>Zion, unto thee shall the kingdom come, &amp; the first</hi>
(or antient) <hi>Dominion shall be to the Kingdom of
the Congregation of Ierusalem.</hi> So that on all
hands, as well the most of the <hi>Iews</hi> as Christians,
will it be agreed that this Prophecy was to be
fulfilled in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and respects his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the times under him; but with a vast
difference between them, the <hi>Iews</hi> looking on
it (as we said) as a promise of an Earthly
Kingdom in this World which is not yet come,
nor any <hi>Messiah,</hi> in Earthly pompe and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
to assert it, yet revealed, for their Sins as
the Chaldee intimates retarded; but that such
a one shall come, and make good what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
agreeable to the litteral sense of the words
according to their interpretation: but Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
firmly believing the promised Christ to be
allready come, and to have made good all that
by vertue of the Prophecies was to be expected
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101621:27"/>
in that way that they are to be understood, to
wit in a Spiritual way, and of better things
then the things of this World. And to him do
we say, and to the <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here
meant, viz. the Church, that the words may, as
they ought to be, in their best and highest
sense and full latitude be applied. To him,
and in him, <hi>to Ierusalem did the first Dominion,</hi>
i. e. that of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, come.</hi> So
the Angel of him, that the Lord God should
<hi>give unto him the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rone of his Father Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
and that he should reign over the house of
Iacob for ever, Luc.</hi> I. 32, 33. over the whole
house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> all the twelve Tribes; and not
only over them, but that his Kingdom (he set
by God <hi>on his holy Hill of Sion</hi>) should take in
the <hi>Heathen also for his Inheritance, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
parts of the Earth for his possession, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
Prophesieth of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> II. 7, 8. So
that under him is no difference between <hi>Iudah</hi>
and <hi>Israel,</hi> no nor between <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> all
believers in him being as one <hi>all the Israel of God
Gal. I. 11. 28. Coll. III. 11. Ephes.</hi> II. 12,
<hi>&amp;c. To him was given Dominion and Glory and a
Kingdome, that all People Nations and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
should serve him, and his Dominion be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Dominion,</hi> Dan. VII. 14. <hi>Vnto all whom
the sound of his Kingdom went forth, Rom.</hi> X. 18.
And so in the second Notion <hi>the first,</hi> that is,
the chief <hi>Dominion came to the Tower of the Flock
to Ierusalem</hi> in and by him, a Dominion and
Kingdom greater and larger then that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
or <hi>Solomon,</hi> or any other. <hi>David</hi> in Spirit
therefore <hi>called him his Lord, Psal.</hi> CX. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi>
XXII. 44. and of himself he witnesseth, and his
witness is true, <hi>that he was greater then Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Mat.</hi> XII. 42, and hath therefore deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>a Name given him, King of Kings and Lord
of Lords, Rev.</hi> XVII. 14. and XIX. 16. <hi>Prince
of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> chap. I. 5. None of
their dominions were ever like his for extent or
duration. <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> were in all their
greatness but Types of his, their Kingdom,
being even quite overthrown; and the<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts XV. 16. 8</note> Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of <hi>David,</hi> which was faln down, was in
him raised up to a greater height and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
manner then ever it was in under the
<hi>Iews.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>to the Tower of the Flock, to
Sion and Ierusalem,</hi> to the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi>
in and by our Lord Christ, <hi>came the first Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi>
i. e. there it was first set up and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged
by the Preaching of the Gospel of the
Kingdom to the <hi>Iews and lost Sheep of Israel,</hi>
there he himself proclaimed it, and shewed his
Disciples, <hi>that repentance and remission of Sins
should be Preached in his Name among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
beginning at Ierusalem, Luc.</hi> XXIV. 47. and
so S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Iews,</hi> that <hi>it was necessary the
Word of God should have been first spoken to them,
Act.</hi> XIII. 46. And it may perhaps not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to observe, that he was even at first
acknowledged for the expected King at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
by much People, when riding on an <hi>Asse</hi>
into the City (whether through that gate
which was called <hi>the Sheep gate,</hi> and properly
denoted by <gap reason="foreign">

by the Prophet, <hi>Tell ye the Daughter of

upon an Asse, &amp;c.</hi>) he was received by the
acclamations of great multitudes, saying, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna
to the Son of David, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> XXI. 4, 5.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath it, <hi>Hosannah, Blessed
is the King of Israel that cometh in the Name of
the Lord, Ioh.</hi> XII. 17. or as in St. <hi>Mark</hi> XI.
10. <hi>Blessed be the Kingdom of our Father David
that cometh in the Name of the Lord,</hi> which
cometh nearer to these words of the Prophet
here, and so <hi>Luk.</hi> XIX. 38. So far were they
convinced by the great Miracles that he shew'd,
such as were before never shewed, and his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
not only over Men (as when he drave out
of the Temple those that profaned it) but over
seas and winds and Devils themselves, that they
could acknowledge him no less; and therefore,
had he not declined it, would have by force
made him a King in another manner then he
would be so acknowledg'd, viz. an Earthly
King, <hi>Ioh.</hi> VI. 15. And so far it appears, this
opinion of him prevailed among the People,
that it was put in as an accusation against him
by those that would not acknowledge him, that
<hi>he said he was a King, Luc.</hi> XXIII. 2. though
it was not he himself but the People that said
it; and in respect to that common vote did <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
say, bringing him forth to the <hi>Iews, Behold
your King,</hi> and put for the superscription of his
accusation on the Cross, <hi>The King of the Iews,
(Mar.</hi> XV. 26. and the other Evangelists) giving
him indeed, though but in scoffe, his just
title; at which the chief Priests offended, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him to change it, and not to write, <hi>the
King of the Iews, but that he said, I am the King
of the Iews, Ioh.</hi> XIX. 21. though he never said
it, nor challenged to himself any such Kingdom
as they pretended contrary to <hi>Cesars;</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such, as he himself told <hi>Pilate, that was not
of this World, Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 36. And that was it
indeed which was his crime with them, because
he challenged only such a Kingdom. Had he
came in the lower power and splendour of an
Earthly King, they would, the chief of them,
have been as forward as the common People
were to have acknowledged him; whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
because he did not so, they rejected, and
for the same reason do their posterity still deny
and reject it, and so will not acknowledge those
Prophecies, as this and other like, concerning
his Kingdom to have been in our Lord Christ
fulfilled, but still vainly look for another in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101621:28"/>
whom they should be fulfilled to them, in a
Kingdom that is of this World, wherein keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his seat in an Earthly <hi>Ierusalem</hi> reedified, he
should rule over <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> by force of
Arms subjecting the rest of the World to them.
But we having learned from himself the nature
and manner of his Kingdom wherein he ruleth,
and which he, beginning at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
propagated through the whole World,
not by carnal Arms and force, but by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of his Spirit and Word, do see and cannot
but acknowledge the utmost of what by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this Prophecy could be expected, made
good in and by him; and that it plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to him. After all this, may be taken
notice of yet another construction of the
Words, by some<note n="i" place="bottom">Grot. Stokes,</note> followed, yet tending still
to the same purpose, <hi>Thou, O Tower of Eder,</hi>
(or the Flock) that is, <hi>Bethlehem, that art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
to thee shall come the Daughter of Zion,
and there shall come from thee the first Dominion,
that is, the Kingdom to the Daughter of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
such a King or Kingdom which shall bear
rule in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> i. e. in thee Messiah the King
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> shall be born: which though some
say may be partly applied to<note n="k" place="bottom">Grot,</note> 
                     <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> yet no
otherwise they say then as he was a type of
Christ, who was to spring of the same race. In
summ these words, however they be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
are a Prophecy concerning Christ and his
Kingdom, which cannot be eluded: in him and
by him, are they in the ampliest manner, and
in none other Person ever yet were, fulfilled: he
it is that should come, and in vain do the
<hi>Iews</hi> look for another to come and bring an
Earthly Dominion and Kingdom to them.</p>

given another exposition, somthing different
from the former, <hi>Now why dost thou cry out, &amp;c.

despair, she is assured of help from the Lord,
who, when she hath been made to know, how

Scope of this and the following verses, yet (for

using her, without respect to her former
holiness, and as much as in them lies abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all signs thereof. In much like sense seems the
word <hi>desiling</hi> (though the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101621:29"/>
be differing, yet of like signification) to be
taken for <hi>contemptuous using</hi> or <hi>destroying,</hi>
as it is said, <hi>Iosiah defiled the high places,</hi>
2 <hi>Kin.</hi> XXIII. 8. &amp; <hi>Ez.</hi> VII. 24. God threatens,
that their holy places should <hi>be defiled by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi>
and Ps. LXXXIX. 39. <hi>Thou hast profaned his
Crown, by casting it to the ground.</hi> In much like
sense may the word here be understood. It has
also another signification, of <hi>doing hypocritically,</hi>
or, <hi>being an hypocrite;</hi> and Some<note n="q" place="bottom">See Arias Montanus &amp; Christ. à Castro.</note> here chuse
to take that. So the <hi>Tigurine</hi> version, <hi>she was an
hypocrite.</hi> The intention must still be, Let her
have the condemnation or punishment of, or,
be used as a profane hypocrite (for the word
is not of the Preter-tense but of the Future, and
is rather after this notion to sound <hi>She is,</hi> or
<hi>let her be,</hi> then <hi>She was,</hi> or <hi>hath bin.</hi>) In fine,
it is an expression of their desires, that all
manner of mischief and shame might befall her
to her utter desolation (like theirs, <hi>Psal.</hi>
CXXXVII. 7) and their hopes to see it that they
may rejoice at it and insult over her, as is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expressed by the next words, and <hi>let our
Eye look upon Zion,</hi> let us see our desire upon
her, as the word is likewise used, <hi>Psal.</hi> LIV. 7.</p>

So they thought, and so they wished, as was
aforesaid, that <hi>Zion</hi> should by their hands be
laid perpetually desolate; but the Lord had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ends; to chastise his People by them, but
then to return their malice on their own heads,
and to bring that final destruction, which they
intended to others, on themselves. Such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Gods counsel and thoughts, and
the thoughts of the Enemies of his People
which he makes use of sometimes, for humbling
and chastising his People, see likewise describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Isa.</hi> X. 5. and following verses. He
when he hath done his work by his Enemies,
shall again in mercy receive his People into
favour, and destroy those to whom for a time
he gave power over them; which destruction
he expresseth by saying, <hi>he will gather them as
sheaves into his floor,</hi> and bidding the Daughter
of <hi>Zion</hi> in his might, to <hi>arise and thresh them,</hi>
trample on and triumph over them, for that
he will enable her so to do; for that end he will
make <hi>her horn Iron,</hi> and <hi>her hoofs Brass, that
she may beat in pieces many People,</hi> that is, he will
give her irresistible strength and power so to
do. In these expressions, the like to which are
else where used, is manifestly alluded to the
custome in those Countries, both of old and
still, to bring the corn, after it is gathered in,
made up in sheaves, into a floor in an open place,
and then laying the sheaves in order, to lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
oxen over them, drawing after them a
pair of dented Iron wheels, or, as in some
places, planks stuck with sharp flints driven
into them, that so the Corn may be trodden or
forced out by the hoofes of the Oxen, and the
straw by the wheels or flints broken in small
parts like chaff; and then the Corn purged
from the straw is laid up for the use of Men,
and the straw for the ordinary food for their
Cattel. This custom is elsewhere alluded to in
Scripture, <hi>Deu.</hi> XXV. 4. This being observed, it
easily will appear to be the meaning (as was
said) that their Enemies should be gathered
for destruction, and they should have power
given them, to bring them under &amp; utterly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
them. Some<note n="r" place="bottom">Deodat. Ludovicus de Dieu.</note> learned Men because the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is borrowed from the treading out of
Corn, which the Oxen do not by the use of their
horns, but their feet and hoofes, think it more
convenient here, not to understand by <hi>horn</hi> the
horns on the head, (although by these strength
is else where rendred) but the horny substance
on the feet of the Cattel, to wit, their <hi>hoofes,</hi>
which by saying he will make Iron and Brass,
is meant (as also if the word <hi>horn</hi> be properly
understood) that he will give them unwearied
strength and irresistible power in subjecting and
prevailing over their Enemies. The <hi>Chaldee</hi>
therefore without mentioning <hi>horn,</hi> or, <hi>hoofe,</hi>
renders, <hi>I will make the People in thee strong as
Iron, and their remnant firm as Brass.</hi> The
subduing of their Enemies seems farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the following words also, <hi>and I will
consecrate their gain unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
or devoting spoils and goods taken
from Enemies, read in <hi>Numb.</hi> XXXI. 28. and

omit the custome of other Nations in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating

their Gods, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> may seem to have
consecrated the vessels taken out of the Lords
house to his Idols; for he carried of the vessels
out of the House of the Lord to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and put
them in his Temple at <hi>Babylon, 2 Chron.</hi> XXXVI.
7. in the house of his Gods, <hi>Ezra</hi> I. 7. That
which we take notice of is, that the consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of their defeat and destruction. So that the

words are a repetition, or continuation of Gods
promise of victory to his People over those
many Nations which should be gathered against
them, and of his denuntiation of destruction
to those Nations. But then who are by those
Nations meant, and how, or when this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was, or was to be, made good on them, are
the things to be inquired: and they may be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together. First as for those Nations<note n="s" place="bottom">Christ. à Castro, Menoch. Tirinus</note> Some
insisting on the particle <hi>now,</hi> in what is said,
<hi>Now also many Nations are gathered against
thee,</hi> as if it denoted something nigher at hand
then the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> coming against <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
and to be done before that, will have to be
understood those that came up in the Army of
<hi>Senacherib</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> in the fourteenth
year of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> whose gathering
together, and taunting insulting speeches,
and threats against <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the X. and XXXVI. and XXXVII.
Chapters of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> as also, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII.
19. And that the prophecy of destruction to
those Nations with its expressions was made
good on them, they prove from the History in
the forecited places, which saith, that when they
were gathered together to set upon <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
the Angel of the Lord went forth, &amp; slew in the
night an Hundred fourscore and five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
in the Camp of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and all the
leaders and Captains, so that <hi>Senacherib,</hi> after
all his proud brags and insultations, returned
home with shame unto his own land. To what
may be objected, that here the Daughter of <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is bid to <hi>arise and thresh, &amp;c.</hi> and that she
should <hi>beat in pieces many People,</hi> but that she
had no hand in this, but all was done by the
Angel of the Lord; it may be answered, that
what was done by the Lord for her sake, though
by other instruments,<note n="t" place="bottom">Deodat.</note> is not unfitly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her, and she is called to trample on and
triumph over them, whom in her behalf, and
for her sake, he had brought under her feet; &amp; it

(perhaps without any good grounds)
that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> consecrated to the Lord many

may be taken notice of, what is said, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
XXXII. 23. that upon the victory many brought
gifts unto the Lord to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But Others
think, that there ought not that stresse here to
be put on the Particle <hi>Now,</hi> as to the designing
of the time, but<note n="z" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi.</note> that the import thereof here
is for assurance, that what is spoken shall as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
come to pass in the time by God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
as if it were already done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that to be said to be done now, which was
a good while after without fail to be done.
<note n="a" place="bottom">Rib. Grot.</note> Some Others therefore understand by <hi>the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations,</hi> such as were in the Army of the
<hi>Chaldeans,</hi> by whom <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was taken and
destroyed, and the <hi>Iews</hi> carried away to <hi>Babel.</hi>
But what victory had the <hi>Iews</hi> ever over
them? (the like objection to what was against
the former opinion.) The answer must be, God
gave them into the hands of the <hi>Medes</hi> and
<hi>Persians</hi> to be threshed and destroyed, so that
the <hi>Iews</hi> then in captivity under them might
justly insult and triumph over them, and what
God did by others for their sakes be attributed
to them. And the consecrating their gain to
the Lord,<note n="b" place="bottom">Grot.</note> Some think to be made good by
Gods bringing it to pass, that the vessels by
them taken out of the house of the Lord were
sent back again. Others, looking on this as no
satisfactory completion of this prophesie alone,
<note n="c" place="bottom">Sanctius.</note> think it ought to be extended to the times
of the <hi>Maccabes,</hi> &amp; that in their History may be

may be well said to have been fulfilled. But

the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom they yet expect, and
<note n="d" place="bottom">Ab. Ezra.</note> by those many Nations understand, Some, of
them which at that time shall come up with
<hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> being, though they promise to
themselves the destruction of <hi>Zion,</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi.</note> by God
stirred up and gathered together, that they
may be themselves destroyed: Others, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whom <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
was sacked, and the second Temple destroyed,
and also such<note n="f" place="bottom">Abarbinel.</note> Armies of the Christians and
of Saracens also, as afterwards invaded,
or shall hereafter at that time of restoring the
captivity, be gathered by God to that place,
and there be destroyed, or, (as before) the
Armies of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> and according to
their several fancies expect the fulfilling of all
these things here said: whose dreams as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
do deservedly reject, so in this do they
(at least divers of them) join issue with them,
that what ever else may be said otherwise to
have been done towards the fulfilling of the
things here said, as to the destruction of the
<hi>Assyrians,</hi> or the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or those of diverse
Nations in the time of the <hi>Maccabes,</hi> yet the full
completion of them to belong to the times of
<hi>Messiah</hi> or Christ, (not yet to be expected, as
the <hi>Iews</hi> would have it, but already come) under
whom they have been and are manifestly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.
But then things are Spiritually (as before
was observed) not carnally to be understood, &amp;
the Daughter of <hi>Zion</hi> not to be the Earthly <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101621:30"/>
but the Church of Christ, which indeed
(as was above said) from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> took its
first rise, and thence spread it self over the face
of the Earth, and brought under many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and much People. With what rage and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
both at the beginning and in succeeding
times they gathered themselves against her, is
manifest: yet were they by the power of Christ,
the sword of his Spirit, and Scepter of his word,
and by those whom he imploy'd furnishing
them with <hi>weapons, not carnal, but mighty through
God to the pulling down of strong holds, and to the

we look on things after the flesh, or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to shew that the Christians (under Godly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours)
have had so great victories over the
insulting Enemies of the Church, as might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the letter of this Prophecy be justlier
said to have been a fulfilling thereof then any
things by those of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church: but Christ
having declared his Kingdom not to be of this
World, we are not so much to judge of his
conquests by what hath been wrought by the
Arm of flesh, though by his power and in his
Name, as by those wrought by the Sword of
the Spirit, <hi>not against flesh and blood, but against
Principalities and Powers, against the rulers of

to the second coming of Christ, (<hi>for he

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 25.) In that day certainly will it
appear how the things here spoken (as every

(which art full of spoilers and robbers, or which
hast great store of military Troups,) <hi>now shalt
thou be spoiled, thou which didst lay siege against,</hi>
or in hostile manner deal with <hi>us,</hi>

and messengers of God, and in which
<hi>they shall smite the judge of Israel,</hi> Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>with a rod on the cheek.</hi> This sense is harsh
in respect both to the construction and to the
coherence. For if there be any coherence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these and the following words (as there
manifestly is) these things must be fulfilled
before Christ was to be born in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and
so he that was after to be born could not be he
that is here said should be smitten. (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
lies against all others<note n="o" place="bottom">Aben Ezra. Capell. Crit. Sac. pag. 246.</note> who would
have by this <hi>judge of Israel</hi> to be understood
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or Christ, however differently
they expound the former words.)</p>
                  <p>It is a clearer sense which is given by
others, who takeing <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
spoken to, in the former part of the
verse, take their Enemies as spoken of
in the latter part; so making it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
or farther declaration of those evills
above threatned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which she should
certainly expect to undergo; and telling by
whom, and in what manner, or how far they
should be inflicted on her: and that, whether
the former words be interpreted in that signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
already mention'd, or in the others also
above spoken of. If in the same signification
that those expositors already mentioned take
them, then thus, <hi>Now, ere long, thou shalt be
spoiled,</hi>

already done, in token of the undoubted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

                  <p>Of the same concern as to the <hi>Iews</hi> do Others

those good things, and obtain that redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

God hath threatned the one in the first place,
and promised the other after to succeed, and
in making good both in their due time, will he
shew his veracity. This verse concerns the evils
that they shall suffer, and then in the following
is farther assurance given of their, redemption,

vengeance of thee, in the place where thou
didst that mischief.<note n="a" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> Which vengeance God
will bring on them for two causes mentioned.
First, because they laid siege against <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
when they took it, and destroyed the second
Temple. Secondly, because they used contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliously
the chief of the <hi>Iews,</hi> whom they
carried captives, as is shewed by the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>smiting with a rod upon the cheek.</hi> These,
though otherwise differing, yet in this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they understand by the Enemy spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, the <hi>Romans</hi> who took <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the Temple, are all liable to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
objection, viz. that the things here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
according to the series of the words, were
to be fulfilled before that ruler in <hi>Israel,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
of in the words next following, to wit
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was to <hi>come forth out of Bethleem,</hi>
that is, to be born there; whereas the siege
and destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Temple
were after Christs time. To the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
lies open also the opinion of other
<note n="b" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi, Michlal Yophe.</note> 
                     <hi>Iews,</hi> who by the Enemy here pointed out
understand the numerous Armies of <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> which they will have to be yet to come
against <hi>Ierusalem</hi> long since destroyed. But
if they say this objection toucheth them not,
because they hold the <hi>Messiah</hi> is not yet come,
we must answer, that we are assured by the
fulfilling as of all other Prophecies concerning
him, so of that immediatly following, (as in
the consideration of it will appear) that he is
already come, and that <hi>Iesus</hi> our <hi>Christ</hi> was
he, and therefore their obstinate denying of that
truth, doth not justify their errour or mistake
in this interpretation, which perhaps they
therefore take up, that they may seem to have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101621:31"/>
some colour for that grand errour and their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
in it, by saying such things ought to be
done before the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which
are not yet done, and that therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe him to be yet come. As for what
<note n="c" place="bottom">Ribera, Ch. à Castro.</note> Some answer here, that the particle <hi>Now,</hi>
seems to import a time nearer to the Prophets
uttering this Prophecy, then the coming of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Armies was, it is perhaps not much to be
insisted on, because that<note n="d" place="bottom">See Kimchi and Abarb.</note> may be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of its due time, or time determined for it
by God, to whom even what was farthest of,

                     <hi>Iew,</hi> thus. Having described what should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
them, that they should be led captive to
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and how the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
over them, and then promised that in a

that it should be by cutting off the

and therefore, as addressing his speech to them,
saith, <hi>Thou shalt be wounded,</hi> or <hi>Be thou also woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>

is, tast of that which thou hast made us tast,

it was not yet done, according to the usual
language of the Prophets, speaking of what
shal certainly be as already done) <hi>siege against us,</hi>
and <hi>which shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod
on the cheek,</hi> meaning their contumelious usage
of their King <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> i. e. This shall befall
thee, because thou hast done these things in
besieging us, and despitefully using our Prince
and King. And then having intimated what
contempt shall befal the house of <hi>David,</hi> he
subjoins (according to Gods usual method) a
declaration of what dignity they shall again
attain to, in the time of their restauration, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>But thou Bethleem, &amp;c.</hi> So will the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the words one with another be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,

of the first (i. e. the <hi>Babylonish</hi>) captivity,
and the first restauration, i. e that from that
captivity, and not meant as some other,
as we have seen, would have it, of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

read, according to the ordinary Translations

expositors have sought out several waies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which are these. First, that which our

two significations, viz. <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> or <hi>of

it is here to be understood in this place. That
the word hath both these significations (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

proves<note n="o" place="bottom">See Porta Mosis, Chaldee Paraph. and Zach. XIII. 7. in Syriack and Greek, and Arab.</note> by instancing in other places, in which

esteem and value above others in sight greater,
so it was with <hi>Bethleem,</hi> though perhaps other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
little in number, bigness, or account,

in sense is all one, alluding to the custom of

they readily answering to him, that he was to
be born in <hi>Bethleem of Iudea,</hi> because it was so
spoken in the Prophet here, that out of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem</hi>
should come a Governour that should rule

read, <hi>Ioh.</hi> VII. 41, 42. where some by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
thinking that Christ, because he had been

be the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> because (as from
this Prophecy I suppose they had their only
ground which they took for undoubted)
that he was to come of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and
out of the Town of <hi>Bethleem</hi> where <hi>David</hi> was.
None could they then acknowledge <hi>for the
Christ,</hi> who was not born in that Town. And
to their Interpretation must we stick that we
may not give advantage to the latter <hi>Iews,</hi> who
think it sufficient for the fulfilling what is
here said, that he was to have his extract from

that there might be any probability of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

was fully completed: as also what is farther
expressed, that he, that was <hi>to come forth out of

the place of his Nativity, was <hi>to be ruler in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>

An ancient<note n="a" place="bottom">Ly a.</note> Commentator mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
some, who would have it <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> saith
of them that they do more <hi>Iudaize</hi> then the

not born in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> (if he were not born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this promise of one to be born, as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he was) that the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves would
not go to attribute them to him. And the same
censure will in great part take hold on those
who attribute them to <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was born there, and in whom such other
things as are here spoken<note n="b" place="bottom">For so R. Tanchum confesseth on ver. 3.</note> cannot by any

though by what is delivered by some<note n="c" place="bottom">Theophylact on the second of Matthew.</note> anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers of the Christian Church, we may
think that heretofore some <hi>Iews</hi> did avow the

those<note n="d" place="bottom">Chaldee paraphrast R. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, R. D. Kimchi, Abarb. R. Tanchum, Nitzachon.</note> who better considered the matter, and

the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or King <hi>Messiah:</hi> in which so
far they agree with us Christians, but with
great difference otherwise, they affirming the
words to note such a <hi>Messiah,</hi> as is not yet
come, and labouring from these and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

here promised, the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> is already
come, and that these words prove that he is so,
and that it appears from them, that our Lord
Jesus Christ is he that should and did come
forth of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and be ruler in <hi>Israel.</hi> As
this is here foretold of our Saviour Christ, so

but they ruled over him, and put him to
Death, and as yet neither do believe in him
or serve him. The answer to which is easy:
they did indeed and had power over him so
far, but not to hinder or impair his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over them here promised: but more to
discover the true Nature of it, which they were,
and continue mistaken in, and to further the

over <hi>Israel</hi> in the narrow sense wherein they
appropriate it to themselves alone, who are <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

which most concerns us, is, not being moved

He goes on in describing of him, who he saith
should come out of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> &amp; be ruler in <hi>Israel,</hi>
by another more eminent coming or going forth
then that from that place, even before that place
was, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Father begotten before all worlds,
and afterwards in <hi>time</hi> (according to what is
said, that he should come forth of <hi>Bethleem</hi>)
made Man of the substance of his Mother and

                     <hi>Iews</hi>
who deny the Divinity of Christ, endeavour
to put us off from this proof of it, or, our so
applying the words to him by another inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
viz. that these words import no
more, then that his going forth, viz. his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
should be from <hi>David,</hi> between whom
and him here promised should be a long time,
a great number of years and ages, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

<hi>from of old, from daies of age,</hi> or, <hi>antiquity, i. e.</hi>
a long time since, and not <hi>from everlasting</hi> or
<hi>before time,</hi> (and so<note n="m" place="bottom">Grotius.</note> others who are not <hi>Iews</hi>
following their exposition, think that the words
may well enough be applied to <hi>Zorobabel</hi> who
was of the posterity of <hi>David,</hi> who was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
from <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and so had anciently his
extraction thence. But this the <hi>Iews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do not say, who (as was before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
do not apply them to him, but to a <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
whom they yet expect to come of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage
of <hi>David.</hi>) Another<note n="n" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> 
                     <hi>Iew</hi> expounds
them in somthing different words, viz. <hi>the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of whose production have been from of old,</hi> and
who hath been from long time soretold of and
promised. But the same answer will serve to all
these, that we may not let go the plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the words, which our Translation gives
us, as an evident proof of Christs eternal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and so of his Divinity, seeing he that is
Eternal must confessedly be God. Our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
will best be framed by taking the words
in order, and first that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Motsaothaw,</hi> rendred <hi>whose goings forth,</hi> doth
manifestly and properly so signifie it cannot be
denied, and that it necessarily implies, in the
Person of whom it is spoken, an having been
or gone forth actually, when or before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
spake these words. In the former words
where he speaks of his being born in after
time (which was to come to pass after the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
this Prophecy) he puts the Future tense
[<hi>shall come forth,</hi>] but here speaking of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth, which was before that time from of
old, the preter tence must needs be understood,
and is well supplied in our Translation, by
[<hi>have been,</hi>] the Verb substantive being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the usual property of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
language not expressed but understood. We
say it is well supplied by the tense denoting the
time past; for the future can here have no
place: it will be no sense to say a thing shall
be from of old: that would be to confound past
and to come in one. This going forth having
been from of old, cannot be said to have been
made good, by the being of the person spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in his ancestors loins, nor by the causes
of his being having been of old. That would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101621:33"/>
note only that there was then a possibillity of
his coming forth, not be properly called an
actual going forth, as it is here called, no
more then 'twould be proper to say, that in
<hi>Adam's</hi> time all Men had their goings forth, or
were then born &amp; in actual beings, because they
were all then in <hi>Adam's</hi> loins, and there were
then causes which should in after times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them. To say then that the person here
spoken of had his goings forth, because he was
to come forth out of the family of <hi>David,</hi> after
this was spoken, can be no proper exposition
of this word, because it denotes goings forth
that had actually been, not that were to come.
Neither if he had been actually born in <hi>Davids</hi>
time, or any of hisancestors before him (although
neither he nor any of his ancestors are here
expressed) could this make good what follows
in the next words, <hi>from of old, from everlasting,</hi>
or, <hi>from daies of Eternity.</hi> But then the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of those words also must be vindicated
from the glosses of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who would have
them to signify only <hi>from some long time ago,</hi> (some
hundreds of years) and not <hi>from Eternity,</hi> or
before time properly so called. We say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that as the words here used, (to wit, <gap reason="foreign">

if these words singly, any of them, may denote
Eternity; how much more, being all put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in that order as here, must they increase
and heighten the signification; and shew that,
of the person here spoken of, as having actual
goings forth, the nature of which is so describ'd
when the words were spoken, they are in the
most improv'd signification to be taken? Which
will be farther confirmed by adding that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which is not only urged by<note n="r" place="bottom">Tarnovius, Glassius, Hacspan.</note> divers
Christians, but suggested by that<note n="s" place="bottom">Kimchi.</note> 
                     <hi>Iew</hi> himself,
who most earnestly endeavours to deprive us of
this proof for Christs being God of the substance
of the Father, coëternal with his Father. To this
he argues, That the Christians concluding from
these words, that Jesus is God, because he had
his goings forth from of old, &amp;c. and their
saying, Who is from daies of old but God? is
false, because God was before the daies of old;
And whereas they say his goings forth were
from of old, from daies of <hi>Olam,</hi> (age or long
ago) implies that then he went forth; but
God is ancient, (or, Eternal) without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
And what is said from <hi>Olam to Olam,</hi> i.e.
<hi>from age or antiquity, and to age, thou art God,</hi>
signifies from before age or the World, as he
saith there, <hi>before the Mountains were brought
forth:</hi> and so what is said, <hi>Proverbs</hi> VIII. 23.
<hi>I was set up Meolam, from Olam, or Age, or
Antiquity,</hi> is, <hi>before Olam, or Age, or the World,</hi>
as he there adds <hi>or ever the Earth was.</hi> In this
his obscure way of arguing is to be observed,
that he misreports the opinion of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as if they said, Then, in age or ancient time,
Christ went forth (i.e. had his beginning and
was not before) whereas God had no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
whereas we do not say so, but that he
had his going forth or emanation from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his Eternal generation without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of time, or priority; but so as that he is
coëternal with the Father. And so what he saith,
as if we give to Christ a beginning of his going
forth, comes to nothing, as a meer fiction of his
own. But what he adds, is that which makes
whollyto our advantage, i.e. that the prepositive
letter or Particle <hi>Mim,</hi> which is here put to
these words, may be, and in the places cited
ought to be understood, as signifying not only
<hi>from,</hi> but <hi>before.</hi> And so then may it here also be

understood, and so is<note n="t" place="bottom">Hacspan. Tarnovius, Glassius.</note> by divers learned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
and will so prevent any advantage, that
may by any be taken from attributing here to
<hi>Kedem, of old,</hi> or, <hi>Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by rendring it, <hi>before what was of old,</hi> or, <hi>the

or age began,) which then will be all one with
<hi>from everlasting;</hi> and so our conclusion still be
confirmed, that the person here described by
his goings forth, of that nature as the words ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
require, must be Eternal. No other
sense will agree to the words spoken of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
forth, which were in actual being when
the Prophet spake this; nor can they agree to
any that then were not in being, as hath been
shewed. And that the words are to be applied
to our Lord Christ, &amp; were spoken of him, hath
been also shewed. All the cavils and objections
of the <hi>Iews</hi> have nothing in them that may
shake our Principles, or weaken our belief in
him, but rather confirm them; and at once
shew, with what vain hopes they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
while they will have these words to be
a promise of a <hi>Messiah,</hi> and yet, denying the true
<hi>Messiah,</hi> in whom they are fully made good,
expect one by vertue of them, to whom they
can by no means agree, viz. one who had had
no actual goings forth, when these words were
spoken, nor yet hath, and they do not expect
that he should have, till he take his whole
actual being, as other Men do, at the time of
his birth, being till then only in the loins of his
ancient stock: whereas these words cannot be
verified of any person, but such a one as may
say, as Christ of himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> VIII. 58. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Abraham was</hi> (much more before <hi>David,</hi>
yea, before <hi>Adam,</hi> before the ancientest of times)
<hi>I am,</hi> by an Eternal being. Out of what
hath been said may likewise appear, (although
<hi>Calvin</hi> doth not deny that Christs Eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Divinity may hence be proved,) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity
of another exposition,<note n="u" place="bottom">Calvin. Bren.</note> by some, though
interpreting the words concerning Christ, so
expressed, as to give advantage to the <hi>Iews,</hi> viz.
that these goings forth of Christ, are still to be
understood, as the former words, of his being
made Man and born at <hi>Bethleem,</hi> which is said to
have been from daies of Eternity, because from
all Eternity it was decreed, that there in time he
should be born. But, why these goings forth,
from of old, from everlasting, which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
spoken of is said to have had when this
was spoken, cannot be the same with that
coming forth which he should have afterwards
in time to come, out of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> by being born
there, hath been shewed. Again, it cannot with
any propriety of speech be said, That Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
maketh things actually to have been, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever they were produced in the time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
for their production, (except other
circumstances make it necessary so to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it, as according to some <hi>Revelations</hi> XIII.
8. but of that place, see Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who
otherwise understands it.) Though by virtue
thereof all things are present to God, and as
certain to be as if they already were; yet it
will not be language intelligible to Men, by
taking away all distinction of times, to say,
such a Man hath been already born into the
World, because God hath decreed he should
be born. Add, that if it were sufficient so to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the words, here would be nothing
more said of this eminent person here signally
pointed out, by some great thing peculiar to
him, by which he should be known and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from all others, then might be said of
any other ever after born in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> of all
which it might be also verified, that their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
forth thence had been from of old, &amp;c.
because their ancestors lived there, and God had
decreed they should be born there. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
then cannot be sufficient or satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Whosoever will soberly and seriously and
without partiality consider the words, shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in this verse, the person spoken of (who
is Christ the true only <hi>Messiah</hi>) described,
by a twofold emanation, coming, or going forth;
the first in order of the words his birth as Man,
in time, after this Prophecy uttered, at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem;</hi>
the other his Eternal emanation or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the Father, which he had when this
was spoken, and from all Eternity, before
the beginning of time or daies properly so
called. The first of these though singular to
him, in that it was without concurrence of an
Earthly Father, yet in this common to him
with others, in that he was born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in time, and in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and so shews
him to be a Man: but the other wholly pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to himself and distinguishing him from all
others, because it was from Eternity before all
time, and so shews him to be God Eternal and
one with the Father. Before we pass from
the words, one thing more may be observed,
to wit, concerning the wonderful aptness and
suitableness of the word, <gap reason="foreign">

of him who is called the word of God, of

the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God, the same was in the beginning with
God. All things were made by him, &amp;c.</hi> Which

being Eternal with the Father, and gave certain
evidence and demonstration of that his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

This the latter <hi>Iews</hi> cite, but do not much insist

(<note n="e" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> saith one) by tradition from the daies of

time of a Womans going with Child. But
seeing they labour not farther to inquire, or
cannot tell us, what their ancestors meant, it
will not concern us to trouble our selves about
it; but rather to look, what Expositions they
themselves give. Such are, First,<note n="f" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> That God
will leave <hi>Israel,</hi> or deliver them to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
till their condition shall be like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of one that is with Child, near her time
of bringing forth; and then shall the (promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
ruler, and his near relations appear, and
return to be, or become a ruler over the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel,</hi> as he saith, and <hi>the remnant of
his Brethren shall return unto the Children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
Or, as<note n="g" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi. Michlal yophi.</note> Others express it, In the day of
Salvation (when God will bring Salvation to
<hi>Israel</hi>) he shall deliver them into great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so that pangs shall take hold of them, as
pangs of a Woman in travail, as he saith in
<hi>Daniel</hi> XII. 1. <hi>and there shall be a time of trouble,
such as never was since there was a Nation even
to that same timethen the remnant of his Brethren,</hi>
i. e. of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> i. e. the Tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> which were left, when the ten
Tribes were led captive, <hi>shall return unto,</hi> i. e.
with, <hi>the Children of Israel,</hi> the ten Tribes, viz.
they and these, all of them shall return to their
Land, and the King <hi>Messiah</hi> shall rule over
them. Or, as<note n="h" place="bottom">Abarbinel.</note> another saith, the ten Tribes
shall go up first into the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> to war
against the Christians, and other People of
the East, and North, and then their Brethren
of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> shall return, or come
unto them, according to his fanciful explication
of the foregoing verse.</p>
                  <p>The construction of the words according to
this exposition must be with a supply, <hi>unto a
time like the time of her</hi> [i. e. a Woman]
<hi>that bringeth forth</hi> [or was with Child] <hi>&amp; hath
brought forth.</hi> But this supply of <hi>like the time</hi>
is harsh, and hath no grounds for it; as neither
to say, that this denotes a time of sorrow and
pangs. Those are yet while she is in travail, and
hath not yet passed her labour, and brought
forth. When she hath once brought forth, and
is delivered of the Child; <hi>her anguish is turned
into joy, because</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">Joh. XVI. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>a Man is born into the World.</hi>
And here is nothing in these words, that signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
pain or anguish, but it is only said word
for word, <hi>untill the time that she that beareth
hath brought forth.</hi> Secondly,<note n="k" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> another expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
by some of them given, is, by expounding
<hi>He</hi> not of the Lord, but of the ruler promised
to come forth out of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and the word,
<hi>shall give them up,</hi> by <hi>shall permit,</hi> or <hi>suffer,</hi>
or <hi>leave,</hi> or <hi>let alone,</hi> (as it is used <hi>Gen.</hi> XX. 6.
<hi>therefore suffered I thee not to touch her,</hi> word for
word <hi>gave I thee not, &amp;c.</hi>) Thus the <hi>Messiah</hi>
shall suffer them, i. e. shall defer his coming
to them [or helping of them] till such a time,
as in the former explication. Or, as Thirdly,
Others give the meaning, <hi>Till the time that she
that beareth hath brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orth,</hi> i. e. till the
time of birth be come, the time of appearance
for him, and them; according to what

is born, &amp;c.</hi> or, as he saith, <hi>Isaiah</hi> LXVI.

Or, yet Fourthly somthing different, as

saith, chap. IV. 10. <hi>be in pain and labour to
bring forth, O Daughter of Zion, like a Woman in
travail,</hi> and that in <hi>Isa.</hi> I.XVI. which we have
seen, without farther explication of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this bringing forth: and then, that the
meaning of the words, <hi>and the remnant of his

is, that they all shall be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

[the name of] <hi>Israel,</hi> and shall not be
any more as two Nations, nor any more divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

have we from the <hi>Iews,</hi> which we have thus

concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> in which is the

it may be said, that we follow our own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without taking notice of what they say.</p>
                  <p>Now as for Christian expositours there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them also great difference in giving the
meaning of this verse,<note n="m" place="bottom">Calvin.</note> Some of giving it, as
if it should signify, That therefore, because
things should be so ordered, as before spoken,
by God, he would give up the <hi>Iews</hi> for a

afflictions should have a joyful issue, as the
sorrows of a Woman in travail, which when
she hath brought forth are turned into joy; and

remain in their Country being returned from
the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity, till the Church by
the preaching of the Gospel hath brought in
many Brethren of the Gentiles, as well as <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi>
in the time betwixt the passion of

look on as forced, yet is by Others preferred
before the rest, and will perhaps upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
be found the most simple proper and
genuine among them. To the farther expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of it may be premised, that the word
rendred <hi>therefore,</hi> may signifie also, <hi>but yet,
notwithstanding,</hi> or <hi>nevertheless,</hi> agreeable to its
signification in the <hi>Arabick</hi> tongue, and as<note n="u" place="bottom">R. Tanchum on Hos. II. 14.</note>

which is to bring him forth hath there brought
forth, will he give them up to be afflicted, and
troubled, and not presently show to them his
promised Salvation in full manner: but then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he is come forth and manifested, his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the converted Gentiles by Faith being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and so Brothers
to this ruler, and<note n="x" place="bottom">Deodat.</note> to the true <hi>Israel,</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto him, and be all together faithful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and members of his Kingdom, <hi>and he
shall stand, and feed</hi> or, rule them all, &amp;c. Or
else, Though God hath certainly decreed and
promised to give Salvation unto <hi>Israel,</hi> by him
whose goings forth have been from of old,
from everlasting; yet he hath determined with
all, that he shall come forth unto him out of
<hi>Bethlehem:</hi> and therefore notwithstanding the
certainty of this Salvation by him promised,
it shall not presently be manifested to them, but
he will defer it, till she that should bring him
forth, hath there brought him forth; and then
shall it be manifested by his calling into his
Kingdom the remnant of his Brethren, the
Heathen, that shall be converted to him, who
shall together with those of <hi>Israel</hi> turn unto
him, <hi>and he shall stand, and feed,</hi> or rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them <hi>in the strength of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
What is there in this explication that is forced
either as to the plain and proper signification of
the words, by all agreed on, or as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion?
And this Prophecy so understood will
well agree with that of <hi>Isaiah</hi> VII. 14. where,
as a sign of Salvation to them, and to point out
the time when it shall be brought to them, it
is said, <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive, and bear
a Son,</hi> which is the same that is here promised,
and said to have been made good by the blessed
Mother of Christ, her bringing him forth in
<hi>Bethleem, Mat.</hi> I. 22, 23. These two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> lived at the same time,
and in their Prophecies were directed by the
Spirit of God to speak sometimes the same
things, as appeareth by what we have seen,
chap. IV. 1, 2. and so both agree concerning
the birth of Christ of a Virgin, or Mother in
<hi>Bethleem,</hi> that he might be the Saviour of the
<hi>Israel</hi> of God all the World over: for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God was not only to <hi>Israel</hi> according
to the flesh, <hi>but to all also that were afar off, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as many as the Lord our God should call, Acts</hi>
II. 39. and all these are called the remnant of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101621:35"/>
his brethren, even those that were before <hi>aliens
from the Common Wealth of Israel, and afar off,
are now in Christ made one with them, Eph.</hi> II.
12. &amp;c. all breathren among themselves, and
all Brethren to Christ their ruler. Having taken
on him their nature in the flesh, he is not asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to call them so, as the Apostle speaketh
<hi>Heb.</hi> II. 11. confirming it out of <hi>Psal.</hi> XXII.
22. where in the person of Christ he saith, <hi>I
will declare thy name unto my Brethren.</hi> And
there is no reason to take the name of Brethren
here in a narrower sense, then to comprehend
all the remnant, whom the Lord shall call, <hi>Ioel</hi>
II. 32. whether the <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to
restrain it with some only to the <hi>Iews,</hi> though
they were nigher of Kin to him according to
the flesh, and were first invited to come in. We
are taught of Christ himself to give the word
this latitude, when to the <hi>Iews</hi> who appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
that name to those who were meerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
unto him in the flesh, he gives answer,
that <hi>whosoever should believe in him, and do the
will of God, is his Brother, and Sister, and
Mother,</hi>

                  <p>But while we apply these words to our Lord
Christ, another<note n="e" place="bottom">R. Lipman in Nitzachon.</note> 
                     <hi>Iew</hi> steps in and endeavours
to raise cavils and objections out of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us. Having said that Christ is not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
as ruler by <hi>Israel,</hi> which hath been
already answered; he adds and argues from
what is said, <hi>in the Majesty of the name of the
Lord his God,</hi> that therefore he (here spoken
of) hath a God, and therefore is not himself
God: and if they say this is spoken of him as
Man, or in respect of his Manhood, Was Man
from of old, from everlasting? again, This King
hath Brothers; again. Is it not so that at his birth
no new thing happened? only they say that
at the hour of his Death he reigned. Further,
His Dominion is not to the ends of the Earth,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>His words are short, but so as his meaning
appears; and he thence infers that hence is
proved, that the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> is not yet
come. But these are sleight cavils, and signify
nothing to us, who profess that our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101621:36"/>
Christ the Son of God, is God and Man,
God of the substance of the Father begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Worlds, and Man of the substance of
his Mother born in the Word, perfect God
and perfect Man, equal to the Father as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Godhead, and inferiour to the Father
as touching his Manhood. In these words is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that may cross what we hold and believe,
but fully confirms it. In that the <hi>Messias</hi> here
spoken of had his goings forth from of old
from everlasting, it is manifest that he is God,
as hath been before shewed: in that he was in
time to come forth out of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and God
is called his God, and Men his Brethren, it is
manifest that he is also Man, partaker of flesh
and blood. But do we therefore say, that Man,
or flesh and blood was from everlasting, or
eternal? By no means, but that he that was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
God before time, was in time made Man,
and so though in the first respect one with the
Father, coequal to him, God himself, yet
in the latter respect, after him and inferiour
to him: so that one Christ is both God and Man,
yet without confusion of substance and natures.
So that if what is affirmed of him according to
one nature should be objected as not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the other, and so a proof against its
being in the same person, will be no more, then
if any should object against him that affirms,
the reasonable Soul of Man is incorruptible,
that therefore he affirms the body, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with that Soul makes one Man, to be also
incorruptible. As he is one God with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so is he the Lord and God of Men,
(as <hi>Thomas</hi> acknowledged him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XX. 28.)
as he is Man inferiour to the Father, so he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Men his Brethren, and their God his God.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> XX. 17.</p>
                  <p>Why he should here take occasion of object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that no new thing happened at his birth,
I know not. Had there not, it might be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to him, that<note n="f" place="bottom">Maimonides Yad. Tract. Melichim. cap. ult.</note> his own greatest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctors
tell him, that no new alteration in the World
ought to be expected at the coming of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
But we know there did happen such
strange things as never did at the birth of any
other, as (not to mention that he was born of
a Virgin without Father on Earth, as never any
other was) that strange star, the appearance
of which made those wise Men from the East
coming to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to ask without doubt or
more ado, <hi>Where is he that is born King of the
Iews? Mat.</hi> II. 1, 2. and that glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of the Angel, <hi>Luk.</hi> II. 10. proclaiming
to the Shepherds, <hi>I bring you tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all People, for unto you is born this
Day in the City of David</hi> (which is <hi>Bethleem</hi>
here spoken of, and the thing here spoken of
it) <hi>a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</hi> What
he adds, <hi>only at the hour of his Death</hi> (or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the hour of his Death, for his words
are obscure) <hi>they say that he reigned,</hi> seems to
intimate, as if he fancied that Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they could not avoid that objection, That
no strange thing happened at his birth, did
therefore date his Kingdom from his death;
or else that he upbraids us, that we say, that
he that was overcome by Death reigneth. Be his
meaning what it will, his objection is of no force
against us, who profess that Christ was both
born King, and all the time of his living on
Earth evidently shewed himself so, by such
means, as we have formerly seen; insomch
that <hi>Nathaniel</hi> convinced by what he saw,
plainly confesseth him so, <hi>Rabbi thou art the
Son of God, thou art the King of Israel, Ioh.</hi> i.
49. and the People not doubting of it, would
needs have taken him by force to make him a
temporal King as he shewed himself a spiritual
one, <hi>Ioh.</hi> VI. 15. besides their openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
him so, <hi>Mar.</hi> XI. 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> XIX. 38.
and that his Death whereto he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
did not (notwithstanding the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
scoffes of the chief among the <hi>Iews, Mat.</hi>
XXVII. 42. <hi>Marc.</hi> XV. 32.) evidence that
he was not a true King or put an end to his
Kingdom, but more advanced it, and did but
serve to draw his Subjects (even a great part
of the World) <hi>all Men unto him, Ioh.</hi> XII.
32. And at that too, as ignominious as they
sought to make it, happened such strange and
unusual things, as made the centurion, and those
that were with him watching Jesus, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
him not an ordinary King, but to say, <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this was the Son of God, Mat.</hi> XXVII. 54.
<hi>Marc.</hi> XV. 36. So far was he from having his
power lessened by his Death, that by it he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame
Death it self, and <hi>destroyed him, that
had the power of it, that is the Devil, Heb.</hi> II.
14. <hi>and in his Cross triumphed over them,</hi> and all
infernal powers, <hi>openly</hi> and discernably to all
that would not shut their eyes, <hi>Coll.</hi> II. 15.
Then his resurrection after his Death (<hi>that not
being able to hold him, Act.</hi> II. 24.) which
he made evident by so many waies, as we find
in the Gospels, and by appearing so many
times, and to so many witnesses, (as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 4, 5. &amp;c.) and then his
ascending visibly into Heaven in the sight of his
Apostles, <hi>Acts I. 9. Mar.</hi> XVI. 19. make
it most evident, <hi>that the same Iesus, whom they
crucified, God made both Lord and Christ, Acts</hi>
XXI. 36. and that he is the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the ruler
in <hi>Israel</hi> here prophecied of, and that we are
to look for no other. But saith he, <hi>his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is not unto the ends of the Earth.</hi> Here call we
in the whole World to witness against him.
He living in <hi>Germany</hi> (far enough from the
land of <hi>Israel</hi>) could not but know how far
and wide over the face of the Earth the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Christ hath spread it self, and in how
many Nations he is acknowledged as Lord,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101621:36"/>
and King, and his name adored, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
so that he would not have made this cavil,
except he had willingly stopt his ears, and shut
his eyes, or would not understand what he
heard, or perceive what he saw; such obstinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth his way of arguing discover. There is
nothing therefore in what he hath said, that
may take us off from applying these words of
the Prophecy hitherto to our Lord Christ, and
affirming them to be all in him fulfilled in their
true and utmost meaning. His cavils out of the

saying that the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> is not yet

it to them, and left it with them, Ioh.</hi> XIV. 27.
So that well might it be said of him by way of
Prophecy, <hi>This Man shall be peace,</hi> or, <hi>the peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this supply of the person may seem as
agreeable to the meaning of the words as any.</p>
                  <p>But then of us, i. e. of Christians, who thus
understand the words as affirming that our
Lord Jesus Christ <hi>shall be peace,</hi> or, <hi>the peace,</hi>
may be demanded by the <hi>Iews</hi> or others, what
peace we mean; or, how that peace, which
we say he is the Author and establisher of, may
agree with that description, which is given of
it in this and the following verse, to wit, such
as should be made good by repelling the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
by <hi>raising against him seven Shepherds,
and eight principal Men,</hi> by <hi>wasting the land of
Assyria with the Sword, and the land of Nimrod,
&amp;c.</hi> and by <hi>delivering from the Assyrian, &amp;c.</hi>
To which we have to answer, that these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
are figurative, and so the litteral signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of every word is not nicely to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, so we may but have the whole
meaning appositly given.</p>
                  <p>That diverse expressions of such benefits as
were promised to be made good under the
<hi>Messiah</hi> are figuratively to be taken, is that
which cannot be denied, and by the learnedst
of<note n="k" place="bottom">Maim. in Melac. cap. ult. &amp; in his Epistle of the Resurrection.</note> the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves confessed: as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101621:37"/>
that which is likewise a description of
the peace by him to be effected, <hi>that</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">Esa. XI. 6. &amp;c. Heb. II. 14. 1 Cor. XV. 57.</note> 
                     <hi>the
Wolfe shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard
lie down with the Kid, the Calfe with the young
Lion, and a little Child should lead them, &amp;c.
and the Lion should eat straw with the Oxe, &amp;c.</hi>
and all this should be because <hi>the Earth should
be full of the knowledge of the Lord,</hi> which none
will say those beasts are capable of, or expect
there should be such a strange change in their
nature. And it must therefore be confessed,
that the expressions are figurative, and denote
only that great change in the natures and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of Men which shall be wrought by the
Doctrine of Christ, and that mutual accord in
love and meekness which thereby they shall be
disposed to. And why may not these words be
understood so too, i. e. figuratively? They
must needs so be, if we read, <hi>This Man shall be
peace,</hi> that is, the peace here described shall be
wrought by the <hi>Messiah</hi> (for reasons which will
by and by appear.) And so figuratively taken,
what do they but, under the type of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
temporal peace to the <hi>Iews,</hi> represent to
us that more excellent spiritual peace, that
comprehensive blessing of peace with God,
peace among themselves (and as far as in them
lies, peace with all Men) and peace within
themselves, not to be disturbed by the assaults
of any enemies thereof, which is by Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his Church and the members thereof,
the Subjects of his Kingdom, and wrought by
the preaching of the Gospel, maugre all that
shall oppose it?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were then the
known Enemies of the <hi>Iews,</hi> such as invaded
their land, and trod in, or entred into their pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and wasted all things; if now God should
raise unto them any, under whose conduct
they should not only repel those Enemies, but
pursue them, and wast their land, and wholly
subject them so as that they should no more
have cause to fear them, would not this be a very
great blessing, a bringing in and establishment
of a most desirable peace, and a thing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
in their eyes, the greatest they could
then wish for? By representing this therefore
to them to be done, he figures out that greater
blessing, that desirable peace, which that <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
whom in the foregoing words he had
promised, and described, should be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of, &amp; make good by conquest of more mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and potent Enemies then the <hi>Assyrian</hi>
or <hi>Chaldean,</hi> even Satan himself with all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
host (whom with his own weapons and
in his own territories he hath vanquished;
<hi>through Death <hi rend="sup">m</hi> having destroyed him that had the
power of death,</hi> and given to his the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Death, and the sting of it, sin) and <hi>the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
and powers and rulers of the darkness of
this World and spiritual wickedness in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Eph.</hi> VI. 12. and all the World that lies
in wickedness, and the Enemies of the truth
which with unappeasable malice constantly
seek to invade the Church and infest the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof, and to disturb their peace. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all these, and all that can be named, will
he secure it to them, and continually raise up
such a sufficient number of such as shall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his truth and beat down whatsoever shall
oppose it, and furnish them with the irresistible
power of his spirit for that end, so that none
shall be able to take from his that true peace
which he giveth. With him is power also to
secure to his an outward peace, and to raise
up such as shall bring under all that shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that also.</p>
                  <p>And this also he often doth by wonderful
means, as he seeth most for his glory and the
good of his Church. But that we do not look
on as the thing here principally meant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
but that spiritual peace of a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature, which we have spoken of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what he promiseth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVI. 33.
<hi>that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therefore to <hi>to be of good chear, because he hath
overcome the world;</hi> which words of his seem
a summary of what is here spoken and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
of.</p>
                  <p>If any of such who so read the words, <hi>This
Man shall be peace,</hi> that is, the <hi>Messiah,</hi> like
not of this way of expounding them, but say,
whether <hi>Iews</hi> or others, that under the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> they ought according to the proper
sound of the letter to be fulfilled,<note n="n" place="bottom">On Micah v.</note> St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
teacheth us thus to argue with them, These
things spoken here as to be effected by <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
are either fulfilled, or yet to be expected
and not fulfilled. If they say they be fulfilled,
let them give us the History thereof by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of ancient Books confirmed, and tell us
when the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were ever
subjected to the <hi>Iews,</hi> conquered and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them; (we may add, if they say they are,
let them then confess that the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who
they confess was to be the authour of that
peace, by the conquest of those Enemies, and
delivering them from them, is already come.)
But 'tis not likely, that they will say this. If
then they say that they are not yet fulfilled,
nor <hi>Messiah</hi> yet come, as they do,<note n="o" place="bottom">Judaei in adventu Christi quem sibi si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulant haec omnia juxta literam futura esse contendunt, Hieronymus. &amp; see R. Sol. Jarchi, &amp; R. D. Kimchi &amp; Abarbinel.</note> but that
they expect that they shall be, according to the
sound of the letter, fulfilled when he shall come,
and that if the <hi>Assyrian</hi> shall offer to invade
them, (as in the Prophets time he did) the
<hi>Messiah</hi> with his Princes and chieftains, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
here by seven Shepherds, and eight prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Men, shall so subd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e them, as to deliver
them from all further fear of annoiance from
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101621:37"/>
them, we then demand, Where are their pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in any land, that they may call their own,
for the <hi>Assyrian</hi> to enter into and tread in?
Where (if they had such) any <hi>Assyrians</hi>
(they being so long since cut off from being a
Nation) to tread in them? Shall the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
that he may fulfill these things according to
the letter, build up for them palaces, which
may be troden in, and raise <hi>Assyrians</hi> out of
the dust, who have so long ceased to be a known
Nation, to come and tread in them, that so he
may drive them out of <hi>Israels</hi> land, and waste
theirs with the Sword? This would be such a
strange miraculous change in the course of the
World, as the greatest of their Doctors (as we
have said) will not admit them to expect at the
coming of the <hi>Messiah:</hi> and for this reason is
it that, as above we intimated, these words
must necessarily be understood figuratively, if
understood as to be effected by Christ, because
that before his coming these Nations, viz.
<hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> had been so utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
as not to be reckoned among Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
much less to be in any such power as to
invade the land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and annoy them in
hostile manner: and much more now stands
the case so.</p>
                  <p>This objection seems<note n="p" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> to one among the
<hi>Iews</hi> (no less learned nor observant of his own
advantages then others) so evidently pressing
and so unanswerable, that he plainly professeth,
that what is here spoken cannot be looked on
as a promise of things yet to come, and to be
expected: There is, saith he, no signification (or
place) for a promise that <hi>Assur</hi> (or the <hi>Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>)
shall in time to come be cut off or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Sword, seeing they are perished and
cut off already, so that there is now no remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of them, by which they are known to be:
and this makes him look after other waies, by
which the words may be expounded, so as not
to suspend their fulfilling on the coming of
the <hi>Messiah;</hi> as first, not referring the word
<hi>this</hi> to the person before spoken of, or what is
before said of him, but to what is after in the
following words described, and so supplying
<hi>thing,</hi> or <hi>time,</hi> viz. <hi>this thing shall be our peace,</hi> or
<hi>the condition of our peace, at that time by this shall
our peace be procured,</hi> or <hi>established,</hi> viz. <hi>that
when the Assyrian shall come, &amp;c. then we shall
raise, &amp;c.</hi> So making it a consolation to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
in those daies, who stood in fear of the
Kings of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and were threatned that
they should be led into captivity by them, but
are here promised (to fortifie them against that
fear and put an end to it) that after that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nation should rise up against them (that is,
against the <hi>Assyrians</hi>) with many Princes and
commanders, who should revenge their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
on them, intimating, that the King of the
<hi>Chaldeans</hi> should prevail over them and destroy
them; as, saith he, it is expresly foretold in the
Prophecies of the Prophets in many places, and
as it was actually brought to pass: (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
this promise can signify nothing, if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
of the many commanders and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the forementioned ruler, as if they
should with their Sword destroy those, who
were already destroyed, long before that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
was born.) Or else he saith, there may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

<hi>shall come into our Land,</hi> viz. that there shall rise

it from Grammar rules concerning

                  <p>This <hi>Rabbin</hi> plainly denies and takes away
from those of his own Nation and sect all
ground of any argument from these words,
whereby they would prove against Christians,
that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is not yet come, because that
is not done by our Lord Christ, which they
expect should be done by the <hi>Messiah;</hi> but
doth not in his expositions say any thing which
may contradict what we believe, that our
Lord is the <hi>Messiah</hi> spoken of in the foregoing
verses, and that all that by vertue of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
was to be expected from the <hi>Messiah</hi> hath
had it's due accomplishment, though he do not
look on these present words as spoken of his
person; in which some among Christians agree
with him also, and do not understand by <hi>this,</hi>
this Man, or person, but<note n="a" place="bottom">Drusius, Grotius.</note> Some taking it for
a note of time, <hi>This time shall be a time of peace,</hi>
or, <hi>then shall be peace and prosperity, when,</hi> i.e.
after, the <hi>Assyrian and Chaldean shall have inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
our Land, &amp;c. for then we shall raise,</hi> (to wit
by our praiers to God) <hi>against him seven
Shepherds,</hi> viz. <hi>Cyrus</hi> with other Kings, <hi>and
eight principal Men,</hi> viz. great Peers or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

shall subdue with their weapons the Land of Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
and Babylon,</hi> and free us, so that we shall
not any more fear their coming into our Land,
and treading in our borders, as we did before.
Others not much from the same purpose, so
joining that particle with <hi>peace,</hi> as to denote
the condition of it, as after described, viz.
<note n="b" place="bottom">See LXX. and see Christ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Army, which invaded <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
by the Angel of the Lord (they might add,
and of his Kingdom by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>) and of
the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> who sacked <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and led
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101621:38"/>
them captives, by <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> and those
many Princes with them (whom by their
Praiers to God they raised up, that they might
perform this work) who subdued and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Chaldea.</hi> And then some
take it as to the connexion to depend on what
went before, viz. <hi>For now shall he be great
unto the ends of the Earth,</hi> as if this here were
promised before hand to come to pass<note n="c" place="bottom">Idem ex Theo.</note> as a
pledge of that promise of Christ and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that seeing this come to pass, they might
not doubt of that.</p>
                  <p>But if this exposition be followed, the words
should seem rather to have respect to what is
before promised, chap. IV. 10. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Among all these expositions, that of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
first of all mentioned is most followed, and
(as we have shewed) hath nothing in it why
it should be excepted against; but withal there
is no danger in following any of the rest, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that only of such of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who expect
yet a literal fulfilling of these things by the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> and would therefore prove him not
to be yet come, because they are not yet so
fulfilled. The vanity and absurdity of which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
hath been sufficiently shewed, and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident.</p>
                  <p>Having thus at large spoken of different
opinions concerning the meaning of these two
verses in general, occasioned chiefly by their
different applying of the first word <hi>This,</hi> it will
be convenient to look more particularly into
the import of some other of the words in them,
to see how they are, or may be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to those different meanings, that we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
judge thereof.</p>

<hi>and the Land of the Assyrian,</hi> and <hi>the Land of

said they should maugre all the opposition of
most potent Enemies, however true it is in it
self, yet may perhaps to some not seem to be
of that weight, as that it may be much pressed
or insisted on as a necessary meaning of the
words undeniably concluded from them.</p>
                  <p>These, who ever they be, it is said shall be
raised against him, i. e. against the Enemy,

would alter nothing in the scope and meaning

Shepherds and Princes, is signified, that this

Shepherds or Princes, which were Men, could
be; so that it shall be abundantly sufficient that
they have him to oppose against all Enemies,
and in confidence of that they are introduced as
supposing themselves to have such forces.</p>

                  <p>If it be rendred <hi>Swords,</hi> then to say <hi>with
their own Swords,</hi> will be as much as to say,
they shall turn their own Swords upon them, or
conquer them with their own weapons, such
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101621:39"/>
as they find in their own Land, for the word
with that affixe which it hath put to it, will
literally sound, <hi>with the Swords of it,</hi> that is,
of their own Land, and not <hi>with their Swords,</hi> i. e.
the Swords of the Conquetours; or else (as one
<note n="b" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> notes in a little different signification of the
word, which he supposeth it to have) <hi>with the
edges of that Sword mentioned,</hi> for so he thinks the
word also to signifie <hi>the mouth,</hi> or <hi>edges of the
Sword.</hi> So as that the meaning may be, They shal
deal with their land or with them according to
their own dealings, so make use of the Sword
toward them, as they have used it towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
If it be rendred <hi>entrances,</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Idem.</note> then will the
meaning be, that they shall conquer their Land,
and slay them in their own gates, and entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their own Country.</p>
                  <p>Yet some of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who are for a literal
interpretation of the words, and a fulfilling
them accordingly, will not have it so far lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
understood, as that they should by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of what is said, destroy and cut them off
with the Sword; for, saith<note n="d" place="bottom">Abarbinel.</note> one of them, the
Prophet here promiseth peace and not war,
and therefore the meaning only is, that they
shall openly and manifestly every where rule
over them in their Land and Cities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="e" place="bottom">R. Lipman.</note> Another of them saith, that by Swords
here spoken of are to be understood those pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
that should come on them, viz. the
<hi>Assyrians,</hi> from Heaven by vertue of the
praiers of <hi>Israel,</hi> according to what is said,
<hi>Isa.</hi> XXXI. <hi>then shall the Assyrian fall with
the Sword, not of a mighty Man, and the
Sword not of a mean Man shall devour him,
&amp;c.</hi> viz. because he was destroyed by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
So that though hence may seem to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that even after the coming of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
there shall be Wars, yet it is probable,
that these seven Shepherds and eight Princes
of Men, shall have no need of using the Sword
against <hi>Assur;</hi> so that they themselves here do
not think that the literal signification of every
word ought strictly to be insisted on.</p>
                  <p>But according to that figurative acception
of the words imbraced by most Christians,
which we in the first place mentioned, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will be evident, That by the might and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Christ, and such as shall be by him quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and commissioned for the spreading and
maintaing of his truth, all that oppose it shall
be brought under and made to yield as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
as when an Enemy (such as the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
then was to <hi>Israel</hi>) is by many comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and their forces beaten in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and with his own Weapons, forced from
him and turned back upon himself, so that he
shall not be able to create farther disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he shall deliver,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Messiah</hi> or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

<hi>the Remnant according to the election of grace,
Rom.</hi> XI. 5. those whom our Saviour calls
<hi>his little Flock, Luk.</hi> XII. 32. by a title well
answerable to this of remnant of <hi>Iacob,</hi> or in a
word to the whole Church and true members
thereof, which in respect to the many, that are
out of it, are but a remnant, and that remnant
a remnant of <hi>Iacob,</hi> though not all according
to the flesh sprung from him (as the first of
them who were called were) yet all by faith
the <hi>Israel</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>To this remnant (how ever taken) are here
great promises made, and peculiar priviledges
attributed, and those set forth under two si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes
of differing nature in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
in one they being compared to Dew,
in the other to a Lion. 1. <hi>They shall be in the midst
of many People, as the dew from the Lord, as the
showers upon the Grass, &amp;c.</hi> Of these words are
two somewhat different expositions given, the
one of which maketh them a description of the
condition of that remnant of <hi>Iacob</hi> in respect to
themselves, how it shall be with them by the
blessing of God; the other in respect to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or how they shall be to others among whom
they are; the first<note n="p" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi, Abarbinel, Munster, Grotius, Deodati.</note> attributing those latter
words, <hi>that tarrieth not for Man, &amp;c.</hi> as an
Epithet not to <hi>grasse,</hi> but to <hi>Dew from the Lord
and showers upon the grass,</hi> and maketh out the
meaning to this purpose; That as the dew and
bigger rain, which falleth on the grass, is only
from God, and<note n="q" place="bottom">Compare Psal. 110. &amp; 3. and see Flac. Illyr. &amp; Rayan.</note> so disposed of as he will,
without Mans help or disposal, so the remnant
of <hi>Iacob</hi> shall depend only on God, and his
goodness, not on Mans help, or contrivance, or
assistance, and by his help and blessing shall in
the midst of many People, many Enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassing
and exposing them, be yet preserved
and maintained, so as still to subsist and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
to encrease to the admiration of those
many that shall behold them. According to this
exposition it will not perhaps be amiss (as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
of<note n="r" place="bottom">Calvin.</note> great note observeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by <hi>dew,</hi> or <hi>rain on
grass,</hi> to understand grass, or fields of grass,
nourished, or refreshed by <hi>dew and rain,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help and cultivations of Men, by the
sole hand and blessing of God.</p>
                  <p>The second way of exposition is, by referring
those words <hi>that tarrieth not for Man,</hi> to the
grass, by Gods watering it with dew and rain
from Heaven, cherished and caused to grow
and flourish; and so the meaning will be,<note n="s" place="bottom">Vatab. edit. 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> &amp; 8<hi rend="sup">to</hi> Ribera, Menoch. Dutch Notes Christ. à Castro.</note> that
that blessed remnant shall be in the midst of
those many People, among whom they are
dispersed, by whom they are entertained, and
received, and hearkned to, as beneficial to them,
as dew from the Lord, as showers on the grass,
which cause them to grow, and flourish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of Man; their Doctrine <hi>shall drop
on them as rain, their speech distill as the dew,
as the small rain on the tender herbs, as the showers
on the grass. Deut.</hi> XXXII. 2. so they by
their Heavenly Doctrine and good example
and communicating of Spiritual blessings, shall
cause them, who are otherwise as uncultivated
herbs and plants, to grow in grace and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the house of God, and bring forth fruit
unto him only by his blessing, and not by any
art of Man; Or, (as<note n="t" place="bottom">Abarbinel.</note> a learned <hi>Iew</hi> thinks
the words may be expounded) without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
reward from Men. To which may be
added perhaps not unfitly, that they shall be thus
beneficial to all among whom they live, by
drawing down Gods blessings on them for their
sakes, as <hi>Laban</hi> confessed, that God blessed
him for Jacobs sake, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXX. 27. and by
coaling and mitigating Gods wrath, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
would speedily burn them up, if these
were away, as the moistning dew and showers
preserve the grass and herbs from the scorching
of the Sun (see <hi>Gen.</hi> XVIII. 26, &amp;c. and XIX.
22. and <hi>Mat.</hi> XXIV. 22. <hi>Mark</hi> XIII, 20.)
This may be looked on as comprehended in,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101621:40"/>
though not the main intention of, the words.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Iewish</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="bottom">Abarbinel.</note> Doctor expounding these words
in this manner also, viz. as describing how
the remnant spoken of shall be in behaviour
towards these many People in the midst of
which they are, makes the meaning of them
to be, That they shall be loving to, and deal
kindly with, those that deal courteously with
them, and do good to them, as dew doth to the
grass, and that of their own good nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect to profit or reward: to them, he
means, and to them alone, being of contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
to others, as will appear by what he
saith on the next words. And if this be all, that
he thinks meant, surely he falleth far short of
showing the duty and property of true <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
(who by this remnant are meant) who
are taught to <hi>do good to all Men, Galat.</hi> VI.
10. <hi>to love not only those that love them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
even their Enemies,</hi> and <hi>to good to them that
hate them. Mat.</hi> V. 44. <hi>that they may be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of their Heavenly Father, who sendeth rain
on the just, and on the unjust.</hi> so must they be
as the dew from the Lord, and as rain by him
given in the midst of many People, striving to
extend their good to all those many, that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as are capable of receiving good by them
may receive it. Mean while he may suggest to
us another property, which the comparing
them to dew and showers requires in them,
viz. softness and gentleness in their behaviour,
in the midst of those, or amongst those, that
will receive them, and hear them; which will
the better bring us to the consideration of what
is meant in the second similitude, which is,
<hi>that they shall be as a Lion, &amp;c.</hi> They, which
shall be gentle and soft in their behaviour, as
communicative of all good to those that will
receive the truth, shall against all that oppose
it, though many and strong, be of a Lionlike
courage, and by God be enabled with power
to beat and tread down all before them, and
prevail over them, so as none may resist them,
as a Lion doth over the beasts of the forrest,
and a young Lion over the flocks of the Sheep.
This their power may well be described by the
words of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 4, 5, 6. in
that by the <hi>weapons of their Warfare, which are
not carnal, but mighty through God to the pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of strong holds, they cast down imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and every high thing that exalteth it self
against the knowledge of God, and bring into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ:</hi> so
hath Christ promised to them, <hi>a mouth and
wisdom, which all their adversaries shall not be
able to resist, Luk.</hi> XXI. 15. This was made
good in the Apostles, and such as have since
succeeded them in their employment, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Christs Kingdom, and others
the true members thereof, and he will never
leave his Church destitute of a remnant of such
valiant defenders of the truth, and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
(through the power of his Spirit) of
what is contrary to it: though all the powers
of Hell join their forces against them, they
shall disperse them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="v" place="bottom">Tirin. Grot.</note> Some learned Men refer what is here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the times after the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity,
and especially those of the <hi>Maccabes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Iews</hi> under valiant commanders over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
diverse strong Enemies, and with Lion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
courage set on them and brought them
under; which though it may be granted, and
their victories looked on as a fulfilling what
is here spoken in part, yet sure it will appear
to have been more evidently and fully made
good since Christs coming into the World,
and setting up his Spiritual Kingdom among
men by these conquests by his little flock obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over the Devil and the World, Sin and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
never so deeply rooted and strongly back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all that may be comprehended under
those names by the Apostle given them, <hi>Eph.</hi>

in high places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conquering and dispersing these (as by
the Church of Christ in the power of his might
and invincible force of his Spirit hath been
wonderfully done) and converting rebellious
sinners, are things of a higher nature, and signs
of a greater strength and courage, then any
that is shewed in the conquering and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatest and most potent Nations that
ever were on the Earth, as to any temporal
dominion or concerns, in as much as the
bringing the minds of Men into subjection is
harder then the forceing their bodies. And
sure though Gods remnant have promises of
temporal things as well as of Spiritual, yet
where such are mentioned as concern them
as members of Christs Kingdom (as the things
here spoken of from the second verse all along
have been shewed to be) it is manifest, that
they cheifly relate to their Spiritual estate, the
things thereto pertaining being the peculiar
priviledges of his Church and flock as so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Kingdom not of this World, and the
happiness of that and them being according to
those to be valued, whereby their dignity may
be made appear not so much by their being
great in this World, as their being great in the
Kingdom of Heaven, and their prevalency not
over temporal and carnal, but over Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Enemies, which are worse, and require a

to be fulfilled, only in a gross literal sense, by
a bloody Massacre of their Enemies with the
edge of the material Sword. We may make use
of them as for finding out the signification of
the words, as in other places, so in such passages
of the Prophets also as concern Christ, his
coming, and Kingdom, and the priviledges
thereof; but as to the sense in such we must
expect to have it as wide from the truth, as
they can wrest it, being obstinatly resolved
not to acknowledge him as yet come.</p>

should be converted to Christ, because else
an objection might be made against it, for
that after the return from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and when Christ came, and since, the
<hi>Iews</hi> were not guilty of Idolatrous worships
and Witchcrafts, &amp;c. that they should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to have them cut off from them, and that
therefore the words cannot be looked on as a
promise of good to them, and therefore that
the Horses and Cities and Witchcrafts and
Idols are to be understood of such as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other Nations, who were to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Christ, and so be made the remnant,
and <hi>Israel</hi> of God, i. e. that those things in
which they did before trust, and so hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Gospel, he would now take away,
or at least make them no longer to be the
cause of their resisting the Gospel, but that
all should yield and give place to it. But though
that which he saith be true as to the main,
viz. that Gods <hi>Israel</hi> comprehends as well the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> that were to be called in to Christs
Church, as the <hi>Iews,</hi> &amp; that there were among
the <hi>Iews</hi> no <hi>Idols,</hi> or <hi>Idol</hi> worship at Christs
coming, and that this promise was to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
as well to the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> as <hi>Iews,</hi> yet
that there is need to interpret the words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as if by the things named were to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
those among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> because at
Christs coming no such were among the <hi>Iews,</hi>
or that the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast meant them of
those, is neither evident, or need to be insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, or scrupled at, because the Prophet
seems to speak of things as they were in those
times when he spake, and to say that in future
time, when God would fulfill his word here
spoken by the Prophet, he would cause that it
should be otherwise; they whom he speaks of
should not make use of or confide in such
things as they now did. That in the Prophets
time such things were among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and
they peccant in forsaking God to rely on them,
appears by what is said in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
who was contemporary with <hi>Micah, Isaiah</hi>
II, 6. &amp;c. <hi>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy
People the house of Iacob, because they be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
from the East and are Soothsayers, &amp;c.
Their Land also is full of horses, neither is there

we need not be much inquisitive after his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

to rely on him alone, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance

we may well be inclined to think by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

Thus he begins his plea with them, by calling
on them to produce what exceptions they have
against him and his service; for their forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it might seem to import, as if he had ill
treated them, and been an hard master to
them. he bids them therefore, if they have
any thing to say for themselves against him in
that kind, to produce it. <hi>O my People, what have
I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee?</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="bottom">Aben Ezra, R. Dimchi.</note> Some for explication add, What evill have I
done unto thee? viz. that thou shouldst thus
behave thy self towards me, as thou dost:
Wherein have I wearied thee? What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
have I given thee, or what have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be done of thee, the doing of which
might be a trouble and wearisomness unto

<hi>what good have I said that I would do to thee, and

have no such things on their part to produce,
he hath his great benefits conferred on them

both true, and the word comprehending

the minding them of all those benefits, that

of his great work of his redemption of

continu'd together amongst them, which was

here particularly mentioned, viz. what

                     </hi> is recorded, <hi>Numb.</hi>
XXII, XXIII. XXIV. <hi>Balak</hi> finding himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to accomplish his designs on <hi>Israel</hi> by force
of Arms, thought to do it by bringing God's
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101621:43"/>
curse upon them, for which end he sends for
<hi>Balaam</hi> (who it seems had then the repute of
an holy Man and great Prophet) to come and
curse them, <hi>for I wot,</hi> saith he, <hi>that he whom
thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest
is cursed, Num.</hi> XXII. 6.</p>
                  <p>How willing <hi>Balaam</hi> was to have complied
with him in this pernicious design, is manifest
by his carriage in the relation of the History,
but God would not suffer either of them to
have their will. <hi>Balak</hi> hired against <hi>Israel Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
to curse them, nevertheless the Lord
their God would not hearken unto <hi>Balaam,</hi>
but turned the curse into a blessing unto them,
<hi>Deut.</hi> XXIII. 4, 5. <hi>Ios.</hi> XXIV. 10. Whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
by building altars and offering sacrifice he
sought to procure a curse against them, the
message that was put into his mouth to return
to <hi>Balak</hi> was a blessing, which he could not
chuse but utter. So that he being forced to it
said, <hi>how shall I curse whom God hath not cursed,
or how shall I defy whom the Lord hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
Num.</hi> XXIII. 9. and, <hi>behold I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
commandment to bless, and he hath blessed,
and I cannot reverse it,</hi> verse 20. He confessed
that no inchantment could prevail against <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
verse 23. and in fine therefore instead of
cursing them, plainly pronounceth blessings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and curses and destruction to those
who would have had them cursed and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Num.</hi> XXIV. 15. &amp;c. So that <hi>Balaks</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in getting <hi>Balaam</hi> to curse <hi>Israel</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="bottom">Ab. Ezra, R. D. Kimchi, Abarbinel.</note> seems
that which is intimated by, <hi>remember what
Balak consulted;</hi> and <hi>Balaams</hi> blessing them
instead of cursing them, that referred to by those
words, <hi>and what Balaam the Son of Beor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is one thing more in that History
to be taken notice of for the fuller understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what is here spoken, and that is, that
though <hi>Balaam</hi> could not by his curses prevail
to hurt <hi>Israel,</hi> yet he sought and taught <hi>Balak</hi>
by another way to attempt it, viz. by seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to do that, which if done by them
should certainly pull down Gods curse on them,
viz. Fornication and Idolatry.<note n="h" place="bottom">Ains. on Num. XXXIV. 16.</note> This is by some
thought to be intimated in what he saith to
<hi>Balak, Num.</hi> XXIV. 14. <hi>I will advertise or
counsel thee.</hi> But though no such counsel is there
more fully exprest, yet it is afterwards, cap.
XXXI. 16. where <hi>Moses</hi> reproving the People
for saving alive the Midianitish Women, saith,
<hi>behold, these caused the Children of Israel through
the Counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against
the Lord in the matter of Peor,</hi> to which also
reference is made <hi>Rev.</hi> II. 14. where tis said
that <hi>Balaam</hi> taught <hi>Balak</hi> to cast a stumbling
block before the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> to eat
things sacrificed to Idols, and to commit Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
That counsel of his is there called the
Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and that may, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
unfitly, be here included in what <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
answered to <hi>Balak,</hi> as calling to mind, as
a great Sin of their forefathers, so togéther a
signal mercy of God, in not suffering that
counsel to prevail to the utter destruction of
them, but to end in the punishment of part
of them only (viz. twenty-four thousand

to, joining with these words the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
namely, <hi>from Shittim to Gilgal,</hi> making
the meaning thus to be, And what pernicious
counsel <hi>Balaam</hi> gave for working mischeif to
them in their passage betwixt <hi>Shittim</hi> and <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
viz. that in all that way (as far as his
dominions extended) he should send into the
camp of <hi>Israel</hi> of the fairest of his Women,
to entice them to Fornication, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Idolatry; that so by that means, which
he could not do by any inchantments, he might
prevail to bring Gods curse upon them: which
counsel if it had taken effect, had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done what he intended. For being begun to
be practis'd in <hi>Shittim,</hi> we see how it provoked
God to send a plague among the People to
the destruction of twenty four thousand, <hi>Num.</hi>
XXV. 9. and had it been seconded or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their further march toward <hi>Gilgal,</hi> had
probably brought destruction on the whole
People before they could arrive there, but was
defeated by God's so timely taking notice of
it, and by the early punishment of those that
were at first seduced, and afterwards by the
<note n="k" place="bottom">Numb. XXXI. 17.</note> cutting of the Midianitish Women, who
were intended to be a snare to them. So that
the plot was dangerously on <hi>Balaams</hi> part laid,
and God's great mercy in defeating it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conspicuous, and worthy to be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
                  <p>But Others do otherwise expound these
words,<note n="l" place="bottom">Tanchum.</note> some taking by the words, <hi>from Shit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
to Gilgal,</hi> to be denoted the several stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to which <hi>Balak</hi> took <hi>Balaam,</hi> that he might
view the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> and curse them,

they first incamped in, and took firm possession

them again out of it, and threatned by the
mouths of this and other Prophets so to do,
except they should prevent it by serious and
speedy repentance, and new obedience, which
all the Prophets, calling on them in his name,
could not perswade them to.</p>
                  <p>All these things with the notorious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances

But though all these may (as we said) agree
to the sense of the words, and be looked on as
true, yet if we look to the words foregoing,
wherein God saith that he hath a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie

to plead the case, and debate the matter with
him, before witnesses, that it may appear on
which part the right stood, or the fault lay,

it will seem perhaps a closer and more

This abrupt, passionate, form of speech seems
to require somthing to be understood, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
whereby it may be joined to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
words, and that<note n="z" place="bottom">Junius Tremellius, Grot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and see R. Tanchum.</note> Some would have
to be <hi>and mayest say:</hi> which then must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
with some caution, not as if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
should suggest to them words, which he
thinks convenient that they should, or he
would have them to say (because they are
such as he could not but know were not to
be said, being not agreeable to the waies of
worship for making attonement, and pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, by God himself in the law prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who would not be pleased with any other
things then what he himself chose, being not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
by any, nor accepting of any, but what
himself approved) but rather mentioning
them as such, which probably they would be
ready to say, being convinced of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
in his plea, and having nothing to
testifie against him, or answer for their own
justification: as if they should say, We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Gods righteousness, and acknowledg all
that he hath said to be true, and that he hath
better deserved at our hands, then we have
repayed him, and would be glad therefore by
any means, and on any terms to make our
peace with him. If offering those ordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
which the law required (which as
speaking in their person he may seem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
they would say they had not failed in)
will not suffice, what else shall we do? be it
offerings of things never so expensive (as by
those hyperbolical expressions of <hi>thousands of
rams, and ten thousands of rivers of oil</hi> seems
denoted) or things never so dear, or precious
to us, our Children, yea the dearest of them,
<hi>our first born,</hi> all of these would we willingly
offer for making attonement for our sins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we have provoked him, and for appeasing
him, if all would do.</p>
                  <p>Not much different as to the meaning will
be what<note n="a" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi. Aben Ezra. Ch. à Castro.</note> others supply, viz. If any of you
(or every one of you for his particular) shall
say, <hi>wherewith shall I come before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
On all hands it will be agreed that the words
are spoken by the Prophet, as in the person of
the People (agreeable to what their behaviour
shewed to be the thoughts of their hearts) as
a reply to what God hath said in his plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them for evidencing his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and their great ingratitude, whether we
look on them as an acknowledgment, that
they are convinced of their own guiltiness, and
desire to acknowledge their sins, and repent
of them, which they would testifie by any
means, if they knew what would be accepted,
or suffice in that kind: tacitely implying that
he had not wearied them in any service, but
<note n="b" place="bottom">See Abarbinel.</note> that there was nothing so wearisome, or
troublesome, or expensive, which for pleasing
him they ought not to do, or would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do;
or whether as a justifying of themselves,
<note n="c" place="bottom">See Pareus</note> That all was true indeed that God had said;
and as for themselves if they had been defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in their duty, and so displeased him, it
was through ignorance, because if they might
be informed what would please him, were it
never so great a matter, they would willingly
do it.</p>
                  <p>However it be, the Prophet by putting this
question in their name in these terms,<note n="d" place="bottom">R. Tanchum, Corn. à Lapide.</note> makes
way for informing and instructing them in the
true means of pleasing God, which, as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to their question, he declares in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words. But before we come to those
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101621:45"/>
words, wherein he positively sets down, what
things God required, and was to be pleased
with, we must necessarily suppose a denying
the things in this question on their parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
to be pleasing, or acceptable to him,
viz. multitude of oblations and sacrifices
above what he required in his law, as if by
the greatness and preciousness of them their
pardon were to be bought out. Offerings
and sacrifices were indeed in the law of Gods
own institution, but those all of such nature as
God might, for all that he had commanded,
justly ask, <hi>wherein have I wearied thee?</hi> They
were neither so costly, nor so many, as that they
had reason much to be aggrieved at; they
were all of such things as were at hand easie
to be gotten, and of the store wherewith he had
blessed them, so that<note n="e" place="bottom">See Lev. v. 11. cap. XII. 8. and cap. XIV. 21.</note> if any were poorer
then others, in many of them regard was had

it was not the value or great price of the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

greater sins oblations<note n="f" place="bottom">Moreh Nevochim. lib. 3. cap. xlv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might appear. And to think therefore, that
by adding to the sacrifices, which God had
prescribed in the law, as by changing single
beasts into thousands of the best sort, or in
stead of beasts to offer, to sacrifice, the dearest
of their Children, could be no safe rule to go
by in seeking to appease the wrath of God
for their sins, and present themselves accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in his sight.<note n="h" place="bottom">Prov. XXX. 6.</note> They were not to <hi>add to,</hi> no
more then to <hi>diminish from what he commanded

their offerings even of such things as he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and required to be offered at any time
please him, because offered in obedience to
his commands, and of such things, for such
ends, in such a manner, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to his will in his word declared, not for
any thing otherwise of intrinsick goodness in
the things themselves, or the value or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of them which he esteemed. And for this
cause, because they thought otherwise, and
neglecting those other circumstances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the offerings were to be made acceptable,
and were never without them, thought to please
him with sacrifices, and oblations, as if the
bare offering them and external performance,
were as much as he required, and a sufficient
performing of their duty, whereby they
should gain his favour, is it that we often
hear him reproving them even for their legal
sacrifices, and rejecting them with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as things which he delighted not in, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
loathed and hated, as <hi>Isa.</hi> I. 11. &amp;c. 66.
3. <hi>Ier.</hi> VI. 20. <hi>Amos</hi> V. 22. &amp;c. and as
things that though by them he thought good
under the law to exercise them in obedience
to him, and<note n="i" place="bottom">Calv.</note> to instruct them and bring them
to repentance and faith, yet were not<note n="k" place="bottom">Moreh Nevochim. lib. 3. cap. XXXII. See Abarb. gand so the Syriack and Arabick translations.</note> his
prime and main intention, nor things which
meerly of themselves could please him; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<hi>Ier.</hi> VII. 21, 22. &amp;c. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is most true what <hi rend="sup">l</hi> some say, though it
seem not the proper construction, or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the words, while they would thus
read and expound them, <hi>Shall I give,</hi> or offer
in sacrifice <hi>my first born? This would be my
transgression,</hi> (it would be a very great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
and not fit for me to do;) <hi>or shall I offer
for a sacrifice the fruit of my body? this would be
the sin of my soul;</hi> and how shall I do this great
wickedness? It is certain, that however
with the greatest zeal and shew of desire to be
reconciled to God, they should have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and been willing to have done any such
thing, (and ought if he had required to have
been willing) yet this (as the case stood)
had been but more and more to provoke not
to appease him, by offering such things never
by him required, as though of the greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
in their own eyes, yet were to him an
abomination,<note n="m" place="bottom">Jer. VII. 31.</note> however in their Idolatrous
worships they were commended and looked
on as most meritorious acts. And therefore this
question, for what end soever put by the
Prophet in their person doth so necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a negative answer [No, thou shalt not
come before the Lord with such things; he
will not be pleased with thy giving such
things] that taking it as granted, he doth not
farther insist on it, but proceeds in positive
terms, to instruct them what is pleasing to
God, and what good for them to do, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that they may in acceptable manner
come before him, and that they may find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance

&amp;c.] This is an answer given by the Prophet
to the question in the preceding words, put
as in the person of the People, or any of them,
and gives a full resolution to the main of the
question, viz. what it is wherewith the Lord
would be pleased, though not such as perhaps
they who would put the question in such
terms as it is put, did, or would expect, for
they make their question concerning things
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101621:45"/>
without themselves, by what in that kind they
might please him, as taking it for granted
that by such things God was to be pleased:
not making question of any thing within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or how their own hearts and minds
were to be disposed, and their conversation
was to be ordered. But the answer respects
only this, with exclusion of the other, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this not worth the mentioning, and of
no value, yea rather abominable in the sight
of God. Their whole Flocks and Herds, yea
their dearest Children would they part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to make satisfaction for their sins,<note n="n" place="bottom">See Calv.</note> but
mention not the parting with those sins, or
rectifying their inward man, and amending
their waies. This in their eies was a great offer,
a way to gain acceptance, but he shews them
that in this they were clear mistaken, God
looking to them and their behavior, not the
greatness, or costliness of their offerings; and
therefore that if they would in acceptable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
come before him, and have him pleased,
they must bring with them, not what seems
good in their own eies, but what he hath
shewed them to be good, and hath required,
so that without that it is in vain to talk of,
or pretend to offer any other gift, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so costly, or of things without themselves,
never so dear to them.</p>
                  <p>This, except willingly, they could not be
ignorant of, so that they might have made
themselves answer, or not needed at all to
put this question, for he had shewed it to
them, and declared it in his Law, wherein he
had plainly set down all that he required of
them. Yet doth the Prophet summarily repeat
it to them, <hi>and what doth the Lord require of thee,
but to do justly,</hi> &amp;c. What but these things?
so as that all other things required are but in
order to these, or with supposal of these, and
without these neither good nor required; so
where he seems to reject those Sacrifices which
otherwise the law enjoyned, as by them offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he doth explain what was the main thing
by him intended, and required, so as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it the outward performances signified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
So <hi>Isa. I. 11. &amp;c.</hi> when he had shewed
that the multitude of their sacrifices to him
was to no purpose, &amp;c. he saith, <hi>Wash ye,
make you clean, put away the evill of your doings
from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do
well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed,</hi> &amp;c.
So <hi>Ier.</hi> VII. 22, 23. telling them that he
spake not to their Fathers concerning sacrifices,
he adds, <hi>but this thing commanded I them, saying,
obey my voice,</hi> &amp;c. And so <hi>Amos</hi> V. 22. &amp;c.
telling them, that he will not accept their
burnt offerings, &amp;c. that they may know,
wherewith to be accepted, he adds, verse 24.
<hi>But let judgment run down as waters, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness
as a mighty stream.</hi> To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>Hos.</hi> VI. 6. saith he, <hi>I desired mercy and
not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more then
burnt offerings:</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> XV.
22. <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord?</hi>

thing that the words of the Prophet here,
though the terms be different, all shewing that
the offering of a Mans self to God, by forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his sins, and ordering his conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
before him, is that which is good and
acceptable in his sight, and required more then,
and preferred before, all oblations, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
pompous ceremonious performances or
shew of worship to him; and all speak that
which was before said in the law (and is noted
in the Margin of our Bibles in this place,)
<hi>And now Israel what doth the Lord thy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to
walk in all his waies, and to love him, and to
serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy Soul, to keep the commandments of the
Lord and his statutes, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> X. 12. 13.
There being put the same question that here,
<hi>what doth the Lord require of thee? but,</hi> with what
follows as in answer to it, shews the duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in both places to be the same, and the
words to aim at the same thing, though in
sound they differ.</p>
                  <p>Now the whole of that duty is here compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in three parts, or summed up under

which will easily be reduced all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the law; those concerning our duty

Jew notes, the acknowledging of one God,
and the loving him with all the heart, and with
all the soul; and so plainly agrees with that
sum of that Table given by our Saviour in the

on them to return by repentance; but when I
the Prophet, saies he, proclaim thy words in

                  <p>Farther yet, by reason of the different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception

difference in this is, that the word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>shall see he</hi> seems to render <hi>shall shew,</hi>
or <hi>declare,</hi> or <hi>make known,</hi> although otherwise
the word which he useth <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Another of good note (viz. <hi>R. Solomon

The voice of the Prophets of the Lord

and the Prophet crieth or preacheth to them
<gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Tushiah, Wisdom,</hi> is referred to the

which hath appointed that revenge (or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
whether he hath power to make good
what he hath decreed. This exposition differs
but little from what we saw in the other Jews,
and takes the words much in the same signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>But another,<note n="a" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi saies his Father so interpreted it.</note> a learned man, and of
some antiquity, differs much in the acception of
one word, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>lair,</hi> which others render
<hi>to the City,</hi> and interprets it <hi>to awaken</hi> or <hi>stir
up, viz.</hi> to repentance: and that the word
may so signify, and (as to the present verse, if
taken by it self) would make a good sense
is no doubt, but that the construction of the
words so ordered, as to refer to it in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
verse, require that it should be a noun, and
signify <hi>to the City,</hi> it being there said <hi>the rich
men thereof,</hi> or of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> the City called unto
and spoken of; and none else of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow his opinion.</p>
                  <p>There is yet<note n="b" place="bottom">Abarbinel.</note> another Jew of great name
among his Nation, yet of latter standing then
any of the aforementioned, and who had seen
what they said (and perhaps the ancient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
too) who cavils against the first mentioned
interpretation, and then gives another much
different from it, and all the rest. His eavils
against that interpretation are, that there is no
need of saying <hi>the voice of the Lord crieth to
the City,</hi> if it be understood that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of the Lord spake and preached con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
(or against) the City <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or
<hi>Samaria,</hi> seeing it is known that this whole
Book is Prophesies of the Prophet. Then that

                     <hi>Tireeh</hi> in the

wisdom hath not eies to see with, and a

himself gives, taking the word. <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Samariah</hi> was taken, II Kings XVIII. 10.)
both concerning <hi>Samariah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and

of these sins, <hi>of keeping the statutes of Omri,</hi>

Prophet in the former part of this
Chapter (whether in his own person, or in
the person of the Church, and company of
the true worshippers of God, as the state of
things in those times which he describes stood)
sadly complains of the great and general cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of those times, which hath made<note n="a" place="bottom">Grot. Stokes.</note> some
to think, that he rather spake by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of things as they should be in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
times of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> then as they were
in the daies of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that good King and
great reformer of Religion, under whom he
seems to have spoken these things: for he
prophesied in the daies of <hi>Iotham, Ahaz</hi> and
<hi>Hezekiah.</hi> But if we consider that <hi>Ahaz</hi> was
a very wicked King, and promoted to the
utmost both Idolatry and all abominations of
the Heathen, and the waies of the Kings of
<hi>Israel, II Kings</hi> XVI. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may well
think, that not only in his time (in which also
our Prophet lived and uttered part of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies)
but in the succeeding times of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
also (at least till the Reformation by
him made) there were great corruptions of
manners among the People, as well of <hi>Iudah</hi>
as <hi>Israel</hi> (to both which it is said he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

as appears out of the History, and the
great need there was of a reformation, both
of their worship and manners, and the great

effecting it, as appears II <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 4.
and II <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIX. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their great wickedness, and the heavy
judgments that they had thereby pulled on
<hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> expressed there, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.
in much like terms as we have here, <hi>c.</hi> VI. <hi>v.</hi>
16. <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Lord delivereth them to trouble,
to astonishment, and hissing,</hi> &amp;c. so that as our
Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> even in the times of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
prophesied, and spake to all the People of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> saying, <hi>that Zion should be plowed like
a field, and Ierusalem should become heaps,</hi> by
which means <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was moved to fear,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101621:52"/>
and besought the Lord, and to the utmost
of his power sought to reform what was amiss,
<hi>and the Lord repented him of the evil which he
had pronounced against them,</hi> Jer. XXVI. 18, 19.
So may it be perceived, that in the times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Manasseh,</hi> there was occasion enough for
the Prophet to utter this complaint. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the times that he particularly speaks of

can find none.) These all, however they
differ in the expression of their meaning, yet
seem not much to differ about the signification
of the words in the Hebrew, but all do take
the first word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Kaits</hi> the signification of <hi>Summer</hi> or <hi>Summer

seem to agree, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is to denote the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of godly men then among them, that
there were no such remaining among them,
as were to be accounted of. So that if the
words be looked on, as spoken in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
own person, it will seem a complaint
much like that of <hi>Eliah, 1 Kings</hi> XIX. 10.
That he, even he was left alone, that truly and
sincerely worshipped God, and he could scarce
find any other: or a bewailing of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it was his lot to live or prophesy in
such a time, wherein<note n="e" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> there were very few
good and pious men to be found. It was as

Which makes him wish that he had lived
in those former times, when there were such
as were like the first ripe fruits, excelling in
their kind, and they not a few, but as a full
harvest or vintage. Or if as spoken in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the people of God, or his Church, or
Nation (as a learned<note n="g" place="bottom">
                        <hi>K.</hi> Tanch.</note> Jew speaks) which
seems most convenient and agreeable to the
place, then will it be a complaint of that
Church or Company of the paucity of truly
pious men in her, as rare and hard to find,
as good fruit after the Summer fruits are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
gathered in, or clusters of grapes
after the vintage: few will be found and those
not very good. For so we may well suppose
the qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ity and imperfection of those that are
to be found to be in these words complained
of, as well as their paucity for number. This
the fore-mentioned learned Jew well suggests
to us by his saying, that by the gatherings of
the Summer, or Summer fruits, are meant
or signified such fallings or fruits as are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up by the poor, which either falling
in time of gathering, and so being fouled,
sullied, marred, or stained, or otherwise naught,
the owners think not worth the taking up, or
gathering them in, but leave them behind for
who so will to take them up.<note n="h" place="bottom">So Jeremy XXIV. good m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by this similitude seems intimated not only,
that there were but few good men left, but
that those few also that went for such, and
had some good thing in them, yet came far
short of those good men in former ages, as
short as fallings or refuse fruits left behind,
of those that were carefully gathered for their
goodness, or some few sowre grapes left on
a Vine do of such a cluster as a man would
chuse to eat. (So <hi>R. Salomon</hi> observes, the

done, even he looks after bribes, and
requires presents from those that seek for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
<note n="j" place="bottom">Kimchi.</note> Others by <hi>the Prince</hi> understand such as
are in cheif authority under the King, who,
because it were a shame for him to ask, do ask
gifts for him. Secondly the <hi>Iudge,</hi> he that
should determine the cause and pronounce
sentence according to right, without <hi>respect to
persons in judgement,</hi> Deut. I. 17. <hi>and not take
any gift,</hi> Deut. XVI. 19. he is<note n="k" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> for a reward, or
asketh a reward, and is swayed by what he
hopes to gain, or that which shall come to his
<note n="l" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi.</note> share of the money given, not by the merits
of the cause. And the <hi>great man, i. e.</hi> say<note n="m" place="bottom">Idem.</note>
some, he that is great in the Kings Court,
<note n="n" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> others the Advocate, the Pleader, or he that
is to set things in order for a legal proceeding,

that have Suits in Law, and order their Plea

shall be, or prove mischeif to himself, or as
divers<note n="q" place="bottom">Chald. Greek, Syriac. and Latin.</note> ancient Translations <hi>the desire of his soul.</hi>
If the <hi>great man</hi> be taken in either of the two
former significations, the meaning will be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that these three one under another, joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conspire to set Justice to sale, not as right,
but as their own gain and advantage shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,

place) that whatsoever the Prince, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Judge and the great man do further his desire
in it, and care not what, how contrary to Law,
Right, and Justice soever they say, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
in his behalf for effecting his designs,
out of hope and advantage to themselves too,
and that they may share in the gain. But if it
be taken in the third signification, then the
meaning will be, that the <hi>great</hi> or rich man,
who hath in his mind or desire to get any
thing by wrong from any other<note n="s" place="bottom">See Chap. II. 1, 2.</note> poorer or
weaker than himself, and who hath done wrong
in any kind, seeing both the Prince and
Judge have both their hands open to receive
gifts and bribes, is not afraid or ashamed to
utter what mischeivous design he hath in his
mind, being sure of their assistance in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he desires; and so how unjust soever
the cause be, yet by their mutual compliance,
they make it firm on his side, or so wrap it
up and involve it, that the right shall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.

follow<note n="o" place="bottom">Calv. Par.</note> they, who (as we said) understand
by <hi>watch-men,</hi> the Governors, Princes, or

the words, as in our Translation read.
But a<note n="p" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> Jew of later standing, who had seen

                     </gap> meaning of the words, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the word which is rendred <hi>watch-men,</hi>
to be put here as a title either of true or false
Prophets, will have the words thus rendred
(as still having respect to those afore named,
the Prince, the Judge, the Great man, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together in seeking for bribes and gain,
and setting justice to sale.) In the day (or all
the time) that they are looking after, (for so
sometimes the word may signify, <hi>viz.</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
or look for,) or expect thee to bring to
them gifts or rewards: heed shall be given to
thee, cognisance of thy cause shall presently be
had, and no longer: when they have gotten
all they can, and they expect no more from
thee, thou mayst seek for justice, but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
shall be had to thee, or notice taken of
thy cause. But now the Land being laid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate,
they shall be in perplexity, and have no
more occasion of spoiling in matter of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature.
This man (as hath been elsewhere
said) loves to go different from others, and to
pretend to understand the words better than
they did: but however his meaning may please
any, his construction of the words here seems
harsh. Another<note n="q" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> Jew ancienter than he (but
whose works have never yet been printed)
taking the word <hi>watch-men,</hi> in its more lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
sense, thus expounds it, The day cometh,
or is at hand, <hi>that thy watch-men</hi> (those that
are set on high places, to spy or discover afar
off what is coming and give report thereof)
<note n="r" place="bottom">So also may Ab. Ezra's words be understood.</note> 
                     <hi>shall say, thy visitation cometh,</hi> i. e. the enemy

It will easily be conceived that the Prophet
here speaks in the person of the Church, or
Nation of the Jews, looking on her self, as
now under hard pressures, and in that capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
under the hand of her enemies, which the
Prophets had foretold, and bid her to expect;
and in that regard comparing her self to a
poor, distressed dejected woman, and her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to a proud, imperious, insolent dame,
insulting over her, as quite cast off, and given
up irrecoverably to destruction, and destitute
of all hope. Who is her enemy that she speaks
to? Babylon, say<note n="n" place="bottom">R. Salom. Hierom. and many others.</note> many, more particularly,
<note n="o" place="bottom">Jer. L. 11.</note> which led her captive, and triumphed over
her. Others understand it rather of <hi>Idumaea,</hi>
or the Edomites, who are every where set
forth as the most inveterate enemies of Israel,
that had<note n="p" place="bottom">Ezek. XXXV. 5.</note> a perpetual hatred against them.
And though they themselves were not able to
do them so much mischeif as others, yet they
made it up in spite, and when ever any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
befell them, rejoiced greatly at it, and
insulted over them, and did the best they could
to help against them. <hi>Obad.</hi> ver. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That
both of these may be here well joined under
that title, may appear by what is said respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
both of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXXXVII. 7, 8. Nor
will it be inconvenient to take in with them
any other that did shew like hatred to the Jews
at that time, and rejoiced at their calamity,
all those her enemies, whose behavior towards
her is described, <hi>Lam.</hi> II. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Jews will have particularly to
be meant<note n="q" place="bottom">See Vatab. Edit. 4<hi rend="sup">•</hi> &amp; 8<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Romans</hi> (whom they

pray for their destruction more earnestly then
for that of the Mahometans or any other, and
have much less kindness for. But there is
more then expression of their hatred to them
in this their interpretation, for from this grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they would make an argument to perswade,
that the Messiah is not yet come: at whose
coming they expect that these their enemies
shall be totally destroyed. That which she saith
to her enemy is, <hi>Rejoice not against me?</hi> &amp;c.
She represseth the enemies taunts, and takes
comfort to her self from her assurance that
things shall not alwaies continue in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with either of them, as they now are,
but there shall be a change, to her for better,
by the mercy of God to whom she will turn
by repentance, and stedfastly cleave, and to
her insulting enemy who contemned God and
despitefully used his People for the worse, by
his Justice in due time exserting it self, though
for a while conniving at them, or making use
of them for the correction of his children, and
bringing about his ends for his own glory,
not to give them cause of boasting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their own might. Of such Gods
method in correcting his People, and taking
vengeance on those whom he makes use of
as his instruments for that end when they grow
proud and insolent, see <hi>Isaiah</hi> X. 5, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and C. XXXIII. V. I. <hi>Ier.</hi> XXX. 8, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
other like places. As for her self she saith,
<hi>when I fall I shall arise,</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="bottom">R. Ta ch.</note> when, if, or though,
I fall from my dignity, be deprived of power,
or fall into calamity, I shall by Gods help be
restored and raised again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I shall arise</hi>] The word is of the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
tense, and word for word signifies,
<hi>I have risen,</hi> to shew the certainty which she
hath of it,<note n="t" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi.</note> according to the usual expression
of the Prophetical style, speaking of those
things, which by vertue of his promise or word
are to be expected, as of things already done
or come to pass. This is the usual and received
exposition; but there is among the Jews <hi rend="sup">u</hi> one,
who thinks it more convenient to take the
words, <hi>I have fallen and I have risen,</hi> as they
are in the form, so in the signification of the
preterperfect tense, thus, <hi>Rejoice not against
me, ô mine Enemy, because</hi> of my captivity,
in which I now am, as thinking that I shall
not come out of it any more, seeing the wrath
of God is kindled against me, for behold I have
formerly many times fallen into captivity, as
in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and have risen or reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from those falls, and returned from those
captivities, and so shall it now be, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a
light unto me, and after this darksome night
shall arise (to me,) a bright light, as at other
times it hath been, because this my fall hath
not been a thing that hath come by chance, but
by the Providence of God for punishment of
my sins, to which is a determined time, and
therefore when I arise he will redeem me. 'Tis
true, that I do in this my captivity, bear the
indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned
against him, but this is not to be perpetual,
but till he hath pleaded with me his contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy,
and inflicted on me that punishment
which I ought to bear according to mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.
And so likewise is to be understood,
<hi>and execute my Iudgement,</hi> i. e. that judgment
which it was due to execute on me. And when
<note n="v" place="bottom">Aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he bring me forth to the light, from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my captivity, and then <hi>shall I behold his
righteousness, viz.</hi> the righteousness and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that he will exercise towards me. To this
purpose he. But though a convenient meaning
might be made of the words by interpreting
those words in the preterperfect tense, and
from help formerly afforded from God, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
penitents may have assurance upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
repentance of finding the like again,
when any calamities befall them, and they may
to that purpose make use of these words on
occasion: yet we cannot here go along with
that Doctor in as much as he seems to drive
at a false end, (as we have already said on
this present verse) and taking the deliverance
from the Babylonish captivity, which seems
here particularly intended, only by the way,
looks for the completion of this Prophecy by
a deliverance and restauration from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
or exile that they are now since Christs
time under, by a destruction of the <hi>Romans</hi> or
<hi>Edomites,</hi> as he calls them (as we said) which
he hath not from these words any ground to
expect.</p>

the unhappy condition of captivity may seem
called, and compared to, darkness, by reason
of the withdrawing of Gods Providence, or

of what appears of it, in the time of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

who now seeming to be withdrawn from him,
hath left him as in darkness, shall again lift

bear the punishment, that he hath seen fit to

spite, not to execute Gods command. When
he hath thus performed his whole work of
chastisement upon her, then will he return in
mercy to her, <hi>bring her forth to light,</hi> restore
to her comfort, and the joy of his Salvation,
and she <hi>shall behold his righteousness,</hi> which he
will exercise toward her in delivering her, and
recompensing vengeance on her enemy,<note n="*" place="bottom">Drus. R. Tanch.</note> or his

the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity

of expounding the words are there, if they
be looked on as spoken to and of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
as our Translators by citing in the Margin,
<hi>Amos</hi> IX. 11. seem to do, and not without

formerly committed. This sense is given by a

harsh.<note n="a" place="bottom">Bren.</note> Others taking the words as referred
more generally to the enemy, (without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

A learned<note n="b" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> Jew, likewise taking it as spoken

                  <p>Others of the Jews, who look on the words
as directed to the Enemy, more plainly speak
out their mind, that by the Enemy they mean
the Romans or Christians: so<note n="c" place="bottom">R D. Kimchi.</note> one of them,
therefore; Speaking concerning the Enemy he
saith, In the day that thou thinkest to build

up to conquer <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which, since <hi>Titus</hi>
destroyed it, had been in their hands, and was
taken from them by the Ismaelites, or Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.
The Kingdom of <hi>Edom</hi> (saith he) shall go
up thither to build their walls; but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shall not succeed according to their thoughts,
for in that day the decree shall be far removed,
that is to say, The decree which was in their
hands, <hi>i. e.</hi> the custom, of taking it as at other
times they had done: and how that decree shall
come to be removed (or altered) he sheweth,
saying, <hi>that is a day and it shall come unto thee,
i. e.</hi> that is a day, a peculiar signal day, a day
unto the Lord, and to thee, ô Enemy, shall it
come, even to thy neck shall it reach. And
so he mentions that against the Kingdom of
<hi>Rome</hi> shall come the Kingdoms of <hi>Assyria,</hi>
and of the sons of the East, that is it which
he says from <hi>Assyria</hi> and the fortified<note n="f" place="bottom">II Kings XVII. 6.</note> Cities,
which he supposes to be <hi>Chaleath</hi> and <hi>Chabor,</hi>
by the River <hi>Gozan,</hi> and the Cities of the
Medes, of which <hi>Ioseph Ben-Gorion</hi> saies, that
the People of them <hi>Alexander</hi> the Macedonian
did shut up within the Mountains that they
should not come forth. These, the Prophet
saith shall now come forth against this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and by saying from <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Matsor,</hi> or the

                  <p>And because the Christians shall some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

he first reckons up the People that shall come
against them by Land, <hi>from Assyria, and from
the fortified Cities, and from the fortress,</hi> and
then prophesies that there shall come against
them that are on the Sea, strong Nations also
by Sea, which is that which he saith, <hi>and from
Sea, i. e.</hi> on the Sea shall they come from Sea,
and then <hi>from Mountain to Mountain,</hi> as much
as to say, also of the Inhabitants of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> in which the War shall be,

shall be for the fruit of their doings, by which
they did evil to <hi>Israel.</hi> And whereas the<note n="g" place="bottom">In the Copies that we have there is no such thing exprest.</note>
Chalde Paraphrast interprets it of the Land of
the Nations, that that should be desolate by
reason of the slaughter and destruction of the
Inhabitants, that also, saies he, is true.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we from him a long story as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually

it already acted, and as confidently affirmed
as if his exposition were as authentick as the
text it self, and had been dictated to him by
the same spirit, as the words thereof were to

their restauration, and coming from all parts
again to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> after the Land had for
seventy years been desolate for their sins; and
that if there be any thing beyond this in an
higher sense to be looked after, it was fully
made good in the setting up the Church, the
Kingdom of Christ, and by so many Nations
being called into it by the preaching of the
Gospell; and it will easily appear that this
Prophecy hath in the utmost extent of it been
long since so fulfilled, as that these Jews look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a farther completion of it, by freeing
them in such a way as they fancy from their
present condition, will (as we before intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
evidently appear to proceed only out of
obstinacy to maintain and make good their
groundless supposition, that the promised
Messiah is not yet come, but yet to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

should be of this World.</p>

can say is, that without doubt, when these

what places were meant by the descriptions
given of them; but now so long after, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
can be said, is but by conjecture, and
cannot be certainly affirmed, so as to conclude
for one opinion, to the silencing and taking
away pretence of probability from all others.</p>
                  <p>Having been thus long on these words, we
shall not dismiss them without taking notice
of what is said in the Dutch Annotations (as
translated into English on the 13. verse.) <hi>viz.</hi>
that by <hi>the Land</hi> they rendring it, <hi>this Land,</hi>
is to be understood the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and
what is said, <hi>it shall become a desolation,</hi> this
happened first in the time of the Babylonian
devastation, and afterwards in the time of the
New Testament, and continueth so to this
very day. In this Note seems to be some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
for it seems to make these two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
<hi>viz.</hi> that occasioned by the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
so many years before Christ, and that
by the <hi>Romans,</hi> after Christ, to be one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
desolation, or both in this one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
to be prophesied of, whereas the long
distance of time, and the restauration of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
after the first devastation and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Jews coming between, shews
them to be of different and distinct considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as to the letter of what was spoken,
though what was spoken of one, may in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense be applicable to the other.</p>
                  <p>Again, what <hi>Drusius</hi> saith, that by some the
11, and 12. verses are understood as of denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
of punishment to his people for their
sins, and then V. 13. is to be understood of <hi>Israel;</hi>
I know not by whom it is, or how made out.
I suppose they must then understand the words
as spoken to the Jews or Israelites, In the
day that thou thinkest to build up thy walls
and fortify thy self against thine Enemies,
thy decree (or determined purpose) shall be
far removed, or frustrated. In that very day
wherein thou thinkest to secure thy self, shall
the Enemy from all parts, and into all thy
quarters come unto thee, and the Land shall
be by them made a desolation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The words
taken by themselves might bear this sense,
but as here they stand considering what went
before, verse 8. <hi>&amp;c. When I fall I shall arise,
&amp;c.</hi> expressions of assurance of comfort and
salvation, and what follows to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
verse the 14. to the end of the Chapter;
it will appear, that if they be looked on
as spoken of Gods People, they are consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and a promise of good, though, that
those who continue in their wickedness may
not snatch at them, and thence take occasion
to encourage themselves in evil; it be added,
(to shew that these things shall not be made
good to them, but upon repentance, and after
they have been chastised for their sins, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Prophesy going before to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
<hi>notwithstanding the Land shall be deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
&amp;c. or (this shall be) <hi>after the Land
hath been desolate because of them that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
for the fruit of their doings.</hi> If they be looked
on as comminatory, they will more properly
seem to belong to the insulting Enemy, as
declaring what shall betide her for her pride
and insolency and like behaviour.</p>

as we said, is agreeable to them, as in our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
read, making the persons, speaking,
spoken to, and of, the Prophet, God, and

implying (as we said) a prophecy, or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promise of return out of captivity to
their own Land, and that under the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of God, taking care of them as his People,
his flock and Sheep, they should enjoy all
things necessary, and conducing to their well
being in abundant manner, set forth by a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of Sheep feeding in those rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
named. Although withall it cannot be
doubted that all these good things promised
to the Jews are in a higher manner made good
to the Church of Christ, and all faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
rescued from sin and Satan, and brought
back into his Fold; who, as he saith, <hi>shall be

ultimate fulfilling of this Prophecy under
Christ, doth the Chalde Paraphrast seem to
point, making them as a prayer to God that
he would feed his People with his word, in
the age that was after to be renewed, as
above was said. This Paraphrase is said to
have been composed some thirty years before
Christ. This place will be well illustrated by
comparing it with another, promising the same

<hi>Feed thy People,</hi> &amp;c. assuring him that he will

any seeming difficulties, puts him in mind
of those former great things which he had
done for their Fathers in bringing them with

signs and wonders. He that could do that,
can do this; his power is still the same; of

how many and potent their Enemies, and what
great obstacles are in the way, it cannot be
done without shewing unto them marvellous
things, like those of old, such as shall be
wonderous in their own eies, and in the eies
of all that behold them: so that they shall
say among the Heathen, <hi>The Lord hath done

in some respects that which God would do,
in their bringing back from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their

With much the like words, Chap. XXIII. vers.
7, 8. which seem to make as if in, and for
effecting the latter deliverance, even greater
marvels were wrought and greater power
shewed then in the first. For what reasons it
may be so said, will not be to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to enquire, our present words represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them as alike marvellous; and they were
both manifestly<note n="p" place="bottom">Tarnov.</note> types of that greater deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
by Christ wrought, and those more
marvellous things by him done, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
of his People from the power of
Hell and the Devil. And so may we look on
the words both here, and in those places of
<hi>Ieremy,</hi> as directing us to that wonderful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
for a fuller and higher completion
of these Prophesies, then was either by the
deliverance in bringing them out of the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian
bondage, or Babylonish captivit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, though
more immediatly the words point at those,
and in this the expressions of the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
will concur, <hi>viz.</hi> that the final com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
of these Prophesies, is to be by what
should be done by Christ or the Messiah. So
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101621:61"/>
                     <hi>Kimchi</hi> on <hi>Ieremy</hi> XVI. 14, 15. saith, that
what is there said shall be made good in the
daies of the Messiah, (as likewise <hi>Abarbinel,</hi>
as being the opinion of their ancienter Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.)
But mean while, though thus far in
words they agree with us, yet in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of them to the matter spoken of, there
is a vast and irreconcilable difference. For we
say, that as for any temporal deliverance by
these words foretold, it was made good in a
marvellous manner by bringing back the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
Jews from the Babylonish captivity.
But as for that more marvellous delivery, by
this typified and given them to look for under
the Messiah it is wholely spiritual (his Kingdom
being not of this World) and hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
fulfilled by rescuing his People (and
those as well Gent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>les, as Jews) from a worse
captivity under a more potent Enemy, then
either the Egyptian of old, or Babylonian
afterward, even the Devil, and the power
of Hell. But the Jews, that they may look
for, by vertue of these Prophesies, a temporal
restitution from the captivity they are now
under, since their rejecting of Christ, passing
by that deliverance from the Babylonish capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
as a small thing, though God set so si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnal
a character on it, apply the words to that
which they yet expect, without any grounds
of a promise to be wrought for them, by their
Messiah's subduing all Nations to them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Christians, whom they hope to see
totally cut off, as hath been above said, and
his making them Lords over them in this
World. We have already seen those marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
things done, and still doing, which make
us expect no other of a different kind, which
would indeed be less then what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

and require, and both these will God
do for his People, by giving them grace, and
power to resist sin, and shake off its yoke, and
by taking away the punishment thereof, and
sreeing them from it. The same is meant by
<note n="c" place="bottom">Grot. Vat.</note> those that render and expound <hi>he shall put
their iniquities under his feet,</hi> as things that he
will not look upon any more, but put out of
sight, and mind, quite suppress, or not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to rise up and come in sight. In the new
Testament are several expressions which agree
to this, and make for illustrating it, as, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the body of sin in Gods children,
that they should not henceforth serve it. <hi>Rom.</hi>
VI. 6. that is, should not reign in their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
bodies, ver. 12. nor have dominion over
them, ver. 14. that God shall bruise or tread
<hi>Satan</hi> under their feet. He will so subdue,
and put under their iniquities, that they shall
not farther have dominion over them, nor<note n="d" place="bottom">Dutch Notes.</note>
rise up in judgment against them. To express
further the certain, and utter abolition of them,
he adds, <hi>Thou wilt cast all their sins into the
depth of the Sea.</hi>] Those things which are so
drowned in the bottom of Sea, and covered
by it, are looked on as out of sight, out of

whether any such custom among them was
in our Prophets time, may be questioned.

                     </hi> gives, <hi>viz.</hi> as if
the promise which he should make good to
<hi>Iacob,</hi> were the reward of <hi>Abrahams</hi> goodness,
which he shewed in teaching his Sons to keep
the way of the Lord. But here<note n="o" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
are also started, as, why <hi>Isaac</hi> is not here
named as well as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
why <hi>Iacob</hi> is named before <hi>Abraham:</hi> but
what ever pleasing or probable answers are,
or may be given to these questions, it seems
not convenient at all to make them. For this
would be to question why the holy Spirit by
the Prophets spake as he did, and not as men
would think fit he should have spoken, as if
they were fit to teach him, or prescribe a
method to him. We shall not therefore insist
on them, only we cannot but take notice,
what occasion that fierce Jewish Doctor <hi>Abar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binel</hi>
takes in his answer to the first of those
questions, of venting (as on all occasions he
doth) his malice against Christians, while he
thus saith, <q>Because from <hi>Abraham</hi> came <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi>
and the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> which shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be at peace with <hi>Israel,</hi> therefore he
saith, that when God shall perform the
truth to <hi>Iacob, i. e.</hi> the truth of those things
which he revealed to him in the Vision of
the Ladder, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVIII. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein,
he saith, God shewed to him all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
both the captivity, or dispersion of his
posterity, and their restauration therefrom,
in the redemption, or restauration of his
seed, He will shew mercy also to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
in that the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> the Sons (he saith) of
<hi>Keturah,</hi> which came from him, and the
Sons of <hi>Ismael</hi> shall receive the Law of God,
and shall be subject, or submit themselves
to <hi>Israel.</hi> But he makes no mention of <hi>Isaac,</hi>
because <hi>Esau</hi> who came from him, shall
have no portion, or inheritance in the Law
of God, nor in the peace of <hi>Israel,</hi> for
there shall be none left remaining to <hi>Esau.</hi>
                     </q>
This is his precise determination of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
in which his aim appears to be, to cut off
the posterity of <hi>Esau</hi> from any lot, or part in
those blessings promised of old to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and from all mercy. But though <hi>Isaac</hi> be not
named, yet was not his son <hi>Esau</hi> then in his
Grand-father <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his posterity, and so under him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
as well as they; though <hi>Iacob</hi> (as
to the Land of Promise) carried away the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the inheritance: and so did <hi>Isaac</hi> from
<hi>Ismael,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Keturah?</hi> And what
is here to exclude him more then them? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> is of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
extent, reaching to <hi>all Nations, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the Earth, Gen.</hi> XII. 3. and XVIII. 18.
and XXII. 18. Among those <hi>all</hi> sure those of
the progeny of <hi>Esau</hi> also must be included.
And though <hi>Isaac</hi> be not here expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
yet is he according to the judgment
of the Chalde Paraphrast, who adds his name,
manifestly comprehended, and understood,
and to him the like Promise was made as
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>in his seed should all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth be blessed, Gen.</hi> XXVI. 4.<note n="p" place="bottom">Ecclus. xliv. 22.</note> With
him he did establish also the blessing of all
men and the Covenant, so that though he
made it rest more peculiarly upon the head
of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the right of primogeniture being
transferred to him, his posterity enjoyed the
promised Land; yea and as for spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
they had the preemmence also, in that they
had the<note n="q" place="bottom">

whom the blessing was to be extended to all
the Nations, and kindreds of the Earth, came:
and therefore at his coming, he was first sent
to bless them, <hi>Act.</hi> III. 26. And it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that the glad tidings thereof should first
be published to them, <hi>Act.</hi> XIII. 32, and 46.
yet was there by vertue of the Promise made
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and repeated to <hi>Isaac,</hi> mercy
also, and a blessing for all other Nations that
should come in. Why shall <hi>Esaus</hi> posterity be
excepted against, and utterly excluded, even
<hi>Isaacs</hi> Sons, to whom he gave also a blessing,
though inferior to <hi>Iacobs,</hi> when as the word
<hi>all</hi> is general without limitation? and we see
<hi>Am.</hi> IX. 12. a Promise of the reception of the
remnant of <hi>Edom</hi> also, as well as of other
Nations. But what do we plead for <hi>Esau's</hi>
posterity, when it is manifest that the Jews
quarrel is not here against them that are really
so, but against those whom he, with others
of them, is pleased to bestow that name or

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>
or <hi>Esauites,</hi> and excluding us in that
notion from any part in that mercy to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
we shall not longer stand, it having no
other ground then the inverterate malice of
those who have refused their own mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those, who have embraced and laid
hold on it. That we may return therefore
from this digression to the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
we may from the words, and conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of him, who hath occasioned it by this
his question and answer to it, take advantage
for our summing up of what is given us to
understand from them; as 1. that the <hi>mercy</hi>
in them mentioned, belongeth not only to
<hi>Israel</hi> after the flesh, but to those of other
Nations also, as he allows to the children of
<hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Keturah,</hi> who shall come in to
God, by the obedience of Faith, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of his <hi>Israel,</hi> being of <hi>Israel</hi>'s Faith.
2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That the mercy here promised was to be
made good at, and by the coming of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
which is meant by the time of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or restauration by him mentioned. Thus
therefore as to the scope of the words we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that these words, as a conclusion of the
former Prophecy concerning the restauration
of the Jews, and the confusion of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
contain an assurance of a temporal or
corporal deliverance to them, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
when God remembring his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made with their Fore-fathers, accepting
of their conversion, pardoning their sins, and
blotting out their iniquities, did free them
from the Babylonish captivity, and bring them
back into the promised Land; but that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
are such as giving to expect all that
by vertue of Gods truth to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and mercy
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and oath to their Fore-fathers,
was to be expected, seem to include a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Christ, that seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in which
all the<note n="y" place="bottom">Act. III. 25.</note> kindreds of the Earth were to be
blessed,<note n="z" place="bottom">Heb. II. 16.</note> with all the benefits of his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so were by him fulfilled in an higher
manner, not of giving to the Jews any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over all Nations, and earthly possessions,
and dominion as they fondly expect, (as we
have above shewed, and the Author we have
last mentioned, here plainly intimates in his
words cited) but of rescuing all that come in
to him, and lay hold on his Redemtion, both
Jews, and Gentiles of all Nations, out of
the hands of worse Enemies then the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi>
even sin and <hi>Satan,</hi> and making them
Citizens, not of the Earthly, but of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> heirs of the Kingdom of
Heaven, and conferring on them all spiritual
blessings. This also being comprehended in
these words, was fully made good by Christs
taking on himself the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
coming into the World for the work of our
Redemtion, and setting up his Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, and calling them without exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any Nation or condition, into his Church.
Thus to understand the words of Christ, and
his Kingdom we learn, both out of the Hymn
of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of <hi>Zachary</hi>
in the first Chapter of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> in both which
much like the same expressions are used as here:
and in the first it is said that by Gods sending
of Christ, <hi>he had holpen his servant Israel in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his mercy, as he spake to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to Abraham, and to his seed for ever,</hi>
vers. 54, 55. and in the other, that <hi>God had
visited, and redeemed his People, and had raised
up an horn of Salvation for us, in the house of
his Servant David, as he spake by the mouth
of his holy Prophets, which have been since the
World began; That we should be saved from our
Enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
To perform the mercy promised to our Fathers,
and to remember his holy Covenant; the oath which
he sware to our Father Abraham, that he would
grant unto us,</hi> vers. 68, &amp;c. In Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was that which is here mentioned, Gods
<hi>truth to Iacob, the mercy to Abraham,</hi> which
he had sworn unto the Fathers from the daies
of old, performed: in him fully,<note n="a" place="bottom">Mercer. on Amos IX. 13.</note> yet so as
to be still in performing unto the Worlds end,
by his calling into his Church, both Jews a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d
Gentiles, and offering his Salvation to them,
and blessing them with all spiritual blessings,
which Salvation that the Jews will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
but reject, and him that brought it, to
expect only a temporal restauration by one
whom they fancy yet to come, is their mere
groundless obstinacy, envying the extent of
Gods boundless mercy promised in the seed
of <hi>Abraham</hi> to all Nations, for which we pity
them, and desire God that he would open their
eies, that they may see, and acknowledg, and
lay hold on his Salvation,<note n="b" place="bottom">Luk. II. 30, &amp;c.</note> which he hath
prepared before the face of all People, a light
to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his
People <hi>Israel.</hi>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:101621:64"/>
Thus much as to the words of this Prophet.
We may only add an observation, which the
fore-mentioned Jew takes from an ancient
<note n="c" place="bottom">Abarb. out of Siffie, in which Book it is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> p. 60. at the beginning of his Exposition of Deut. XXXIII. and see Yalkut.</note> Author of theirs; <hi>viz.</hi> that there is not any

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Among
other instances (as out of <hi>Moses, Hosea, Ioel,
Amos, Ieremiah</hi>) he brings this conclusion of
<hi>Micah</hi>'s Prophecy, in which after several
Judgements, he shuts up all with words of
comfort. And very remarkable in that kind
is indeed this conclusion, which to shew how
greatly God delights in mercy, is uttered in
words giving assurance of mercy, not only to
<hi>Israel</hi> after the flesh, upon their repentance,
but to all that shall in Christ, the promised
seed by Faith, lay hold on his Promise made
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him to all the kindreds
of the Earth, so that the Gentiles also reading
it, cannot but glorify God, and rejoice with
his People, and sing unto him that Hymn
which the<note n="d" place="bottom">Rom. XV. 9, 10, 11. Psal. 117.</note> Apostle shews to be fitted to them,
<hi>viz. O praise the Lord all ye Nations, praise

            <p>
               <hi>MICAH</hi> 4. 5. in the Note on that Verse,
the last line of the first Column, after,
<hi>rendred,</hi> adde, by many, <hi>But we,</hi> will be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rendred as it is by ours, <hi>And we,</hi> &amp;c. at
the end of the Note, for alteration, read, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severation,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and adde; <hi>Vatablus</hi> in his Notes
in the Edition <hi>in folio</hi> by <hi>Robert Stephens</hi> saith,
that this expression of walking in the Name of
God, or the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an Hebraisme, (why
it need so be called I know not) he saith here
that the meaning of it is, to worship or serve
God. The like expression occurs, <hi>Zach.</hi> 10.
12. they shall walk up and down in his Name,
and there in the lesser Editions of those Notes
in 4<hi rend="sup">•</hi> and 8<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, he saith the meaning is <hi>freti au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xilio
Dei,</hi> trusting on the help of the Lord.
And indeed both those doth it manifestly seem
to imply, 1. To own God for their God, and
to cleave only to him, and him duly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to worship, invocate, serve and obey,
and to conform their lives to his will and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
which is called walking with God,
<hi>Gen.</hi> V. 22. or before him, <hi>Gen.</hi> XVII. 1. as
the contrary behaviour, walking contrary to
him, <hi>Levit.</hi> XXVI. 21. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, To have affiance in
him to place their trust and confidence in him,
and on him, whose Name is a strong Tower,
<hi>Prov.</hi> XVIII. 10. to rely professing that their
help is in the name of the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXXIV.
8. These Notions of walking in his Name,
however they may be considered as distinct,
yet cannot be severed in the subject so as that
they should be one without the other. For he
that doth not rightly own God, and cleave to
him alone, and faithfully serve him, cannot have
any grounds to rely or trust on him for good
and protection, but he that doth adhere to him,
and duly serve him, may with confidence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on him, and shall find from him assured
protection. These meanings will easily be
made out of the use of the single words, which
they have besides their proper signification, as
walking is used for living or framing the course
of ones life, or conversation, behaving or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
oneself, or continuing in any course
of living, and as the Name of the Lord is used
either for his doctrine, worship, Religion,
will and commandment, or else his power,
assistance, blessing and protection. They will
live in constant fear of him, and obedience to
him, and without fear of any others in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his assistance and protection. To walk
in the Name of God will be to give up their
selves to him, either as the object of their
worship, or of their confidence: the expression
here we look on as including both these and
that seems the full import of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Micah</hi> V. 3. page 51. col. 2. line 15. read;
of some foregoing passages, as c. IV. 13. and
the 1. verse of this Chapter. p. 52. col. 1. l. 9.
after what they say, adde, Besides these, there
is also another exposition hinted by <hi>Abarbinel,</hi>
as extravagant as any of the other: <hi>viz.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>i. e.</hi> because the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
the House of <hi>David</hi> (of which the Ruler
ought alwaies to have been) God shall give
them up into their Captivity, untill the time
that she which travells hath brought forth, in
many distresses and sorrows, so declaring that
the destruction of the ten Tribes should be for
that sin; And as for <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> which
did not forsake <hi>David</hi> their King, yet they
also shall go into Captivity as well as the other,
wherefore he saith, and the remnant of his
Brethren shall return unto the Children of
<hi>Israel, i. e.</hi> to go into Captivity as they went.
Thus he saith the words may be also interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but I suppose none else will so think, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
some who as he will seek to say any thing,
without considering whether it agrees with the
words, or makes any probable or tolerable
sense (as this Exposition plainly doth neither)
rather then embrace the true meaning, if it
make against what they are obstinately set on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Micah</hi> c. V. immediatly after the 14. verse
adde,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will pluck up thy Groves out of the midst
of thee.</hi>] Of what use consecrated Groves were
anciently, in the times of Idolatry, we may
easily perceive out of the ancientest Records,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> XXXIV. 13.
where <hi>Israel</hi> being forbidden to make any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with the Amorites and Canaanites,
and other Idolatrous Nations, are commanded
to destroy their Altars, break down their Images,
and cut down their Groves (as wherein they
worshipped, or did honour to their Idols) as
appears again, <hi>Deut.</hi> XII. 2. 3. Ye shall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
destroy all the places wherein the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which ye shall possess, served their
Gods, upon the high Mountains and upon
the Hills, and under every green Tree, and
you shall overthrow their Altars, and break
their Pillars, and burn their Groves with fire.
So we read that <hi>Israel</hi> served <hi>Baalim</hi> and the
Groves, <hi>Iudg.</hi> III. 7. and again c. VI. 25, 28.
we read of <hi>Baals</hi> Grove; and the Israelites to
keep them from Idolatry are commanded not
to plant a Grove of any Trees near unto the
Altar of the Lord their God, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVI. 21.
notwithstanding which command, as <hi>Israel</hi>
afterwards fell to Idolatry, so they fell also to
<pb facs="tcp:101621:65"/>
planting of Groves to the honor of Idols, and
worshipping them in them. So <hi>Maacah</hi> the
mother of <hi>Asa,</hi> made an Idol in a Grove,
1. <hi>Kings</hi> XV. 13. And <hi>Ahab</hi> setting up the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Baal</hi> made a Grove, I. <hi>Kings</hi> XVI. 33.
and had his Prophets of the Groves, c. XVIII.
19. so of the Grove in <hi>Samaria</hi> we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
II <hi>Kings</hi> XIII. 6. and that the Israelites
doing things that were not right against the
Lord, set them up Images and Groves, <hi>ibid.</hi>
c. XVII. 9. 10. and made them molten Images,
even two Calves, and made a Grove, v. 16.
and that <hi>Iudah</hi> left the Lord their God, and
served Groves and Idols, II <hi>Chro.</hi> XXIV. 18.
by comparing which and like places will here
easily be understood what is meant when he
saith, He will pluck up their Groves, <hi>viz.</hi> that
he will take away those parts of Idolatry also,
whether the words be taken with some as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the Chaldeans, or with others to the
Israelites, the use of Groves in the worship
of their Idols having been cowmon to both,
