            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Speech spoken by Sir <hi>Simonds D'Ewes,</hi> (so neare as it could be collected together) touching the priviledge of <hi>Parliament</hi> in causes criminall and civill.

            <p>I Perceive that the maine doubt upon the late questioning of some of the Members of the House of Commons as whither or no there be any priviledge of Parliament in matter of <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Rot. <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 6. <hi>n.</hi> 27.</note> Treason or other capitall offences, in which I cannot deny but that there is a common saying (and yet not more common then erroneous) That priviledge of Parliament doth not extend to Felony and Treason; For there is a double priviledge of Parliament, the one finall, and the other tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Our finall priviledge extends to all civill causes and Suites in Law, and that continues during the Parliament. The other priviledge that is temporary extends to all Capitall causes, as Treason or the like, in which the persons and goods of the members of both Houses are freed from sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure till the said Houses be first satisfied of their crimes, and so doe deliver their bodies up to be committed to safe custody; and the reason of it is evident because their crime must either be committed, within the same houses or without them; as for example if any member of the House of Commons be accused for treasonable actions or words committed or spoken within the walls of the same house then there is a necessitie that not only the matter of fact, but the matter of crime also, must bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by that house; for it can appeare to no other Court what was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96648:1"/>
there done in respect that it were the highest treachery and breach of priviledge for any Member of that House, to witnes or reueale what was there done or spoken without the leave and direction of the same House. And if it be for treason committed out of the House, yet still the House must bee fi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st satisfied with the matter of fact; before they part with their members, for else all priviledge of <hi>Parliament</hi> must of necessitie bee destroyed, and by the same reason that they accuse one of the said Members they may accuse fortie, or fiftie, upon imaginary and false Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and so commit them to custody and deprive the house of their Members; whereas on the contra<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y side the House of Commons hath ever beene so just as to part with such Members when they have beene discovered. As in the <hi>Parliament de Anno</hi> 27. of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Doctor <hi>Parry</hi> being a Member of the House of Commons, had no Articles of Treason preferred against him till the House had discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him from being one of their members, and that the chiefe heads and branches of his said Treason had beene made knowne unto the House partly by his owne confession, and partly by other proofes; and yet if ever Treason required a speedy tryall that did, for it concerned no lesse then the murder and assassination of the Queene her selfe, [See the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gininall Journall booke of the House of Commons, <hi>de Anno</hi> 27. <hi>Regin. Eliz. pag.</hi> 85 <hi>&amp; pag.</hi> 103.] And so likewise in Master <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys</hi> case in the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the last yeare of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> who spake very dangerous words against the said Queene; yet it was tried in the House of Commons as apeeares in the originall Journall booke of the same House, and the said Queene at their intreaty did afterwards remit it. But for the case of these Gentlemen that are now in question it doth not yet appeare to us whether it bee for a crime done within the Walles of the House of Commons or without, so as for ought wee know the whole judicature thereof must first passe with us, for the LORDS did make an Act Declaratory in the <hi>Parliament, Roll de An.</hi> 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Num.</hi> 6. that the judgments of Peeres only did properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, so as I hold it somewhat cleere, that these Gentlemen cannot bee condemned but by such a judgement onely as wherein the Lords may joyne with the Commons, and that must bee by Bill; and the same priviledge is to the members of the Lords House, for wee must not thinke that if a private person should come there and accuse any of them of Treason that they will at all part with that member, or commit him to safe custody till the matter of fact be first proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>Tis true indeed that upon the empeachment of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96648:2"/>
for Treason or other capitall crimes, they doe Immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their members to safe custody, because it is first admitted that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse not till wee are satisfied in the matter of fact, and secondly, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so supposed in Law that such an aggregate body as the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is will doe nothing, <hi>ex livore, vel ex odio,</hi> seeing they are entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the whole Commons of <hi>England</hi> with their estates and fortunes. So as upon the whole matter, I conclude that the proceedings against these five Gentlemen have beene hitherto illegall and against the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
