            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is matter of lamentation to ſee the great diſtreſs poor mortals are in by the common Enemy of Mankind, languiſhing ſickneſs, with grief of Mind, wandring from one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to another, and from this Receipt to another Experiment, for Cure of ſome churliſh accident which unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people lie under the preſſure of, till the vital and noble parts are pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated; and chiefly by deſpiſing or neglecting ſmall beginnings, till the Enemy of nature gets ground, and by wandring in errors path the cure is more difficult; to avoid which, let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed methodically, to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44489:5"/>
and benefit of the meaneſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Firſt, Know that all Diſeaſes ought to be prevented, or Cured, and that the health of humane Bodies do mainly reſt upon theſe two great Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prophylactical, and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapeutical; the Prophylactical part ſhews how Diſeaſes may be prevented, the Therapeutical ſhews how Diſeaſes may be Cured, when the Body hath contracted them: the way and means to prevent Diſeaſes, is rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand every ones Conſtitution and Complexion, and to keep your ſelf in a right temperament, and you muſt obſerve thoſe ſix things, called by Phyſicians, <hi>non-naturals,</hi> as Air, Diet, Exerciſe, Sleep, Paſſions of the Mind, Excretion; all which you are taught in my Book, <hi>Every Man his own Doctor.</hi> Theſe things being rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to every ones Conſtitution, and fitted in proportion to our Bodies, and ſo continued in uſe, as ought to be done by him that treads, <hi>Via recta, ad vitam</hi>

               <hi>longam,</hi> though I commend not ſuch rigid Staticks as to eat and drink but juſt to ſuch a weight, becauſe nature may at ſome time or other be over-charged or leſſened, therefore a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate evenneſs, without exact ſeverity, is the beſt Rule; for if you do not (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if Diſeaſed) the Enemy of nature gets ground, and the Cure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more difficult, becauſe the blood is vitiated; ſo a Scorbute, a Cachexia, evil habit of the Body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which weakens the Senſes, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the mind, and divers ſymptoms may ariſe, as decay of ſtrength, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, ſpots, pains, dimneſs of ſight, <hi>cum multis aliis;</hi> for the Body being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed adds grief to the mind, the mind being diſtracted encreaſeth the Diſeaſe, ſo both being oppreſſed, the Patient too often deſpondeth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficient cauſe, inſtead of uſing good means and advice, do wholly neglect means of recovery, till the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts are infeebled, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

perform their office for digeſtion, fermentation, nor due Circulation of the Blood and Spirits; thus beginneth a Cachectical Scorbute, Conſumptive decays, many ill ſymptoms, Hectick Feavers, complicate Diſtempers, and falling, <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> till at length you muſt die; and this is the cauſe of lamentation, it might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for many a year longer, to whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quare morereris an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te tempus tuum?</hi> and that you may not die too ſoon, I will endeavour to ſet down the chief ſign of Conſumptions, Scurvy, Melancholy, and the French Diſeaſe, that ſo you may prevent them, and knowing the ſigns and degrees of danger, with the more ſatisfaction, Cure them.</p>

that do moſt frequently and naturally bring it upon us, that ſo by reſiſting the beginnings, we may be free from the ill conſequence and effects: Now I have in my practice obſerved, that one of theſe three Diſeaſes have been the cauſe of Conſumption in the moſt part of people, <hi>viz.</hi> Melancholy, Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, or the French Diſeaſe, to which may be added Mercury as an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix; I ſay one of theſe are uſually the Forerunner and cauſe of the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the greateſt part of people, whether perſonally acquired, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary deſcended: And now that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may be his own Doctor, that is, to judge by Symptoms, whether it be a Conſumption, from what cauſe it came, and if Curable; I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour as clearly as I can to ſolve all doubts, by ſhewing the ſigns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, Scurvy, Melancholy, and the French Diſeaſe; the want of which knowledge have cauſed many to periſh irrecoverably, by uſing a wrong me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,

ſo endeavouring the Cure of another Diſeaſe by miſtake, or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that private which ought to be conſidered, till deſpairing of Cure have yielded their Weapons (the means for recovery) and through inward diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſhame and infirmity, have fallen into deep Conſumption, and quickly made their <hi>Exit:</hi> thus many dying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their full accompliſh'd time, through want of timely means, and true knowledge of the prognoſtick part of Symptoms, which through fear and ſhame do keep to their own heart till their Diſeaſe becomes formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and deadly; and finding the World defective to the ſick, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions eſpecially, in not giving them ſome light and guide how to be acquainted with their condition of danger with directions how to get out of that toil, without the uſual ill ſucceſs; and few Doctors do in all points ſatisfy their Patients Queries: Therefore I thought it uſeful, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

and charitable, to give ſome light in ſo dark a Diſtemper; therefore I adviſe, firſt find out and be ſure of the cauſe that firſt uſhered it in; for the Venereal Conſumption is to be Cured one way, and the Scorbutick another, and the Melancholy another; that which is moſt likely to be your bane and death is moſt conſiderable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hide nothing from your Phyſician of the Diſeaſe, or Cauſe, leſt you lead him into a wrong method; and be ſure to have regard in the Cure of a Conſumption, to thoſe ſix things we call not natural, as Air, Food, Sleep, Paſſions of Mind, Exerciſe of Body, Venery, Excretions, Retentions; all which are fully ſet forth in that little Book, <hi>Every Man his own Doctor,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needleſs here to direct you in; but now I ſhall give you the ſigns; Firſt, of a Conſumption, then of a Scurvy, Melancholy, and the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Diſeaſe, and to judge of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of your Diſeaſe, or recovery, termed

the prognoſtick part, being eſpecially uſeful, becauſe many are affrighted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of life and hope of Recovery, by that too common received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that once have a Conſumption, or the Pox, you can never be well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; which ſaying or doubts ought to be refuted, becauſe many have been, and daily are recovered out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions and the Venereal Diſeaſe, the fear and doubt of which have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many to deſpair, and by neglecting means have conſumed and died. The uſual queſtion a ſick perſon asks, is, How long will it be before I am Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; therefore know the more urging and greater Symptoms are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and require moſt time for Cure, and the leſs the ſooneſt and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt cured; and for ſatisfying your doubts, if afflicted, you are inſtructed by the ſigns in the ſeveral Diſeaſes as following; it is likely ſome may be your caſe and condition, and that you may not be deceived, conſider

            <p>AS I take ſharp acid acrimonious humours to be the chief cauſe of vitiating the blood, and corroding the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this ſharp acrid humour doth ſometimes ariſe from ill digeſtion of food, by a bad tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſordered conſtitution, by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular living, hurting nature in its actings, whereby comes a decay of ferments nutritive, cauſing ruine to the Microcoſm.

            <p>THE Scorbute or Scurvy being a Corruption of the Blood, produceth innumerable Symptoms, as may be eaſily judged; from putrid blood may ariſe, putrifaction in the Gums, redneſs in the Face, vapours from the Spleen, <hi>Flatus Hypochondriacus,</hi> ſudden Fluſhings, obſtructions, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Breathing, ſtinking Breath, Tooth Ach, looſeneſs of Teeth, ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt, the Body dull and heavy, and many ſpots, red, yellow or blue, eſpecially in Legs or Arms; violent pains in the Head, Arms, Neck, Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Legs, Thighs, Sweats and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, troubleſome Dreams, a watrineſs in the Stomach, and wambling in the Bowels; it often cauſeth Barrenneſs,

            <p>The Scurvy by corrupting the Blood, uſually and quickly weakens the vitals, eſpecially the Liver, being the <hi>Coagulum</hi> of the Body, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth fermentation, the want of which cauſeth obſtructions; for thoſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Blood which are not by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation alternated, muſt needs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, excoriate, and purify; from whence it is eaſy to judge what diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Symptoms and Diſeaſes may be

            <p>This Diſeaſe is bred from divers Cauſes, as from Blood inflamed, or Tumours, Boils, ſometimes from Piles and Hemorrhoids, not diſcharging the corrupt blood falling into thoſe parts of the Fundament, and Ulcers of the <hi>Anus</hi> or Piles, not well Cured, but moſt dangerous when a Venereal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe lies lurking in the Blood and Reins, which I have known too often the cauſe of Ulcers and Fiſtula's in <hi>Ano,</hi> and therefore whoever attempts the Cure without taking away the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Cauſe, is like another <hi>Ixion,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ever to turn the Wheel up the Hill, which always runs back again. For by reaſon of Excrements always
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44489:22"/>
paſſing that way, the blood and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours having once found a Cavous Receptacle admits not a Remedy, but by proper and powerful Medicines, eſpecially where the Patient is of an ill habit of Body, irregular; and the worſe if of a coſtive Conſtitution. Of Fiſtula's ſome are eaſily Cured, ſome more difficultly; as thoſe that have newly had it, are eaſier cured than of long continuance: thoſe that pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> where the Excrements are voided through the Orifice, and liquor injected, comes through the Gut out of the <hi>Anus;</hi> or if it paſs into the Bladder, for then the Water will come through the Fiſtula, therefore conclude, if the Fiſtula pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates through the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> or into the Bladder, or into both; or if it be in the Sphincter Muſcle, it is moſt difficultly Cured. It ſometimes happeneth that a Tumour and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is between the Scrotum and Anus, by bruiſes in hard riding, which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44489:22"/>
turn to Fiſtula's if not Cured. Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's in the ſolid parts of the Body may be eaſier means be Cured, taking away the inward cauſe which feeds it; <hi>Fiſtula Lacrymalis,</hi> and all Fiſtula's near the Eyes muſt be cautiouſly dealt with, by reaſon of the vicinity to ſo noble a part as the Eye; in moſt of theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I have by long Experience found the moſt ſucceſsful means, of which ſome of my Patients have acquainted his Majeſty, who was pleaſed thereupon to Command me to help ſome Noble Perſons afflicted with a Fiſtula; which Diſeaſe if not prevented, corrupts the blood and humours, vitiates the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moiſture, offends the Heart and Brain, decays the Senſes, weakens the memory, and by ſeveral ways haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Death, if not Cured.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <label>I. <hi>Condylomata.</hi>
               </label>
               <hi>COndylomata</hi> being very hard and of a callous ſubſtance like Nuts, bunching out about the Anus, but not very painful; this ſort pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Melancholy Acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice, and generally from a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive Conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <label>II. <hi>Thymi.</hi>
               </label>NExt kind to theſe we ſhall treat of, is <hi>Thymi,</hi> a ſort of Pile rough at top, narrower in the bottom, and large upwards; if you rub theſe with a courſe linnen cloath, they eaſily bleed, which ſerves for eaſe a little time, but ſoon fill again.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44489:24"/>
               <label>III. <hi>Criſta.</hi>
               </label>
THE third ſort is called <hi>Criſta,</hi> Excreſſences of fleſh which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are cauſed from too much Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, attracting heat to the part.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <label>IV. <hi>Ficus.</hi>
               </label>
THE fourth ſort is called <hi>Ficus</hi> or Fig, being a flat ſort, growing like a Muſhroom, or Fig, of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row foundation, and a broad Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies. Now as to the prognoſtick part or danger of them, as I find by the Judgment of Authors, and my own Experience, the <hi>Condylomata</hi> Pile is more troubleſome than dangerous, yet it is obſtinate to remove, becauſe of a hard and deep rooting. <hi>Thymi</hi> are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier cured than the former, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate not into worſe Symptoms: <hi>Criſta</hi> have a malignancy, and as Authors ſay, hard to Cure, yet by my Drops I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44489:24"/>
have Cured them at one application. <hi>Ficus</hi> is a dangerous Pile, or Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, becauſe ſometimes they prove Cancerous; they are moſt dangerous if ſubject to bleed, as bad as any of theſe Piles.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Ragades.</label>I Have found in my practice the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe called <hi>Ragades</hi> or Clefts of the Fundament, eſpecially if they have been of long continuance, being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to turn into Fiſtula's they are the worſe, if they happen in old Age, in a Melancholy Conſtitution, where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat is wanting; if Women with Child are troubled with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, they are very ſubject to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; and in men, where they have been of long continuance, and nature hath disburthened it ſelf that way, it will be difficult in curing by common Artiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:44489:25"/>
               <label>Haemorrhoids.</label>
LAſtly, The <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> being a Flux of blood by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, occaſioned by an Acrimonious humour, which generates internal Piles, call'd blind Piles, which by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Stool do ſend out blood ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with pain: if this Diſeaſe be of long continuance, it ſometimes keeps a Lunar Motion like the Feminine Sex, and proves dangerous if neglected; it often degenerates into a Fiſtula; a worſe Diſeaſe cannot happen. I have been the more careful to declare in all plainneſs the ſeveral ſorts of Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's, Piles, Haemorrhoids, and other infirmities belonging to the back parts and Fundament, which for the moſt part Phyſicians are negligent to Cure, although they are grievous, and the moſt troubleſome; and I might add, the moſt dangerous Maladies (if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected) belonging to the Body of Men
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44489:25"/>
or Women, eſpecially if we include the Diſeaſe incident to the ſecret parts, Reins and Bladder, all which being ſo nigh to each other they do often communicate the evil effects to their Neighbour-parts if not prevented, as a Fiſtula in <hi>Ano</hi> in time, often by its malign Quality perforates and eats through the Fundament, or <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> Bladder or Sphincter Muſcle, then it becomes moſt dangerous, and chiefly by neglect, not meeting your Malady in convenient time with good advice and powerful Medicine; ſo many good people that might have lived many years are cut off by lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Conſumptions, decays and Death. Now I ſay, as the Diſeaſes of the Fundament are often ſent to the Bladder, Reins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe the Diſeaſe of the private parts are more often ſent to the Reins, Bladder, Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, yea to the Liver, Heart and Brain, all which in time might by ſafe Medicines eaſily have been Cured,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44489:26"/>
if the Patient had been ſo fortunate or wiſe as to lay open their cauſe of grief to an experienced and skilful honeſt Phyſician, and in theſe Maladies I much inſiſt upon Experience for, <hi>dies diem docet;</hi> and I cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what ſome years paſt I could not effect; I now can <hi>(Deo juvante)</hi> My Experience and Succeſs in theſe private Diſeaſes hath been eminently known <hi>(Laus Deo)</hi> for ſeveral Years, it being about fourteen Years ſince I publiſhed the Book called, <hi>Every man his own Doctor,</hi> with an Herbal, which was ſo acceptable, that few Bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in <hi>England</hi> but ſold it; that treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly of the French Diſeaſe; but my Fiſtula and Pile Drops, many Phyſicians and Chirurgions have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to buy from me at a good price, which I parted with but to very few, except my own Patients. Now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great benefit which many afflicted people may have by the uſe of them. I have now firſt ſet down
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44489:26"/>
in this Treatiſe the ſeveral afflictions of the back parts, whereby every one may judge of their danger, and what their Diſeaſe is, and then they may ſend or come to me for thoſe Drops and Medicines which every day I uſe ſo ſucceſsfully; for as the Diſeaſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, ſo do our Medicines; for we have a Maxime, <hi>Nullum Medicamentum eſt idem omnibus.</hi> The Pile Drops are ſold at five ſhillings a Vial Glaſs, the Fiſtula Drops are at ten ſhillings a Vial, that the World may not longer want them; and as to the other Cure of the private parts, by any diſtemper by Venery, bad Cure, old or new, you may freely conſult me the Author of this Treatiſe, who will give you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice how you may be quickly well, if not quite too late.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now adviſe all perſons afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fiſtula's, Piles, Haemorrhoids, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they forbear things hurtful, ſuch are all ſalt Meats, Spice Meats, and ſharp things; as Vinegar, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44489:27"/>
French Wine, Stale Beer, crude Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be careful of taking Cold, and ſit not long upon the Cloſe-ſtool, by which only error many have had the Piles, ſooner got than cured. The manner of uſing the Pile Drops, is to warm about half a ſpoonful, and dip a fine Rag or Lint, apply it to the Piles, and bind it to the part with a double Rag upon it, for they do cure the Piles and prevent a Fiſtula, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſound the part applied to: For the Fiſtula we ought to put the Drops into it with Lint, or Syringe, and bind it to with a Plate of thin Lead, till well; and if one Glaſs will not do, it is an Argument you ought to uſe more, and ſome inward means, as a Fiſtula Drink and gentle purging; which is prepared by the Author here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who wiſheth all health, and hath procured it, by means, (with Gods Bleſſing) to many afflicted; to God alone be praiſe.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of the great</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Cordial Stone, by ſome called</hi> Antonio.</head>
            <p>THis Univerſal Cordial, brought from the <hi>Indies,</hi> being now in great uſe and eſteem, by all that have experimented it in health and ſickneſs, being a preſerver of health, and a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Sickneſs, and ſo generally appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that I wonder none hath writ of its worth and uſe, giving ſome Directions for the moſt profitable and proper way to take it; therefore I have deſigned in this ſmall Treatiſe, to Advertiſe the World of its moſt beneficial way of taking, it being pitty ſo admirable a Cordial ſhould be abuſed. Firſt, for its Compoſition is moſtly of Bezoar, Ambergreece, Pearl, Unicorns-Horn, Coral, and ſuch other of the greateſt Cordial Preſervatives, Corroboraters,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44489:28"/>
and Renewers of ſtrength and youth, and of that lively efficacy to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, that nature is ſoon ſenſible of its Friendlineſs, ſo long as there is any ſenſe or life to act upon; for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves nature by procuring due fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and concoction, expelling <hi>(per poros)</hi> in a moiſt breathing ſweat, the vitious humours and enemy of nature, which hinder nature in her actings, and turns to a Scorbute in the blood; it hinders and helps thoſe declinings of ſtrength and feavouriſh heats in palms of the Hands, or ſoals of the Feet, which commonly lead people into Conſumptions, Hectick Feavers, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack, Melancholy, Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, and pains that many complain of, and think or fear it may be a worſe Diſtemper; it is a moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Antidote againſt all infection of ſmall Pox, Plague, and other Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feavers, and a very ſucceſsful Cure in the New Feaver and Ague, whether Tertian, Quartan, or Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44489:28"/>
eſpecially if the Stomach is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cleanſed before by a ſafe Vomiting Pill for that purpoſe, which I have by me, and with great ſucceſs give it; which doth moſt commonly Cure at firſt taking, which ſaves the dangerous uſe of the Jeſuits Powder; but that I may profitably direct for the benefit of all the moſt general uſes of this Stone, I will mention ſome of thoſe Diſeaſes it is uſeful in, and thoſe ways it is beſt to take it, this being but a brief direction; many may know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes and good Remedies not here named, but to begin with ſome, it is I ſay neceſſary always to carry about one, being ſo great an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Diſeaſes; being made up in Balls, from the magnitude of a large Nutmeg or Prune to the bigneſs of four or ſix Ounces weight; they are moſt conveniently carried about one, being always ready to refreſh our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſpirits, by ſmelling to them, and as oft as you pleaſe you may ſhave
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44489:29"/>
as much or as little as you will into a Glaſs of Wine, Beer or Water, which makes it moſt pleaſant and cordial; the Seamen that bring it from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> uſually put as much Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as will ly on a Groat into a Bowl of Punch, which gives it an excellent ſcent and flavor; it is of great uſe to Travellers, becauſe it performs all can be expected from a Cordial, ready at hand to be taken at any time without danger, being pleaſant to ſmell to, and not liquid, without danger of breaking Glaſſes as in other Cordials, being dry; it is a pleaſant Companion which I ſhall ſcarce go without.</p>
            <p>
               <label>For Conſumptions,</label> It is conveniently taken to the quantity of a ſcruple or more three times a day, Mornings, Afternoons, and going to Bed, in a little Wine, or Ale, or put into a draught of warm Milk from the Cow, with ſome Sugar
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44489:29"/>
of Roſes, and you will reſt the better, with a pleaſant breathing, and your food will better concoct.</p>
            <p>
               <label>For the Ague or Feaver.</label> If you deſire to ſweat away an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue or Feaver with it, put half a Dram or a Dram to an Ounce of Treacle-Water, and diſpoſe your ſelf to ſweat.</p>
            <p>
               <label>For the ſmall Pox, Meaſles, or Plague.</label> In theſe Diſtempers you cannot take a better Cordial to drive it out than half a Dram of this Powder in one Ounce or more of Treacle-Water, or good Sack, and every three hours about a ſcruple in a little Sack, till ſafely come out, and ſometimes after to uphold the Spirits.</p>

               <label>
                  <hi>For Pains, Gout, Stone,</hi> &amp;c.</label> It is good to take half a Dram Night and Morning in a little Sack or Whitewine, and ſweat upon it.</p>
            <p>It Cures the green Sickneſs, and breeds a freſh Complexion in young and old; it is very good for all weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the back in Men or Women, and will remedy iſſuings or waſtings, but for gleetings or weakneſs of the Spermatick Veſſels, I have another excellent Cure that ſtrengthens the Retentive Faculty in a little time, which I have remedied divers by; and ſhall give directions to any <hi>gratis</hi> in Venereal Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>The uſe of this Cordial Stone, or Powder, taken in ſome Whitewine or Sack, mightily reſiſts the <hi>flatus Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacus</hi> and Melancholy; it ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Memory, and by comforting the Brain revives the Senſes; it is a great helper to fruitfulneſs in Men and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44489:30"/>
Women, inclining all to a pleaſant diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>If taken by thoſe in health it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the Gout, Dropſy, Scurvy, all infections, cauſing ſtrength and a good Complexion.</p>
            <p>For Children, it prevents and Cures Conſumptions, Rickets, Liver grown, Convulſions, Worms, and other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and no ways dangerous any way taken, or in quantity alſo; it doth wonderfully help the eaſy cutting of Teeth in Children.</p>
            <p>Now it is neceſſary, after acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with ſome vertues and uſes of this great <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Cordial, that I alſo acquaint you with the prices, there being now ſome in my hands, ſent very lately from <hi>India,</hi> the ſmalleſt ſort of Balls are at ten ſhillings price, ſome at a Guinny, the largeſt of the bigneſs of a Turky Egg five pound a piece, they will keep many years without the leaſt decay.</p>

            <p>TO Anſwer expectation to theſe Heads diſtinctly is my deſign. Firſt, For occult Qualities, we ſay, it is an uſual Refuge for Ignorance to take Sanctuary in, when a reaſon cannot be given, as to ſhew why ſuch a Cauſe produceth ſuch an effect; and the cauſe for the moſt part is by reaſon we do not labour nor ſearch into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, but for the moſt part ſit down with a contented Ignorance; if we cannot find our queſtions and doubts reſolved in other mens Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Works and Labours, then we ſay by occult Quality, it is done; but truth and knowledge is dear in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44489:32"/>
and what our Predeceſſors were ſhort in, we ought to diſcover to our Succeſſors; for we may better and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier do it than they from their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and our own reaſon with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>For the general diſcovery of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, the Doctrine of Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Antipathy Learnedly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> and others, doth in ſome things much facilitate the Work, ſhewing how by Sympathy a Medicine may work at diſtance upon a perſon by the Effluviums of the Air, which have been experimented by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to a cruental Cloth or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, which made the Wound one while Anodine and Sanative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, at which time, and during that application, they found eaſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; and the applying of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, or other Corroſives to the Cloth or Weapon, ſhould preſently cauſe pain and anguiſh, though at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miles diſtance; it is related the

Italians are ſo well acquainted with this Magick and Philoſophy, that they uſually in revenge of him that hath been ſo unmannerly, as to eaſe his Body at their Doors, they preſently heat a Spit or Iron-Fork red hot, and many times thruſt through the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the abſent perſon, knowing that the bruning Iron, acting upon the ſpirits of the Body, in the new made Excrements, will corrode the Bowels, and very often they find the ſad effects of it; we all forbid our Children to piſs upon Fire, becauſe it breeds a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inflammation in the Neck of the Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the contrary ſome have accidentally been cured of a Cold Flux of the Belly, a Looſeneſs, when their Nurſes have caſually caſt hot aſhes upon their ordure to take it away. It is not unworthy the relating an experiment of my own of this kind, about the year 1660. I being upon practice in <hi>Dublin,</hi> there came to my Houſe there, a rich Citizen in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44489:33"/>
of his Wife, who had lain ſick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Months, and had made uſe of moſt of the Eminent Doctors in Town; but having no remedy, he deſired my aſſiſtance and viſit; when I ſaw her in great agony by an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and burning ſhe complained of in her Belly and Womb, which ſhe and the Standers by ſaid came to her in fits, holding her about two hours at a time, Mornings and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: I finding her condition very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, enquired of her Self, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Friends, what might be the firſt cauſe, which they all being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, they told me, ſhe being thus left by her Doctors, her Neighbours, her Mother, and all concluded ſhe was bewitched, for the violent Fits came ſo exactly in time, Mornings and Evenings; after I had conſidered the Diſtemper and violent Paroxyſms of pain, I ſent for a Chirurgeon to breath a Vein, and that no methodical means might be wanting, I directed her Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44489:33"/>
to an Apothecary, but all ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied little, ſhe having uſed good means before; about that time I read Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> and ſome other Books of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and Antipathy, which did the more faſten it in my mind, that ſome ſtrange trick or magick art had been uſed upon her. Her Husband being a Soap-Boiler by Trade, it came into my mind to ask the Maid Servant, and made her ſhew me where ſhe emptied her Miſtreſſes Pots of Water, ſo I went with her where was a great heap of Aſhes made in Soap-Boiling, this ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to her by much than the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Houſe, ſhe uſually threw her Water upon the Aſhes to ſave her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of going further; after I ſaw this cauſe of her Miſtreſſes Diſeaſe, I told her ſhe was the Witch that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched her Miſtreſs, and forbad her for the future to empty any more there, and having found the cauſe, declared it to them, but adviſed the ſick Woman for ſome time after, conſtantly to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine

            <p>Further to confirm this Philoſophy of Sympathy and Antipathy, I knew a Midwife that uſually came to me for ſome advice for her Women, that got much money by Curing of Agues, and yet gave them no Medicine, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their Waters, which ſhe with flower made a Cake of, and gave it to a great Dog, ſhe always kept for that purpoſe, and ſo ſhe tranſplanted the Ague and Fever out of the Man into the Dog, who was affected with hot and cold Fits, that I have ſeen him ſhake, and then the ſick party grew well, the ſtrength of the Dog and his natural heat exceeding the mans, drew the morbid matter from the Man by the magnetick quality of the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Urine into the Dogs Body; this is commendable magick for the good of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44489:34"/>
Man: but whoever by this Art miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys it to hurt men, it is Malice and Witchcraft; but I ſhall break off from ſhewing too far of this magick Art, leaſt evil diſpoſed perſons learn to do miſchief, which is too much practiſed in ſome Foreign parts, which hath been a chief cauſe we heard ſo much noiſe of Poiſoning lately. This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is ſufficient to convince thoſe which believe there is no Witchcraft, or Witches; making void the Law that ſaith, Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live. To confirm it further, that there are Witches, I remember a Relation I read of the Confeſſion of Witches, ſuch Witches that make a compact perſonally with the Devil, that underſtand not the Magical Art which the Devil undoubtedly teacheth his Followers and Imps to practiſe; for I believe the Devil can do nothing miraculouſly or above nature, as the Maxime is, <hi>Diabolus non poſſit efficere ſupra naturam ſed in natura,</hi> the Devil

            <p>TObacco being a Drug now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed, eſpecially by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholians, and Conſumptive People, and many are ſo accuſtomed to it, that it is become a ſecond nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it but neceſſary to acquaint all for whom it is good, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may forbear it, if hurtful to their Conſtitutions before it be too late. I know many Authors have writ of it, have multiplied the Vertues of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> but always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the old Proverb (what is one
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44489:35"/>
mans meat is another mans poiſon) which is very truly verified in this thing Tobacco; yet it certainly is a good vulnerary Herb as can be uſed to Wounds in Ointment, or the Leaf it ſelf applied, and eſpecially good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſcab or itch in Man or Beaſt; but it is ſo forcible a worker upon the Brain, as it may be prepared and uſed, though but only outwardly applied; it is of that force in its nature, that it can kill ſome Beaſts (as I have ſeen the Experiment of twice) and for ought I know it may do it to others; but I forbear to divulge it, leſt evil diſpoſed perſons may do miſchief by it. Tobacco in its nature is hot and dry, very penetrating, digeſting and cleanſing, forceably purging the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ventricle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head and Brain, and this it performs by its hot, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative, attractive quality; and this it doth, as the cuſtom is, by ſmoaking in a Pipe, to the benefit of ſome, and great damage of many others: now I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44489:36"/>
ſhall acquaint you who may profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſmoak Tobacco, and others may forbear; I ſay if any perſons can take it without too great diſturbance to their Conſtitutions (for I know many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) it is moſt proper for cold, moiſt, phlegmatick Conſtitutions, eſpecially if they have Catarrhs and Diſtillations, becauſe it draws forth by heat to the mouth thoſe Rheums, and ſharp diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which diſtill (eſpecially by Night) upon the Lungs, and often ulcerate them, and brings the Body to Conſumption and Death, for that is the worſt ſymptom of a Catarrh when it falls upon the Lungs, which by drawing it forth it may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, eſpecially if other good things are added to Tobacco, it may then be a proper Vehicle to ſtrengthen the Brain, and Cure Catarrhs, Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and prevent and Cure Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which that it may the better do, I have compoſed a prepared To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, which hath been much appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
