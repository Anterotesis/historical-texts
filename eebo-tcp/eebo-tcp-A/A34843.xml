            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF to admire Worth and Honour were a Crime, it would highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me to beg your Lordships pardon for the presumption of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress. For that's the Cause,
<pb facs="tcp:100171:4"/>
this the Effect. It is true, the obscurity of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and remoteness of my Scituation, have plac'd me out of the reach of your Lordships Knowledge; yet your Lordships Fame Ecchoing out of <hi>Oxford-shire</hi> through all the very Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Kingdom, could hardly escape my Ears, were I not particularly entitled to the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which hath given me thereby the greater op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity both to know, and admire the Greatness of your Generosity, the Magnificence of your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Prudence of your

Governing, accompanied with all other Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Endowments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to render any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son both Great and Good: As also, that though your Lordship is a great impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of your own natural parts by your elaborate stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and of others Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by your Edifying Conversation; yet to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate Idleness, and to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote Sickness, as also the better to enapt your active Body to suit your Loyal Mind for Martial Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, should the concerns of your King and Country call you forth into the Field,

your Lordship is a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable user of all active Sports and Recreations, and consequently become the great Oracle and Master of them all, and all their Artful Terms.

Under no other certainly, without some kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice to your Lordship, and real Injury to the Work it self. Be pleased therefore a little to unbend your Thoughts (I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your Lordship) from your more serious Studies,
<pb facs="tcp:100171:5"/>
allowing your Eyes to run over these few Leaves, and either vouchsafe to correct their Errours, (if any have escaped those Judicious Sports-men who have been pleased to be my Guides in perusing this Work, and purging it from many Errors and Mistakes of the former Edition) or stamp them with the unquestionable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of your Lordships Approbation. This will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all true Lovers of the same generous Recreations to become greedy purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of these Rules, both to improve their Knowledge, and reduce their Language

                     <p>Besides, <hi>Hunting</hi> trains up Youth to the use of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exercises in their riper Age, being encouraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the pleasure they take in hunting the <hi>Stately Stag,</hi> the <hi>Generous Buck,</hi> the <hi>Wilde Boar,</hi> the <hi>Cunning Otter,</hi> the <hi>Crafty Fox,</hi> and the <hi>Fearful Hare;</hi> also the catching of Vermin by Engines, as the <hi>Fitchet,</hi> the <hi>Fulimart,</hi> the <hi>Ferret,</hi> the <hi>Polecate,</hi> the <hi>Moldwarp,</hi> and the like. Exercise herein preserveth Health, and increaseth Strength and Activity. Others inflame the hot Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of young men with roving Ambition, love of War, and seeds of Anger: But the Exercise of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting neither remits the Minde to Sloth nor Softness,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100171:8"/>
nor (if it be used with moderation) hardens it to inhumanity; but rather inclines men to good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and generous Society. It is no small advantage to be enured to bear Hunger, Thirst, and Weariness from ones Childhood; to take up a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habit of quitting ones Bed early, and loving to sit well and safe upon an Horse. What innocent and natural delights are they, when he seeth the day brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fortl. those Blushes and Roses which Poets and Writers of Romances onely paint, but the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man truely courts? When he heareth the chirping of small Birds pearching upon their dewy Boughs? when he draws in the fragrancy and coolness of the Air? How jolly is his Spirit, when he suffers it to be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the noise of Bugle-Horns, and the baying of Hounds, which leap up and play round about him.</p>
                     <p>Nothing doth more recreate the Minde, strengthen the Limbs, whet the Stomach, and clear up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when it is heavy, dull, and over-cast with gloomy Cares: from whence it comes, that these delights have mcrited to be in esteem in all Ages, and even amongst barbaroas Nations, by the Lords, Princes, and highest Potentates.</p>
                     <p>Then it is admirable to observe the natural instinct of Enmity and Cunning, whereby one Beast being as it were confederate with man, by whom he is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, serves him in, his designes upon others. How perfect is the Scent or Smell of an Hound, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves it, but follows it through innumerable chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and varieties of other Scents, even over and in the Water, and into the Earth? Again, how soon will a <hi>Hound</hi> fix his Eye on the best and fattest <hi>Buck</hi> of the Herd, single him out, and follow him, and him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without changing, through a whole Herd of rascal Game, and leave him not till he kills him? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100171:8"/>
is it not delightful and pleasant to observe the Docibleness of Dogs, which is as admirable as their Understanding? For as a right Huntsman knows the Language of his Hounds, so they know his, and the meaning of their own kinde, as perfectly as we can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the voices of our friends and acquaintance from such as are strangers.</p>
                     <p>Again, how satisfied is a curious Minde, nay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly delighted, to see the Game fly before him! and after that it hath withdrawn itself from his sight, to see the whole Line where it hath passed over, with all the doublings and cross works which the amazed and afrighted Beast hath made, recovered again; and all that Maze wrought out by the intelligence which he holds with Dogs! this is most pleasant, and as it were a Master-piece of natural Magick. Afterwards, what Triumph there is to return with Victory and Spoils, having a good Title both to his Appetite and Repose! Neither must it be omitted, that herein there is an especial need to hold a strict Rein over our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that this Pleasure, which is allowable in its season, may not intrench upon other Domestical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. There is great danger lest we be transported with this Pastime, and so our felves grow Wild, haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Woods till we resemble the Beasts which are Citizens of them; and by continual conversation with Dogs, become altogether addicted to Slaughter and Carnage, which is wholly dishonourable, being a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile employment. For as it is the priviledge of Man, who is endued with Reason, and Authorized in the Law of his Creation, to subdue the Beasts of the Field; so to tyrannize over them too much, is brutish in plain English.</p>
                     <p>Mistake me not, I intend this Reflection not for the Nobility and Gentry of this Nation, whose expence of time in this noble and delightful Exercise can no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100171:9"/>
ways prejudice their large Possessions, since it is so far from being very chargeable, that it is exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the bodily health of such who can dispence with their staying at home without any injury to their Families.</p>
                     <p>I might much enlarge my self in the commendation of Hunting, but that I am loath to detain you too long from the knowledge of what will make a right and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Huntsman. I shall therefore thus conclude: No Musick can be more ravishingly delightful than a Pack of Hounds in full Cry, to such a man whose Heart and Ears are so happy to be set to the tune of such charming Instruments.</p>

                     <head>HUNTERS TERMS.</head>
                     <p>BEfore we shall treat of the Method that is to be used in the obtaining pleasure in the prosecution of this Royal Game, it will be very requisite, as an Introduction to this Work, first to understand those <hi>Terms of Art</hi> Huntsmen, Foresters, and Wood-men use, when they are discoursing of their commendable and highly recreative Profession. And first, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</p>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>Which are Beasts of Forest, or Venery, or Venary, Chase, and Warren.</head>
                        <p>Old Foresters and Wood-men, with others well acquainted with Hunting, do reckon that there are five Beasts of Venery, (that are also called Beasts of Forest) which are these: the <hi>Hart,</hi> the <hi>Hinde,</hi> the <hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Boar,</hi> and <hi>Wolf:</hi> this is the Opinion of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100171:9"/>
likewise, in his Treatise of <hi>Philologie,</hi> speaking of the former Beasts, <hi>Semper Forestae &amp; Veneris habentur Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiae:</hi> These (saith he) are always accounted Beasts of Venery and Forest.</p>
                        <p>Some may here object and say, Why should the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Hinde,</hi> being both of one kinde, be accounted two several Beasts? To this I answer, That though they are Beasts of one kind, yet they are of several seasons: for the <hi>Hart</hi> hath his season in Summer, and the season of the <hi>Hinde</hi> begins when the <hi>Hart's</hi> is over.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that with the <hi>Heart</hi> is included the <hi>Stag,</hi> and all other <hi>Red Deer</hi> of Antlier.</p>
                        <p>There are also five wild Beasts that are called Beasts of Chase; the <hi>Buck</hi> the <hi>Doe,</hi> the <hi>Fox,</hi> the <hi>Martron,</hi> and the <hi>Roe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Beasts and Fowls of Warren, are the <hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Coney,</hi> the <hi>Pheasant,</hi> and the <hi>Partridge;</hi> and none other, saith Mr. <hi>Manwood,</hi> are accounted Beasts nor Fowls of Warren.</p>
                        <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> is of another Opinion, in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on Littleton 233. There be both Beasts and Fowls of the Warren,</hi> saith he: <hi>Beasts, as</hi> Hares, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, <hi>and</hi> Roes: <hi>Fowls of two sorts,</hi> Terrestres, (<hi>and they of two sorts</hi>) Silvestres, &amp; Campestres. <hi>The first,</hi> Pheasant, Wood-cock, <hi>&amp;c. The second,</hi> Partridge, Quail, Rail, <hi>&amp;c. Then</hi> Aquatiles, <hi>as</hi> Mallard, Hern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is great difference between Beasts of Forest, and Chase; the first are <hi>Silvestres tantum,</hi> the latter <hi>Campestres tantum.</hi> The beasts of the Forest make their abode all the day-time in the great Coverts and secret places in the Woods; and in the night-season they repair into the Lawns, Meadows, Pastures, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant feeding places; and therefore they are called <hi>Silvestres,</hi> Beasts of the Wood. The Beasts of Chase do reside all the day-time in the Fields, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100171:10"/>
upon the Hills or high Mountains, where they may see round about them afar off, to prevent danger; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nights approach they feed as the rest in Meadows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore these are called <hi>Campestres,</hi> Beasts of the Field.</p>
                        <p>Let us in the next place discover their Names, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Degrees, and Ages of Forest or Venery, Chase and Warren: and because the <hi>Hart</hi> is the most noble, worthy, and stately Beast, I shall place him first; and must call a <hi>Hart</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first year, a <hi>Hinde-calf,</hi> or <hi>Calf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second year, a <hi>Knobber.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third year, a <hi>Brocke.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fourth year, a <hi>Staggard.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fifth year, a <hi>Stag.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The sixth year, a <hi>Hart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If hunted by the King, a <hi>Hart Royal.</hi> If he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and Proclamation be made for his safe return without let or detriment, he is then called a <hi>Hart Royal Proclaimed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a vulgar errour, according to the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Guillim,</hi> to think that a <hi>Stag,</hi> of what age soever he be, shall not be called a <hi>Hart</hi> till he be hunted by the King or Queen, and thence he shall derive his Title. Mr. <hi>George Turbervile</hi> saith positively, he shall not obtain that Name till he be hunted or killed by a Prince. But late Huntsmen do agree, he may be called a <hi>Hart</hi> at and after the age of six years old.</p>
                        <p>Now if the King or Queen shall happen to hunt or chase him, and he escape with life, he shall ever after be called a <hi>Hart Royal:</hi> But if he fly so far from the Forest or Chase, that it is unlikely he will ever return of his own accord to the place aforesaid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100171:10"/>
and that Proclamation be made in all Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages thereabouts, that none shall kill or offend him, but that he may safely return if he list; he is then called a <hi>Hart Royal Proclaimed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second Beast of Venery is called a <hi>Hinde.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And she is called the first year, a <hi>Calf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second year, a <hi>Hearse;</hi> and sometimes we say <hi>Broc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets Sister,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The third year, a <hi>Hinde.</hi>

                        <p>The next and third, which by old Foresters is called the King of all Beasts of Venery, is the <hi>Hare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And is called the first year, a <hi>Leveret.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The fourth Beast of Venery is called the <hi>Wilde-Boar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first year, he is a <hi>Pig of the Sounder.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second year, he is a <hi>Hog.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third year, he is a <hi>Hogs Steer.</hi>

                        <p>The fourth year, he is a <hi>Boar;</hi> at which age, if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he leaveth the <hi>Sounder,</hi> and then he is called a <hi>Singler</hi> or <hi>Sanglier.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>No Beast of the Forest that is <hi>Solivagam &amp; nocivum</hi> is Venison, as the <hi>Fox,</hi> the <hi>Wolf,</hi> the <hi>Martin,</hi> because they are no meat. The <hi>Bear</hi> is no Venison, because not onely that he is <hi>Animal nocivum &amp; Solivagam;</hi>
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100171:14"/>
but because he is no beast of the Forest, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is Venison must be a beast of the Forest; <hi>sed non è converso.</hi> On the other side, <hi>Animalia gregalia non sunt nociva,</hi> as the Wilde <hi>Boar;</hi> for naturally the first three years he is <hi>Animal gregale;</hi> and after trusting to his own strength, and for the pleasure of man, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Solivagum.</hi> He is then called <hi>Sanglier,</hi> because he is <hi>Singularis:</hi> but he is Venison, and to be eaten.

                        </p>
                        <p>So are the <hi>Red-Deer</hi> and <hi>Fallow-Deer</hi> Venison: <hi>vide Cook</hi> Inst. 4. pag. 316. Give me leave to insert here out of the same Author two Conclusions in the Law of the Forest, which follow from hence. First, Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Beast of the Forest is for the food of man, that is Venison: and therewith agreeth <hi>Virgil,</hi> describing of a Feast,<q>Implentur Veteris <hi>Bacchi</hi> pinguisque ferinae.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>They had their belly full of Old Wine and Fat Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. So Venison was the principal Dish of the Feast. Secondly, Whatsoever Beast is not for the food of man, is not Venison. Therefore <hi>Capriolus,</hi> or the <hi>Roe,</hi> being no Beast of the Forest, is by the Law of the Forest no Venison unless Hunted. Nature hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed the Beasts of the Forest with two qualities, Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Fear; and their Fear increaseth their Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.<q>— Pedibus timor addidit alas.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vert</hi> is any thing that beareth green Leaf, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of great and thick Coverts, and is derived <hi>à Viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate.</hi>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100171:14"/>
Vert is of divers kinds; some that beareth Fruit that may serve for food both for man and beasts, as <hi>Service-trees, Nut-trees, Crab-trees,</hi> &amp;c. and for the shelter and defence of the Game. Some called <hi>Haut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys,</hi> serving for Food and browse of and for the Game, and for the defence of them; as <hi>Oaks, Beeches,</hi> &amp;c. Some <hi>Hautboys</hi> for Browse, Shelter, and Defence onely; as <hi>Ashes, Poplars,</hi> &amp;c. Of <hi>Sub-boys,</hi> some for Browse and Food of the Game, and for Shelter and Defence; as <hi>Maples,</hi> &amp;c. Some for Browse and Defence; as <hi>Birch, Sallow, Willow,</hi> &amp;c. Some for Shelter and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence onely; as <hi>Elder, Alder,</hi> &amp;c. Of Bushes and other Vegetables, some for Food and Shelter, as the <hi>Hiw-thorn, Black-thorn,</hi> &amp;c. Some for hiding and shelter, as <hi>Brakes, Gorse, Heath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Vert,</hi> as I said, comes <hi>à Viridi;</hi> thence <hi>Viridarii,</hi> because their Office is to look after the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Vert,</hi> which in truth is the preservation of Venison.</p>

                        <p>A <hi>Forest,</hi> is a place priviledged by Royal Authority and differs from Park, Warren, and Chase, and is on purpose allotted for the peaceable abiding and nourishment of the Beasts and Fowls thereto belonging. For which there are certain peculiar Laws, Officers, and Orders; part of which appear in the Great Charter of the Forest.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Forester,</hi> is an Officer of the Forest, sworn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Vert and Venison therein, and to attend the wild beasts within his Bailiwick, and to watch, and endeavour to keep them safe by day and night. He is likewise to apprehend all Offenders in Vert and Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to present them to the Courts of the Forest to the end they may be punished according to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100171:17"/>
                        <p>A <hi>Purlieu,</hi> is all that ground adjoyning to Forests, which being made Forest by <hi>Henry</hi> the second, <hi>Richard</hi> the first, or King <hi>John,</hi> were by perambulations gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and severed again from the same.</p>
                        <p>A Purlieu-man, is he that hath ground within the <hi>Purlieu,</hi> and hath 40 s. a year Free-hold; and such a one with some caution may hunt within his own <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Regarder,</hi> is an Officer of the Kings Forest, that is sworn to take care of the Vert and Venison, and to view and enquire of all the offences committed within the Forest, and of all the Concealments of them; and whether all other Officers do execute their Office or not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Woodgeld,</hi> is the gathering or cutting of Wood in the Forest, or the money paid for it to the use of the Foresters; or an Immunity for this by the King's Grant.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Raunger,</hi> In some Forests there are twelve <hi>Raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> whose Offices are to look after the <hi>Purlieu,</hi> and drive back the wild Beasts into the Forest again; and to see, hear, and enquire of offenders there, and to present their offences.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Verderor,</hi> is an Officer of the King's Forest, and chosen by the Free-holders of the County where the Forest is, by the Kings Writ directed to the Sheriff for that purpose. Their Office is chiefly to look after the Wood and Grass in the Forest.</p>
                        <p>An <hi>Agistor,</hi> is an Officer of the Forest that takes in to feed the Cattle of Strangers, and receives for the Kings use all such tack-Money as becomes due from those Strangers.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Chase,</hi> is a place used for the receipt of <hi>Deer</hi> and Beasts of the Forest: It differs from a Forest and Park. It may be in the hands of a Subject, which a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100171:18"/>
Forest in its proper nature cannot be. Neither is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed as a Park always is; and it hath a larger compass, more store of Game, and more Keepers and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Expeditate,</hi> is (saith Mr. <hi>Crompton</hi>) the cutting out the ball of the Foot of great Dogs in the Forest; but (saith Mr. <hi>Manwood</hi>) it is the cutting off the three fore-Claws by the Skin; and that the owner of every such Dog, unexpeditated in the Forest, shall forfeit <hi>3s. 4d.</hi>

                     <p>AS there is no Country in the World wherein there is not plenty of Dogs, so no Animal can boast of greater variety both in shape and kind.</p>
                     <p>Some Dogs are very great, as the Wolf-dog, which is shaped like a Grey-hound, but by much taller, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thicker; some are for the <hi>Buck,</hi> others for the <hi>Boar, Bear,</hi> and <hi>Bull;</hi> some for the <hi>Hare, Coney,</hi> and <hi>Hedge-hog;</hi> some are both for Water and Land, and they are called Spaniels; other are called Lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Tumblers, Brachers, Beagles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Dogs, foisting Curs, and such whom some fond Ladies make their daily, nay nightly Companions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100171:19"/>
too, I shall pass over, being neither worthy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in this Subject, nor agreeable thereunto: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall onely treat of such whose natures do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to Game, for mans Pastime and Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>In the first place, let us consider the Nature of Dogs in general, wherein they agree, and their common properties of Nature, such as are not destroyed in the distinction of kinds, but remain like infallible Truths, and invariable in every kind and Country through the Universe. Dogs (as it is to be observed) are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally rough; and their Hair indifferently long (which in Winter they lose every year) is a signe of a good constitution; but if it grow over-long, the Mange will follow. The outward proportion of the Head altereth as the kind altereth, having no commissure or seam in the Skull, being a continued bone without separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>The best Dogs (in <hi>Pliny's</hi> Opinion) have flat Nostrils, yet round, solid, and blunt: Their Teeth are like Saws, which they change in the fourth month of their age: and by them is their age discerned; for while they are white and sharp, it discovers the youth of a Dog; but when they grow blackish or dusky, broken and torn, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the elder age.</p>
                     <p>The Breast of a Dog is narrow, so is his Ventricle: for which cause he is always in pain in the discharging his Excrements.</p>
                     <p>After they have run a Course, they relieve themselves by tumbling and rowling to and fro. When they lie down, they turn round in a circle two or three times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which they do for no other cause, but that they may the more commodiously lie round, and from the Wind.</p>
                     <p>In their sleep they often dream, as may appear by their barking. Here observe, that they who love to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100171:20"/>
keep Dogs, must have a special care that they let them not sleep too much, especially after their Meat, when they are young: for as they are very hot, so in their sleep doth their heat draw much pain into their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and Ventricle. The time of their Copulation is for the most part at a year old; yet the Females will lust after it sooner; but they should be restrained from it, because it debilitates their Body, and dulls their Generofity. After the expiration of a year, they may be permitted to copulate; it matters not whether in Winter or Summer, but it is best in the beginning of the Spring: but with this caution, that Whelps of a Litter, or of one and the same Bitch, be never suffered to couple; for Nature delights in varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>In antient time, for the more ennobling of their race of Dogs, they would not permit them to ingender till the Male was four year old, and the Female three; for by that means the Whelps would prove more strong and lively. By Hunting, Labour, and Travel, the Males are made more fit for Generation, and they prove best which have their Siers of equal age. When they grow proud, give them Leaven mingled with Milk and Salt, and they will not stray and ramble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
                     <p>It is not good to preserve the first or second Litter, but the third: and after they have littered, it is good to give the Bitch Whey and Barley-bread; for that will comfort her, and increase her Milk: or take the Bones of broken Meat, and seeth them in Goats-Milk: which nutriment will strengthen very much both Dam and Whelps.</p>
                     <p>There is no great regard to be had as to the Food of a Dog, for he will eat any thing but the Flesh of his own kinde; for that cannot be so dressed by the art of Man, but they find it out by their Nose, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100171:20"/>
avoid it. It is good to let the Whelps suck two Months before they be weaned, and that of their own Dam.</p>
                     <p>Put <hi>Cummin</hi> now and then in their bread, it will cure or prevent Wind in their bellies; and if Oyl be mingled with that Water they lap, they will prove more able and swift to run. If he refuse and loath his Meat, give him a little hot Bread, or dip brown Bread in Vinegar, and sqeeze the liquor thereof into his Nose, and it will ease him.</p>
                     <p>There is some difficulty to chuse a Whelp under the Dam that will prove the best of the Litter. Some observe that which seeth last, and take that for the best: others remove the Whelps from the Kennel, and lay them several and apart one from the other; then watch they which of them the Bitch first taketh and carrieth into her Kennel again, and that they take for the best; or else that which vomiteth last of all. Some again give for a certain rule to know the best, that the same which weigheth least while it suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will prove the best, according to the Verses of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesian:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Pondere nam Catuli poteris perpendere viris,</l>
                        <l>Corporibusque leves gravibus pernoscere cursu.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>But this is certain, that the lighter Whelp will prove the swifter, and the heavier will be the stronger.</p>
                     <p>As soon as as the Bitch hath littered, it is requisite to chuse them you intend to preserve, and throw away the rest: keep the black, brown, or of one colour, for the spotted are not much to be accounted of; but of Hounds, spotted are to be valued.</p>
                     <p>There is not any Creature irrational, more loving to his Master, nor more serviceable than a Dog, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during blows from his hands, and using no other means
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100171:21"/>
to pacifie his displeasure, than Humiliation and prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and after beating, turneth a Revenge into a more fervent Love. Irrational, did I say,? I may mistake, if what <hi>AElianus</hi> reports be true, who thought Dogs have Reason, and use Logick in their Hunting; for they will cast about for the Game, as a Disputant doth for the truth; as if they should say, the <hi>Hare</hi> is gone either on the left hand, the right, or straight forward; but not on the left or right, Therefore straight forward. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he runneth forthright after the true and infallible footsteps of the <hi>Hare.</hi>

                           <hi>Of</hi> Dogs <hi>for Hunting. Of the Hound</hi> Rache <hi>and</hi> SLUTH-HOUND, <hi>so called in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and by the</hi> Germans SCHLATHUND.</head>
                        <p>THere are to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> two kindes of Hunting-Dogs, and no where else in all the World: The first kind is called <hi>Ane Rache,</hi> and this is a Foot-scenting creature both of wild Beasts, Birds, and Fishes also, which lie hid among the Rocks: <hi>The Female hereof in</hi> England <hi>is called a</hi> Brache. A <hi>Brach,</hi> is a mannerly name for all Hound-Bitches. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in <hi>Scotland</hi> is called a <hi>Sluth-hound,</hi> being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle greater than the Hunting-Hound, and in colour for the most part brown or sandy spotted. The sense of Smelling is so quick in these, that they can follow the Foot-steps of Thieves, and pursue them with violence until they overtake them: nay, should the Thief take the Water, so eager they are in their pursuit, that they will swim after them; and are restless till they find the thing they seek after: For this is common in the Borders
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100171:21"/>
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the people were wont to live much upon Theft: and if the Dog brought his Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to any house where they may not be suffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they take it for granted that there is both the stolen Goods, and the Thief also.</p>

                           <hi>Of the</hi> BLOOD-HOUND.</head>
                        <p>THe Blood-hound differeth nothing in quality from the Scotish Sluth-hound, saving that they are more largely sized, and not always of one and the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: for they are sometimes Red, Sanded, Black, White, Spotted, and of all colours with other Hounds, but most commonly either brown or red.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> call this beast <hi>Langhund,</hi> because their Ears are long, thin, and hanging down; and they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not from vulgar Dogs in any other outward propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than onely in their Cry and Barking. Their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, being set on by the voice and words of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to cast about for the sitting of the present Game; and having found it, will never cease pursuing it with full cry, till it is tired, without changing for any other. They seldome bark, except in their Chase, and are very obedient and attentive to the Voice of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p>They which are white, are said to be the quickest scented, and surest Nos'd, and therefore best for the <hi>Hare:</hi> The black ones for the <hi>Boar;</hi> and the red for the <hi>Hart</hi> and <hi>Roe.</hi> This is the Opinion of some, but none of mine; because their colour (especially the latter) are too like the Game they Hunt: although there can be nothing certain collected of their colour, yet is the black Hound hardier, and better able to endure cold than the other which is white. They
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100171:22"/>
must be tied up till they hunt, yet so as they be let loose now and then a little to ease their Bellies; for it is necessary that their Kennel be kept sweet and dry. It is questionable how to discern a Hound of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sense: yet some are of the Opinion that the square and flat Nose is the best signe thereof; likewise a small Head, having all his Legs of equal length; his Breast not deeper than his Belly, and his Back plain to his Tail; his Eyes quick, his Ears hanging long; his Tail nimble, and the beak of his Nose always to the Earth; and especially such as are most silent, and bark least.</p>
                        <p>Consider now the divers and variable dispositions of Hounds in their finding out the Beast. Some are of that nature, that when they have found the Game, they will stand still till the Huntsman come up, to whom in silence, by their Face, Eye, and Tail, they shew the Game: others, when they have found the foot-steps, go forward without any voice or other shew of Ear or Tail: Another sort when, when they have found the footings of the Beast, prick up their Ears a little, and either bark or wag their Tails; and others will wag their Tails, and not move their Ears.</p>
                        <p>There are some again that do none of these, but wander up and down barking about the surest marks, and confounding their own foot-steps with the Beasts they hunt; or else forsake the way, and so run back again to the first head; but when they see the <hi>Hare,</hi> are affraid, not daring to come near her, except she start first. These, with the other which hinder the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning labours of their Colleagues, trusting to their Feet, and running before their betters, deface the best mark, or else hunt counter, and take up any false scent for the truth; or, which is more reprehensible, never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the High-ways, and yet have not learned to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100171:22"/>
silent: Unto these you may also adde those which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern the Footing or Pricking of a <hi>Hare,</hi> yet will they run speedy when they see her, pursuing her hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning, and afterwards tire, or hunt lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All these are not to be admitted into a Kennel of good Hounds.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, those Hounds which are good when they have found the <hi>Hare,</hi> make shew thereof to the Huntsman, by running more speedily, and with gesture of Head, Eyes, Ears, and Tail, winding to the Fourm or <hi>Hares</hi> Muse, never give over prosecution with a gallant noise: they have good and hard Feet, and stately Stomacks.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas the nature of the <hi>Hare</hi> is sometimes to leap and make headings, sometimes to tread softly with but a very small impression in the Earth, or sometimes to lie down, and ever to leap or jump out and into her own Form, the poor Hound is so much the more busied and troubled to retain the small scent of her pricking which she leaveth behinde her; for this cause it is requisite that you help the Hound, not onely with Voice, Eye, and Hand, but with a seasonable Time also: for in frosty weather the scent freezeth with the Earth, so that there is no certainty of hunting till it thaw, or that the Sun arise. Likewise if very much Rain fall between the starting of the <hi>Hare</hi> and time of hunting, it is not convenient to hunt till the Water be dried up; for the drops disperse the scent of the <hi>Hare,</hi> and dry weather collecteth it again. The Summer-time also is not for hunting, because the heat of the weather consurneth the scent; and the night being then but short, the <hi>Hare</hi> travelleth not far, feeding onely in the morning and evening: besides, the fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Flowers and Herbs then growing, obliterates the scent the Hounds are guided by.</p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100171:23"/>
                        <p>The best time for hunting with these Hounds is in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, because then the former Odours are weakned, and the Earth barer than at other time.</p>
                        <p>These Hounds do not onely chase their Game while it liveth, but being dead also by any manner of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty, make recourse to the place where it lieth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in this point an assured and infallible Guide, namely, the <hi>Scent</hi> and <hi>Savour</hi> of the Blood sprinkled here and there upon the ground: for whether the Beast being wounded doth notwithstanding enjoy life, and escapeth the hands of the Huntsman; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the said Beast, being slain, is conveyed cleanly out of the Park, (so that there be some marks of bloodshed) these Dogs, with no less facility and easiness, than avidity and greediness, disclose and bewray the same by Smelling, applying to their pursuit agility and nimbleness, without tediousness; for which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, of a singular speciality they deserved to be called <hi>Sanguinarii,</hi> Blood-Hounds: And although a piece of flesh be subtilly stolen, and cunningly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed away, with such proviso's and precaveats, as thereby all appearances of Bloud is thereby prevented or concealed; yet these kind of Dogs, by certain direction of an inward assured notice and private mark, pursue these desperate Deer-stealers through craggy Ways, and crooked Meanders, till they have found them out: yea, so effectual is their foresight, that they can discover, separate, and pick them out from an infinite multitude; creep they never so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thickest throng, they will find them out notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>

                        <p>This Dog will chuse and separate from amongst a great Flock or Herd, and such a one will it take by election, as is not lank or lean, but full, fat, and round.</p>
                        <p>If a Beast be wounded and go astray, this Dog will seek after it by the sreadfastness of the Eye; if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to return, and be mingled with the residue of the Herd, this Dog will soon spy it out, leaving the rest untouched: and after he hath set sure sight upon it, he separateth it from the company; and having so done, never ceaseth till he hath wearied it to death.</p>
                        <p>This Dog is called in Latine <hi>Agasaeus,</hi> because the beams of the Sight are so stedfastly setled, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably fastned. These Dogs are much used in the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> much more than in the Southern; and on Champion ground rather than in bushy and woody places: Horsemen use them more than Footmen.</p>
                        <p>If it happen so at any time that this Dog take a wrong way, the Master making some usual signe, and familiar token, he returneth forthwith, and taketh the right and ready course, beginning his Ghase afresh, and with a clear Voice, and a swift Foot, followeth the Game with as much courage and nimbleness as he did at the first.</p>

                        <p>The best time to try them and train them to their Game, is at twelve Months old; yet some begin sooner with them, that is, at ten Months if they are Males, and at eight if Females: yet it is surest not to strain them, or permit them to run a long Course, till they be twenty Moneths old. Keep them also in the Slip while they are abroad, until they can see their Course; and loosen not a young Dog, until the Game have been on foot for a good season, lest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-greedy of the Prey, he strain his limbs too much.</p>

                           <hi>Of the</hi> HARRIER <hi>and</hi> TERRIER.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Harrier</hi> in Latine is called <hi>Leverarius,</hi> or <hi>Sagax;</hi> by the Greeks, <hi>Ichneuten,</hi> of tracing or chasing by the Foot.</p>
                        <p>Nature hath endewed this Creature with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable gift of Smelling, and is bold and courageous in the pursuit of his Game. There are several sorts of them, and all differ in their Services: some are for the <hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Fox,</hi> the <hi>Wolf,</hi> the <hi>Hart,</hi> the <hi>Buck,</hi> the <hi>Badger,</hi> the <hi>Otter,</hi> the <hi>Polecat,</hi> the <hi>Weasle,</hi> the <hi>Coney,</hi> &amp;c. some for one thing, some for another.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Coney,</hi> we use not to hunt, but take it sometimes with a Net, sometimes with a <hi>Ferret,</hi> and sometimes with a Lurcher or Tumbler. Among the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of <hi>Harriers,</hi> there are some which are apt to hunt two divers Beasts, as the <hi>Fox</hi> sometimes, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles the <hi>Hare;</hi> but they hunt not with that good success and towardness, who stick not to one sort of Game.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Terrier</hi> hunteth the <hi>Fox</hi> and the <hi>Badger</hi> or <hi>Grey</hi> onely: And they are called <hi>Terriers,</hi> because they (after the manner and cusiom of <hi>Ferrets</hi> in searching. for <hi>Coneys</hi>) creep into the ground, and by that means affright, nip, and bite the <hi>Fox</hi> and the <hi>Badger,</hi> in such sort, that either they tear them in pieces with their Teeth, (being in the bosome of the Earth) or else hale and pull them by force out of their lurking Angles, dark Dungeons, and close Caves; or at the least, through conceived fear, drive them out of their hollow Harbours, insomuch, if they are not taken by Net or otherwise, they are compelled to prepare for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100171:25"/>
flight; and being desirous of the next, though not the safest refuge, they are oft-times entrapped with Snares and Nets laid over Holes for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

This is as it where a middle kinde between the <hi>Harrier</hi> and the <hi>Grey-Hound,</hi> as well for his kinde, as the frame and shape of his Body. It is called in Latine <hi>Levinarius, à Levitate,</hi> of lightness, and therefore may well be called a <hi>Light-Hound.</hi> This Dog, for the excellency of his Conditions, namely, Smelling, and swift Running, doth follow the Game with more eagerness, and taketh the Prey with a jolly quickness.</p>

                           <hi>Of the</hi> TUMBLER.</head>
                        <p>THe word <hi>Tumbler</hi> undoubtedly had its derivation from the French word <hi>Tumbier,</hi> which signifies to Tumble; to which the Latine name agrees, <hi>Vertagus,</hi> from <hi>Vertere</hi> to turn, and so they do: for in Hunting they turn and tumble, winding their Bodies about cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and then fiercely and violently venturing on the Beast, do suddenly gripe it at the very entrance or mouth of their Holes or Receptacles, before they can make any recovery of self-security.</p>
                        <p>This Dog useth another craft and subtilty, namely,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100171:26"/>
when he runneth into a Warren, or fetcheth a course about a <hi>Coney</hi>-borough, he hunts not after them, he no ways affrights them, he shews no spight against them; but dissembling friendship, and pretending fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, passeth by with silence and quietness, marking their Holes diligently, wherein he seldom is deceived. When he cometh to a place where there is a certainty of <hi>Coneys,</hi> he coucheth down close with his Belly to the ground, provided always by his Skill and Policy that the Wind be against him in that Enterprize, and that the <hi>Coneys,</hi> discover him not where he lurketh; by which means he gets the benefit of the scent of the <hi>Coneys,</hi> which is carried to him by the Wind and Air, either going to their Holes, or coming out, either passing this way, or running that way; and so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the business by his circumspection, that the silly <hi>Coney</hi> is debarred quite from his Hole, (which is the Haven of their hope, and the Harbour of their safety) and fraudulently circumvented and taken before they can get the advantage of their Holes. Thus having caught his Prey, he carrieth it speedily to his Master, waiting his Dogs return in some convenient lurking corner.</p>
                        <p>These Dogs are somewhat lesser than the Hounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lanker, leaner, and somewhat prick-ear'd. By the form and fashion of their Bodies they may be justly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mungrel-Grey-hounds,</hi> if they were somewhat big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But notwithstanding they countervail not the <hi>Grey-hound</hi> in greatness, yet will he take in one days space as many <hi>Coneys</hi> as shall arise to as big a burthen, and as heavy a load as a Horse can cary: For Craft and Subtilty are the Instruments whereby he maketh this spoil, which pernicious properties supply the places of more commendable qualities.</p>
                        <p>Let this suffice for a taste: now, after such Dogs as serve Hunting, will follow such as serve for Hawking
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100171:26"/>
and Fowling; among which, the principal and chiefest is the <hi>Spaniel,</hi> called in Latine <hi>Hispaniolus,</hi> borrowing his name from <hi>Hispania;</hi> wherein we English-men, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Aspiration <hi>H,</hi> nor the Vowel <hi>I,</hi> for quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and readiness of speech, say, <hi>Spaniel.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>THere are two sorts of Dogs which necessarily serve for Fowling. The first findeth Game on the Land, the other on the Water. Such as delight on the Land, play their parts either by swiftness of foot, or by often questing to search out and to spring the Bird for further hope of reward, or else by some secret signe and privy token, discover the place where they fall. The first kinde of such serve the <hi>Hawk;</hi> the second, the Net or Train. The first kinde have no peculiar names assigned them, except they are named after the Bird which by natural appointment he is allotted to take; for which consideration, some are called Dogs for the <hi>Falcon,</hi> the <hi>Pheasant,</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> and such-like: they are commonly called by one name, <hi>viz. Spaniels,</hi> as if they originally came from <hi>Spain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniel,</hi> whose service is required in Fowling on the Water, partly through natural inclination, and partly by diligently teaching, is properly called <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> as <hi>Water-Spaniel,</hi> because he hath usual recourse to the Water, where all his Game lieth, namely, Water-fowl, which are taken by their help in their kind.</p>
                        <p>His size is somewhat big, and of a measurable great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, having long, rough, and curled Hair, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100171:27"/>
must be clipt in due season: for by lessening that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of Hair, they become more light and swist, and are less hindred in swimming. <hi>Ducks</hi> and <hi>Drakes</hi> are his principal Game; whereupon he is likewise named a Dog for a <hi>Duck,</hi> because in that quality he is excellent.</p>

                        <p>THose Hounds which are all of one colour, as all white, are the best Hounds; in like manner those which are spotted with red: but those which are spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a dun colour, are of little value, being faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and cannot endure much labour. But should they happen to be whelpt coal-black, which is but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they commonly prove incomparable Hounds. But if white Hounds are spotted with black, experience tells us, they are never the best Hare-hunters. White, and black and white, and grey streak'd white, are also the most beautiful.</p>

                        <p>THey are hardy, and of good scent, keeping well their Chase without change; but not so swift as the white. They are of a strong constitution, and do not fear the Water; running surely, and are very hardy, commonly loving the <hi>Hart</hi> beyond any other Chase.</p>
                        <p>The best complexion for these <hi>Fallow-Hounds,</hi> is the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100171:27"/>
lively red, and such as have a white spot in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or have a Ring about their Neck: but those which are yellowish, and spotted with black or dun, are of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle estimation. Those which are well joynted, having good Claws, are fit to make Blood-hounds: and those which have shagged Tails, are generally swift runners. These Hounds are fitter for Princes than private Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, because they seldom run more than one Chace; neither have they any great stomack to the <hi>Hare</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther small Chases: and, which is worst of all, they are apt to run at tame Beasts.</p>

                        <p>THese are good for all Chases, and therefore of general use. The best coloured are such as are dun on the Back, having their four quarters tann'd, or of the complexion of a <hi>Hare's</hi> Legs: But if the Hair on the Back be black, and their Legs freckled with red and black, they then usually prove excellent Hounds: and indeed there are few dun-coloured to be found bad; the worst of them are such whose Legs are of a whitish colour. It is wonderful, in these creatures, to observe how much they stick upon the knowledge of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, especially his Voice, and Horn, and none's else. Nay, farther, they know the distinct Voices of their Fellows, and do know who are Babblers and Liars, and who not; and will follow the one, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Now for Hounds, the West-country, <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and <hi>Lancashire,</hi> with other Wood-land and Mountainous Countries, breed our <hi>Slow-hound;</hi> which is a large great Dog, tall and heavy. <hi>Worcester-shire, Bedford-shire,</hi>

and many well-mixt soils, where the Champaign and Covert are of equal largeness, produce a middle-sized Dog, of a more nimble composure than the former. Lastly, the North-parts, as <hi>York-shire, Cumberland, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> and many other plain Champaign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, breed the Light, Nimble, Swift, Slender, Fleet Hound. After all these, the little Beagle is attributed to our Country; this is that Hound, which in Latine is called <hi>Canis Agasaeus,</hi> or the <hi>Gaze-hound.</hi> Besides our Mastiff, which seems to be an <hi>Indigena,</hi> or Native of <hi>England,</hi> we train up most excellent Grey-hounds (which seem to have been brought hither by the <hi>Galls</hi>) in our open Champaigns.

                        <p>Your Bitch must come of a good kind, being strong, and well proportioned in all parts, having her Ribs and Flanks great and large. Let the Dog that lines her be of a good fair breed; and let him be young, if you intend to have light and hot Hounds: for if the Dog be old, the Whelps will participate of his Dull and heavy nature.</p>
                        <p>If your Bitch grow not naturally Proud so soon as you would have, you may make her so, by taking two heads of Garlick, half a Gastor's Stone, the juice of Cresses, and about twelve Spanish Flies, or Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides: boil these together in a Pipkin which holds a pint, with some Mutton, and make Broth thereof; and of this give to the Bitch twice or thrice, and she will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly grow proud. The same Pottage given to the Dog, will make him desirous of copulation.</p>
                        <p>When your Bitch is lined, and with Puppy, you must not let her hunt, for that will be the way to make her cast her Whelps; but let her unconfined walk up and down in the House and Court, and never lock her up in her Kennel; for she is then impatient of food; and therefore you must make her some hot Broth once a day.</p>
                        <p>If you would spay your Bitch, it must be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she ever had Litter of Whelps: And in spaying her, take not away all the Roots or Strings of the Veins; for if you do, it will much prejudice her Reins, and hinder her swiftness ever after: but by leaving some behinde, it will make her much the stronger and more hardy. Whatever you do, spay her not when she is proud; for that will endanger her life: but you may do
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100171:29"/>
it fifteen days after. But the best time of all is, when the Whelps are shaped within her.</p>

and if you find any of them lag behinde, you must beat or whip them forward.</p>
                        <p>In what place soever you kill the <hi>Hart,</hi> immediately flay his Neck, and reward your Hounds: for it is best whilst it is hot so to do.</p>
                        <p>There are several ways of entring Hounds. As first, by taking a <hi>Hart</hi> in Nets, and after you have cut off one of his Feet, let him go: a quarter of an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, assemble your young Hounds; and having found out the View or Slot of the <hi>Hart</hi> or <hi>Buck</hi> by your Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, uncouple your young Hounds, and let them hunt. Secondly, you may bring them to quarry, by taking half a dozen Huntsmen, swift of foot, each whereof shall have two couple to lead in Liams; and having unlodg'd the <hi>Hart,</hi> pursue him fair and softly, so that you tire not too much your young Hounds. After the <hi>Hart</hi> hath ran two or three hours, and that you find he begins to sink, you may then cast off your young Hounds: but beware it be not when he is at Bay, and his Head full summed; for so you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the lives of your Hounds.</p>
                        <p>But the best way of entring Hounds is at the Hare; for thereby they will learn all Doubles and Turns, better know the Hallow, will be more tender-nosed, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter scented, by using the beaten ways and Champion grounds.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that with whatsoever you first enter your Hounds, and therewith reward them, they will ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love that most. Wherefore, if you intend them for the <hi>Hart,</hi> enter them not first with the <hi>Hinde.</hi> And for the better hunting the <hi>Hart,</hi> enter not your young Hounds within a Toil; for there a <hi>Hart</hi> doth nothing but turn and cast about, since he cannot run end-long, and so they are always in sight of him. If then afterwards you should run him at force out of a Toil, and at length, and out of sight, you will find the Hounds to give him over quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100171:30"/>
                        <p>Lastly, enter not your Hounds nor teach them in the Morning; for if so, you will find them apt to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the heat of the day.</p>

                        <hi>Of</hi> COURSING <hi>with</hi> Grey-Hounds.</head>
                     <p>I Need not declare the Excellencies which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the noble and worthy Exercise of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with <hi>Grey-hounds,</hi> since it is so well known to all Gentlemen who take delight in this pleasant and healthy Pastime: I shall therefore onely insist upon the breed of <hi>Grey-hounds,</hi> their Shape, their Diet, and the Laws belonging to the same, according as they were commanded, allowed, and subscribed by the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, for the Breeding of <hi>Grey-Hounds,</hi> in this you must have respect to the Country, which should be Champain, Plain, or high Downs. The best Valleys are those of <hi>Belvoir, White-horse,</hi> and <hi>Evesholm,</hi> or any other where there are no Coverts, so that a <hi>Hare</hi> may stand forth and endure a Course of two or three miles: as for high Downs or Heaths, the best are about <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, Salisbury, Cirencester,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though these places are very commodious for the breeding and training up of <hi>Grey-Hounds;</hi> yet, in my opinion, the middle, or most part arable grounds are the best: and yet those Gentlemen who dwell on Downs or plain grounds, to keep up the reputation of their own Dogs, affirm, that they are more nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cunning in turning than the Vale-Dogs are and Mr. <hi>Markham</hi> confesseth that he hath seen a Vale-Dog so much deceived, that upon a turn he hath
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100171:30"/>
lost more ground than hath been recoverable in the whole Course after: however, with a little care, in a short time this errour may be rectified; and then you will experimentally find <hi>The good Dogs upon the Deeps will ever beat the good Dogs upon the Plains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a received opinion, that the Grey-hound-Bitch will beat the Grey-hound-Dog, by reason the excelleth him in nimbleness: but if you consider that the Dog is longer and stronger, you must look upon that opinion no more than as a vulgar errour.</p>
                     <p>Here note, as to the breeding of your <hi>Grey-hounds,</hi> that the best Dog upon an indifferent Bitch, will not get so good a Whelp as an indifferent Dog upon the best Bitch.</p>
                     <p>Observe this in general as to breeding, let your Dogs and Bitches, as near as you can, be of an equal age, not exceeding four years old: however, to breed with a young Dog and an old Bitch, may be the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing excellent Whelps, the goodness whereof you shall know by their Shapes in this manner.</p>
                     <p>If they are raw-bon'd, lean, loose-made, sickle or crooked-hough'd, and generally unknit in every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; these are the proper marks of excellent shape and goodness: but if after three or four months they appear round and close-trust, fat, straight, and as it were full summed and knit in every Member, they never prove good, swift, nor comely.</p>
                     <p>The goodness of shape in a <hi>Grey-hound</hi> after a year and a half old, is this: his Head must be lean and long, with a sharp Nose, rush-grown from the Eye down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; a full clear Eye, with long Eye-lids; a sharp Ear, short and close falling; a long Neck a little bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a loose hanging Weasand; a broad Breast, straight Fore-legs, hollow Side, straight Ribs; a square slat Back, short and strong Fillets, a broad space between the Hips, a strong Stern or Tail, a round Foot, and good large Clefts.</p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:100171:31"/>
                     <p>The Dieting of <hi>Grey-Hounds</hi> consists in these four things: <hi>Food, Exercise, Airing,</hi> and <hi>Kennelling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Food of a <hi>Grey-hound</hi> is two fold: general, that is, the maintaining of a Dog in good bodily condition; and particular, when the Dog is dieted for a Wager, or it may be for some Distemper he is afflicted with.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Grey-hound's</hi> general Food ought to be Chippings, Crusts of Bread, soft Bones and Gristles. Your Chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings ought to be scalded in Beef, Mutton, Veal or Venison-Broth; and when it is indifferent cool, then make your Bread onely float with good Milk, and give it your <hi>Grey-hounds</hi> Morning and Evening; and this will keep them in good state of body.</p>
                     <p>But if your Dog be poor, sickly, and weak, then take Sheeps-heads, Wool and all, clean wash'd, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broken them to pieces, put them into a Pot; and when it boils, scum the Pot, and put therein good store of Oatmeal, and such Herbs as Pottage is usually made of; boil these till the Flesh be very tender: then with the Meat and Broth feed your Dogs Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and it will recover them.</p>
                     <p>If you designe your <hi>Grey-Hound</hi> for a Wager, then give him this Diet-bread: Take half a peck of the finest and driest Oat-meal, and a peck of good Wheat, having ground them together, boult the Meal, and scattering an indifferent quantity of Liquorish and Anniseeds well beaten together; knead it up with the Whites of Eggs, new Ale and Barm mix'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and bake it in small Loaves indifferent hard; then take it and soak it in Beef or any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Broths; and half an hour after Sun-rising, and half an hour before its setting, having first walke and air'd your <hi>Grey-hound,</hi> give it him to eat. This will not onely increase his strength, but enlarge his Wind.</p>
                     <p>Having thus spoken of a <hi>Grey-Hound's</hi> Feeding,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100171:31"/>
either generally or particularly, either for keeping him in health, or restoring it when it is lost, I shall in the next place proceed to his Exercise; and this likewise consists in two things, that is, Coursing, and Airing.</p>
                     <p>As to the first, he ought to be Coursed thrice a week, in such manner that you usually reward him with Blood, which will animate and encourage him to prosecute his Game: but be not unmindful to give the <hi>Hare</hi> all just and lawful advantage, so that she may stand long before the <hi>Grey-hound,</hi> that thereby he may shew his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most strength and skill before he reap the benefit of his labour.</p>
                     <p>If he kill, suffer him not to break the <hi>Hare,</hi> but take her from him; and having cleans'd his Chaps from the Wool of the <hi>Hare,</hi> then give him the Liver, Lights, and Heart, and so take him up in your Leash; and having led him home, wash his Feet with some Butter and Beer, and then put him into the Kennel, and feed him half an hour afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Upon your <hi>Grey-hounds</hi> Coursing-days, give him in the Morning before you air him, a Toast and Butter or Oyl, and nothing else; then Kennel him till he go to his Course.</p>
                     <p>The reason of Kennelling your <hi>Grey-hounds</hi> is this, because it breeds in Dogs Lust, Spirit, and Nimbleness; besides, it prevents several dangerous Casualties, and keeps the Pores from spending till time of necessity: and therefore do not permit your Dog to stir out of the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel but in the hours of Feeding, Walking, Coursing, or other necessary business.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>First, it was ordered, that he who was chosen <hi>Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,</hi> or Letter-loose of the <hi>Grey-hounds,</hi> should receive the <hi>Grey-hounds</hi> Match to run together into his Leash as soon as he came into the Field, and follow next to the <hi>Hare-finder</hi> till he came unto the Form: and no Horse-man or Foot-man, on pain of disgrace, to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, or on any side, but directly behinde, the space of forty yards or thereabouts.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That not above one Brace of <hi>Grey-hounds</hi> do course a <hi>Hare</hi> at one instant.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Hare-finder</hi> should give the <hi>Hare</hi> three <hi>Sohoe's</hi> before he put her from her <hi>Lear,</hi> to make the <hi>Grey-hounds</hi> gaze and attend her rising.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Fewterer</hi> shall give twelve-score Law ere he loose the <hi>Grey-hounds,</hi> except it be in danger of losing sight.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That Dog that giveth the first <hi>Turn,</hi> if after the Turn be given there be neither <hi>Coat, Slip,</hi> nor <hi>Wrench</hi> extraordinary; I say, he which gave the first <hi>Turn</hi> shall be held to win the Wager.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If one Dog give the first <hi>Turn,</hi> and the other bear the <hi>Hare,</hi> then he which bare the <hi>Hare</hi> shall win.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If one give both the first and last <hi>Turn,</hi> and no other advantage be between them, the odde <hi>Turn</hi> shall win the Wager.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That a <hi>Coat</hi> shall be more than two <hi>Turns,</hi> and a <hi>Go-by,</hi> or the <hi>Bearing</hi> of the <hi>Hare</hi> equal with two <hi>Turns.</hi>

                        <p n="13">13. If any Dog shall take a fall in the Course, and yet perform his part, he shall challenge the advantage of a <hi>Turn</hi> more than he giveth.</p>

                     <head>Of the Stiles of Hunting different from the English both Antique and Forrein.</head>
                     <p>THe Hunting used by the Antients was much like that way which is at present taken with the <hi>Rain-Deer,</hi> which is seldom hunted at force or with Hounds, but onely drawn after with a Blood-hound, and forestall'd with Nets and Engines. So did they with all Beasts, and therefore a Dog is never commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them for opening before he hath by signes disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered where the Beast lieth in his <hi>Layre,</hi> as by their drawing stiff our Harbourers are brought to give right judgement. Therefore I do not finde that they were curious in the Musick of their Hounds, or in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of their Kennel or Pack, either for deepness, or loudness, or sweetness of cry like to ours. Their Huntsmen were accustomed to shout and make a great noise, as <hi>Virgil</hi> observes in the third of his <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks:</hi>
                        <q>Ingentem clamore premes ad retia Cervum.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that it was onely with that confusion to bring the <hi>Deer</hi> to the Nets laid for him.</p>
                     <p>But we comfort our Hounds with loud and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Cries and Noises, both of Voice and Horn, that they may follow over the same way that they saw the <hi>Hart</hi> pass, without crossing or coasting.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sicilian</hi> way of Hunting was this: when the Nobles or Gentry were informed which way a Herd of <hi>Deer</hi> passed, giving notice to one another, they appointed a meeting, and every one brought with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100171:33"/>
him a Cross-bow, or a Long bow, and a bundle of Staves. These Staves had an Iron-spike at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and their Head is bored, with a Cord drawn through all of them; their length is about four foot: Being thus provided, they come to the Herd, and there casting themselves about into a large Ring, they sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the <hi>Deer;</hi> and then every one of them receives a peculiar stand, and there, unbinding his Faggot, ties the end of his Cord to the other who is set in the next station; then to support it, sticks into the ground each Staff, about the distance of ten foot one from the other. Then they take out Feathers, which they bring with them, dyed in Crimson for this very purpose, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stned upon a Thred which is tied to the Cord, so that with the least breath of wind they are whirled round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Those which keep the several Stands, withdraw and hide themselves in the next Covert. After this, the chief Ranger enters within the Line, taking with him onely such Hounds which draw after the Herd; and coming near with their cry, rouze them: Upon which the <hi>Deer</hi> fly till they come towards the Line, where they turn off towards the left, and still gazing upon the shaking and shining Feathers, wander about them as if they were kept in with a Wall or Pale. The chief Ranger pursues, and calling to every one by name, as he passeth by their Stand, cries to them, that they shoot the first, third, or sixth, as he shall please; and if any of them miss, and single out any other than that which was assigned by the Ranger, it is counted a disgrace to him: by which means, as they pass by the several Stations, the whole Herd is killed by several hands. This Relation is of undoubted truth, as you may finde it in <hi>Pierius</hi> his <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> Lib. 7. Chap. 6.</p>
                     <p>Boar-hunting is very usual in <hi>France,</hi> and they call it <hi>Sangtier.</hi> In this sort of Hunting the way is to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100171:34"/>
use furious terrible Sounds and Noises, as well of Voice as Horn, to make the Chase turn and fly; because they are slow, and trust to their Tusks and defence: which is <hi>Agere Aprum,</hi> to bait the <hi>Boar.</hi> Yet this must be done after his Den or Hold is discovered, and the Nets be pitched.</p>
                     <p>The Huntsmen give judgement of the <hi>Wild-Boar</hi> by the print of his Foot, by his Rooting. A wild Swine roots deeper than our ordinary Hogs, because their Snouts are longer; and when he comes into a Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, (as the <hi>Caledonian-Boar</hi> in <hi>Ovid</hi>) turns up one continued Furrow, not as our Hogs, routing here and there; and then by his soil he soils and wallows him in the myre: these are his <hi>Volutabra Silvestria,</hi> where his greatness is measured out; then coming forth, he rubs against some Tree, which marks his height; as also when he sticks his Tusk into it, that shews the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof. They observe the bigness of his Lesses, and the depth of his Den; where note, that they call his Dung by the name of <hi>Lesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whensoever the <hi>Boar</hi> is hunted and stands at Bay, the Huntsmen ride in, and with Swords and Spears striking on that side which is from their Horses, wound or kill him. This is in the French Hunting: but the antient <hi>Romans</hi> standing on foot, or setting their Knees to the ground, and charging directly with their Spear, did <hi>Opponere ferrum,</hi> and <hi>Excipere Aprum:</hi> for such is the nature of a <hi>Boar,</hi> that he spits himself with fury, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the Weapon to come at his Adversary; and so, seeking his revenge, he meets with his own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>Though these <hi>Wild-Boars</hi> are frequent in <hi>France,</hi> we have none in <hi>England;</hi> yet it may be supposed that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we had, and did not think it convenient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that Game: For our old Authors of Hunting reckon them amongst the beasts of Venery; and we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100171:34"/>
have the proper terms belonging to them, as you may find them at the beginning of the Book. Of Boar-hunting you will read more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>There are no <hi>Roe-Deer</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> but there are plenty of them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as Sir <hi>James Lindsay</hi> an old Scottish Writer testifies.</p>
                     <p>Yet it may be thought that they have been more common in <hi>England,</hi> because our antient Huntsmen acknowledge the proper terms for this Chase; and in the first place we have distinct Ages for these <hi>Dorces,</hi> which you shall find in the Terms aforesaid. They make good Chase, stand long, and fly end-way. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellere Dorcas,</hi> is to force the <hi>Bevy;</hi> and to drive them into the <hi>Toyls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although we have no <hi>Wolves</hi> in <hi>England</hi> at this present, yet it is certain that heretofore we had Routs of them, as they have to this very day in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and in that Country are bred a race of <hi>Grey-hounds,</hi> (which are commonly called <hi>Wolf-Dogs</hi>) which are strong, fleet, and bear a natural enmity to the <hi>Wolf.</hi> Now in these the <hi>Grey-hounds</hi> of that Nation there is an incredible force and boldness, so that they are in great estimation, and much sought after in forrein parts, so that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> makes use of them in his hunting of great Beasts by force. Wherefore it may well be intended of the great fierceness which these Dogs have in assaulting, that when the <hi>Romans</hi> saw them play, they thought them so wonderful violent, as that they must needs have been <hi>Ferreis caveis advecti,</hi> brought up in Iron Dens.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Poland</hi> when the King hunts, his servants are wont to surround a Wood, though a Mile in compass, with Toyls which are pitched on firm Stakes. This being done, the whole Town, all Sexes and Ages promiscuously rush into the Inclosure, and with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oud shouts rear all the Beasts within that Wood; which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100171:35"/>
making forth, are intercepted in the Nets. Their small and great Beasts are entangled together, after the same manner as when amongst us we draw a Net over a Pond, and after beating it all over with Poles, we bring out not onely <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Carp,</hi> but lesser Fry; so they inclose at once <hi>Deer, Boar, Roe-buck,</hi> and <hi>Hare:</hi> For so they order their Nets, that the space of those Meshes which are twisted with greater Cords, for the entangling of greater Beasts, that space, I say, is made up with smaller Whip-cord, for the catching smaller Prey.</p>
                     <p>He hath a great race of English Mastiffs, which in that Country retain their generosity, and are brought up to play upon greater beasts. It is not counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them disagreeable to the Laws of the Chase, to use Guns. I shall now proceed to the manner of English-Hunting both antient and modern, according to the best information I could gather either out of Books, experienced Huntsmen, and my own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Hart</hi> can naturally swim a great way; insomuch that I have heard of some so sore hunted in Forests near the Sea, that they have plung'd into it, and have been killed by Fisher-men a dozen miles from land.</p>
                     <p>It is reported of them when they go to Rut, and must for that purpose cross some great River or Arm of the Sea, they assemble in great Herds, the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest goes in first, and the next of strength follows him, and so one after the other, relieving themselves
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100171:35"/>
by staying their Heads on the Buttocks of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hinde</hi> commonly carries her Calf eight or nine moneths, which usually falls in <hi>May,</hi> although some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: some of them have two at once, eating the Skin up wherein the Calf did lie.</p>
                     <p>As the Calf grows up, she teacheth it to run, leap, and the way it must keep to defend it self from the Hounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Hindes</hi> are very long-liv'd, living common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an hundred years and upwards.</p>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>The nature of a <hi>Hart.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>The <hi>Hart</hi> is strangely amazed when he hears any one call, or whistle in his Fist; For trial of which, some see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Hart</hi> in the Plain in motion, have called after him, saying, <hi>Ware, Ware,</hi> or <hi>Take heed;</hi> and thereupon have seen him instantly turn back, making some little stand. He heareth very perfectly when his Head and Ears are erected; but heareth imperfectly when he holdeth them down. When he is on foot, and not afraid, he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at every thing he seeth, and taketh pleasure to gaze at them.</p>
                        <p>They bear sometimes few, and sometimes more Croches; and that is the reason that many men have erred in their judgments as to their age.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Harts</hi> are bred in most Countries; but the Antients do prefer those of <hi>Britain</hi> before all others, where they are of divers colours.</p>
                        <p>These do excel all others in the beauty of Horns; which are very high, yet do not grow to their Bones or Scalps, but to their Skin, branching forth into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Speers, being solid throughout, and as hard as Stones, and fall off once a year: but if they remain abroad in the Air, and that thereby they are sometimes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100171:36"/>
wet and dry, they grow as light as any vanishing or other substance, as I have proved by experience, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some which have been lost by them in the Woods; wherefore I gather, that they are of an earthly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, concrete, and hardned with a strong heat, made like unto Bones. They lose these Horns every year in the Spring. At one year old they have nothing but Bunches, that are small significators of Horns to come: at two years they appear more perfectly, but straight and simple: at three years they grow into two Spears: at four, into three; and so increase every year in their Branches till they be six; and above that time their age is not certainly to be discerned by their Head.</p>
                        <p>Having lost their Horns in the day-time, they hide themselves, inhabiting the shades, to avoid the annoyance of Flies, and feed, during that time onely, in the night. Their new Horns come out at first like Bunches, and afterwards (as I said before) by the increase of the Sun's heat they grow more hard, covered with a rough Skin, which is called a <hi>Velvet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;</hi> and as that Skin drieth, they daily try the strength of their new Heads upon Trees; which not onely scrapeth off the roughness, but by the pain they feel thus rubbing them, they are taught how long to forbear the company of their fellows: for at last, when in their chafing and fretting of their new Horn against the Tree they can feel no longer pain and smart in them, they take it for high time to forsake their solitary dwellings, and return again to their former conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>The reason why <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Deers</hi> do lose their Horns yearly, are these: First, because of the matter whereof they consist; for it is dry and earthy, like the substance of green Leaves which have an yearly fall, likewise, wanting glewing or holding moisture
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100171:36"/>
to continue them; wherefore the Horn of a <hi>Hart</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bent. Secondly, from the place they grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for they are not rooted upon the Skull, but onely within the Skin. Thirdly, from the efficient cause; for they are hardned both with the heat of Summer, and cold of Winter; by means whereof the Pores to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their nourishing Liquor are utterly shut up and stopped, so as of necessity their native heat dieth; which falleth not out in other Beasts, whose Horns are for the most part hollow, and fitted for longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; but these are of lesser, and the new Bunches swelling up towards the Spring, do thrust off the old Horns, having the assistance of Boughs of Trees, weight of the Horns, or by the willing excussion of the Beast that beareth them.</p>
                        <p>It is observed, that when a <hi>Hart</hi> pricketh up his Ears, he windeth sharp, very far, and sure, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth all treachery against him; but if they hang down and wag, he perceiveth no danger. By their Teeth is their Age discerned, and they have four on both sides wherewith they grinde their meat, besides two other, much greater in the Male than in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. All these Beasts have Worms in their Head underneath their Tongue, in a hollow place where the Neck-bone is joyned to the Head, which are no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Flie-blows. His Blood is not like other Beasts, for it hath no Fibres in it, and therefore it is hardly congealed. His Heart is very great, and so are all those of fearful Beasts, having in it a Bone like a Cross. He hath no Gall, and that is one of the causes of the length of his life; and therefore are his Bowels so bitter, that the Dogs will not touch them unless they be very fat. The Genital part is all nervy; the Tail small; and the <hi>Hinde</hi> hath Udders betwixt her Thighs, with four Speans like a Gow. These are above all other four-footed Beasts, both
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100171:37"/>
ingenious and fearful, who although they have large Horns, yet their defence against other four-footed Beasts is to run away.</p>
                        <p>And now if you will credit <hi>Gesner</hi> as a Huntsman, pray here observe what account he gives of Hunting the <hi>Hart: This wild deceitful and subtile Beást</hi> (says he) <hi>by windings and turnings does often deceive its Hunter, as the Harts of</hi> Meandros <hi>flying from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible cry of</hi> Diana's <hi>Hounds.</hi> Wherefore the prudent Hunter must frame his Dogs as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did his Scholars, with words of Art to set them on, and take them off again at his pleasure; wherefore he must first of all compass in the Beast <hi>(en son giste)</hi> in her own Layr, and so unharbour her in the view of the Dogs, that so they may never lose her Slot or Footing: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must he set upon every one, either of the Herd or those that wander solitary alone, or a little one but partly by sight, and partly by their Footing and Fumets, judge of their Game; also he must observe the largeness of his Layr. Being thus informed, then <hi>Discouples les chiens,</hi> take off your Dog-Couplings; and some on Horse-back, others on foot, follow the Cry with greatest art, observation and speed, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring and preventing <hi>(cer fruze)</hi> the subtile turnings and headings of the <hi>Hart;</hi> straining with all dexterity to leap Hedge, Pale, Ditch, nay Rocks; neither fearing Thorns, down Hills, nor Woods, but providing fresh Horse if the first tire, follow the largest Head of the whole Herd, which you must endeavour to single out for the Chase; which the Dogs perceiving must follow, taking for a prohibition to follow any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>The Dogs are animated by the winding of Horns and voices of the Huntsmen, like Souldiers to the battle, by the noise of Trumpets and other Warlike Instruments. But sometimes the crafty great beast seo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100171:37"/>
forth his little Squire to be sacrificed to the Dogs and Huntsmen, instead of himself; lying close in the mean time: Then must a Retreat be sounded, and <hi>(rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre le chiens)</hi> the Dogs be broken off, and taken in <hi>(le Limier)</hi> that is, Leame again, until they be brought to the fairer Game; who ariseth in fear, yet still striveth by flight, until he be wearied and breathless.</p>
                        <p>The Nobles call this beast <hi>(Cerf sage)</hi> a wise <hi>Hart,</hi> who, to avoid all his Enemies, runneth into the greatest Herds, and so bringeth a Cloud of errour on the Dogs, to keep them from further prosecution; sometimes also beating some of the Herd into his Footings, that so he may the more easily escape, and procure a Labyrinth to the Dogs; after which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh himself to his Heels again, running still with the Wind, not onely for refrigeration, but because he may the more easily hear the voice of his pursuers, whether they be far or near. At last, being for all this found out again by the observance of the Hunters, and skilful Scent of the Dogs, he flieth into the Herds of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as Cows, Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leaping on an Ox or Cow, laying the foreparts of his body thereon, that so touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth onely with his hinder Feet, to leave a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small or no scent at all behinde for the Hounds to descern.</p>
                        <p>The chief Huntsman to <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, called <hi>(le Grand Venieur)</hi> affirmeth, that on a time, they having a <hi>Hart</hi> in chase, suddenly the Hounds were at a fault, so as the Game was out of sight, and not a Dog would once stir his foot, whereat the Hunters were all amazed; at last, by casting about, (as it is usual in such cases) they found the fraud of the crafty beast, which is worth the memory.</p>
                        <p>There was a great White-thorn, which grew in a hadowy place as high as a Tree, and was environed with other small shrubs about it; into the which the said
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100171:38"/>
                           <hi>Hart</hi> leaped, and there stood aloft the Boughs sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from one another, and there remained till he was thrust through by a Huntsman, rather than he would yield to the angry and greedy Hounds. Yet their manner is when they see themselves every where intercepted, to make force at him with their Horns who first comes unto him, except prevented by Sword or Spear; which being done, the Hunter with his Horn windeth the fall of the Beast, and then every one approacheth, luring with triumph for such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, of whom the skilfullest openeth the Beast, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the Hounds with what properly belongeth unto them for their future encouragement; and for that purpose the Huntsmen dip Bread in the Skin and Blood of the Beast, to give unto the Hounds their full satisfaction.</p>

                        <p>They are easily kill'd in Rutting-time: for they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the scent of the <hi>Hindes</hi> with such greediness, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Noses to the ground, that they mind that sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and nothing else.</p>
                        <p>They are such great lovers of the sport, it is very dangerous for any man to come near them at this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for then they will make at any living creature of different kind.</p>
                        <p>In some places, in <hi>October</hi> their Lust ariseth, and also in <hi>May;</hi> and then, whereas at other times the Males live apart from the Females, they go about like lascivious Lovers, seeking the company of their Females, as it were at the Market of <hi>Venus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Males in their raging desired Lust have a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar noise, which the French call <hi>Reere.</hi> One Male will cover a many Females, continuing in this carnal appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite a month or two. The Females are chaste, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to admit of Copulation, by reason of the rigour of the Male's Genital; and therefore they sink down on their buttocks when they begin to feel his Seed, as it hath been often observed in tame <hi>Harts;</hi> and if they can, the Females run away, the Males striving to hold them back within their fore-Feet. It cannot be well said, that they are covered standing, lying, or going, but rather running; for so are they filled with greatest severity. When one month or six weeks is over of their Rutting, they grow tamer by much, and laying aside all fierceness, they return to their solitary places, digging every one by himself a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hole or Ditch, wherein they lie, to asswage the strong savour of their Lust; for they stink like Goats, and their Face beginneth to look blacker than at other times: and in those places they live till some Showers distil from the Clouds; after which, they return to their Pasture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, living in Flocks as before.</p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:100171:39"/>
                        <p>The Female, thus filled, never keepeth company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the Male until she is delivered of her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, which is eight months; and but one at a time, seldom two, which she lodgeth cunningly in some Covert: If she perceive them stubborn and wilde, she will beat them with her Feet till they lie close and quiet.</p>
                        <p>Oftentimes she leadeth forth her young, teaching it to run and leap over bushes, stones, and small shrubs; and so continueth all the Summer long, while their own strength is most considerable.</p>
                        <p>It is very pleasant to observe them when they go to Rut, and make their Vaut. For when they smell the <hi>Hinde,</hi> they raise their Nose up into the Air, looking aloft, as though they gave thanks to the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who gave them so great delight and pleasure. And if it be a great <hi>Hart,</hi> he will turn his Head and look about to see whether there be none near to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or spoil his sport. Hereat the young fly away for fear: but if there be any of equal bigness, they then strive which shall Vaut first; and in the opposing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they scrape the ground with their Feet, shocking and butting each other so furiously, that you shall hear the noise they make with their Horns a good half mile, so long, till one of them is Victor. The <hi>Hinde</hi> behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Pastime, never stirs from her station, expecting, as it were, the Vauting of him who hath the Mastery; and having got it, he bellows, and then instantly covers her.</p>
                        <p>During the time of their Rut, they eat but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; for they feed onely on what they see before them, minding more the track of the <hi>Hindes.</hi> Their chief meat is the red Mushrome, which helps them to evacuate their Grease: they are then extraordinary hot, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that every where as they pass and find waters, they tumble and lie therein.</p>

                        <p>The old <hi>Hart</hi> casteth his Head sooner than the young: and the time is about the months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March.</hi>

                        <p>Having cast their Heads, they instantly withdraw unto the Thickets, hiding themselves in such convenient places where they may have good Water, and strong Feeding, near some ground where Wheat or Pease is sown: But young <hi>Harts</hi> do never betake themselves to the Thickets till they have born their third Head, which is in the fourth year.</p>
                        <p>After they have Mewed, they will begin to Button in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> and as the Sun grows strong, and the season of the year puts forward the Crop of the Earth, so will their Heads increase in all respects: so that in the midst of <hi>June</hi> their Heads will be summed as much as they will bear all the year.</p>

                        <p>There are another sort of brown <hi>Harts,</hi> which are little, short, and well-set, bearing commonly a black Main, and are fatter and better Venison than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by reason of their better feeding in young Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                        <p>They are very crafty, especially when in grease; and will be hardly found, because they known they are then most enquired after: besides, they are very sensible they cannot then stand long before the Hounds. If they be old, and feed in good ground, then are their Heads black, fair, and well branched, and commonly palmed at the top.</p>
                        <p>The Fallow-<hi>Harts</hi> bear their Heads high, and of a whitish colour, their Beams small, their Antliers long, slender, and ill-grown, having neither Heart, Courage, nor Force.

                        <head>How to know an old <hi>Hart</hi> by the Slot, Entries, Abatures and Foils, Fewmets, Gate and Walks, Fraying-Stocks, Head and Branches.</head>
                        <p>I shall proceed in order, and first of the <hi>Slot.</hi> You must carefully look on the Treadings of the <hi>Hart's</hi> Foot: If you find the Treadings of two, the one long, the other round, yet both of one bigness; yet shall the long Slot declare the <hi>Hart</hi> to be much larger than the round.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the old <hi>Hart's</hi> hind-foot doth never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach the fore-foot; the young one's doth.</p>
                        <p>But above all, take this Observation: When you are in the Wood, and have found the Slot of a <hi>Hart,</hi> mark what manner of Footing it is, whether worn, or sharp; and accordingly observe the Country, and thereby judge whether either may be occasioned thereby. For <hi>Harts</hi> bred in mountainous and stony Countries, have their Toes and sides of their Feet Worn, by reason of their continual climbing and resting themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not on the Heel: whereas in other places they stay themselves more on the Heel than Toes: For in soft or sandy ground they slip upon the Heel, by reason of their weight; and thus by frequent staying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereon, it makes the Heel grow broader and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And thus you may know the age of a <hi>Hart</hi> by his Slot or Treading.</p>
                        <p>The next thing to be considered, is the Fewmishing; and this is to be judged of in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May.</hi> If the Fewmets be great, large, and thick, they signifie the <hi>Hart</hi> to be old.</p>
                        <p>In the midst of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> they make their Fewmets or Fewmishing in great Croteys, very soft; and from that time to the end of <hi>August,</hi> they make them great, long, knotty, anointed and gilded, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100171:41"/>
them fall but few and scattered. In <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> there is no longer judging, by reason of the Rut.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If you would know the height and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Hart,</hi> observe his Entries and Galleries into the Thickets, and what Boughs he hath over-stridden, and mark from thence the height of his Belly from the ground.</p>
                        <p>By the height of the Entries, we judge the age of a <hi>Hart:</hi> for a young <hi>Deer</hi> is such as creeps usually; but the old is stiff and stately.</p>
                        <p>His greatness is known by the height of his creeping as he passes to his Harbour; the young <hi>Deer</hi> creeping low, which the old will not stoop to.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Take notice of his Gate, by which you may know whether the <hi>Hart</hi> be great and long, and whether he will stand long before the Hounds or not. For all <hi>Harts</hi> which have a long step will stand up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long, being swift, light, and well breath'd; but if he leave a great Slot, which is the signe of an old <hi>Deer,</hi> he will never stand long when he is chased.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Take notice of his Fraying-post: Where note, the elder the <hi>Hart</hi> is, the sooner he goeth to Fray, and the greater is the Tree he seeketh to Fray upon, and such as he cannot bend with his Head.</p>
                        <p>All <hi>Stags</hi> as they are burnish'd, beat their Heads dry against some Tree or other, which is called their Fray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-post: The younger <hi>Deer</hi> against weaker and lesser Trees, and lower; the elder against bigger and stronger, and Fray higher; so that accordingly we confidently judge of their age, and of the nearness of their Harbour; for that is the last Ceremony they use before they enter it.</p>
                        <p>As to the Head and Branches, the <hi>Hart</hi> is old, First, when the compass of the Bur is large, great, and well pearl'd.</p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100171:41"/>
                        <p>Secondly, when the Beam is great, burnished, and well pearl'd, being straight, and not made crooked by the Antliers.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, when the Gutters therein are great and deep.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, when the first Antlier, called <hi>Antoiller,</hi> is great, long, and near to the Bur; the Surantlier near unto the Antlier: and they ought to be both well pearl'd.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The rest of the Branches which are higher, being well ordered and set, and well grown, according to the bigness and proportion of the Head; and the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Palm or Crown being great and large according to the bigness of the Beam, are the signes of an old <hi>Hart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now since many men cannot understand the names and diversities of Heads according to the Terms of Hunting, I shall in the following Chapter give you a brief account thereof.</p>

                        <p>That which is about the Crust of the Beam, is termed <hi>Pearls:</hi> and that which is about the Bur it self, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like little Pearls, is called <hi>Pearls bigger than the rest.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Bur is next the Head; and that which is about the Bur, is called <hi>Pearls.</hi> The first is called <hi>Antlier;</hi> the second, <hi>Surantlier:</hi> All the rest which grow after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, until you come to the Crown, Palm, or Croche, are called <hi>Rovals,</hi> and <hi>Sur-royals:</hi> The little Buds or Broches about the Top, are called <hi>Croches.</hi>

                        <p>Their Heads go by several Names: The first Head is called a <hi>Crowned Top,</hi> because the Croches are ranged in form of a Crown.</p>
                        <p>The second is called a <hi>Palmed Top,</hi> because the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are formed like a mans Hand.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, all Heads which bear not above three or four, the Croches being placed aloft, all of one height, in form of a cluster of Nuts, are to be called <hi>Heads</hi> of so many <hi>Croches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, all Heads which bear two in the Top, or having their Croches doubling, are to be called <hi>Forked Heads.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, all Heads which have double Burs, or the Antliers, Royals, and Croches turned downwards, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to other Heads, are onely called <hi>Heads.</hi>

                        <head>How to seek a <hi>Hart</hi> in his Haunts or Feeding-places according to the seasons of the year.</head>
                        <p>All <hi>Harts</hi> do change their manner of Feeding every month; and therefore I shall treat orderly of every one till I have concluded the year; beginning with that month which is the conclusion of their Rutting-time, and that is <hi>November,</hi> in which month they feed in Heaths and Broomy places.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>December</hi> they Herd together, and withdraw themselves into the strength of the Forests, to shelter themselves from the cold Winds, Snows, and Frosts, and do feed on the Holm-trees, Elder-trees, Brambles, with whatsoever other green thing they can find; and if it snow, they will skin the Trees like a Goat.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>January, February,</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> they leave Herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but will keep four or five in company, and in the corners of the Forest will feed on the Winter-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; sometimes making their incursions into the neighbouring Corn-Fields, if they can perceive the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100171:42"/>
blades of Wheat, Rie, or such-like, appear above ground.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> they rest in their Thickets, and other bushy and shady places, during that season, and stir very little till Rutting-time, unless they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd.</p>
                        <p>There are some <hi>Hearts</hi> are so cunning, that they will have two several Layrs to harbour in, a good distance one from the other; and will frequently change (for their greater security) from the one to the other, taking still the benefit of the Wind.</p>
                        <p>In these months they go not to the Soil, by reason of the moisture of the Spring, and the Dew that continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overspreadeth the Grass.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> they are in their pride of grease, and do resort to Spring-Copses, and Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields; onely they seldom go where Rye or Barley grow.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> they leave their Thickets and go to Rut; during which season they have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place either for food or harbour.</p>

                        <p>Let him not come too early into the Springs or Hewts where he thinketh the <hi>Hart</hi> feedeth, and is at relief. For they usually go to their Layrs in the Springs; and if they be old crafty <hi>Deer,</hi> they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the border of the Copse, and there listen whether they can hear any approaching danger: and if they chance once to vent the Huntsman or the Hound, they will instantly dislodge.</p>
                        <p>Now is the Huntsman's proper time. Let him beat the outsides of the Springs or Thickets: if he find the Track of an <hi>Hart</hi> or <hi>Deer,</hi> let him observe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100171:43"/>
whether it be new; which he may know thus; the Dew will be beaten off, the Foil fresh, or the ground broken or printed, with other tokens: so he may judge his Game lately went that way.</p>
                        <p>Having found this Slot or Treading, and the Hound sticking well upon it, let him hold him short, for he shall better draw being so held, than if he were let at length of the Lyam: and thus let him draw till he is come to the Covert, if possible, taking notice by the way of the Slot, Foils, Entries, and the like, till he hath harboured him. That done, let him plash down small Twigs, some above, and some below, as he shall think fit: and then, whilst the Hound is hot, let him beat the outsides, and make his Ring-walks twice or thrice about the Wood, one while by the great and open ways, that he may help himself by the Eye; another while through the thick and Covert, for fear lest his Hound should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoot it, having still better Scent in the Coverts than High-ways.</p>
                        <p>If he doubt the <hi>Hart</hi> is gone out of the Ring-walks, or fears he hath drawn amiss; then let him go to the marks which he plashed, and draw counter, till he may take up the Fewmet.</p>

However, if the ground be too hard to make any judgment from the Slot, he is to draw into the Covert, as he passes observing the size of the Entries; the larger
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100171:43"/>
and higher, the elder the <hi>Deer;</hi> as also his Croppings of the Tenders as he passes: (the younger the <hi>Deer,</hi> the lower; the elder the <hi>Deer,</hi> the higher he branches.) Also observe his Fewmishings as you pass, whose large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness bespeak the largeness of the <hi>Deer;</hi> also be curious in observing his Fraying-post, which usually is the last opportunity you have to judge by, the eldest <hi>Deer</hi> Fray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highest against the biggest Trees; and that found, you may conclude his Harbour not far off; therefore draw with more circumspection, checking your Draught-hound to secure him from spending when he comes so near as to have the <hi>Deer</hi> in the Wind: and then by his eagerness you having discovered that, ought to draw him; and having retired some distance back, you are with your Hound to round the place first at a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable distance; and then, if you find him not disturbed, a little within that make your second round; which will not onely secure you that he is in his Harbour, but will also secure his continuance there; for he will not (unforc'd) pass that Taint your Hound hath left in the rounding of him. So that having broken a bough for his direction, he may at any time unharbour that <hi>Hart.</hi>

If any such thing should happen, then thus you must do. First, they which follow the Hounds, must mark the place where they left the Chase, and at break of day bring your Blood-hound to it with your Kennel after him. If any hound vents, whom he knows to be no Lier or Babler, he shall put his Hound to it, whooping twice, or blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Notes with his Horn, to call all his fellows

And if there he renews his Slot or View, let him first consider whether it be the right or not: if it be the right, let him blow his Horn. Now if he find five or six Layrs, let it not seem strange; for <hi>Harts</hi> hunted and spent, do frequently make many Layrs together, because they cannot stand, but lie and feed.</p>

                           <hi>Harts</hi> which are hunted, most commonly run up the Wind, and straight forwards as far as they are able, and finding any Water or Soil, do stay a long time therein; by which means their Joynts are so benummed and stiffned, that coming out they cannot go far, nor stand up long; and therefore are compelled to take any Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour they can finde, which may be a present Covert to them.</p>

                        <p>In the seeking of a <hi>Hart</hi> in high Woods, regard must be had to two things; that is, the Thickets of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and the Season.</p>
                        <p>If it be in very hot weather, Gnats, Horse-flies, and such-like, drive the <hi>Deer</hi> out of the high Wood, and they disperse themselves into small Groves and Thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets near places of good feeding. According to the Coverts which are in the Forest, so accordingly the Huntsman must make his enquiry. For sometimes the <hi>Harts</hi> lie in the Tufts of White-thorn; sometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der little Trees; otherwhiles under great Trees in the high Woods; and sometimes in the Skirts of the Forest under the shelter of little Groves and Copses. And therefore the Huntsman must make his Ring-walk great or small, according to the largeness of those Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or Goverts.</p>

                        <head>How to Unharbour a <hi>Hart,</hi> and cast off the Hounds.</head>
                        <p>When the Relays are well set and placed, let the Huntsman with his Pole walk before the Kennel of Hounds: Being come to the Blemishes, let him take notice of the Slot, and such other marks as may be observed from the View of the <hi>Deer,</hi> to the intent he may know whether the Hounds run Riot or not. Then let the Huntsmen cast abroad about the Covert, to discover the <hi>Hart</hi> when he is unharboured, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to distinguish him by his Head or otherwise. The Huntsman having unharboured him, all the Hounds shall be cast off, they crying one and all, <hi>To him, to him; That's he, that's he,</hi> with such words of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>If the Blood-hound as he draweth chance to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoot, and draw wrong or counter, then must the Huntsman draw him back, and say, <hi>Back, back, Soft, soft,</hi> until he hath set him right again: and if he perceive that the Hound hath mended his fault, by his kneeling down, and observing the Slot or Ports, he must then che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish him, by clapping him on the Back, and giving him some encouraging words. Thus let him draw on with his Hound till the <hi>Deer</hi> be descried.</p>
                        <p>Now some are so cunning and crafty, that when they are unharboured from their Layr, they will coast round about to finde some other <hi>Deer,</hi> whereby the Hounds may be confounded in the change of hunts.</p>
                        <p>If the Huntsman have the <hi>Hart</hi> in view, let him still draw upon the Slot, blowing and hollowing until the Hounds are come in. When he seeth they are in full cry, and take it right, he may then mount, keeping under the Wind, and coast to cross the Hounds that are in chase, to help them at default, if need require.</p>
                     </div>

                        <head>What subtilties are used in Hunting a <hi>Hart</hi> at force.</head>
                        <p>Let the Huntsman never come nearer the Hounds in cry, than fifty or threescore paces, especially at the first uncoupling, or at casting off their Relays. For if a <hi>Hart</hi> make Doublings, or wheel about, or cross before the Hounds, as he seldom doth; if then you come in too hastily, you will spoil the Slot or View; and so the Hounds, for want of Scent, will be apt to overshoot the Chase: but if after hunting an hour, the Huntsman perceive that the <hi>Hart</hi> makes out end-ways before the Hounds, and that they follow in full cry, taking it right, then he may come in nearer, and blow a Recheat to the Hounds to encourage them. Hereupon the <hi>Hart</hi> will frequently seek other <hi>Deer</hi> at Layr, and rouze them, on purpose to make the Hounds hunt change, and will lie down flat in some of their Layrs upon his Belly, and so let the Hounds over-shoot him: and because they shall neither scent or vent him, he will gather up all his four Feet under his Belly, and will blow and breath on some moist place of the ground, in such sort, that I have seen the Hounds pass by such a <hi>Hart</hi> within a yard, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vent him.</p>
                        <p>For which cause Huntsmen should blemish at such places they see the <hi>Hart</hi> enter into a Thicket, to this end, that if the Hounds should fall to change, they may return to those Blemishes, and put their Hounds to the right Slot and View, until they have rouzed or found him again.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hart</hi> hath another way to bring the Hounds to change; and that is, when he seeth himself closely pursued, and that he cannot shun them, he will break into one Thicket after another to finde <hi>Deer,</hi> rouzing and herding with them, continuing so to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times above an hour before he will part from them, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100171:45"/>
break Herd. Finding himself spent, he will break herd, and fall a doubling and crossing in some hard High-way that is much beaten, or else in some River or Brook, in which he will keep as long as his breath will permit him: and if he be far before the Hounds, it may be then he will use his former device, in gathering his Legs up under his belly as he lies flat along upon some hard and dry place. Sometimes he will take soil, and so cover himself under the water, that you shall perceive nothing but his Nose.</p>
                        <p>In this case the Huntsman must have a special regard to his old Hounds, who will hunt leisurely and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; whereas the young Hounds will over-shoot their Game.</p>
                        <p>If it so chance that the Hounds are at a default, and hunt in several companies, then it may be guessed that the <hi>Hart</hi> hath broken herd from the fresh <hi>Deer,</hi> and that the fresh <hi>Deer</hi> have separated themselves also: then regard how the old Staunch-hounds make it, and observe the Slot; and where you see any of the old Hounds challenge, cherish and encourage him, hastening the rest in to him, by crying <hi>Hark</hi> to such a Hound, calling him by his Name.</p>
                        <p>Here is to be noted, that they cannot make it so good in the hard High-ways as in other places, because they cannot have there so perfect a scent, either by reason of the Tracks or Footing of divers sorts of beasts, or by reason of the Sun drying up the moisture, so that the dust covereth the Slot: now in such places (such is the natural subtilty of that beast for self-preservation) the <hi>Hart</hi> will make many Corsses and Doublings, holding them long together, to make the Hounds give over the Chase.</p>
                        <p>In this case, the first care of the Huntsman is, to make good the Head, and then draw round apace, first down the Wind, though usually <hi>Deer</hi> go up the Wind:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100171:46"/>
and if the way is too hard to Slot, be sure to try far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough back. This expert Hounds will frequently do of themselves.</p>
                        <p>But if a <hi>Hart</hi> break out into the Champion-country, and that it be in the heat of the day, between Noon and three of the clock; then if the Huntsman perceive his Hounds out of breath, he must not force them much, but comfort them; and though they do not call upon the Slot or View, yet it is sufficient if they but wag their Tails; for, being almost spent, it is painful for them to call.</p>
                        <p>The last Refuge of a <hi>Hart</hi> sorely hunted is the Water, (which, according to Art, is termed the <hi>Soil</hi>) swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming oftnest down the Stream, keeping the middle, fearing lest by touching any bough by the Water-side he may give scent unto the Hounds.</p>
                        <p>Always when you come to a Soil, (according to the old Rule: <hi>He that will his Chase finde, let him first try up the River, and down the Wind)</hi> be sure if your Hounds challenge but a yard above his going in, that he is gone up the River: for though he should keep the very middle of the Stream, yet will that, with the help of the Wind, lodge part of the Stream, and Imbosh that comes from him on the Banks, it may be a quarter of a mile lower, which hath deceived many. Therefore first try up the Stream: and where a <hi>Den</hi> first breasts soil, both Man and Hound will best perceive it.</p>
                        <p>Now the ways to know when a <hi>Hart</hi> is spent, are these: <hi>First,</hi> He will run stiff, high, and lompering. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If his Mouth be black and dry without any Foam upon it, and his Tongue hanging out; but they will often close their Mouths, to deceive the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By his Slot: for oftentimes he will close his Claws together, as if he went at leisure; and straightway again open them wide, making great
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100171:46"/>
glidings, and hitting his Dew-claws upon the ground, following the beaten Paths without Doublings; and sometimes going all along by a Ditch-side, seeking some Gap, having not strength to leap it otherways: yet it hath been often seen, that Dead-run <hi>Deer</hi> have taken very great leaps.</p>
                        <p>Thus must a Huntsman govern himself according to the subtlety and Craft of the <hi>Deer,</hi> observing their Doublings and Crossings, and the places where they are made; making his Rings little or great, according to the nature of the place, time, and season: For Hounds are subject to shoot where Herbs and Flowers have their most lively scent and odoriferous smell. Neither must you be unmindful of the perfection and imperfection of your Hounds. Thus doing, it will be very hard luck if you loose a <hi>Hart</hi> by default.</p>

                        <p>It is very dangerous to go in to a <hi>Hart</hi> at Bay, and especially at Rutting-time; for then they are most fierce.</p>
                        <p>There are two sorts of Bays; one on the Land, the other on the Water. If now the <hi>Hart</hi> be in a deep Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where you cannot well come to him, then couple up your Dogs; for should they long continue in the Water, it would endanger surbating or foundering.

                        <p>As to the Land-bay, if the <hi>Hart</hi> be burnished, then must you consider the place: For if it be in a plain and open place, where there is no Wood nor Covert, it is dangerous and hard to come in to him; but if

it be in a Hedge-side or thicket, then, whilst the <hi>Hart</hi> is staring on the Hounds, you may come covertly among the bushes behinde him, and cut his Throat. If you miss your aim, and the <hi>Hart</hi> turn head upon you, then make some Tree your refuge; or when the <hi>Hart</hi> is at Bay, couple up your Hounds; and when you see the <hi>Hart</hi> turn head to fly, gallop in roundly to him, and kill him with your Sword.</p>

                        <p>The first Ceremony when the Huntsmen come in to the Death of a <hi>Deer,</hi> is to cry <hi>Ware Haunch,</hi> that the Hounds may not break into the <hi>Deer;</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving secured, the next is cutting his Throat, and there blooding the youngest Hounds, that they may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love a <hi>Deer,</hi> and learn to leap at his Throat; then, having blown the Mort, and all the company come in, the best person, that hath not taken Say before, is to take up the Knife that the Keeper or Huntsman is to lay cross the Belly of the <hi>Deer,</hi> standing close to the left Shoulder of the <hi>Deer,</hi> some holding by the Fore-legs, and the Keeper or Huntsman drawing down the Pizle, the person that takes Say, is to draw the edge of the Knife leisurely along the very middle of the Belly, beginning near the Brisket; and drawing a little upon it, enough in the length and depth to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how fat the <hi>Deer</hi> is, then he that is to break up the <hi>Deer</hi> first slits the Skin from the cutting of the Throat downward, making the Arber, that so the Ordure may not break forth; and then he is to pounch him, rewarding the Hounds therewith. Next, he is to present the same person that took the Say with a drawn Hanger, to cut off the Head; which done, and the Hounds rewarded therewith, the concluding Ceremony is, if a <hi>Buck</hi> a double, if a <hi>Stag</hi> a treble

Mort blown by one, and then a whole Recheat in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort by all that have Horns; and that finished, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a general <hi>Whoo whoop.</hi>

                        <p>It was formerly termed, <hi>Winde a Horn,</hi> because (as I suppose) all Horns were then compassed; but since straight Horns are come into fashion, we say, <hi>Blow a Horn,</hi> and sometimes, <hi>Sound a Horn.</hi>

                        <p>In many cases heretofore, <hi>Leasing</hi> was observed; that is, one must be held, either cross a Saddle, or on a mans back, and with a pair of Dog-couples receive ten pound and a Purse; that is, ten stripes, (according to the nature of the Crime, more or less severe) and an eleventh, that used to be as bad as the other ten, called a <hi>Purse.</hi>

                     <p>THis Beast is common in most Countries, being as corpulent as a <hi>Hart;</hi> but in quantity resembleth more a <hi>Roe,</hi> except in colour.</p>
                     <p>The Males have Horns, which they lose yearly; but the Females none at all. Their colours are divers, but most commonly branded or sandy on the back, having a black list all down along on the back; their bellies and sides spotted with white, which they lose by their old age: and the <hi>Does</hi> do especially vary in colour, being sometimes all white, and therefore like unto Goats, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in their hair, which is shorter.</p>
                     <p>In their Horns they differ not much from a <hi>Hart,</hi>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:100171:48"/>
except in quantity, and that they grow out of their Heads like Fingers out of the Hand; such is this <hi>Fallow-Deer,</hi> being therefore called <hi>Cervus Palmatas.</hi> As for their other parts, they much resemble a <hi>Roe-buck.</hi> Their flesh is excellent for nourishment, but their blood ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders too much Melancholy.</p>
                     <p>Now know, the <hi>Buck</hi> is Fawn'd about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> and its nature and properties differ little from the <hi>Hart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is not so much art and skill in Lodging a <hi>Buck,</hi> as in the Harbouring a <hi>Hart;</hi> neither is there required so much drawing after, but onely you are to judge by the View, and mark what Grove or Covert he entreth; for he will not wander and rove up and down so often as a <hi>Hart,</hi> nor so frequently change his Layr.</p>
                     <p>He maketh his Fewmishings in divers manners and forms, as the <hi>Hart</hi> doth, according to the diversity of Food, and time of the day, Morning and Evening; but most commonly they are round.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hart</hi> and <hi>Buck</hi> differ thus in parallel. When the <hi>Buck</hi> is hunted, he oft-times betakes himself to such strong Holds and Coverts as he is most acquainted with, not flying far before the Hounds, not crossing nor doubling, using no such subtleties as the <hi>Hart</hi> is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Buck</hi> will beat a Brook, (but seldom a great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the <hi>Hart</hi>) but it must not be so deep; nor can he stay so long at Soil as the <hi>Hart</hi> will do: onely he leapeth lightlier at Rut than the <hi>Hart;</hi> and groaneth or troateth, as a <hi>Hart</hi> belleth, but with a lower Voice, ratling in the Throat. And here is to be noted, they love not one another, nor will they come near each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Layr.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Buck</hi> Venison is incomparable food, and is dressed like Hart-Venison; onely this last will be preserved lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the former.</p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:100171:48"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Buck</hi> herds more than the <hi>Hart,</hi> and lieth in the driest places: but if he be at large, unconfined within the limitary Precincts of a Park, he will herd but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from <hi>May</hi> to <hi>August,</hi> because the flies trouble him. He takes great delight in hilly places; but the Dales are his joy to feed in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bucks</hi> have seldom or never any other Relays than the old Hounds.</p>
                     <p>The greatest subtlety a Huntsman need use in the Hunting of the <hi>Buck,</hi> is to beware of Hunting Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Change, because of the plenty of <hi>Fallow-Deer,</hi> which use to come more directly upon the Hounds than the <hi>Red-Deer</hi> doth. Now upon the breaking up of a <hi>Buck</hi> the Hounds Reward is the same with that of the <hi>Hart.</hi>

                     <p>THe <hi>Roe-Buck</hi> is called by the Greeks and Latines by one name, <hi>viz. Dorcas.</hi> These beasts are very plentiful in <hi>Africa, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Helvetian</hi> Alps.</p>
                     <p>Their swiftness doth not onely appear upon the Earth, but also in the Waters, cutting them when they swim as with Oars; and therefore they love the Lakes and strong Streams, breaking the Floods to come at fresh Pasture, feeding deliciously on sweet Rushes, and Bull-rushes. Horns onely grow upon the Male, and are set with six or seven branches, not palmed, but branchy, yet shorter than <hi>Follow Deer:</hi> They differ not much from common <hi>Deer,</hi> but in their Horn: and whereas the Horns of other Beasts are hollow towards the root, whereinto entereth a certain long substance; the Horns of these, as also of the vulgar <hi>Buck</hi> and <hi>Elk,</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:100171:49"/>
are solid whithout any such emptiness, onely they are full of Pores.</p>
                     <p>It is supposed by the Learned, that a <hi>Roe</hi> was called in Greek <hi>Dorcas,</hi> by reason of the quickness of her sight; and that she can see as perfectly in the night as in the day. Physitians have observed a certain viscous humour about her bowels, which by anointing Eyes that are dark, heavy, and near blinde, quickens the sight most wonderfully.</p>
                     <p>It is reported of them, that they never wink no not when they sleep; for which conceit their blood is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for them who are dim-sighted or pur-blinde. The tail of this beast is lesser and shorter than a <hi>Fallow-Deer's;</hi> insomuch that it is doubtful whether it be a tail or not.</p>
                     <p>They keep for the most part in the Mountains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Rocks, being very swift; and when they are hunted (<hi>Martial</hi> saith) they hang upon the Rocks with their Horns, to delude the Dogs, after a strange manner, ready to fall and kill themselves, and yet receive no harm, where the Dogs dare not approach, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in his Epigram.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>They are most easily taken in the Woods. When they are chased, they desire to run against the wind, because the coldness of the Air refresheth them in their course; and therefore they who hunt them place their Dogs with the Wind. They are often taken by the counterfeiting of their Voice, which the skilful Huntsman doth by the assistance of a Lease in his Mouth.</p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:100171:49"/>
                     <p>This Beast is very easie to hunt, and goeth to Rut (or <hi>Tourn</hi> most properly) in <hi>October,</hi> the extent whereof consists of fifteen days, and never parteth with the <hi>Doe</hi> till Fawning-time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Doe,</hi> finding her self near her time, secretly departs from the <hi>Buck,</hi> and sawneth as far from him and his knowledge as she can; for could he finde the <hi>Fawn,</hi> he would kill it. Now when the <hi>Fawn</hi> grows big, and can run and feed, she then returns to the <hi>Buck</hi> again very lovingly, with all expedition: the cause whereof, is the <hi>Roes</hi> fawning Twins, which are commonly <hi>Buck</hi> and <hi>Doe;</hi> so that being accustomed together in youth, they do love to keep company ever after.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the <hi>Roe-Buck</hi> cometh from Rut, he casts his Horns; and there are few after two years old which Mew not at <hi>Alhallontide,</hi> but their Heads grow quickly out again.</p>
                     <p>The Venison of a <hi>Roe</hi> is never out of season, being never fat, and therefore they are to be hunted at any time: onely this, some favour ought to be shewn the <hi>Doe</hi> whilst she is big with <hi>Fawn,</hi> and afterwards till her <hi>Fawn</hi> is able to shift for himself: besides, some <hi>Roe-Does</hi> have been killed with five <hi>Fawns</hi> in their belly.</p>
                     <p>They usually when hunted, take a large first Ring, and afterwards hunt the Hounds.</p>
                     <p>When they are hunted, they turn much and often, and come back upon the Dogs directly: When they can no longer endure, they then take Soil, as the <hi>Hart</hi> doth, and will hang by a bough in such manner, that nothing shall appear of them above Water but their Snout, and will suffer the Dogs to come just upon them before they will stir.</p>
                     <p>He is not called by the skilful in the Art of Hunting a <hi>Great Roe-Buck,</hi> but a <hi>Fair Roe-Buck.</hi> The Herd of them is called a <hi>Beavy:</hi> And if he hath not Beavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grease
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100171:50"/> on his Tail when he is broken up, he is more fit to be Dogs-meat than Mans-meat.</p>
                     <p>The Hounds must be Rewarded with the Bowels, the Blood, and Feet slit asunder, and boiled all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is more properly called a <hi>Dose</hi> than a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> For what might be said farther concerning Roe-Hunting, I shall refer you to the Chapters of <hi>Hart</hi> and Buck-Hunting.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Rain-Deer</hi> is not unlike a <hi>Hart,</hi> onely his Head is fuller of Antliers, being bigger and wider in compass; for he bears four and twenty branches and more according to his age, having a great Palm on the top, as a <hi>Hart,</hi> and his Fore-Antliers are Palmed also.</p>
                     <p>He flieth end-ways when he is Hunted, by reason of the great weight of his Head. When he hath stood up a great while, doubled, crossed, and used other crafty tricks to shun the Hounds, he makes a Tree his last refuge; so planting himself, that nothing can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault him but just before, placing his buttock and Haunches against the Tree, and hanging down his Head low to the ground, whereby all his Body is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Hart</hi> strikes with his Head, the <hi>Rain-Deer</hi> strikes with his Feet against any one that comes in to him to help the Dogs, not in the least turning his Head, that being his chiefest defence, and seems very terrible to the Hounds.</p>
                     <p>He feedeth like the <hi>Hart,</hi> and maketh his Fewmets sometimes long, and sometimes flat, and beareth fatter

Venison, when he is in pride of Grease, than any other <hi>Deer</hi> doth, and is very long liv'd. He is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drawn after with a Blood-hound, than hunted, and intrapped with Nets and Engines, and that in the thick and greatest Holds, if it may be; which is the best and speediest way, by reason of his great and spreading Head.

                     <head>Of the Nature and Properties of a <hi>Hare.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AN <hi>Hare</hi> is called in Hebrew <hi>Arnebet</hi> in the Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine gender, which word possessed a great many that all <hi>Hares</hi> were Females: He is called <hi>Lagws</hi> by the Greeks, for his immoderate Lust; and by the same Nation <hi>Ptoox,</hi> for his Fear; and by the Latines <hi>Lepus, quasi Levi-pes,</hi> signifying Swiftness of feet (<hi>alias</hi>) Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</p>
                     <p>There are four sorts of <hi>Hares;</hi> some live in the Mountains, some in the Fields, some in the Marshes, some every where, without any certain place of abode. They of the Mountains, are most swift; they of the Fields, less nimble; they of the Marshes, most slow; and the wandering <hi>Hares</hi> are most dangerous to follow; for they are so cunning in the ways and muses of the Fields, running up the Hills and Rocks, because by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom they know the nearer way, with other tricks, to the confusion of the Dogs, and dis-encouragement of the Hunters.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, a description of the parts of an <hi>Hare</hi> will not be unnecessary, since it is admirable to behold how every Limb and Member of this Beast is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100171:51"/>
composed for celerity. In the first place, the Head is round, nimble, short, yet of convenient longitude, prone to turn every way. The Ears long, and lofty, like an Asses: for Nature hath so provided, that every fearful and unarmed creature should have long and large Ears, that by hearing it might prevent its Enemies, and save it self by flight. The Lips continually move sleeping and waking; and from the slit they have in the middle of their Nose, cometh the term of <hi>Harre-lips</hi> which are so divided in men.</p>
                     <p>The Neck of an <hi>Hare</hi> is long, small, round, soft, and flexible: The Shoulder-bone straight and broad, for her more easie turning: her Legs before soft, and stand broader behinde than before, and the hinder Legs longer than the former: a Breast not narrow, but fitted to take more breath than any Beast of that bigness: a nimble Back, and fleshy Belly, tender Loins, hollow Sides, fat Buttocks, filled up, strong and nervous Lines. Their Eyes are brown, and they are subtile, but not bold; seldom looking forward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause going by jumps. Their Eye-lids coming from the Brows are too short to cover their Eyes, and therefore this Sense is very weak in them: when they watch they shut their Eyes, and when they sleep they open them.</p>
                     <p>They have certain little Bladders in their Belly fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with matter, out of which both the one and the other Sex suck a certain humour, and anoint their Bodies all over therewith, and so are defended against Rain.</p>
                     <p>Though their sight be dim, yet they have <hi>visum inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessum,</hi> an indefatigable sence of Seeing; so that the continuance in a mean degree, countervaileth in them the want of excellency.</p>
                     <p>They feed abroad, because they would conceal their forms; and never drink, but content themselves with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100171:51"/>
the Dew, and for that cause they often fall rotten. As it is before, every Limb of a <hi>Hare</hi> is composed for ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity, and therefore she never travelleth, but jumpeth: her Ears lead her the way in her Chase; for with one of them she harkneth to the cry of the Dogs, and the other she stretcheth forth like a Sail, to hasten her course; always stretching her hinder beyond her former, and yet not hindering them at all; and in Paths and High-ways she runs more speedily.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hares</hi> of the Mountains do often exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Valleys and Plains, and through practice grow acquainted with the nearest ways to their Forms or places of constant abode. So that when at any time they are hunted in the Fields, such is their subtile dodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they will dally with the Huntsmen till they seem to be almost taken, and then on a sudden take the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to the Mountains, and so take Sanctuary in the inaccessible places, whither Dogs nor Horse dare as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hares</hi> which frequent Bushes and Brakes, are not able to endure labour, and not very swift, by reason of the pain in their Feet, growing fat through idleness and discontinuance of running. The <hi>Campestrial</hi> or Field-<hi>Hare,</hi> being leaner of Body, and oftner chased, is taken with more difficulty, by reason of her singular agility; she therefore when she beginneth her course, leapeth up from the ground as if the flew, afterwards passeth through Brambles, and over thick Bushes and Hedges with all expedition; and if at any time she come into deep Grass or Corn, she easily delivereth her self, and slideth through it, always holding up one Ear, and bending it at her pleasure to be the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of her Chase. Neither is she so unprovident and prodigal of her strength, as to spend it all in one Course, but observeth the force of her Prosecuror, who if he be slow and sluggish, she is not profuse of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100171:52"/>
her celerity, but onely walketh gently before the Dogs, and yet safely from their Clutches, reserving her grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test strength to her greatest necessity: for the knoweth she can out-run the Dogs at her pleasure, and therefore will not trouble her self more than she is urged. But if there be a Dog following her more swiftly than the residue, then she setteth forward with all the force she can; and when she hath left both Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Dogs a great way behinde her, she getteth to some little Hill or rising of the Earth, where she raiseth her self upon her hinder-Legs, that thereby she may observe how far or near her Pursuers are distant from her.</p>
                     <p>The younger <hi>Hares,</hi> by reason of their weak Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, tread heavier on the Earth than the elder; and therefore leave the greater Scent behinde them. At a year old they run very swift, and their Scent is stronger in the Woods than in the plain Fields; and if they lie down upon the Earth (as they love to do) in red Fallow-grounds, they are easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried.</p>
                     <p>Their foot-steps in the Winter-time are more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent than in the Summer, because, as the Nights are longer, so they travel farther: neither do they scent in the Winter-mornings so soon as it is day, until the Frost be somewhat thawed; but especially their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps are uncertain at the Full of the Moon, for then they leap and play together, scattering and putting out their scent or savour; and in the Spring-time also, when they do ingender, they confound one anothers footsteps by multitudes.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is the judgement of all, that a <hi>Hare</hi> doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally know the change of Weather from twenty four hours to twenty four hours. When she goeth to her Form, she will suffer the Dew to touch her as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as she can, but followeth the High-ways and beaten Paths.</p>
                     <p>They go to Buck commonly in <hi>January, February,</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and sometimes all the warm Months; sometimes seeking the Buck seven or eight miles distant from the place where they usually sit, following the High-ways, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If when a <hi>Hare</hi> riseth out of her Form, she couches her Ears and Scut, and runs not very fast at first, it is an infallible sign that she is old and crafty.</p>
                     <p>You may know a Buck-<hi>Hare</hi> as you hunt him to his Form by his beating the hard High-ways. He feedeth farther out into the Plains, and maketh his doublings and crossings much wider, and of greater compass than the Female doth: for she will keep close by some Covert-side, turning and winding in the bushes like a <hi>Coney;</hi> and if she go to relief in the Corn-fields, she seldom crosseth over the Furrows, but followeth them along, staying upon the thickest tufts of Corn to feed.</p>
                     <p>Likewise you may know a Buck at the rising out of his Form by his Hinder-parts, which are more whitely; or if you observe his Shoulders before he rise, which will be redder than the Does, having some loose long Hairs growing on them. Again, his Head is shorter, and better trussed; his Hairs about his Lips
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100171:53"/>
longer; and his Ears shorter and more gray. The Hairs upon the Female's Chine will be of a blackish gray.</p>
                     <p>Besides, when Hounds hunt a Female-<hi>Hare,</hi> she will use more crossing and doubling, seldom making out end-ways before the Hounds: whereas the Male acts contrary; for having once made a Turn or two about his Form, then farewal Hounds; for he will frequently lead them five or six miles before ever he will turn his head.</p>
                     <p>When you see that your Hounds have found where an <hi>Hare</hi> hath pass'd to Relief upon the High-way-side, and hath much doubled and crossed upon dry places, and never much broken out nor relieved in the Corn, it is a sign she is but lately come thither; and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly she will stay upon some high place to look about her, and to chuse out a place to form in, which she will be loth to part with.</p>

                        <head>Of the Craft and Subtlety of an <hi>Hare.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>As of all Chases the <hi>Hare</hi> makes the greatest pastime and pleasure; so it is a great delight and satisfaction to see the craft of this little poor Beast in her own self-preservation.</p>
                        <p>And that you may understand what these Subtleties are, you must first take notice what Weather it is. If it be rainy, then the <hi>Hare</hi> will hold the High-ways more than at any other time: and if she come to the side of any young Grove or Spring, she will scarcely enter, but squat down by the side thereof until the Hounds have over-shot her; and then she will return the self-same way she came to the place from whence she was started, and will not by the way go into any Covert, for fear of the wet and Dew that hang upon the Boughs.</p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100171:53"/>
                        <p>In this case, let the Huntsman stay a hundred paces before he comes to the Wood-side, by which means he shall perceive whether she return as aforesaid; which if she do, let him hallow in his Hounds, and call them back, and that presently, that the Hounds may not think it the Counter she came first.</p>
                        <p>The next thing to be observed, is the place where the <hi>Hare</hi> sitteth, and upon what wind she makes her Form: for if she form either upon the North or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, she will not willingly run into the Wind, but run upon a side or down the Wind. But if she form in the Water, it is a sign she is foul and measled. If you hunt such a one, have a special regard all the day to the Brook-sides, for there and near Plashes she will make all her crossings, doublings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have seen a <hi>Hare</hi> so crafty, that as soon as she heard the sound of a Horn, she would instantly start out of her Form, thought it was a quarter of a mile distant, and go swim in some Pool, and there rest her self upon some Rush-bed in the midst thereof, from whence she would not stir till she heareth the Horn again; and then I have seen her start out again swimming to Land, and she hath stood up before the Hounds four hours before we could kill her, swimming, and using all her Subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and crossings in the Water.</p>
                        <p>Such is the Natural craft and subtlety of a <hi>Hare,</hi> that sometimes, after she hath been hunted three hours, she will start a fresh <hi>Hare,</hi> and squat in the same Form. Others, having been hunted a considerable time, will creep under the Door of a Sheep-coat, and there hide themselves among the Sheep; or when they are hard hunted, will run in among a flock of sheep, and cannot be gotten out from among them by any means, till the Hounds are coupled up, and the Sheep driven into their Pens. Some (and that is something strange) will take the ground like a <hi>Coney,</hi> and that is called
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100171:54"/>
                           <hi>going to the Vaut.</hi> Some <hi>Hares</hi> will go up one side of the Hedge, and come down the other, the thickness of the Hedge being the onely distance between the courses.</p>
                        <p>I have seen a <hi>Hare,</hi> that being sorely hunted, got up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Quick-set-hedge, and ran a good way upon the top thereof, and then lept off upon the ground. And they will frequently betake themselves to Furz-bushes, and will leap from one to the other, whereby the Hounds are frequently in default. Nay, which is more, I have heard of a <hi>Hare,</hi> that being hunted two hours or more, at length, to save her self, got upon an old Wall six foot high from the ground, and hid her self in the hole that was made for a Scaffold: and that several have swam over <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Severn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Hare</hi> liveth not above seven years at most, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Buck; and if he and the Doe shall keep one quarter together, they will never suffer any strange <hi>Hare</hi> to sit by them; and therefore it is proverbially said, <hi>The more you hunt, the more</hi> Hares <hi>you shall have;</hi> because when you have killed one <hi>Hare,</hi> another will come and possess his Form.</p>
                        <p>An <hi>Hare</hi> hath greater Scent, and is more eagerly hunted by the Hounds, when she feeds and relieveth upon green Corn, than at any other time in the year: and yet there are some <hi>Hares</hi> which naturally give a greater Scent than others; as the great Wood-<hi>Hares;</hi> and such as are foul and measled, and keep near to the Waters: But the little red <hi>Hare,</hi> which is not much bigger than a <hi>Coney,</hi> is neither of so strong a Scent, nor so eagerly hunted. Such as feed upon the small branches of wild Time, or such-like Herbs, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very swist, and will stand long up before the Hounds. In like manner you have some <hi>Hares</hi> more subtile and cunning than others. Young <hi>Hares</hi> which have not been hunted are foolish, and are neither of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100171:54"/>
force nor capacity to use such subtleties and crafts, but hold on end-ways before the Hounds most commonly, and do squat and start again oftentimes, which doth much encourage the Hounds, and enters them better than if the <hi>Hare</hi> flies and-ways, as sometimes they will five or six mile an end.</p>
                        <p>The Females are more crafty and politick than the Bucks; for they double and turn shorter than they, which is displeasant to the Hounds; for it is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for them to turn often, delighting more in an end-way-chase, running with all their force: for such <hi>Hares</hi> as double and cross so often, it is requisite at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault to cast the greater compass about, when you beat to make it out, for so you will find all her subtilties, and yet need to stick upon none of them, but onely where she went on forwards: By this means you will abate her force, and compel her to leave doubling and crossing.</p>

                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>How to Enter Hounds to the <hi>Hare.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Let the Huntsinan be sure in the first place to make his Hounds very well acquainted with him and his Voice, and let them understand the Horn; and to this end let him never blow his Horn or hallow but when there is good cause for so doing, and let him be sure that his Hounds want no encouragement.</p>
                        <p>Here by the way observe two remarkable things. The first is, if you intend to enter a young Kennel of Hounds, you must take notice of the Country where you will make your first Quarry, and whereof you make it. For according to the places wherein they are first entred, and the nature of the Quarry given them, they will prove accordingly for the future. Thus if they are first entred in the Plains and Champain-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, they will ever after more delight to hunt there
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100171:55"/>
than in any other place: and so it is the same with the Coverts.</p>
                        <p>But, say some of our Huntsmen, all strange Countries that differ from that to which Hounds are accustomed, causes them at first to be at seek: But good Hounds will soon be master of any Country; and therefore he that would have the best Hounds, must use them to all kinds of Hunting: And it is easie to bring Hounds to enjoy a Scent from a bleak Down to a fresh Pasture. And therefore many of us love to enter in the worst Countries.</p>
                        <p>Do not accustom your Hounds to hunt in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because of the Dew and moisture of the Earth: and besides, you will find by experience, that if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you hunt them in the heat of the day, they will soon give over the chase; neither will they call on willingly or chearfully, but seek out the shades to sleep in. Yet many of us agree, that to hunt both early and late in the morning by Trayling, advantageth the Hounds to use their Noses; and by keeping them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the heat of the day, or till night, moves them to stoutness.</p>
                        <p>The best season to enter your young Hounds is in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> for then the weather is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, neither too hot nor too cold; and then is the time to find young <hi>Hares</hi> which have never been hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which are foolish, and ignorant of the politick crossings, doublings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their Sires, running com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly end-ways, frequently squatting, and as often starting, by which encouragement the Hounds are the better entered.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Hare</hi> hath greater Scent, and is more eagerly hunted by the Hounds, when she feedeth and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on green Corn, than at any other time of the year.</p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:100171:55"/>
                        <p>Moreover, some <hi>Hares</hi> have naturally a greater scent than others, as the great Wood-<hi>Hares,</hi> and such as are foul and measled, having their greatest resort near the Water and Plashes.</p>
                        <p>The little small red <hi>Hare,</hi> not much bigger than a <hi>Coney,</hi> is very feeble, and not much covered by the Hounds, having a bad scent: but such as feed on the small branches of wilde Time are commonly very swift, and will stand up a long time before the Hounds.</p>
                        <p>The Does are much craftier than the Bucks, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and turning oftner and shorter, which is very vexatious and troublesome to the Hounds. Now for such <hi>Hares</hi> as double and cross so often, it is requisite at a default to cast the greater compass about when you draw to make it out; so shall you find all their subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; though it is needless to stick upon any, but where they went onwards: by so doing you will abate the force of a <hi>Hare,</hi> and force her from crossing and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                        <p>Some <hi>Hares</hi> hold the high beaten ways onely, where the Hounds can have no scent: wherefore when the Huntsman finds his Hounds at a default in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, let him hunt on until he find where the <hi>Hare</hi> hath broken from the High-way, or hath found some Dale or fresh place where the Hounds may recover scent, looking narrowly on the ground as he goeth, if he can find the Footing or Pricking of the <hi>Hare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are other places wherein a Hound can finde no scent; and that is in fat and rotten ground, and it sticketh to the Foot of the <hi>Hare,</hi> which is called <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,</hi> and so consequently she leaves no scent behinde her. So likewise there are certain Months wherein a Hound can find no scent, and that is in the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, by reason of the fragrant smell of Flowers, and the like.</p>
                        <p>Shun, as much as you can, hunting in hard frosty wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100171:56"/>
for so you will surbate or founder your Hounds, and make them lose their Claws: besides, at that time a <hi>Hare</hi> runneth better than at any other time, the Soals of her feet being hairy.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, the best way of entring your young Hounds, is by the help of old Staunch-Hounds; so will they the better learn to cast for it at a doubling or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault.</p>

                        <head>What time of the year is best for Hare-Hunting: How to find her, start her, and chase her.</head>
                        <p>The best time to begin Hare-Hunting, is about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> ending towards the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> lest you destroy the early brood of <hi>Leve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets.</hi> Moreover, upon the approach of Winter the moistness and coolness of the Earth increaseth, which is agreable to the nature of the Hounds, and very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, they ever hating extream heats and hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Your Hounds being two years old and upwards, you may exercise them thrice a Week, and they will be the better for so often hunting, provided you feed well; and keep out your Hounds the greatest part of the day, both to try their stoutness, and to make them stout.</p>
                        <p>If there be any Hound which hath found the Trail of a <hi>Hare</hi> where she hath relieved that night, let the Huntsman then forbear being over-hasty, but let the Hounds make it of themselves: and when he shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they begin to draw in together, and to call on freshly, then let him encourage them, especially that Hound which hunteth best, frequently calling him by his name.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that a <hi>Hare</hi> leaveth better scent when
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100171:56"/>
she goeth to relief, than when she goeth towards her Form: for when she relieveth in the Field, she couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her body low upon the ground, passing often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one piece of ground, to find where lieth the best food; and thus leaveth the better Scent, crotying also sometimes.</p>
                        <p>Besides, when she goes to her Form, she commonly takes the High-ways, doubling, crossing, and leaping as lightly as she can; in which places the Hounds can have no scent, (as is said before) by reason of the dust, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet they will squat by the sides of the High-ways; and therefore let the Huntsman beat very well the sides of those High-ways.</p>
                        <p>Now having found where a <hi>Hare</hi> hath relieved in some Pasture or Corn-field, then must you consider the season of the year, and what Weather it is: for if it be in the Spring-time, or Summer, a <hi>Hare</hi> will not then sit in the Bushes, because they are frequently offended with Pismires, Snakes and Adders, but will sit in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields and open places.</p>
                        <p>In winter they love to sit near Towns and Villages in Tufts of Thorns and Brambles, especially when the Wind is Northerly or Southerly.</p>
                        <p>According to the season and nature of the place where the <hi>Hare</hi> is accustomed to sit, there beat with your Hounds and start her; which is much better sport than Trailing of her from her Relief to her Form.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Hare</hi> is started and on foot, then step in where you saw her pass, and hallow in your Hounds until they have all undertaken it and go on with it in full cry: then Recheat to them with your Horn, following fair and softly at first, making neither too much haste nor noise with Horn or Voice: for at the first Hounds are apt to over-shoot the chase through too much heat. But having ran the space of an hour,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100171:57"/>
and that you see the Hounds are well in with it, stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well upon it, then you may come in nearer with the Hounds, because by that time their heat will be cooled, and they will hunt more soberly. But above all things mark the first doubling, which must be your direction for the whole day; for all the doublings that she afterwards shall make will be like the former: and according to the policies that you shall see her use, and the place where you hunt, you must make your compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses great or little, long or short, to help the defaults, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways seeking the moistest and most commodious places for the Hounds to scent in.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, those who delight in the commendable Exercise of Hunting the <hi>Hare,</hi> must rise early, lest they be deprived of the scent of her foot-steps, by which means the Dogs will be incapacitated to follow their Game; for the nature of the scent is such, that it will not remain long, but suddainly, in a manner every hour, vanisheth away.</p>

                     <p>The Walls or Pales must be high, or close joynted, so as neither <hi>Badger</hi> nor <hi>Cat</hi> can creep through, nor <hi>Wolf,</hi> nor <hi>Fox</hi> can leap over; wherein ought also to be Bushes and broad Trees to cover the Beasts against heat and cold, and other secret places to satisfie their natures, and to defend the lesser beasts, as <hi>Hares, Conveys,</hi> &amp;c. from <hi>Hawks, Kites,</hi> and other ravening Fowls: in which three or four couple of <hi>Hares</hi> will quickly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply into a great Warren.</p>
                     <p>It is very good to sow Gourds, Misceline, Corn, Barley, Pease, and such-like, wherein <hi>Hares</hi> delight, and will thereby quickly grow fat.</p>
                     <p>Warreners have a very crafty device to fatten <hi>Hares,</hi> which by experience is found effectual, and that is by putting Wax into their Ears, and so make them deaf; then turn them into the place where they should seed, where being freed from the fear of Sounds (for want of hearing) they grow fat before other of their kind.</p>

                     <p>BEfore we speak of the Hunting of the <hi>Coney,</hi> it will not be amiss to take notice of her nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, which are these: the carrieth her young in her Belly thirty days; as soon as she hath kindued she goes to Buck. They begin to breed in <hi>England</hi> at a year old (but sooner in other places) and so coutinue, bearing at least seven times in a year if they Litter in <hi>March;</hi> this is the reason that a small stock will serve to increase a large Warren. The Does cannot suckle their young till they have been with the Buck, which must be done pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, or she will not be inclined fourteen days after.</p>
                     <p>When the Buck goes to Doe, he will beat very strongly with his fore-Foot upon the ground, and by that means he heateth himself. When he hath buckt, he is accustomed to fall backwards, and lie as if he were in a Trance or half dead, at which time he is easily taken.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Latines</hi> call a <hi>Coney, Cuniculus,</hi> because it maketh holes in the Earth; and <hi>Cuniculus</hi> was a Latine word for a Hole or Cave in the Earth, before it was taken for a <hi>Coney.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Bucks will kill the young if they can come at them, like to your Bore-cats; and therefore the Doe prevents that mischief, by covering her Stop or Nest
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100171:58"/>
with Earth or Gravel, that so they may not easily be discovered.</p>
                     <p>Those who keep <hi>Coneys</hi> tame for profit, may give them to eat Vine-leaves, Fruits, Herbs, Grass, Bran, Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, Mallows, Milk-thistles, Apple-parings, Cabbage, Lettise, or Carret-tops. In Winter they will eat Hay, Oats, and Chaff, being given to them thrice a day: but when they eat green things, they must not drink at all, because of the Dropsie which will follow: At all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times a little drink must serve their turn, and that must be always fresh. Here note, give them not too much green juicy meat, unless you entermix there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with what is dry, as Oats, Chaff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> otherwise they will be <hi>Cathed,</hi> or tun-bellied.</p>
                     <p>Now the way of taking them is either by small Curs or Spaniels bred up for that sport; and their places for hunting are among Bushes and Hedges; or else by coursing them with small Grey-hounds. In their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault they are commonly driven into their Burrows; and therefore it will be very requisite to set Purse-nets on the Holes, then put in a Ferret close muzzled, and she will make the <hi>Coneys,</hi> bolt out again into the Purse-nets, and so you may take them. Some say the Drone of a Bag-pipe, put into a Coney-borrow, and blown on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, will make <hi>Coneys</hi> bolt.</p>
                     <p>For want of a Ferret; you may take the powder of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and some Brimstone, and therewith make a smother in the Burrows, and so they will bolt out. But this way is not to be approved of; for by that means the <hi>Coneys</hi> will forsake those Burrows, and so in a little time a Warren will be destroy'd, should this course be used fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</p>
                     <p>But above Nets and Ferrets, Hays are to be preferred for the taking of <hi>Coneys;</hi> neither is the drawing Ferret to be despised when they are young. Likewise there is excellent sport to be made with our Tumblers, who will kill <hi>Coneys</hi> abundantly.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Ferret</hi> is a little creature that is not bred in <hi>Spain, Italy, France,</hi> nor <hi>Germany;</hi> but in <hi>England</hi> they breed naturally, and are tamed for the benefit of such who keep Warrens, and others.</p>
                     <p>It is a bold and audacious Beast, Enemy to all others but his own kind, drinking and sucking in the blood of the beast it biteth, but eateth not the flesh.</p>
                     <p>When the Warrener hath an occasion to use his <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> he first makes a noise in the Warren to frighten what <hi>Coneys</hi> are abroad into their Burrows, and then he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Nets; after that, he puts his <hi>Ferret</hi> into the Earth, having a long Strick, with Bells about her Neck, whose Mouth must be muzzled, so that he may not seize, but frighten the <hi>Coneys</hi> out of their Burrows, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards driven by Dogs into the Nets or Hays so planted for them.</p>
                     <p>The Body is longer for the proportion than the quantity may afford. Their colour is variable, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times black and white on the Belly, but most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a yellowish sandy colour, like Wool died in Urine. The Head is little, like a Mouse's; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into whatsoever Hole she can put it in, all her body will easily follow after. The Eyes are small, but fiery like red-hot Iron, and therefore she seeth most clearly in the dark. Her Voice is a whining cry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing it: She hath onely two Teeth in her neither Chap, standing out, and not joyned and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

together. The Genital of the Male is of a bony substance, and therefore it always standeth stiff, and is not lesser at one time than another. The pleasure of the sence in Copulation is not in the Genital-part, but in the Muscles, Tunicles, and Nerves wherein the said Genital runneth. When they are in Copulation the Female lieth down, or bendeth her Knees, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually crieth like a Cat, either because the Male claweth her with his nails, or by reason of the roughness of his Genital.</p>
                     <p>She usually brings forth seven or eight at a time, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them forty days in her little belly: The young ones newly littered are blind thirty days together; and within forty days after they can see, they may be used as their dam for profit and recreation.</p>
                     <p>When tamed, they are nourished with Milk or with Barley-bread, and they can fast a very long time. When they go, they contract their long back, and make it stand upright in the middle round like a Bowl: when they are touched, they smell like a <hi>Martel;</hi> and they sleep very much. Thus much of the <hi>Ferret,</hi> which I thought good to place after the Chapter of Coney-catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because this little Animal is such a necessary Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that purpose.</p>

                     <p>HIs Shape and Proportion is so well known, being a beast so common, that it will be needless to describe him.</p>
                     <p>His nature in many respects is like that of a <hi>Wolf,</hi> for they bring as many Cubs at a Litter one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but thus they differ; the <hi>Fox</hi> Litters deep under the ground, so doth not the <hi>Wolf,</hi>

                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:100171:60"/>
                     <p>A Bitch-<hi>Fox</hi> is hardly to be taken when she is brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and with Cub; for then she will lie near her Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, into which she runs upon the hearing of the least noise. And indeed at any time it is somewhat diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; for the <hi>Fox</hi> (and so the <hi>Wolf</hi>) is a very subtile crafty creature.</p>
                     <p>Fox-hunting is very pleasant; for by reason of his strong hot scent he maketh an excellent Cry: And as his scent is hottest at hand, so it dies soonest. Besides, he never flies far before the Hounds, trusting not on his Legs, Strength, or Champion ground, but strongest Coverts. When he can no longer stand up before the Hounds, he then taketh Earth, and then must he be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out.</p>
                     <p>If Grey-hounds course him on a Plain, his last refuge is to piss on his Tail, and flap it in their Faces as they come near him; sometimes squirting his thicker Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, to make them give over the Course a pursuit.</p>
                     <p>When a Bitch-<hi>Fox</hi> goes a clicketing and seeketh sot a Dog, she cryeth with a hollow Voice, not unlike the howling of a mad Dog; and in the same manner she cries when she misseth any of her Cubs: but never makes any cry at all when she is killing, but defend her self to the last gasp.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fox</hi> will prey upon any thing he can overcome, and feeds upon all sorts of Carrion; but their dainties and the food which they most delight in, is Poultry. They are very destructive and injurious to Coney-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, and will sometimes kill <hi>Hares</hi> by deceit and subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not by swift running.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fox</hi> is taken with Hounds, Grey-hounds, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, Nets, and Gins.</p>
                     <p>Of Terriers there are two sorts, The one is crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd, and commonly short-hair'd: and these will take
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100171:60"/>
Earth well, and will lie very long at <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badger.</hi> The other sort is shagged and straight Legg'd: and these will not onely hunt above-ground as other Hounds, but also enter the Earth with much more fury than the former; but cannot stay in so long, by reason of their great eagerness.</p>
                     <p>The time of entring these Terriers, is when they are near a twelve-month old; for if you enter him not in within this time, you will hardly after bring him to take the Earth. And to encourage the young Terrier the more, put in an old one before him, that can better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the fury of the <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badger:</hi> and be careful that neither of them be old when you engage your young Terrier with him.</p>
                     <p>The entring and fleshing them may be done several ways. In the first place thus: When <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> have young Cubs, then take your old Terriers and enter them in the ground; and when they begin to bay, you must then hold every one of your Terriers at a sundry Hole or Mouth of the Earth, that they may listen and hear the old ones Bay. Having taken the old <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badger,</hi> and that nothing remains within but the young Cubs, then couple up all your old Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and put in the young in their stead, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them by crying, <hi>To him, to him, to him.</hi> And if they take any young Cub within the ground, let them alone to do what they please with him; and forget not to give the old Terriers their reward, which is the Blood and Livers, fryed with Cheese and some of their own Grease, shewing them the Heads and Skins to encourage them. Before you reward them, wash them with Soap and warm Water, to clear their Skins from Earth and Clay that is clodded to the Hair, otherwise they are apt to be mangie. You may also enter them in this manner: Take an old <hi>Fox,</hi> or <hi>Badger,</hi> and cut away the neither Jaw, but meddle not with the other,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100171:61"/>
leaving the upper to shew the fury of the Beast, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it can do no harm therewith. Then dig an Earth in some convenient place in your own grounds, and be careful to make it wide enough, to the intent the Terriers may turn therein the better, and that there may be room enough for two to enter together: then cover the Hole with boards and Turf, putting the <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badger</hi> first therein, and afterwards put in your Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both young and old, encouraging them with words that are the usual terms of Art. When they have bay'd sufficiently, then begin to dig with Spades and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, to encourage them against such time as you are to dig over them: then take out the <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badger</hi> with the Clamps or Pinchers, killing it before them, or let a Grey-hound kill it in their sight, and make them reward thereof. Here note, that instead of cutting away the Jaw, it will be every whit as well to break out all his Teeth, to prevent him from biting the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers.</p>
                     <p>Now to say the truth, there is not much pastime or pleasure in Hunting of a <hi>Fox</hi> under ground; for as soon as that subtle creature perceiveth the Terriers, if they bay hard, and lie near unto them, they will bolt out immediately, unless it be when the Bitch hath young Cubs, then they will sooner die than stir.</p>
                     <p>They make their Earths as near as they can in ground that is hard to dig, as in Clay, Stoney-ground, or amongst the Roots of Trees; and their Earths have commonly but one Hole, and that is straight a long way in before it come at their Couch. Sometimes craftily they possess themselves of a <hi>Badger's</hi> old Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which hath variety of Chambers, Holes, and Angles.</p>
                     <p>When a good Terrier doth once binde the <hi>Fox,</hi> he then yearns, and defends himself very notably, but not so strenuously as the <hi>Badger,</hi> nor is his biting half so
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100171:61"/>
dangerous. Here note, if you take a Bitch-<hi>Fox</hi> when she goeth a Clicketing, and cut out that Gut which containeth her Sperm, together with the Kidneys which Gelders deprive Bitches of when they spay them, and cut them into small gobbets, mingling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Gum of Mastick, and put them hot as they are into a Pot, and cover the same close, it will serve for an excellent Train for a <hi>Fox,</hi> and will keep the whole year round. Take the Skin of Bacon, and broil it well on a Gridiron, then dip it in the ingredients of the Pot aforesaid, and make a train thereof, you will expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally find, that if there be any <hi>Fox</hi> near to any place where the train is drawn, he will follow it; but let him who makes the train rub the soals of his Feet with Cow-dung, lest the <hi>Fox</hi> vent his footing: and thus you may train a <hi>Fox</hi> to a standing, and kill him in an Evening with Gun or Cross-bow. It is likewise found by experience, that if a Terrier be rubbed with Brimstone, or with Oil of Cade, and then put him into an Earth where either a <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badger</hi> is, they will leave that Earth, and come not to it again a good while after.</p>
                     <p>I shall conclude this discourse with what I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in <hi>Gesner's History of Beasts</hi> tending to the same purpose: saith he, <q>As he frequently cheats the <hi>Badger</hi> of his Habitation by laying his Excrements at the mouth of his Earth or Burrow; so, for as much as the <hi>Wolf </hi> is an Enemy to the <hi>Fox,</hi> he layeth in the mouth of his Earth an Herb called a Sea-onion, which a <hi>Wolf </hi> naturally hates, and is so averse thereunto, that he will never come near the place where it either lies or grows.</q>

                        <head>Of Fox-Hunting above ground.</head>
                        <p>To this purpose you must draw with your Hounds about Groves, Thickets, and Bushes near Villages: for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100171:62"/>
a <hi>Fox</hi> will lurk in such places, to prey on young Pigs and Pullein.</p>
                        <p>But it will be necessary to stop up his Earths, if you can find them, the night before you intend to hunt; and the best time will be about midnight, for then the <hi>Fox</hi> goeth out to seek his Prey. You may stop his Holes by laying two white sticks a cross before them, which will make him imagine it is some Gin or Trap laid for him: or else you may stop them up close with black-Thorns and Earth together.</p>
                        <p>The best hunting a <hi>Fox</hi> above-ground, is in <hi>January, February,</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> for then you shall best see your Hounds hunting, and best find his Earthing; besides, at those times the <hi>Fox's</hi> Skin is best in season.</p>
                        <p>Again, the Hounds best hunt the <hi>Fox</hi> in the coldest weather, because he leaveth a very strong scent behind him; yet in cold weather it chills fastest.</p>
                        <p>At first onely cast off your sure Finders, and as the Drag mends, so adde more as you dare trust them.</p>
                        <p>Shun casting off too many Hounds at once, because Woods and Coverts are full of sundry Chases, and so you may engage them in too many at one time.</p>
                        <p>Let such as you cast off at first be old Staunch-Hounds, which are sure; and if you hear such a Hound call on merrily, you may cast off some other to him; and when they run it on the full cry, cast off the rest: and thus you shall compleat your pastime.</p>
                        <p>The words of comfort are the same which are used in the other chases, attended with the same Hallowings and other ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>Let the Hounds kill the <hi>Fox</hi> themselves, and worry and hare him as much as they please: many Hounds will eat him with eagerness.</p>
                        <p>When he is dead, hang him at the end of a Pike-staff, and hallow in all your Hounds to bay him: but reward them not with any thing belonging to the <hi>Fox;</hi> for it is not good, neither will they eat it.</p>

                     <head>Of Badger-Hunting.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Badger</hi> is called by several names, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Gray, Brock, Boreson</hi> or <hi>Bauson,</hi> and in <hi>France Tausson.</hi> The Male is called a <hi>Badger</hi> or <hi>Boar-pig;</hi> and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is called a <hi>Sow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Beasts are plentiful in <hi>Naples, Sicily, Lucane,</hi> and in the <hi>Alpine</hi> and <hi>Helvetian</hi> Coasts; so are they also here in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two kinds of this beast, (saith <hi>Gesner</hi>) one resembling a Dog in his feet, and the other a Hog in his cloven hoof: they differ too in their snout and colour; for the one resembles the snout of a Dog, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Swine: the one hath a greyer coat, or whiter coat than the other, and goeth farther out in seeking of its prey. They differ also in their meat, the one eating Flesh and Carrion like a Dog, the other Roots and Fruits like a Hog: both these kinds have been found in <hi>Normandy, France,</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Turbervil</hi> makes mention of two sorts of <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> likewise, but in a different manner. <q>For the one (saith he) casteth his Fiaunts long like a <hi>Fox,</hi> and have their residence in Rocks, making their Burrows very deep. The other sort make their Burrows in light ground, and have more variety of Cells and Chambers than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</q> The one of these is called the <hi>Badger-pig,</hi> and the other the <hi>Badger-whelp;</hi> or call one <hi>Canine,</hi> and the other <hi>Swinish.</hi> The first hath his Nose, Throat, and Ears yellowish like a <hi>Martern's</hi> Throat; and are much blacker, and higher Leg'd than the Badger-whelp. Both sorts live upon all Flesh, hunting greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after Carrion. They are very mischievous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100171:63"/>
to Warrens, especially when they are big with young.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Badgers</hi> when they Earth, after by digging they have entred a good depth, for the clearing of the Earth out, one of them falleth on the back, and the other layeth Earth on the belly, and so taking his hinder feet in his mouth, draweth the Belly-laden-<hi>Badger</hi> out of the Hole or Cave; and having disburdened her self, re-enters, and doth the like till all be finished.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Badgers</hi> are very sleepy, especially in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and seldom stir abroad but in the night; for which cause they are called <hi>Lucifugae,</hi> avoiders of the Light.</p>
                     <p>It is very pleasant to behold them when they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther materials for their Couch, as straw, leaves, moss, and such-like; for with their Feet and their Head they will wrap as much together as a man can well carry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his arm, and will make shift to get it into their Cells and Couches.</p>
                     <p>He hath very sharp Teeth, and therefore is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a deep biting beast: his back is broad, and his legs are longer on the right side than the left, and therefore he runneth best when he gets on the side of an Hill, or a Cart-road-way. His fore-Legs have very sharp Nails, bare, and apt to dig withal, being five both before and behinde, but the hinder very much shorter, and covered with hair. His savour is strong, and much troubled with Lice about the secrets. Both Male and Female have under their Hole another Hole outwardly, but not inwardly in the Male. If she be hunted abroad with Hounds, she biteth them most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously where-ever she lays hold on them. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention thereof, the careful Huntsmen put great broad Collars made of <hi>Grays</hi> Skins about their Dogs Necks Her manner is to fight on her back, using thereby both her Teeth and her Nails; and by blowing up her Skin
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100171:63"/>
after a strange and wonderful manner, she defendeth her self against any blow and teeth of Dogs; onely a small stroke on her Nose will dispatch her presently; you may thrash your heart weary on her back, which she values as a matter of nothing.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> they eat the flesh of <hi>Badgers,</hi> and so they do in <hi>Germany,</hi> boiling it with Pears: some have eaten it here in <hi>England,</hi> but like it not, being of a sweet rankish taste.</p>
                     <p>The flesh is best in <hi>September</hi> if it be fat; and of the two kinds, the Swinish <hi>Badger</hi> is better flesh than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>They love Hogs-flesh above any other; for take but a piece of Pork and train it over a <hi>Badger's</hi> Burrow, if he be within, you shall quickly see him appear without.</p>
                     <p>Their nature is very cold; and therefore when it snoweth they will not come out of their holes for three or four days together.</p>
                     <p>They live long, and by mere age will grow blinde; then will they not stir out of their Holes, but are fed by those who have their sight.</p>
                     <p>This subtilty they have, that when they perceive the Terriers begin to yearn them, they will stop the hole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Terriers and them: if the Terriers continue baying, they will remove their baggage with them, and go into another apartment or chamber of the Burrow, (for know that some of their Houses have half a dozen rooms at least;) and so will remove from one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till they can go no further, barricadoing the way as they go.</p>
                     <p>The Hunting of a <hi>Badger</hi> must be after this manner: You must first seek the Earths and Burrows where he lieth, and in a clear Moon-shine night go and stop all the holes but one or two, and therein place some Sacks fastned with some drawing Strings, which may shut him in as soon as he straineth the Bag.</p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:100171:64"/>
                     <p>The Sacks or Bags being thus set, cast of your Hounds, and beat all the Groves, Hedges, and Tufts within a mile or two about. What <hi>Badgers</hi> are abroad, being alarm'd by the Dogs, will straight repair to their Earths or Burrows, and so be taken.</p>
                     <p>Let him that standeth to watch the Sacks, stand close, and upon a clear Wind, for else the <hi>Badger</hi> will soon find him, and fly some other way for safety. But if the Hounds either encounter him, or undertake the chase before he can get into his Earth, he will then stand at bay like a <hi>Boar,</hi> and make most incomparable sport.</p>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>What Instruments are to be used in digging, and how to dig for <hi>Badger</hi> or <hi>Fox.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>In the first place, you must have such as are able to dig: next, you must have so many Terriers garnished with Bells hung in Collars, to make the <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badga</hi> bolt the sooner; besides, the Collars will be some smal defense unto the Terriers.</p>
                        <p>The Instruments to dig withal are these: a sharp pointed Spade, which serveth to begin the Trench when the ground is hardest, and broader Tools will not so wel enter; the round hollowed Spade, which is useful to dig amongst Roots, having very sharp edges; the flat broad Spade, to dig withal when the Trench is better opened and the ground softer; Mattocks and Pick-axes, to dig in hard ground where a Spade will do but little service the Coal-rake, to cleanse the Hole, and to keep it from stopping up; the Clamps, whereby you may take a <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badger</hi> out alive to make sport therewith afterwards. And it would not be amiss to have a Pail of Water, to refresh your Terriers after they are come out of the Earth to take breath.</p>
                        <p>In this order you may besiege a <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Badger</hi> in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100171:64"/>
their strongest Holes or Castles, and may break their Casmats, Platforms, Parapets, and work to them with Mines and Counter-mines, until you have obtained your satisfaction. But there is a shorter method than this, which by reason of its commonness I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to mention.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of the <hi>Otter.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is supposed by some that the <hi>Otter</hi> is of the kind of <hi>Beavers,</hi> being it is an amphibious creature living both in the Water and on the Land; besides, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of the parts beareth a similitude of that beast. Some say, were his tail off, he were in all parts like a <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> differing in nothing but habitation: For the <hi>Beaver</hi> frequenteth both the Salt-water and the Fresh; but the <hi>Otter</hi> never goeth to the Salt.</p>
                     <p>Though the <hi>Otter</hi> live in the Water, yet it doth not breath like Fishes through the benefit of the Water, it doth breath like other four-footed beasts, yet it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a long time underneath the Water without respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>If he want prey in the Waters, then will he quit them for the Land; and if by painful hunting ashore he cannot fill his belly, he will feed on Herbs, Snails, or Frogs: neither will he take less pains in the water to satisfie hunger; for he will swim two miles together against the stream, that so, when his belly is full, the current of the stream may carry him down again to his designed Lodging, which is near the water, very artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially built with boughs, sprigs, and sticks couching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in excellent order, wherein he sitteth to keep him from the wet.</p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:100171:65"/>
                     <p>In the hunting of Fish he often pops his Nose above water to take breath: It is a creature of wonderful swistness and nimbleness in taking his prey, and for greediness takes more than he knows what to do with.</p>
                     <p>It is a very subtile and crafty beast, and indowed with a wonderful sagacity and sense of smelling, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he can directly wind the Fishes in the waters a mile or two off.</p>
                     <p>The flesh of this beast is both cold and filthy, because it feedeth on stinking Fish, and therefore not fit to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; yet it is eaten in <hi>Germany;</hi> and the <hi>Carthusian</hi> Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are forbidden to eat all manner of flesh of other four-footed beasts, yet they are not prohibited the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Otters.</hi> There are those in <hi>England,</hi> who late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have highly valued an Otter-pie, much good may it do them with it.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Otters</hi> must be hunted by special Dogs, such as are called <hi>Otter</hi> hounds, and also with special Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments called Otter-spears. When they find themselves wounded with a spear, they then come to Land, where they fight with the Dogs furiously; and except they be first wounded, they forsake not the Water: for they are not ignorant how safe a refuge the Waters are un to them, and how unequal a combat they shall sustain with Men and Dogs upon the Land: yet, because the cold Water annoyeth their green wounds, therefore they spin out their lives to the length of the thread, chusing rather to die in torments among Dogs, than to die in the Waters.</p>
                     <p>The Food of an <hi>Otter</hi> (as I said) is Fish; and her abode is commonly under the Root of some Tree near Rivers, Brooks, Pools, Meers, or Fish-ponds; and sometimes she will lie in a hollow Tree four or five foot above ground: and no Vermin can be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to a Warren, than the <hi>Otter</hi> is to a Fish-pond;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100171:65"/>
for she diveth and hunteth under water after that most wonderful manner, that few fish escape her, unless they are very swift and great.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Otter</hi> and <hi>Ferret</hi> grow salt much about the same time, and bring forth their young much after the same manner, neither having their constant number.</p>
                     <p>There is much craft and cunning in the hunting them; yet with pains-taking you may ensnare them under the water, and by River-sides, as you may a <hi>Hare</hi> with Hare-pipes and such-like Gins. They bite sore and venomously, and when occasion serves they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send themselves stoutly. If after their ensnaring they chance to abide there long, they will soon enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their teeth.</p>
                     <p>These creatures are footed like your water-Fowl, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a web between their claws, and have no heel, but a round ball under the soal of their Feet: and their Track is called their <hi>Mark,</hi> as the Slot of a <hi>Hart;</hi> and their Excrements are called <hi>Spraints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An <hi>Otter</hi> will not abide long in a place; for he is apt to be afraid and take distasle, (having an excellent Ear and Nose, for hearing and smelling;) and then he will forsake his Couch, and shift a mile or two up or down the River: and this he will do according as he findes scarcity of fishing.</p>
                     <p>In hunting of the <hi>Otter</hi> observe this, to send some to one side of the River whilst you are on the other, and so beat on the banks with your Dogs, and so you will soon find if there be an <hi>Otter</hi> in that quarter: for an <hi>Otter</hi> cannot endure long in the water, but must come forth to make his Spraints, and in the night some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to feed on Grass and such Herbs as the fields af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
                     <p>If any of the Hounds find out an <hi>Otter,</hi> then look in the soft grounds and moist places to see which way he bent his head: if the marks make no discovery,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100171:66"/>
you may partly perceive it by the spraints, and so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Hounds, and lodge him as a <hi>Hart</hi> or <hi>Deer.</hi> If you find not the <hi>Otter</hi> quickly, you may then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he is gone to couch somewhere farther off from the River: for sometimes he will seek his food a mile from the place of his rest, chusing rather to go up the River than down, because upwards he meets with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter scent of Fish; and bearing his nose into the wind, he shall the sooner finde any fault that is above him.</p>
                     <p>Remember, in the Hunting of the <hi>Otter,</hi> that you and your friends carry your Otter-spears to watch his Vents, for that is the chief advantage: and if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive where the <hi>Otter</hi> swims under water, then strive to get to a stand before him where he would vent, and there endeavour to strike him with your spear; but if you miss, pursue him with the Hounds, which if they be good Otter-hounds, and perfectly entred, will come chaunting and trailing along by the River-side, and will beat every Tree-root, every Osier-bed and tuft of Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rushes; nay, sometimes they will take the Water, and beat it like a Spaniel. And by these means the <hi>Otter</hi> can hardly escape you.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Squirrel</hi> is greater in compass than a <hi>Weasle,</hi> but the latter is longer than the other; the back-parts and all the body is reddish except the belly, which is white. In <hi>Helvetia</hi> they are black and branded, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100171:66"/>
they are hunted at the fall of the Leaf, when the Trees grow naked: for they run and leap from bough to bough in a most admirable and agile manner; and when the Leaves are on, they cannot be so well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. They are of three colours, in the first age black, in the second of a rusty Iron-colour, and lastly, when old, they are full of white hoar Hairs. Their Teeth are like the Teeth of Mice, having the two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Teeth very long and sharp. Their Tail is always as big as their Body, and it lieth continually on their back when they sleep or sit still, and it seemeth to be given them for a covering.</p>
                     <p>In the Summer-time they build them Nests (which by some are called <hi>Drays</hi>) in the Tops of the Trees very artificially with Sticks and Moss, with other things the Woods afford, and then they fill it with Nuts for Winter-provision, and do sleep like the <hi>Alpine</hi> Mouse most part thereof very soundly, in such sort, that the beating of the outside of their Drays will not wake them.</p>
                     <p>When they leap from Tree to Tree, they use their Tail instead of VVings, leaping a great distance, and are supported without sinking to any one's appearance; nay, they will frequently leap from a very high Tree down to the ground, and receive no harm.</p>
                     <p>Many must go together to hunt them, and must carry Dogs with them: and the fittest place for the exercise of this sport, is in little and small slender Woods, such as may be shaken by the hand. Bows are requisite to remove them when they rest in the twists of Trees; for they will not be much terrified with all the hallowing, except they be struck now and then by one means or other.

that labour must be supplied with Bows and Bolts, that when the <hi>Squirrel</hi> resteth, presently he may be thumpt by the blow of an Arrow: the Archer need not fear to do her much harm, except he hit her on the head, for by reason of a strong back-bone, and fleshy parts, she will abide as great a stroak as a Dog.</p>
                     <p>If they be driven to the ground from the trees, and they creep into Hedges, it is a sign of their weariness: for such is the lofty mind of this little beast, that while her strength lasteth she saveth her self in the tops of high trees; but being wearied, she descendeth, and falls into the mouths of the yelping curs that attend her.</p>
                     <p>The admirable wit of the <hi>Squirrel</hi> appeareth (if it be true) in her swimming, or passing over a River; for when hunger constraineth her so to do, she seeks out some rind, or small bark of a tree, which she setteth upon the water, and then goeth into it, and holding up her Tail like a Sail, letteth the wind drive her to the other side; and carry meat in their mouths, to prevent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whatsoever should befal them.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Martern</hi> is about the bigness of a Cat, having a longer body, but shorter legs, with head and tail like a <hi>Fox;</hi> its skin is commonly brown, white on the throat, and somewhat yellowish on the back.</p>
                     <p>Their teeth are exceeding white, and unequal, being above measure sharp; the canine teeth both above and below hang out very long.</p>
                     <p>This and the wild-<hi>Cat</hi> are a sort of Virmine which we use here in <hi>England</hi> commonly to Hunt, and as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100171:67"/>
necessary to be hunted as any Virmin can be: For the question may be doubtful, whether either <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> do more hurt than the wild-<hi>Cat</hi> doth, since there are so many Warrens every where throughout the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> which are very much infested by the wild-<hi>Cat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the opinion of long-experienced Huntsmen, that she leaveth as great scent, and maketh as good a cry for the time as any Vermin that is Hunted, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Martern</hi> passeth all other Vermin for sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of scent, and her Case is a noble Fur. The wild-<hi>Cat's</hi> Case is not so good, but it is very warm, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable for several Aches and Pains in the bones and joynts: also her Grease is very good for Sinews that are shrunk.</p>
                     <p>These two Chases are not to be sought purposely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Huntsman do see them where they prey, and can go readily to them; but if a Hound chance to cross them, he will hunt it as soon as any Chase, and they make a noble cry as long as they stand up; when they can do it no longer, they will take a tree, and so deceive the Hounds; but if the Hounds hold in to them, and will not give it over so, then they will leap from one tree to another, and make great shift for their lives, with much pastime to the Huntsmen.</p>
                     <p>When they are killed you must hold them up upon a piked staff, and hallow in all your Hounds, and then reward them with some meat; for the flesh of these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min is naught for Hounds.</p>

                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head type="sub">The Nature and Properties of a <hi>Wolf,</hi> and the manner of its Hunting.</head>
                        <p>HEretofore I read that there were many <hi>Wolves</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but now there are none; however they are still in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but their number is very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased within these thirty years; and that they may more and more decrease, being so pernicious to all sorts of Cattle, I thought good to publish the nature and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Hunting.</p>
                        <p>First, as to their Nature; they go a Clicketing in <hi>February,</hi> and continue in that manner ten or twelve days. Where many <hi>Wolves</hi> are, many will follow one Bitch, as Dogs will follow a Bitch that is salt, but she will be onely lined with one.</p>
                        <p>A notable story I have heard when I was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and attested for a truth by the Inhabitants: That a Bitch-<hi>Wolf</hi> proud, will suffer a great many of the Male to follow her, and will carry them after her sometimes eight or ten days without Meat, Drink, or Rest; and when they are so tired that they cannot travel farther, she will first lie down, then will the rest follow her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: when she perceives that they are all asleep, and through weariness snore, then will she arise and awake that <hi>Wolf</hi> which she observed to follow her most, and having so done, entice him with her far from the rest, and suffer him to line her: the rest awaking and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her missing, pursue her by the scent, and finding
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100171:68"/>
how she hath cunningly deluded them, they fall instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on her Companion who hath been before-hand with them, and revenge themselves on him by depriving him of his life; which verifies the proverb: <hi>Never</hi> Wolf <hi>yet ever saw his Sire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Their Whelps are able to ingender at twelve months end, at which age they part with their Dam, that is, when those Teeth are grown which they cast the first half year, and being grown, they never shed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and here see their gratitude, (though bloody cruel creatures) after they have preyed for themselves, if they chance to meet their Dam or Sire (for <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> doth not believe the aforesaid story) they will fawn upon them and lick them, rejoycing at the sight of them.</p>
                        <p>The Dog will never bring any of his Prey to his whelps till he hath filled his own belly; whereas the Bitch will not eat a bit till she hath served them first: they go nine weeks with whelp, and sometimes a little longer, and grow salt but once a year. As to number of whelps, they have more or less as Dogs have; for doubtless both the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>Fox</hi> are but a kind of wild Mastiffs and wild Curs.</p>
                        <p>They prey upon all kind of things, and will feed on Carrion, Vermin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They will kill a Cow or a Bullock; and as for a Sheep, Goat, or good Porket, they will roundly carry him off in their Mouths, not touching ground with it, and will run so fast away, notwithstanding the load, that they are hardly to be stopped but by Mastiffs or Horse-men. There is no Beast which runneth faster than the <hi>Wolf,</hi> and holdeth wonderfully also. When he is hunted with Hounds, he flieth not far before them; and unless he be coursed with Grey-hounds or Mastiffs, he keepeth the Covert like the <hi>Bear,</hi> or <hi>Boar,</hi> and especially the bearen ways therein. Night is the usual time of his preying,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100171:69"/>
though hunger will force him to prey by day. They are more subtile and crafty (if more can be) than the <hi>Fox</hi> or any other beast: When they are hunted, they will take all their advantages; at other times they will never run over-hastily, but keep themselves in breath and force always.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Wolf</hi> will stand up a whole day before a good Kennel of Hounds, unless that Grey-hounds or <hi>Wolf</hi>-dogs course him. If he stand at bay, have a care of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bitten by him; for being then mad, the wound is desperate, and hard to be cured.</p>
                        <p>When a <hi>Wolf</hi> falls into a flock of Sheep, with his good will he would kill them all before he feed upon any of them, and therefore all means should be used to destroy them, as by hunting at force, or with Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds or Mastiffs, or caught in Gins and Snares; but they had need be strong. For encouragement to the meaner sort in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whosoever took a sucking-Whelp, or preying Cub, a Dog or a Bitch <hi>Wolf,</hi> and brought but the heads of either to the next Justice of Peace, for reward for the first, he received twenty shillings; for the second, forty; for the third, five pound; and for the last, six pounds: which late en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement hath in a manner cleared that Kindom of them.</p>
                        <p>They bark and howl like unto Dogs; and if there be but two of them together, they make such a terrible hideous noise, that you would think there could be no less than twenty of them in a body.</p>
                        <p>When any one would hunt the <hi>Wolf,</hi> he must train him by these means: First let him look out some fair place, a mile or more from the great woods, where there is some close standing to place a brace of good Grey-hounds in, if need be, the which should be closely environed, and some pond of water by it: there he must kill a Horse that is worth little, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100171:69"/>
take the four legs thereof and carry them into the Woods and Forests adjoyning; then let four men take every man a leg of the beast and draw it at his Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail all along the paths and ways in the Woods, until they come back again to the place where the Carcass of the said Beast lieth; there let them lay down their trains. Now when the <hi>Wolves</hi> go out in the night to prey, they will follow the scent of the train till they come to the carcass where it lieth. Then let those who love the sport, with their Huntsmen come early and privately near the place; and if they are discernable as they are seeding, in the first place let them consider which way will be the fairest course for the Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, and place them accordingly, and as near as they can let them forestal with their Grey-hounds the same way that the <hi>Wolves</hi> did or are flying either then or the night before; but if the <hi>Wolves</hi> be in the coverts near the carrien that was laid for them to feed upon, then let there be hewers set round the coverts to make a noise on every side, but onely that where the Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds do stand; and let them stand thick together, making what noise they can to force them to the Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds: Then let the Huntseman go with his Leam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, and draw from the carrion to the thickets-sides where the <hi>Wolves</hi> have gone in, and there the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall cast off the third part of their best Hounds; for a <hi>Wolf</hi> will sometimes hold a covert a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will come out.</p>
                        <p>The Huntsmen must hold near in to the Hounds blowing hard, and encouraging them with their voice: for many Hounds will strain courtesie at this chase, although they are strong and fit for all other chases.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Wolf</hi> cometh to the Grey-hounds, they who hold them will do well to suffer the <hi>Wolf</hi> to pass by the first rank until he come further, and let the last
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100171:70"/>
Rank let slip their Grey-hounds full in the face of the <hi>Wolf,</hi> and at the same instant let all the other Ranks let slip also: so that the first Rank staying him but ever so little, he may be assaulted on all sides at once, and by that means they shall the more easily take him.</p>
                        <p>It is best entring of Hounds at young <hi>Wolves</hi> which are not yet past half a year or a year old; for a Hound will hunt such more willing, and with less fear than an old <hi>Wolf;</hi> or you may take <hi>Wolves</hi> alive in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and breaking their Teeth, enter your Hounds at them.</p>
                        <p>A man may know a Dog-<hi>Wolf</hi> from a Bitch by the tracks of his Feet; for the Dog hath a greater Heel, a greater Toe, greater Nails, and a rounder Foot. Besides, the Bitch casteth her Fiaunts commonly in the midst of an High-way, whereas the Dog casteth them either on the one side or the other of the Path.</p>
                        <p>The Reward of the Dogs is thus: when they have bit and shaked the dead <hi>Wolf,</hi> let the Huntsman then open his Belly straight along, and taking out his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, let him throw in Bread, Cheese, and other Scraps, and so let the Dogs feed therein.</p>

                        <p>I Never could read or hear that there was ever any such Chase in <hi>England</hi> as the Hunting of the wild-<hi>Goat:</hi> But since there may be such sport in <hi>Wales,</hi> as there hath been elsewhere, it will not be much amiss to give some short account thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Wild-<hi>Goat</hi> is as big as a <hi>Hart,</hi> but not so long, or so long Leg'd, but is as fleshy. They have Wreaths
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100171:70"/>
and wrinkles on their horns, which declare what their age is: for according to the quantity of the wreaths, such is the number of their years; which wreaths he meweth, but not his beam, the which may be, if he be an old <hi>Goat,</hi> as big as a mans leg.</p>
                        <p>They have a great long beard, and are of a brownish gray colour very shaggy, having a long black list down the ridge of the back, and the track is bigger than the slot of a <hi>Hart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They fawn as a <hi>Hinde</hi> or <hi>Doe</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> and have but one fawn, which they suckle and bring up as the tame <hi>Goat</hi> doth her kid.</p>
                        <p>They feed like <hi>Deer,</hi> onely they will eat besides ivy, moss, and such-like. In spring they make their fumets round, and afterwards broad and flat, as the <hi>Hart</hi> when he comes to feed well.</p>
                        <p>They go to rut about <hi>Alhallontide,</hi> and continue therein a month or five weeks; that season being over, they descend from the mountains and rocks, their abode for the summer-season, and herd themselves, not onely to avoid the snow, but because they can find no food any longer; and yet they come not very low, but keep at the foot of the mountains, feeding there till <hi>Easter:</hi> then they return again, every one chusing some strong hold in the rocks, as the <hi>Harts</hi> in the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
                        <p>About fawning-time the females separate from the males, attending till rutting-time: in this interval they will run at man or beast, and fight as <hi>Harts</hi> doe one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the other.</p>
                        <p>When he goeth to rut, his throat and neck is much bigger than usual: he is very strong backt; and (which is wonderful) though he should fall from on high ten poles length, he will receive no harm; and will walk as securely on the sharp tops of rocks, as a horse in the high-way.</p>

                           <hi>Alhallontide</hi> is the chiefest season for hunting these wild <hi>Goats,</hi> observing very well before you hunt, the advantages of the coasts, the rocks and places where the <hi>Goats</hi> do lie.</p>
                        <p>Having thus done, set nets and toils toward the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and bottoms; for you cannot expect your hounds should follow a <hi>Goat</hi> down every place of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                        <p>Also it will be needful that some stand on the top of the rocks, and throw down stones as they see occasion. Where the <hi>Goat</hi> goeth down to the small brooks or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the bottom, there place your relays, and let the relays never tarry till the hounds come in which were cast off: and this is your best help; for a man can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow on foot nor horse-back.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Boar</hi> is ever pigg'd with as many teeth at first as he shall have ever after, which will onely increase in bigness, not number. Amongst the rest, they have four which are called <hi>tushes,</hi> or <hi>tusks,</hi> whereof the two biggest do not hurt when he strikes, but serve onely to whet the other two lowest, with which they frequently kill.</p>
                        <p>They feed upon all kind of corn and fruits which they can come at; also roots. In <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> they feed on the buds of plumb-trees, and ches-nut-trees, and all other sweet buds they can find, especially on the buds of broom and juniper, and are never measled, as our tame swine. Being near the sea-coast, they will feed on all manner of shell fish.</p>
                        <p>Their season beginneth in the midst of <hi>September,</hi>
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:100171:71"/>
and endeth about the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> at which time they go a <hi>brimming.</hi> A <hi>Boar</hi> will commonly abide the bay before he goes out of his den; and he lies most commonly in the strongest holds of thorns and thick bushes.</p>
                        <p>If it so chance that there is a <hi>sounder</hi> of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then if any break sounder, the rest will run that way: and if you hunt a <hi>Boar</hi> from a thick and strong covert, he will not fail to go back by the same way he came thither: and when he is rear'd he never stays, but flies continually till he comes to the place where he was farrow'd and brought up. This Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself when he was in <hi>France;</hi> attesting he saw a <hi>Boar</hi> hunted from a thicket, which returned the same way he came to the place of his farrowing, which was distant seven French leagues. And this was performed by the track of his feet.</p>
                        <p>If he be hunted in a forest or hold where he was bred, he will hardly be forced out of it. Sometimes he will take head, and seem to go out, and will draw to the outsides of the wood; but it is onely to hearken on every side: and if he hear the noise of the hounds, then will he return, and will not be compell'd to go that way till night. But having broken out of a forest and taken head end-ways, he will not be put out of his way either by man, dog, voice, blowing, or any thing.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Boar,</hi> especially a great one, will not cry when you kill him: The sows and young swine will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>

                           <p>Be advised not to hunt a young <hi>Boar</hi> of three years old at force; for he will stand up as long, if not longer than any light young <hi>Deer</hi> which beareth but three in the top: but in the fourth year you may hunt him at force, as you do a <hi>Hart</hi> at ten.</p>
                           <p>In the rearing of your <hi>Boar,</hi> you need not be afraid to come near him, for he values you not, and will lie still, and will not be rear'd by you alone.</p>
                           <p>Here note, that if a <hi>Boar</hi> intends to abide in his den, couch, or fort, then will he make some crossing or doubling at the entry thereof upon some high-way or beaten path; by such means a huntsman, being early in the woods, may judge of the subtilty of the <hi>Boar,</hi> and accordingly may make preparations for his game.</p>
                           <p>If he be a great <hi>Boar,</hi> and one that hath lain long to rest, let him hunt him with good store of hounds, and such as will stick close to him; and let him on horse-back be ever amongst them, charging the <hi>Boar,</hi> to discourage him: for if you hunt such a <hi>Boar</hi> with half a dozen couple of dogs, he will not value them; and they having chased him, he will take courage and keep them still at bays, running upon any thing he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100171:72"/>
seeth before him. But if he be charged home, and hard laid unto with the hounds, he will turn head and fly.</p>
                           <p>If you strike at him with your sword or Boar-spear, strike not low, for then you will hit him on the snout, which he little values; for he watcheth to take blows upon his tusks or thereabouts: but lifting up your hand, strike right down, and have a special care of your horse; for if you strike and hurt him, so will he you if he can.</p>
                           <p>It behoveth the hunters of <hi>Boars</hi> to be very wary; for he will run fiercely without fear upon his pursuers: in which encounter, if he receive not his deaths wound, he overthroweth his adversary, except he fall flat on the ground, and then he need not fear much harm; for his teeth cannot cut upward but downward: but it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise with a female; for she will bite and tear any way.</p>
                           <p>It is good to raise this beast early in the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath made water, for the burning of his bladder doth quickly make him weary.</p>
                           <p>When the <hi>Boar</hi> is first raised out of the wood, he snuffeth in the wind, lifting up his nose to smell what is with him, and what against him; and rarely strikes a man till he be first wounded himself.</p>
                           <p>The hunting-spear must be very sharp and broad, branching forth into certain forks, so that the <hi>Boar</hi> may not break through them upon the huntsman: The best places to wound him in therewith, are the middle of his forehead betwixt his eye-lids, or else upon the shoulder; either of these wounds is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
                           <p>If the <hi>Boar</hi> make head against the hunter, he must not fly for it, but must meet him with his spear, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one hand on the middle of it, and the other at the end, standing one foot before another, having
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100171:73"/>
an especial eye to the head of the beast which way soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he windeth or turneth the same: for such is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Boar,</hi> that-sometimes he snatcheth the spear out of their hands, or else recoileth the force back again upon the hunter, by both which means he is in great danger of life: whensoever this hapneth there is but one remedy, which is; another of his companions must come and charge the <hi>Boar</hi> with his spear, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to wound him with his dart, but not casting it for fear of hurting the hunter. The <hi>Boar</hi> seeing this, forsaketh the first man, and rusheth upon the second, who must look to defend himself with all dexterity, composing his body, and ordering his weapons accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to artificial Boar-hunting: in the mean time he that was overthrown must rise again, taking fresh hold on his spear, and with all courage assault his adversary, and assist his friend who was the cause of the saving of his life.</p>
                           <p>When he feeleth himself so wounded that he cannot live, were it not for the forks of the Boar-spear, he would press it on his vanquisher, and so revenge his death: For such is the fury of this beast, that he will endeavour to wound and kill, although he feel upon him the pangs of death; and what place soever he bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, whether man or dog, the heat of his teeth causeth the wound to be inflam'd: and for this cause, if he but touch the hair of a dog, he burneth it off: nay, hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have tried the heat of his teeth, by laying hairs on them as soon as he was dead, and they have shrivel'd up as with a hot-iron.</p>
                           <p>To conclude; the same devises, diligence, labour, prosecution, and observations are to be used in the hunting of the <hi>Boar,</hi> which are prescribed for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Hart.</hi> Not but that there are several poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and stratagems which have been invented, and are still used in several countries, whereby to take
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100171:73"/>
them without the pursuit of dogs; to the knowledge whereof I shall refer the reader to <hi>Blondus, Oppianus, Gesner, Turbervile,</hi> and many others both antient and modern writers, who have largely treated on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

                        <head>Of the Nature and Properties of a <hi>Bear,</hi> and after what manner Hunted.</head>
                        <p>THere are two sorts of <hi>Bears,</hi> a greater and lesser; the last is more apt to climb trees than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bears</hi> are bred in many countries; in the <hi>Helvetian Alpine</hi> region they are so strong and courageous, that they can tear in pieces both oxen and horses; for which cause the inhabitants are studiously laborious in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Bear</hi> is of a most venereous and lustful disposition; for night and day the females with most ardent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd desires do provoke the males to copulation; and for this cause at that time they are most fierce and angry. The time of their copulation is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of winter, and the manner of it is like to a man's; the male moving himself upon the belly of the female, which lieth flat on her back, and they embrace each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their fore-feet: they remain a very long time in that act; in so much (as some have observed, how true I cannot say) that if they were very fat at their first entrance, they dis-joyn not themselves again till they be lean.</p>
                        <p>There is a strange report in history, (if it be true) That in the mountains of <hi>Savoy</hi> a <hi>Bear</hi> carried a young maid into his den by violence, where in a venereal
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100171:74"/>
manner he had the carnal use of her body; and while he kept her in his den, he daily went forth and brought her the best fruits he could get, presenting them to her as food, as courtly as he could do it; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when he went to forrage, he rowled a very great stone to the mouth of his den, that the virgin should not make her escape from him: at length her parents, with long search, found their daughter in the <hi>Bear's</hi> den, who delivered her from that beastial captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p>They are naturally very cruel and mischievous unto all tame beasts, and are very strong in all parts of their body but their head, whereon a small blow will kill them.</p>
                        <p>They go to mate in the beginning of the winter, some sooner, some later, according to their rest and feeding; and their heat lasteth not passing fifteen days.</p>
                        <p>When the she-<hi>Bear</hi> perceiveth her self with whelp, she withdraws her self into some cave, or hollow rock, and there remains till she brings forth her whelps, where without meat they grow very fat, especially the males, onely by sucking their fore-feet. When they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their den, they convey themselves backward, that so they may put out their foot-steps from the sight of the hunters.</p>
                        <p>The nature of all of them is to avoid cold, and therefore in the winter-time they hide themselves, chusing rather to suffer famine than cold; lying for the most part three or four months together and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see the light, whereby in a manner their guts are clung together: coming forth, they are so dazled by long darkness, being in the light again, that they stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and reel to and fro; and then by a secret instinct they remedy the straightness of their guts by eating an herb called <hi>Arum,</hi> in English <hi>Wake-robbin</hi> or <hi>Calves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi>
                           <pb n="135" facs="tcp:100171:74"/>
by the acidity whereof their guts are enlarged; and being recovered, they remain more fierce and cruel than at other times, during the time their young are with them: and this is the herb, some say, which they eat to make them sleep so long in winter without sense of cold or hunger.</p>
                        <p>They are whelped most commonly in <hi>March,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two, and not above five in number; the most part of them are dead one whole day after they are whelped; but the <hi>Bear</hi> doth so lick them and warm them with her breath, and hug them in her bosom, that she quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives them again.</p>
                        <p>It is commonly received as a truth, (though it be a palpable vulgar errour) <hi>That the whelps of</hi> Bears <hi>at their first littering are without all form and fashion, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little congealed blood like a lump of flesh, which afterwards the old one frameth with her tongue by licking them to her own likeness.</hi> This opinion may be easily disproved; for they are onely littered blind without hair, and the hinder-legs not perfect, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet folded up like a fist, and other members deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by reason of the immoderate humour or moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them; which also is one cause why she cannot retain in her womb the seed to the perfection of the young ones, whereof <hi>Joachimus Rheticus</hi> is an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the dam perceiveth her cubs to grow strong, she suckleth them no longer, by reason of their curstness; for they will sorely bite her if they cannot get suck enough. After this she preyeth abroad upon any thing she can meet with, which she eates, and casts up again to her young ones, and so feeds them till they can prey for themselves: They will climb a tree for the fruit.</p>
                        <p>If they be hunted, they will follow a man, but not run upon him unless they are wounded. They are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100171:75"/>
very strong in their paws, in such sort, that they will so hug a man or dog till they have broke his back, or squeez'd his guts out of his belly: with a single paw they will pull a lusty dog to their tearing and devouring mouth. They bite very severely; for they will bite a man's head to the very brains; and for an arm or leg, they will crash it as a dog may do a slender bone of mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
                        <p>When they are hunted, they are so heavy that they make no speed, and so are always in sight of the dogs. They stand not at bay as a <hi>Boar,</hi> but fly wallowing; but if the hounds stick in, they will fight valiantly in their own defence; sometimes they stand up straight on their hinder-feet, and then take that as a sign of fear and cowardize; they fight stoutest and strongest on all four.</p>
                        <p>They have an excellent scent, and smell further off than any other beast except the <hi>Boar;</hi> for in a whole forest they will smell out a tree laden with mast.</p>
                        <p>They may be hunted with hounds, mastiffs, or grey-hounds; and they are chased and kill'd with bows, Boar-spears, darts, and swords; so are they also taken in snares, caves, and pits, with other engines.</p>
                        <p>They do naturally abide in great mountains; but when it snoweth, or in hard weather, then they descend into valleys and forests for provision. They cast their lesses sometimes in round croteys, and sometimes flat like a bullock, according to their feeding.</p>
                        <p>They go sometimes a gallop, and at other times an amble; but they go most at case when they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                        <p>When they come from their feeding they beat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the high-ways and beaten paths: and whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they go out of the high-ways, there you may be sure they are gone to their dens; for they use no doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings nor subtilties.</p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:100171:75"/>
                        <p>They tumble and wallow in water and mire as swine, and they feed like a dog. Some say their flesh is very good food, let who will eat it for me, who are not so nicely palated as my self.</p>
                        <p>The best finding of a <hi>Bear</hi> is with a leam-hound; and yet he who is without one may trail after a <hi>Bear</hi> as we do after a <hi>Buck</hi> or <hi>Roe,</hi> and you may lodge and hunt them as you do a <hi>Buck.</hi> For the more speedy executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, mingle mastiffs among your hounds; for they will pinch the <hi>Bear,</hi> and so provoke her to anger, until at last they bring her to the bay; or else drive her out of the plain into the covert, not letting her be at rest till she fight in her own defence.</p>

                        <head>Of the <hi>Beaver.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>A <hi>Beaver</hi> differeth but a little from an <hi>Otter</hi> but in his tail: his colour is somewhat yellow and white aspersed with ash-colour, which stand out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the shorter hairs, double their length; and are neat and soft like an <hi>Otters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is plenty of them in the river <hi>Pontus,</hi> whence the <hi>Beaver</hi> by some is called <hi>Canis Ponticus:</hi> They are also bred in <hi>Spain,</hi> some few in <hi>France, Germany, Polonia, Sclavonia, Russia, Prussia, Lithuania;</hi> and abundance of them in <hi>New-England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These beasts are amphibious, living both on land and water both fresh and salt, keeping the last in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and the first in the night: Without water they cannot live; for they participate much of the nature of fish, which may be gathered from their tails and hinder-legs.</p>
                        <p>They are about the bigness of a country cur;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100171:76"/>
their head short; their ears small and round; their teeth very long, the under-teeth standing out beyond their lips three fingers breadth, and the upper about half a finger, being very broad, crooked, strong, and sharp, standing very deep in their mouth, wherewith they defend themselves against beasts, take fishes as it were upon hooks, and will gnaw in sunder trees as big as a man's thigh.</p>
                        <p>Their fore-feet are like dogs, and their hinder like geese, made as it were on purpose to go on the land, and swim in the water; but the tail of this beast is most strange of all, being without hair, and covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a skin like the scales of a fish, it being like a Soal, and for the most part six fingers broad, and half a foot long. They are accounted a very delicate dish, and eat like Barbels: the manner of their dressing is by roasting them first, and boiling or stewing them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; they must be food that is very sweet, since this proverb proceeded from them: <hi>Sweet is that fish which is no fish at all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the wonderful manner of their building, I shall let that alone, since it is at large described by <hi>Gesner</hi> in his <hi>History of Beasts,</hi> page 36.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing so valuable in this beast as his stones; for they are in great esteem, and a precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</p>
                        <p>It hath been the opinion of some, that when a <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> is hunted, and is in danger to be taken, he biteth off his own stones, knowing that for them onely is he thus pursued: but this is found to be a meer fiction; for their stones being small, and placed like a <hi>Boar's,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them to come at them.</p>
                        <p>They are taken for their skins, tails, and cods, and that many ways. First, when their caves are found: (in which are several chambers built one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the water-side, to ascend or descend according
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100171:76"/>
as the water riseth or falleth) I say, their abode being found, they make a breach therein, wherein is put a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dog, which the <hi>Beaver</hi> perceiving, flies instantly to the end of her cave, and there defendeth her self with her teeth, till all her building be raised, and she laid open to her enemies, who kill her with instruments for that purpose. These dogs for the <hi>Beaver</hi> are the same which hunt <hi>Otters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They cannot dive long time under water, but must put up their heads for breath; which being seen by those who are hunting them, they kill them with gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot or Otter-spears: His nature is, if he hear any noise, to put up his head above water, whereby he is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and so loseth life. Those skins are best which are blackest.</p>

                        <p>THis beast is twice as big as a <hi>Hart,</hi> whose upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip is so great, and hangeth over the nether so far, that he cannot eat going forward; but as he eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he goeth backward, and so gathereth up his suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                        <p>His mane is divers both on the top of his neck, and underneath his throat, which buncheth like a beard, or curled lock of hair; his neck is very short, dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his body.</p>
                        <p>He hath two very large horns bending towards the back in a plain edge, and the spires stand forward to the face: both males and females have them; they are solid at the root and round, but afterwards bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; they are broader than a <hi>Hart's,</hi> and are very heavy, being not above two foot long; and these
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100171:77"/>
horns they mew every year: He is colour'd for the most part like a <hi>Heart,</hi> and hath cloven feet, but without joynts (like an Elephant) in his fore-legs, and therefore sleepeth leaning to posts or trees; and fighteth not with his horns, but fore-feet.</p>
                        <p>It is a most timorous creature, not desiring to stir much, unless provok'd thereunto by hunting. There is no danger in hunting this beast, except a man come right before him: for if this beast fasten his fore-feet on him, he cannot escape alive; but if it receive any small wound, it instantly dies.</p>
                        <p>They are taken by nets and toils, or as Elephants are taken: for when they have found the trees where-unto they lean, they so cut and saw them, that when the <hi>Elk</hi> cometh, he overthroweth the tree and falleth with it; and being not able to rise, is so taken alive. When they are chased eagerly, and can find no place to rest themselves in and lie secret, they run to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and therein stand, taking up waters into their mouths; and in a little time do so heat it, that squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it out upon the dogs, the heat thereof so scaldeth them, that they dare not come nigh or approach them any more.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THe ancients have derived <hi>Rabies,</hi> Madness, from <hi>Ravies,</hi> hoarseness of voice, for mad dogs have no perfect voice: but it is more probable, that <hi>Rabies</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>à Rapiendo;</hi> because when a dog beginneth to go mad; he biteth, runneth, snatcheth, and roves to and fro, to his own perdition. A mad dog is most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the Dog-days; for at that time the very foam or spittle falling on a man breeds danger.</p>
                        <p>There are properly seven sorts of Madnesses which afflict a dog, whereof two of them are incurable, and therefore I shall speak little of them; onely so much as may give you warning to shift them from your other dogs, because their disease is infectious; and that you may beware of them your self, lest they injure you; for their biting is dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The first of these incurable Madnesses is called the <hi>Hot burning Madness,</hi> and is known by these symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. First, when they run, they raise their tails bolt-upright, and run upon any thing that stands before them, having no respect where nor which way they run: also their mouths will be very black, having no foam in nor about them. They will not continue thus above three or four days, after which time they die, their pain being so intolerable. Where note, that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100171:78"/>
all those dogs they have bitten and drew blood from, will be mad in like manner.</p>
                        <p>The second is called the <hi>running Madness,</hi> and is less dangerous, however incurable. The dogs that are troubled with this madness run not on men, but dogs, and on no other beasts. The symptoms are, they will smell on other dogs, and having smelt them, will shake and bite them, yet shaking their tails, and seeming to offer no harm: with other tokens I omit for brevity sake.</p>

                        <p>The five Madnesses (or rather Sicknesses) which are curable, are these:</p>
                        <p>The first is called the <hi>Dumb</hi> madness, and is thus known: the dog that is troubled therewith will not feed, but holds his mouth wide open continually, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his feet to his mouth frequently, as if he had a bone in his throat.</p>
                        <p>The cure is thus: Take four ounces of the juice of <hi>Spathula putrida,</hi> and put it into a pot; then take the like quantity of the juice of black Hellebore, and as much of the juice of Rue: having strained them all well through a fine cloath, put them into a glass: then take two drams of Scammony unprepared, and having min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled it with the former juices, put it into a horn or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and convey it down his throat, keeping his head up straight, lest he cast it up again: then bleed him in the mouth, cutting three or four veins in his gums that he may bleed the better; and in a short time you will find amendment. Or you may onely take eight drams of the juice of an herb called Harts-horn, or Dogs-tooth, and you will find it a most excellent receipt against any madness whatsoever.</p>

                        <p>The second is called the <hi>Falling</hi> Madness: the disease lieth in their heads, which maketh them reel as they go, and fall.</p>
                        <p>The cure is thus: Take four ounces of the juice of Piony, with the like quantity of the juice of Briony, the like of the juice of <hi>Cruciata,</hi> and four drams of Staves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acre pulverized: mingle these together, and give it your hound or dog as aforesaid: then let him blood in the cars or the two veins which come down the shoulders; and if he is not cured at first, give it him a second or third time.</p>

                        <p>The third kind of madness is called the <hi>Lank</hi> Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by reason of the leanness of their bodies occasioned by <hi>skummering.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The cure is thus: First, purge your dog with this portion: Take an ounce and a half of <hi>Cassia fistularis</hi> well cleansed, two drams and a half of Stavesacre pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verized, and the like quantity of Scammony prepared in White-wine-vinegar, and four ounces of Oyl-olive; temper these and warm them over the Fire, and give it your dog. In the morning put him into this bath fasting as followeth: Put into six pails full of water ten handfuls of Mugwort, of Rosemary, of red-Sage, of the roots or leaves of Marsh-mallows, of the roots or leaves of Wall-wort, of the roots or stalks of Fennel, of the leaves or stalks of Elecampane, Baulm and Rue, Sorrel, Bugloss and Mellilot; let these boil together in two thirds of water and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wine, until one third be consumed: the bath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hotter than your dog can endure it, bathe him
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100171:79"/>
therein for the space of an hour; then taking him out, put him in some warm place for sear of catching cold. Do this four or five times in the same bath, and it will cure.</p>

                        <p>The fourth Madness is called the <hi>Sleeping</hi> Madness, and is caused by some little Worms breeding in the mouth of the Stomack from corrupt Humours, the vapours and sumes whereof ascending into the head, make the dog sleep continually, and frequently he dieth sleeping.</p>
                        <p>For the cure, you must take five ounces of the juice of Wormwood, with two ounces of the powder of Harts-horn burned, and two drams of Agarick: mingle these together; and if they be too thick, thin them with White-wine, and give it your dog to drink.</p>

                        <p>This Madness is called so, because, when a dog hath got it, his head swelleth, his eyes are as yellow as a Kite's-foot, and he commonly slavereth at the mouth.</p>
                        <p>The Cure is thus: Take six ounces of the juice of Fennel-roots, and the like quantity of the juice of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seltoe, four ounces of the juice of lvy, four ounces of the powder of the roots of Polypodie; boil these in White-wine, and give it your dog to drink as hot as he can suffer it.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that when a dog hath any of these kinds of Madnesses he will have no desire to eat, fasting fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently eight or nine days, and so starving to death. Nay, if they are troubled with any distemper they will refuse their meat, nay, the daintiest bit you can give them, until they have eaten grass, and have cleared
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100171:79"/>

                        <head>Concerning the Madness of <hi>Dogs,</hi> and their Venomous Bitings.</head>
                        <p>I think no reasonable man ought to question why the teeth of a mad dog should do more harm than those of a sound one; because in rage and anger the teeth of every beast and creature receive venome and poison from the head, whereby when they bite at that time they do much more harm.</p>
                        <p>Against the simple biting of a dog, take the urine of a dog, which is sufficient, since there is but little ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome in those wounds. To lay the hair of the same dog thereon, (though so much talkt on) I look upon as a meer foppery. Or being bit by a dog, take vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and with your hand rub the wound very well; then pour into it vinegar mixed with water or Nitre; then wet a spunge in the same liquids, and so let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main bound up three days; then take Pellitory of the wall, mingled and beaten with Salt, or any other plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for green wounds.</p>
                        <p>Divers are the cures and remedies for biting of mad dogs; which I omit in this place, as belonging not to my subject, but to Physick.</p>

                        <p>This distemper befalls a dog frequently for want of fresh water to drink when he desires it, and sometimes by foul kennelling, and sometimes by foundering and melting his greace.</p>
                        <p>You may cure it in this manner: Take two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of wild Cresses, two handfuls of Elecampane, and as much of the leaves and roots of Roerb and

                     <head>A brief Discourse of the Cure of Maladies belonging to <hi>Spaniels,</hi> with other accidents happening.</head>
                     <p>HOw necessary a thing a <hi>Spaniel</hi> is to Faulconry, and for those that delight in that noble recreation, keeping Hawks for their pastime and pleasure, I think no body need question, as well to spring and retrive a fowl being flown to the mark, as also divers other ways to help and assist Faulcons and Goshawks.</p>
                     <p>Now since they are subject to many diseases and casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, I shall endeavour to propound a suitable cure for them; and first, I shall begin with the Mange, as the capital enemy to the quiet and beauty of a brave <hi>Spaniel,</hi> wherewith poor creatures they are often grievously tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and as frequently infect others.</p>
                     <p>For the cure of this distemper, take a pound of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-flick, common Oil three ounces, Brimstone well pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verized foar ounces, Salt well beaten to powder, Ashes well sifted and searced, of each two ounces; boil all these in a kettle or earthen-pot, and when they are all well incorporated together, anoint your <hi>Spaniel</hi> with this thrice every other day, either against the Sun or Fire: having so done, wash him all over with good strong Lye, and this will kill the Mange. Remember you shift his kennel and litter often.</p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:100171:80"/>
                     <p>If the <hi>Spaniel</hi> lose its Hair, as it often happens, then bathe your <hi>Spaniel</hi> in the water of Lupines or Hops, and anoint him with stale Barrows-flick.</p>
                     <p>This ointment, besides the cure, maketh his skin look slick and beautiful, and kills the fleas, the dogs disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and enemies to his ease.</p>
                     <p>If this be not strong enough to destroy this malady, then take two quarts of strong vinegar, common oil six ounces, brimstone three ounces, soot six ounces, brayd salt and searced two handfuls: boil all these together in the vineger, and anoint your dog as aforesaid. This receipt must not be administred in cold weather, for it may hazard his life in so doing.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Spaniel</hi> be not much troubled with the Mange, then it is easie to cure him thus:</p>
                     <p>Make bread with wheaten-bran, with the roots, leaves, and fruit of Agrimony, beating them well in a mortar, and, making it into a paste or dough, bake it in an oven, and so made, give thereof to your <hi>Spaniel,</hi> giving him no other bread for some time, letting him eat as long as he will.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>In the summer-time there is a scurvy malady which very much afflicts a <hi>Spaniel's</hi> ears, and is accasioned by flies and their own scratching with their feet: We term it a <hi>Mange,</hi> the <hi>Italians, Formica,</hi> and the <hi>French, Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the cure, take Gum-dragaganth four ounces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused in the strongest Vinegar may be gotten, for the space of eight days, and afterwards bruised on a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-stone, as painters do their colours, adding unto it Roch-allum and Galls beaten to powder, of either two ounces; mingle all these well together, and lay it on the place afflicted.</p>

                        <p>By reason of a humour distilling from the brain, the throat of a <hi>Spaniel</hi> will often swell unreasonably.

                        </head>
                        <p>These worms do hinder the cure of the mange or wounds, causing them to continue at one stay, or to grow worse and worse. To remove this hindrance, take the gum of Ivy and convey it into the wound, and let it there remain a day or two, washing the wound with Wine; and after that anoint it with Bacon-grease, oil of Earth-worms, and Rue.</p>
                        <p>The powder of wild Cucumbers is excellent good to kill these worms, and will prove a good corrosive, also eating away the dead flesh, and increasing the good.</p>
                        <p>If the worms be within the body, you must destroy them in this manner: Cause your <hi>Spaniel,</hi> by fair means or foul, when fasting, to eat the yolk of an egg with two scruples of Saffron pulverized and confected with the same egg, keeping him after it fasting till night.</p>
                        <p>When a <hi>Spaniel</hi> is hurt, as long as he can come to lick the wound with his tongue he needs no other remedy; his tongue is his best Chirurgeon: but when he cannot do that, then such wounds as are not venomous you may cure with the powder of <hi>Matresilva</hi> dried in an oven, or in the Sun. If it be a bite of a <hi>Fox,</hi> anoint it with oil wherein Earth-worms and Rue have been boiled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If by a mad dog, let him lap twice or thrice of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100171:81"/>
broth of Germander, and eat the Germander too boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>Others bore the skin of his neck through with a hot-Iron just betwixt his ears, so as the fire may touch both sides of the hole made: after that, plucking up the skin of the dog's shoulders and flanks backwards, thrust it through with a hot-Iron in like manner: by giving the venom this vent, it is a ready way to cure him.</p>

                     <head>OF HAWKING.</head>
                     <head>The Introduction.</head>
                     <p>THe Element wherein the <hi>Faulconer</hi> useth to trade, is the <hi>Air;</hi> and though he dealeth sometimes in the <hi>Water,</hi> yet he prefers the Air before it, that yielding him most Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; for it is unable to stop the high soaring of his generous Faulcon: in it she flies to such a height, that, being lost to the sight of Mortals, she seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with Heaven alone; and, like <hi>Icarus,</hi> endangers her Wings to be scorcht by the Sun-beams; and yet is fearless, cutting the fluid Air with her nimble Pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, making her High-way over the steepest Mountains and deepest Rivers, and in her lofty career looks down with a seeming contempt on the greatest Glories we most estimate: and yet such is her Loyalty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her Master, that a word from his mouth shall make her stoop and condescend.</p>
                     <p>This Element of Air is not onely to be praised for the Recreation it affords the Faulconers, but for its Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to all, no creature being in a condition to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: for if the inspiring or expiring Organ of any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100171:88"/>
creature be stopt, it must speedily die, and pay the Debt that's due to Nature.</p>
                     <p>And as this Element justly merits praise, so do its wing'd Inhabitants, both feeding and refreshing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: with their Bodies they perform the first, and the latter with their harmonious Voices.</p>
                     <p>The number of Heaven's airy Quire is so great, I cannot here well enumerate them; yet I must not pass by these nimble Musicians of the Air, which warble forth such curious Notes as puzzle Art to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
                     <p>I mean to speak of few, and first of the <hi>Lark:</hi> When she means to recreate her self and hearers, she quits the Earth, and sings as she ascends; and having made an end of her heavenly Ditty, she seems to swound to think she must descend again unto the dull Earth, which she would scorn to tread but for necessity.</p>
                     <p>Again, observe how the <hi>Black-bird</hi> and the <hi>Thrush</hi> contend who shall with their unimitable Voices bid the best welcome to the fragrant Spring.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth the <hi>Nightingale</hi> come short in breathing out her loud Musick through the small Organ of her Throat. How have I oft admired in a still night the clearness of her Airs, the sweetness of her Descants, her natural Risings and Fallings, her Doublings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doublings!</p>
                     <p>Much more might be said of these, which I shall wave, being a digression from my purpose, which is to treat of another Bird of Pleasure, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Hawk</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>HEre note, that the <hi>Hawk</hi> is distinguished into two kindes; the <hi>Long-winged,</hi> and <hi>Short-winged Hawk.</hi>

                     <head>The Names and Natures of <hi>Hawks</hi> in general: and first of the <hi>Haggard-Faulcon.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Begin with the <hi>Haggard-Faulcon,</hi> since it is a Hawk which most men now-a-days covet, to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for their delight and pleasure; although hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hear less spoken of her praise by the Antients than she deserves.</p>
                     <p>Some of old have preferred the <hi>Faulcon-gentle</hi> for mettle and courage, being of a loving disposition, strong and daring, and hardy in all seasons; and by a mere mistake have undervalued the <hi>Haggard-faulcon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning her as being a Bird too tender to endure rough and boisterous weather.</p>
                     <p>Experience confutes this Opinion, she being known to be able to endure as much the extremity of weather, or more than the <hi>Tiercel, Faulcon-gentle,</hi> or most other Hawks whatsoever; and therefore she shall first take place in this manner.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Haggard-faulcon,</hi> wild, and unreclaimed, takes a large liberty to her self for her abode, either by Sea or Land; and is so absolute in her power, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she comes, all flying Fowl stoop under her subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nay, the <hi>Tiercel-gentle,</hi> although her natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, dares not sit by her or come near her residence but in cawking-time, and that is in the Spring; and then for procreation sake, she will admit him to come near her with submission, which he manifests by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head at his approach, and by calling and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with his Wings, as the young ones do, in testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny how fearful he is of incurring her displeasure.</p>
                     <p>Whilst she is very young (and so will a <hi>Passenger-Soar-faulcon)</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100171:93"/>
she will prey upon Birds which are too big to encounter withal; and this she doth for want of understanding: and she continues this rashness and folly, till experience and a sound beating have reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Haggard faulcon</hi> will prey on any other Fowl she can meet with advantageously, especially tame Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, or such as belong to a Dove-house; for these they frequently meet withal.</p>
                     <p>This Hawk is an incessant Pains-taker; no weather discourageth her from her Game, but that onely where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no Fowl can well stir abroad to seek for sustenance; otherwise she is continually working, either in the Air or elsewhere, unless she stoop and miss of her Prey, and then she will rest a little, to take breath and renew her courage. Nay, if she hath laboured in boisterous and tempestuous weather three or four days together, she will be so far from being the worse for it, that she will appear much better, and more lively. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it is a vulgar errour, for men not to fly their Hawks but after three or four days rest, some a week or fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. For old Staunch-hawks, I judge a little rest will do no harm; but for the young, till she is blouded give her but little; and if you can fly her every day, you will find it so much the better.</p>
                     <p>When the Faulcon unreclaimed hath seized her Prey and broke her Neck, (in artificial terms, her <hi>Ink</hi>) she then falls on the Crop, and feeds first on what is there contained, afterwards on other parts; and having filled her Gorge, she will fly to some solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place which is near water, or what liketh her best, and there she will sit all day: upon the approach of night she takes Wing, and flies to some convenient place she hath afore purposed, to pearch therein till the morning.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of her as she is wild and un-reclaimed.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100171:93"/>
In the next place it will be requisite to inform you with the manner of reclaiming of a <hi>Haggard-faulcon,</hi> and her entry to the Lure.</p>
                     <p>Having taken or purchased one of them, set her down, and let her rest quietly the first night in a Ruster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                     <p>The next day take her up easily on your Fist, and carry her up and down that whole day; using a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to stroke her withal instead of your hand. When you find her not impatient of being toucht, take her Hood off speedily, and put it on again as speedily, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving thus to do till she is willing to feed: then fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently offer her food, but let her have but a little at a time; never pulling her Hood off or on but you must gain her love with a bit or two, using your voice unto her when you are taking off her Hood, and all the while she is feeding, and no longer; that by that means, after she is reclaimed, she may know by your voice she shall be fed.</p>
                     <p>Having thus done, teach her to come to your Fist from the Pearch by doing thus: Let her stand on a Pearch about breast-high; if lower, kneel, for this low posture will less affright than any other: after this, unstrike her Hood, and lure her, using your voice; and have a special care that you affright her not or distaste her, and so cause her to bate from you. But you must, before you unstrike her Hood, encourage her with a bit or two, which will make her the more eager to come to you: For it is her Stomach that rules her, and is the Bridle that keeps her in subjection, pricking her forward to perform her duty: wherefore if you keep not her Appetite sharp and truly edged, instead of Submission, you will find Disobedience. When you find she will willingly feed from and come to your hand, you may then let her sit bare-fac'd, now and then diverting her starting about by giving her a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100171:94"/>
bit or two, to direct her face towards you: after this you may set her to the Lure.</p>
                     <p>When you find she will come readily to the Lure, garnisht with meat in the <hi>Creance,</hi> fearing lest she scorn this way of Luring, fix a live Pidgeon to the Lure, and lure her therewith. When she hath killed the Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon and eaten the Head, take her up gently with a bit of meat, and put on her Hood; then unstrike her Hood and lure her to the Pelt, doing thus twice or thrice, and no more: if you do it oftner, she will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in time very loth to part with the Pelt, and by this means you will provoke her to carry. This is a great fault, and more incident to and worse in Field-Hawks than such as are fitted for the River.</p>
                     <p>But be sure you lure her not far till her Stomach be perfect; for otherwise she may discover something by the way which she hath a greater esteem for, and so be lost for that time; which will be very detrimental to her, although you should happen to recover and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim her afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Here observe, in the time of her making (while she is on the ground either pluming or feeding) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not to walk round her, using your voice, and giving her many bits with your hand; continuing so to do till you have won her to a more than ordinary familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>But above all, mark this; spring her some living Doves between the Man and the Lure, and let them be given in a long Creance, that she may kill them near you, in such manner that she may truss them over your head: by this means she will not be afraid when you come to her from afar off; the neglect whereof will make her timorous: thence will proceed her dragging and carrying from you; nay sometimes she will leave her Prey, and totally forsake you.</p>
                     <p>There are some Hawks will not be taken up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100171:94"/>
striking or rapping in the Creance, which must be infallibly the loss of such a Hawk without such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: this is a great fault in the Hawk, and argueth great negligence in the Faulconer, in suffering, and not remedying that ill property in her first making.</p>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>Rules for ordering a <hi>Haggard-faulcon</hi> in the Luring: with the Causes and Remedies of Carrying, and other ill qualities.</head>
                        <p>Having thus far acquainted your Hawk with the Lure, take her out some convenient Evening, and be no farther from her than she can see and hear you; then hold in your Lure, and suffer her to fly about you, holding her as near you as you can with your Voice and Lure, teaching her to do her business, and work it on your head; and then cast up a live Dove: Which some disapprove of, because (say they) the lightness of the Dove inclines the Hawk to that ill quality of Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but I rather impute that fault to the ignorance, or negligence and harshness of the Faulconer, who hath been either unskilful, remiss, or hath not used that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness which is requisite in Reclaiming a Hawk in her first Making: so that instead of gaining her love by fair Allurements, he hath converted it into Hatred, Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, and Disdainful Coyness.</p>
                        <p>Another cause of this Dragging or Garrying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Keepers ill or slender Rewarding his Hawk in the Luring, in giving her the Pelt of a Pidgeon or some other dead thing, which gives her no delight. It is the pleasure she takes in the Reward that engages her coming to you: If then she chance to find her expectation frustrated in her usual satisfaction, she will ever after shun you; and though you should throw her a live Pidgeon, she may seize it, and keep close
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100171:95"/>
to it, or remove it as you approach, for fear that your unkindness should deprive her of it. Wherefore you must have a special care you disoblige her not in her Luring.</p>
                        <p>There are several other errours which must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in a <hi>Haggard-faulcon, Faulcon-gentle,</hi> or <hi>Slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulcons,</hi> (which naturally are all of one kind, yet differ much in quality and condition) which I shall leave to the study of the ingenious and industrious Faulconer or Keeper. I say, the first fault is, that though you have lured your Hawk well, and given her all the content and satisfaction imaginable, yet will she not tarry with you, but take her slight and forsake you. This argueth an aversion in her from you to something else. This fault Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> and Mr. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> say they have known remedied: but because I look upon the trouble therein to be so great, and the future satisfaction so small and uncertain, I shall not lay down what means are commonly made use of in the cure of this ill quality.</p>
                        <p>But there is another fault, which at first may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily prevented; and that is, an aspiring quality and working humour, when although the Hawk never shewed any dislike to the Keeper or discontent, yet by observation she hath been found conceited, and would not endure the society of another Hawk; and having been well blouded on Fowl, she would not be kept down near her Keeper. To remedy this, let no scope be given to the <hi>Haggard</hi> in the time of making; let her not fly high, but be held down and near you: and if you should let this Hawk in to another Hawk, and find her fall to her work without any regard or notice taken of the other Hawk, suspect her instantly, and let her see Fowl in due time, lest when she comes to her due place, she go her way; for she will prove impatient: wherefore the shorter work you make
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100171:95"/>
with her, the greater delight you give her, and so consequently you engage her love continually towards you.</p>
                        <p>Having taught your Hawk to sit bare-faced in the Evening among company undisturbed, and that she knows your Voice, and will come to the Lure, then give her every night stones, till you find her Stomach good: after that, profer her <hi>Casting,</hi> and let her not receive it unless she likes it well; otherwise she is apt to take a dislike, and will never afterwards receive it willingly.</p>
                        <p>These Stones aforesaid prepare and make ready the way for casting, stirring, and dissolving whatever is offensive within, and fitting it to be carried, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in her Mutes, or upward in her Castings. The time for giving these Stones is, when she hath put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her Supper from above; then give her half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen above the hand, if you have so much skill; if not, otherwise as you are able. Do thus often, until such time as you shall give her such things whereof she shall take Plumage in her living or training. But of this, more hereafter.</p>

                        <head>How to know the Nature and Disposition of several <hi>HAWKS,</hi> and what must be observed from thence.</head>
                        <p>THere is a certain Hawk called a <hi>Blank Hawk,</hi> which is a kinde, loving, and docible Hawk; for she will diligently listen and give ear unto you and your voice; she will soon learn to come to hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very eager and hot to seize on what you shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100171:96"/>
throw or give her, and will be very familiar: I astly, having done your will on the ground, she will look up for your Fist, and will readily jump there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>They are much subject to little Grubs, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered in the Guts, and discover themselves in their Mutes, crawling out from them, shrinking themselves up, and so instantly dying. These Worms do little harm, and that Hawk which hath them is seldom bad. The colour of these Worms is red in a <hi>Slight Faulcon,</hi> and red in a <hi>Barbary-Faulcon;</hi> and when dead, in both white.</p>
                        <p>There is a sort of <hi>Swarthy black-plum'd Hawk,</hi> that is good-mettled, and a high flier, yet hard to be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: for she will neither mind you nor your voice; but when you lure her, will look any other way than that she should. However, you must shew your self very loving towards her, though you shall get no more from her than what you extort by force. For her due reclaiming, lessen her pride by ordering her Diet with measure, with respect had unto the Weather; which if it be mild and temperate, you need not fear to hold her down until you have quarried her: and as you shall see her amend her manners, alter her Diet, and add to her strength according to reasonable expedition; which will be soon obtained if the be sound, and the weather moderate.

                        <p>When at any time you fly any one of these black or tawny Hawks, and she stoops foul and falls in her flight, you must take her down with some living thing.</p>
                        <p>If the be young, suffer not her (or any other Hawk) to fly too long; for nothing is more prejudicial and distasteful to a young Hawk at her first making, than to let her toil and make many stoopings before the be

                        <p>The <hi>Faulcon-gentle</hi> is so called for her familiar cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous disposition; she is withal valiant, strong, and better able to endure any sort of weather than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hawk.</p>
                        <p>She hath a natural inclination and love to fly the Hern every way, either from her Wings to the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or from the Fist and afore-head. She is most excellent at the Brook or River, especially at large Fowl, as the Shoveler, Wild-goose, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If she be an <hi>Eyess,</hi> you may venture her at the Crane; otherwise she will not be so hardy and bold. Where note, Hawks prove valiant or cowards according as they are first quarried: and if you take them out of the Eyrie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are fully summed and hard penned, you must never expect their Wings should grow to perfection, but their Legs will be apt to wear crooked, and their Train, their long Feathers and their Flags also will be full of Taints.</p>
                        <p>In the choice of your Faulcon, observe that she have wide Nares; high and large Eye-lids; a great black Eye; a round Head, somewhat full on the top; a short, thick, azure Beak; and indifferent high Neck; barb Feathers under the clap of the Beak; a good
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100171:97"/>
large, round, fleshy Breast: let her be strong, hard, and stiff bonded, broad-shouldered; having slender Sails, full Sides, long and great Thighs; strong and short Arms; large Feet, with the Sear of the Foot soft and blewish; black Pounces, long Wings, and crossing the Train, which Train must be short and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pliable.</p>
                        <p>Here observe, that Faulcons of one kind differ much, and are diversly named, according to the time of their first Reclaiming, places of Haunt, and Countries from whence they come; as <hi>Mew'd-Hawks, Rammage-Hawks, Soar-Hawks, Eyesses:</hi> and these again are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into large Hawks, mean Hawks, and slender Hawks. All these have different Males and Plumes, according to the nature of the Countries from whence they come; as some are black, some blank, or russet: and they differ in disposition; some are best for the Field, others for the River.</p>
                        <p>Names are bestowed on a Faulcon according to her Age or Taking.</p>
                        <p>The first is an <hi>Eyess,</hi> which Name lasts as long as she is in the Eyrie. These are very troublesome in their feeding, do cry very much, and are difficultly entred; but being well entred and quarried, prove excellent Hawks for the <hi>Hern,</hi> River, or any sort of Fowl, and are hardy and full of mettle.</p>
                        <p>The second is a <hi>Rammage-faulcon,</hi> and reserves the name after she hath left the Eyrie, being so called <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and <hi>August.</hi> These are hard to be manned, but being well reclaimed, they are not inferiour to any Hawk.</p>
                        <p>The third is a <hi>Soar-hawk,</hi> so called <hi>September, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>November.</hi> The first Plumes they have when they for sake the Eyrie, they keep a whole year before they mew them, which are called <hi>Soar-feathers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fourth is termed <hi>Murzarolt,</hi> (the latest term
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100171:98"/>
is <hi>Carvist,</hi> as much as to say, <hi>Carry an the Fist:)</hi> they are so called <hi>January, February, March, April,</hi> and till the middle of <hi>May,</hi> during which time they must be kept on the Fist. They are for the most part very great Baters, and therefore little eaters: They are bad Hawks, frequently troubled with <hi>Filanders</hi> and worms, and are rarely brought to be good for any thing.</p>
                        <p>The fifth are called <hi>Enter-mews,</hi> from the middle of <hi>May,</hi> to the latter end of <hi>December.</hi> They are so called because they cast their Coats. They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Hawks, could they be trusted; therefore they must be kept hard under, and must make your Fist their Pearch. Having discours'd of the Names and Nature of the Faulcon, I next come to his Manning, Luring, Flights, and Mewing in every condition: which course I shall orderly take in my ensuing discourse of the other Hawks I have onely named heretofore. And because what Diseases or Casualties are incident to one are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to all, I shall put their Cures at the latter end all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>Having taken a Faulcon, you must Seel her, in such manner, that as the Seeling slackens, the Faulcon may be able to see what provision is straight before her, which she will better see so than any other way: and be sure you Seel her not too hard.</p>
                        <p>A Hawk newly taken ought to have all new Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as new Jesses of good Leather, mailed Leases with Buttons at the end, and new Bewets. You must have a small round stick likewise hanging in a string, with which you must frequently stroak your Hawk:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100171:98"/>
the oftner you do it, the sooner and better you will man her. She must have two good Bells, that she may the better be found and heard when she either stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or scratteth: Her Hood must be well fashioned, raised and bossed against her Eyes, deep, and yet straight enough beneath, that it may the better fasten about her Head without hurting her: and you must cope a little her Beak and Talons, but not so near as to make them bleed.</p>
                        <p>Take notice, if you take a <hi>Soar-faulcon</hi> which hath already past the Seas, although she be very hard to be reclaim'd, yet she is the best of Faulcons.</p>
                        <p>Her food must be good and warm twice or thrice a day, until she be full gorg'd; which food must be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pigeons, Larks, or other live Birds: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because you must break her by degrees off from her accustomed feeding.</p>
                        <p>When you feed her, you must whoop and lure as you do when you call a Hawk, that she may know when you will give her meat.</p>
                        <p>You must unhood her gently, giving her two or three bits; and putting on her Hood again, you must give her as much more, and be sure that she be close Seeled: and after three or four days lessen her diet: and when you go to bed, set her on some Pearch by you, that you may awaken her often in the night. Thus you must do till you observe her grow tame and gentle: and when you find she begins to feed eagerly, then give her a Sheep's-heart. And now you may begin to unhood her by day-time, but it must be far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; first giving her a bit or two, then hood her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain gently, and give her as much more. Be sure not to afright her with any thing when you unhood her. And when you perceive her to be acquainted with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and that she is sharp set, unhood her, and give her some meat, holding her just against your Face and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100171:99"/>
Eyes, which will make her less afraid of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of others. If you can, reclaim her without over-watching.</p>
                        <p>You must bear her continually on the Fist till she be throughly Manned, causing her to feed in company, giving her in the Morning about Sun-rising the Wing of a Pullet, and in the Evening the Foot of a Coney or Hare cut off above the joynt, flay'd and laid in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which having squeez'd, give it her with the Pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Hen's Wing.</p>
                        <p>For two or three days give her washt meat, and then Plumage, according as you think her foul within. If she Cast, hood her again, and give her nothing till she Gleam after her Casting: having gleamed and casted, then give her a beaching of hot meat in company; and towards the Evening let her plume a Hen's Wing in company also.</p>
                        <p>If the Feathers of her Casting be foul or slimy, and of a yellowish complexion, then be sure to cleanse her well with washt meat and Casting: if clean within, give her gentle Castings, as the Pinions of an old Hens Wing, or the Neck-bone chopped four or five times between the joynts, washt and steeped in fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>Having well reclaimed her, throughly manned her, and made her eager and sharp set, then you may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to feed her on the Lure.</p>
                        <p>But before you shew her the Lure, you must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these three things: 1. That she be bold in and familiar with company, and no ways afraid of Dogs and Horses. 2. That she be sharp set and hungry, regarding the hour of the Morning and Evening when you will Lure her. 3. And lastly, she must be clean within, and the Lure must be well garnished with meat on both sides, and you must abscond your self when you intend to give her the length of the Lease.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100171:99"/>
                        <p>You must first unhood her, giving her a bit or two on the Lure as she sitteth on your Fist: afterwards take the Lure from her, and so hide it that she see it not; and when she is unseized, cast the Lure so near her that she may catch it within the length of her Lease. When she hath seiz'd it, use your voice according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of Faulconers, and feed her upon the Lure on the ground with the Heart and warm Thigh of a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. Having so lured her, in the Evening give her but a little meat; and let this luring be so timely, that you may give her Plumage and a Juck of a joynt.</p>
                        <p>In the Morning betimes take her on your Fist, and when she hath cast and gleamed, give her a little beach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of warm meat. Towards Noon take a Creance and tie it to her Lease, and go into some pleasant Field or Meadow, and give her a bit or two on the Lure; then unseize her: and if you find she is sharp set, and hath seized on the Lure eagerly, then give her some one to hold, to let her off to the Lure, then unwind the Creance, and draw it after you a good way, and let him which holds the Hawk hold his right hand on the Tassel of the Hawks Hood in readiness, so that he may unhood her assoon as you begin to lure: and if she come well to the Lure, and stoop upon it roundly, and seize it eagerly, then let her eat two or three bits thereon; then unseize her and take her off the Lure, hood her, and deliver her to him again that held her, and going farther off lure her, feeding her as before with the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed voice. Thus lure her every day farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, till she is accustomed to come freely and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lure.</p>
                        <p>After this, lure her in company, but have a care that nothing affright her: and when you have used her to the Lure on foot, then lure her on Horse-back; which you may effect the sooner, by causing Horse-men
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100171:100"/>
to be about you when you lure her on foot: also you may do it the sooner by rewarding her upon the Lure on Horse-back among Horsemen. When this way she grows familiar, let some body afoot hold the Hawk, and he that is on Horse-back must call and cast the Lure about his Head; then must the holder take off the Hood by the Tassel: and if she seize eagerly on the Lure without fear of Man or Horse, then take off the Creance, and lure her at a greater distance. And if you would have her love Dogs as well as the Lure, call Dogs when you give her Tiring or Plumage.</p>

As she flieth about you, trot on with your Horse, and cast out your Lure, not suffering her to fly long about you at first: continue thus doing Morning and Evening for seven or eight days. But if you find your Hawk unwilling to fly about you or stop to the Lure, then must you let her fly with some <hi>Hawk</hi> that loves the company of others, and will not rove at any change or check; and that must first be done at the Partridge, for they will not fly far before the <hi>Hawk.</hi> If she hath flown twice or thrice, cast out the Lure, and reward her on Horseback. If the Fowl you flew her at be killed by another <hi>Hawk,</hi> let her feed with him a little, and then farther reward her on the Lure.</p>
                        <p>If you would have your Faulcon prove upwards and a high-flying <hi>Hawk,</hi> you must let her fly with such as are so qualified. If the love the company of others, and is taught to hold in the Head, then if the Fowl be in Pool, Pit, or Plash, cast off your high-flying <hi>Hawk,</hi> and let him that hath your new-lur'd <hi>Hawk</hi> get under the Wind, and when he seeth his advantage, let him unhood her; and if she bate, then it is to get up to the other <hi>Hawk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let him then cast her off, and before she get up to the other near his full pitch, lay out the Fowl: if she kill her Game, reward her with the Heart, and let her participate of the Breast with the other <hi>Hawks.</hi>

                        <p>To take your Faulcon from going out to any Check, thus you must do: If she hath kill'd a Check, and hath fed thereon before you could come in, rebuke her not severely at first, but take her down to the Lure, give her a bit or two, hood her, and fly her not in three or four days; and if you do, let it be where no Checks are: but if you come in before she hath tasted the Check she hath killed, then take the Gall of an Hen, and anoint the Breast of that Check she hath killed, (any other bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing will do) and this will make her hate to go at Check again.</p>

                        <p>When you feed your Faulcon, call and lure as if you called her to the Lure, and every day profer her Water, and every night give her Castings accordingly as she endeweth. Take off her Hood frequently in company; and that you may hinder her from bating, hold always the Hood ready by the Tassel in your hand.</p>
                        <p>In the Evening by candle-light take off her Hood among company, until she Rouze and Mewt; then set her on the Pearch, and not before, setting a light before her.</p>
                        <p>Every Faulcon ought to have a <hi>Make-Hawk</hi> to teach her to hold in the Head: if that will not do, cut off some part of her two Principals in each Wing, the long Feather and that next to it, which will force her to hold in.</p>
                        <p>Be sure to reward your <hi>Hawk</hi> well at the beginning, and let her feed well on the Quarry; which will so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage her, that she will have no fancy to go out to the Check. When she is well in bloud and well quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, then let her fly with other <hi>Hawks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100171:101"/>
                        <p>If you would make your Faulcon to the Crane, her Lure should be a counterfeit Crane. If you would make her to the Hare, her Lure should be then a Hares Skin stuft with some light matter: When she is well lured, and you would enter her, tie the Hares Skin so stuft to the end of a Creance, and fasten it to your Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-pummel, by which means when you gallop it will resemble a running Hare: then unhood your <hi>Hawk,</hi> and cry, <hi>Back with the Dogs, back with the Dogs.</hi> When you find she hath seized it, let go your Creance, and suffer her to fasten thereon; then instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reward her upon it, and encourage her as much as is possible.</p>
                        <p>When she is well entred after this manner, take a living Hare and break one of her hinder Legs, and having before well acquainted your Faulcon with your Dogs by continual feeding among them, I say then put your Hare out in some fair place with your Dogs, and the Faulcon will stoop and ruff her until the Dogs may take her; then take the Hare from the Dogs, and cast her out to the Faulcon, crying, <hi>Back, back there.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you would make your Hawk flying to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge or Pheasant after she is reclaimed and made, then every time you lure her, cast your Lure into some low Tree or Bush, that she may learn to take the Tree or Stand: if she take the Stand before she sees the Lure, let her stand a while; and afterwards draw the Lure out before her, and cry with what words you have acquainted her to understand you by, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her well. After this manner she will learn to take Stand.</p>
                        <p>Feed her always on the ground, or in some thick place; for in such places she must encounter with the Pheasant at Pearch.</p>
                        <p>At first fly with her at young Pheasant or Partridge,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100171:102"/>
to encourage her by advantage, and afterwards at the old.</p>
                        <p>If a Faulcon will not take Stand, but keep on the Wing, then must you fly her in plain places where you may always see her upon you.</p>
                        <p>Draw your Faulcon out of the Mew twenty days before you Enseam her: If she truss and carry, the remedy is to cope her Talons, her Powlse and Petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>single.</p>
                        <p>Never reward your <hi>Hawk</hi> upon River-sowl but upon the Lure, that she may the better love and esteem thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Crane ought to be flown at before Sun-rising; for she is a slothful Bird, and you may cast off to her a Cast or Lease of Faulcons, or a Coshawk from the Fist, without Dogs. You must fly but once a day at the Crane, after which you must reward your Hawk very well, ever succouring her with a Grey-hound, which is the best of Dogs for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>Give your Faulcon a Beaching very early in the morning, and it will make her very eager to fly when it is time for it.</p>
                        <p>If you would have her a high-flying <hi>Hawk;</hi> you must not feed her highly, but she should be fed nine days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before Sun-rising, and at night late in the cool of the Evening.</p>
                        <p>The Faulcon will kill the Hern naturally if she be a Peregrin or Traveller: yet you will do well to give her Trains.</p>
                        <p>A Faulcon may fly ten times in a day at a River, if the season be not extream; but more is inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Hawk</hi> ought to have forty Castings before she be perfectly made. And indeed all <hi>Hawks</hi> ought to have Castings every night, if you would have them clean and sound: for <hi>Hawks</hi> which have not this continual
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100171:102"/>
nocturnal Casting will be surcharged with abundance of superfluous Humours, which ascending to the Brain, bred so great a disturbance that they cannot fly so high as otherways they would. And it is good to give them Tiring or Plumage at night, especially field-<hi>Hawks,</hi> but not River-<hi>Hawks,</hi> for fear of weakning their Backs.</p>
                        <p>When your <hi>Hawk</hi> hath flown or bated, feed her not so long as she panteth, (but let her be first in breath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;) otherways you may bring her into a Disease called the <hi>Pantas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If a Faulcon or other <hi>Hawk</hi> will not Seize nor Gorge, take the Quill of a Wild-goose, and tie it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her long Single; then will she Seize and Gripe. When she beginneth to seize, take away the said Quill, and she will seize long afterwards.</p>
                        <p>If you cannot give Covert to your Faulcon or Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk, then cast her off with the Sun in her back.</p>
                        <p>When you draw your <hi>Hawk</hi> out of the Mew, if she be greazie, (which you shall know by her round fat Thighs and her full Body, the flesh being round, and as high as her Breast-bone) and if she be well mew'd, and have all her Feathers summed, then give her at feeding-time in the morning two or three bits of hot meat; and at night give her less, unless it be very cold; and if she feed well and without compulsion, give her washt meat. Thus prepared, take the Wings of a Hen for her Dinner and wash them in two Waters. In the morning give her the Legs of a Hen very hot, at Noon meat temperately warm, a good Gorge; then let her fast till it be late in the Evening. If she have put over her meat, and there is nothing left in her Gorge, then give her warm meat, as in the morning. Thus diet her till it be convenient to give her Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the which you may know by these tokens: First, the Flesh of the end of the Pinion of the <hi>Hawk's</hi>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100171:103"/>
Wing will seem softer and tenderer than it did before she did eat washt meat. Secondly, if her Mewts be white, and the black thereof be very black, and not mingled with any other colour. Lastly, if she be sharp set, and doth plume eagerly, you may give her Casting either of a Hare's or Coney's Foot, or the small Feathers on the joynt of the Wing of an old Hen.</p>
                        <p>Having set her on the Pearch, sweep clean under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, that you may see whether the Mewt be full of streaks, or skins, or slimy: if it be, then continue this sort of Casting three or four nights together; but if you find the Feathers digested and soft, and that her Casting is great, then take the neck of an old Hen, and cut it between the joynts, then lay it in cold water, and give it your Faulcon three nights together; in the day-time give her washt meat, after this Casting or Plumage, as you shall see requisite: and this will bear all down into the Pannel.</p>
                        <p>When you have drawn her out of the Mew, and her principal Feathers are summed, give her no washt meats, but quick Birds with good Gorges, and set her out in open places.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100171:103"/>
and to that end he must often unhood and hood her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                        <p>In nine nights the Faulconer ought not to let his <hi>Hawk</hi> Jouk at all, nor suffer her to pearch, but keep her during that time continually on his Fist.</p>
                        <p>When the Faulconer would call his <hi>Hawk,</hi> let him set her on the Pearch, unhood her, and shew her some meat within his Fist, call her so long till she come to it, then feed her therewith: if she come not, let her stand without food till she be very sharp set. Observe this order for about nine days.</p>
                        <p>When you would lure her give her some man to hold, and call her with a Lure well garnisht with meat on both sides, and give her a bit: use her to this six or seven days; then cause her to be held farther from you, and cast the Lure about your Head, and throw it on the ground a little way from you: if she come to it roundly, reward her bountifully. Having used her to this some certain days, take your Lure gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as aforesaid, and every day call her to you as far as it is possible for her to see or hear you, and let her be loose from all her Furniture, without Loins or Creance. If she come freely, reward her, and stop her now and then in her feeding; for that will make her come the better. You may do well to stop the Lure upon her sometimes, and let her fly upon you. Here note, it is requisite to bathe her before you take this course, lest when she is at liberty she rangle to see Water, and in the mean time you lose your <hi>Hawk;</hi> wherefore bathe her every seven or eight days, for her nature requireth it.</p>
                        <p>When you have thus manned, reclaimed, and lured your <hi>Hawk,</hi> go out with her into the fields, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle her off your Fist, stand still to see what she will do, and whether she will rake out or not: but if she fly round about you, as a good <hi>Hawk</hi> ought to do, let
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100171:104"/>
her fly a turn or two, and fling her out the Lure, and let her foot a Chicken or Pullet, and having killed it, let her feed thereon.</p>
                        <p>Unhood her often as you bear her; continue so doing till she hath endewed and mewted sufficiently.</p>
                        <p>Your <hi>Hawk</hi> being thus made and manned, go abroad with her every morning when it is fair, and let the place where you intend to fly her be plashy, or some narrow Brook; and when you cast her off, go into the Wind so far, that the Fowl may not discover you. When she is cast off, and beginneth to recover her Gate, make then to the Brook or Plash where the Fowl lie, always making your <hi>Hawk</hi> to lean in upon you: and when you see her at a reasonable pitch, (her Head being in) lay out the Fowl, and land it if you can; and if you cannot, take down your <hi>Hawk,</hi> and let her kill some Train; to which end you must always carry some live Fowl with you, as a Duck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having slipt one of her Wing feathers, thrust it through her Nares, and cast her up as high as you can underneath your <hi>Hawk</hi> that she may the better know your hand.</p>
                        <p>If you would have your <hi>Hawk</hi> fly at one particular Fowl more than at another, you must then feed her well upon a Train of the same kind, as thus: Take a Creance, and tie that Fowl you would accustom her to fly to by the Beak, with meat on her Back, and cause one to stand close that shall hold the Creance; then standing afar off, unhood your <hi>Hawk,</hi> and let the Fowl be stirred and drawn with the Creance until your <hi>Hawk</hi> perceive it stir; and if she foot it, make another Train thus: Take a living Fowl that can fly, half seel it and cast it out; then let your <hi>Hawk</hi> fly to it; and if she kill it, reward her well upon it.</p>

Having thus furnished her, you must begin her manning by gentle handling. To avoid the danger of her Beak, you must have a smooth Stick about half a foot in length, with which you must stroak your <hi>Hawk</hi> about the Pinions of her Wings, and so downwards thwart her Train. If she offer to snap at the Stick, withdraw not your hand, and let her bite thereon, the hardness whereof will soon make her weary of that sport.</p>
                        <p>If you would man her well, you should watch all the night, keeping her continually on your Fist.</p>
                        <p>You must teach her to feed seel'd; and having a great and easie Rufter-hood, you must hood and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood her often, seel'd as she is, handling her gently about the head, coying her always when you unhood her, to the intent she may not be displeased with her Keeper.</p>

                        <p>When your <hi>Hawk</hi> or <hi>Haggard-faulcon</hi> will come and stoop to the Lure roundly without any fear or coyness, you must put her on a great pair of Luring-bells; the like you must do to a <hi>Soar-hawk:</hi> by so much greater must the Bells be, by how much your <hi>Hawk</hi> is giddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and apt to rake out at Check.</p>
                        <p>That being done, and she sharp set, go in a fair mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into some large Field on Horseback, which Field must be very little incumbred with Wood or Trees: having your <hi>Hawk</hi> on your Fist, ride up into the wind,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100171:106"/>
and having loosned her Hood, whistle softly to provoke her to fly; and then you will observe she will begin to bate, or at least to flap with her Flags and Sails, and to raise her self on your Fist: then suffer her until she rouze or Mewt: when she hath done either of them, unhood her, and let her fly with her Head into the Wind; for thereby she will be the better able to get upon the Wing; then will she naturally climbe upwards, flying in a circle.</p>
                        <p>When she hath flown three or four Turns, then cry and lure with your Voice, casting the Lure about your head, unto which you must first tie a Pullet: and if your Faulcon come in and approach near you, then cast out the Lure into the Wind; and if she stoop to it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her as before.</p>
                        <p>There is one great fault you will often find in the making of a <hi>Hawk</hi> flying, and that is, when she flieth from the Fist she will not get up, but take stand on the ground; a frequent fault in Soar-faulcons. You must then fright her up with your Wand, riding in to her; and when you have forced her to take a Turn or two, take her down to the Lure and feed her. But if this do no good, then you must have in readiness a Duck seeled, so that she may see no way but backwards, and that will make her mount the higher. This Duck you must hold by one of the Wings near the body in your right hand, then lure with your voice to make your Faulcon turn the head: when she is at a reasonable pitch, cast up your Duck just under her, that she may perceive it: if she strike, stoop, or truss the Duck, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her to kill it, and reward her, giving her a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gorge. Use this custom twice or thrice, and your <hi>Hawk</hi> will leave the Stand, delighting on the Wing, and will become very obedient.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that for the first or second time it is not convenient, to shew your <hi>Hawk</hi> great or large Fowl,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100171:107"/>
for it often happens that they slip from the <hi>Hawk</hi> into the wind; the <hi>Hawk</hi> not recovering them, raketh after them, which puts the Faulconer to much trouble, and frequently occasions the loss of his <hi>Hawk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if it so chance that your <hi>Hawk</hi> so rake out with a Fowl that she cannot recover it, but gives it over and comes in again directly upon you, then cast out a seeled Duck; and if she stoop and truss it, cross the Wings, and permit her to take her pleasure, rewarding her also with the Heart, Brains, Tongue, and Liver. For want of a quick Duck, take her down with the dry Lure, and let her plume a Pullet, and feed her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                        <p>By so doing, your <hi>Hawk</hi> will learn to give over a Fowl that rakes out, and hearing the Lure of the Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner, will make back again to the River, and know the better to hold in the Head.</p>

                        <p>When you intend a Flight for a Haggard, for the first, second, and third time, make choice of such a place where there are no Crows, Rooks, or the like, to take away all occasion of her raking out after such Check.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes a Haggard out of pride and a gadding humour will rangle out from her Keeper: then clog her with great Luring-bells, and make her a Train or two with a Duck seeled, to teach her to hold in and know her keeper: take her down often with the dry Lure, and reward her bountifully, and let her be ever

                        <head>How to continue and keep a <hi>Hawk</hi> in her high-flying.</head>
                        <p>If your <hi>Hawk</hi> be a stately high-flying <hi>Hawk,</hi> you ought not to engage her in more flights than one in a morning: for often flying brings her off from her stately pitch. If she be well made for the River, fly her not above twice in a morning; yet feed her up though she kill not.</p>
                        <p>When a high-flying <hi>Hawk</hi> being whistled to, gathers upwards to a great gate, you must continue her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, never flying her but upon broad Waters and open Rivers; and when she is at the highest, take her down with your Lure; where when she hath plumed and broken the Fowl a little, then feed her up, and by that means you shall maintain your Faulcon high-flying, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and very fond of the Lure.</p>
                        <p>Some will have this high-flying Faulcon seldom to kill, and not to stoop: yet if she kill every day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she stoop from a high Gate, yet if she be not rebuked or hurt therewith, she will, I can assure you, become a higher flier every day than other; but she will grow less fond of the Lure. Wherefore your
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100171:109"/>
high-flying <hi>Hawks</hi> should be made inwards, it being a commendable quality in them to make in and turn head at the second or third toss of the Lure, and when she poureth down upon it as if she had killed.</p>
                        <p>And as the teaching of a Faulcon, or any other <hi>Hawk</hi> to come readily to and love the Lure, is an art highly commendable, because it is the effect of great labour and industry: so it is the cause of saving many a <hi>Hawk,</hi> which otherways would be lost irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                        <p>Mark this by the way, that some naturally high-fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hawks</hi> will be long before they be made upwards, still fishing and playing the slugs; and when they should get up to cover the Fowl, they will stoop before the Fowl be put out: And this may proceed from two causes. In the first place, she may be too sharp set, and in the next place, it may be she is flown untimely, either too soon or too late.</p>
                        <p>When you see a <hi>Hawk</hi> use those evil Tatches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any visible cause, cast her out a dead Fowl for a dead Quarry, and hood her up instantly without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to discourage her from practising the like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time: half an hour afterwards call her to the Lure and feed her, and serve her after this manner as often as she fisheth in that fashion.</p>
                        <p>Besides, to correct this errour, the Faulconer ought to consult the natures and dispositions of his <hi>Hawks,</hi> and should carefully observe which fly high when in good plight, and which best when they are kept low; which when sharpest set, and which on the contrary in a mean between both; which early at Sun-rising, which when the Sun is but two hours high; which sooner, and which later in an evening.</p>
                        <p>For know that the natures of <hi>Hawks</hi> are different; so are the time to fly each one: for to fly a <hi>Hawk</hi> in her proper times, and to fly her out of it, is as disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100171:109"/>
as the flight of a <hi>Gerfaulcon</hi> and a <hi>Buzzard.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ostrager must fly his <hi>Hawks</hi> according to their natures and dispositions, keeping them always in good order.</p>
                        <p>Where by the by take notice, all <hi>Hawks,</hi> as well <hi>Soar-hawks</hi> as <hi>Mew'd-hawks</hi> and <hi>Haggards,</hi> should be set out in the Evening two or three hours, some more, some less, having respect to their nature as it is stronger or weaker; and in the morning also according as they cast, hooding them first, and then setting them abroad a weathering, until you get on Horseback to prosecute your Recreation.</p>

                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>A Flight for the Hern.</head>
                        <p>This Flight hath less of Art in it than Pleasure to the beholders; and, to say the truth, the Flight is state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and most noble.</p>
                        <p>As it is less difficult to teach a <hi>Hawk</hi> to fly at Fowl than it is to come unto and love the Lure, the first being natural, and not the last; so there is less industry to be used in making a <hi>Hawk</hi> fly the Hern than Water-fowl. To the first she is instigated by a natural propensity and inclination; to the latter she is brought with art, pains, and much diligence.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of <hi>March</hi> Herns begin to make their Passage: if therefore you will adapt your Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons for the Hern, you must not let them fly longer at the River, and withal you must pull them down to make them light; which is done by giving them Hearts and flesh of Lambs and Calves, also Chickens; but give them no wild meats.</p>
                        <p>To the intent you may acquaint them one with the other, so that they may the better fly the Hern and help one another, you must call a cast of them to the Lure at once; but have a care they crab not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100171:110"/>
for so they may endanger one another in their flight.</p>
                        <p>When your <hi>Hawk</hi> is scowred and clean and sharp set, you must then get a live Hern, upon the upper part of whose long sharp Bill you must place a joynt of a hollow Cane, which will prevent her from hurting the <hi>Hawk:</hi> that being done, tie the Hern in a Creance; then setting her on the ground, unhood your <hi>Hawk,</hi> who will fly the Hern as soon as shee sees her. If she seize her, make in apace to succour her, and let her plume and take bloud of the Hern: then take the Brains, the Marrow of the Bones, and the Heart, and laying it on your Hawking-glove, give it your Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. After this, rip her Breast, and let your <hi>Hawk</hi> feed thereon till she be well gorged: this being done, hood her up upon the Hern, permitting her to plume at her pleasure; then take her on your Fist, and let her tire on the Foot or Pinion.</p>
                        <p>Because Herns are not very plentiful, you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve one for a Train three or four times, by arming Bill, Head, and Neck, and painting it of the same colour that the Hern is of: and when the Faulcon seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her, you must be very nimble to make in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her by a live Pidgeon clapt under the Wing of the Hern for the Faulcon, which must be her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hawk</hi> having thus several times taken her Train without discovery of the delusion, you may then let the Hern loose in some fair Field without a Greance, or without arming her: when she is up of a reasonable height, you may cast off your Faulcon; who if she bind with the Hern and bring her down, then make in apace to rescue her, thrusting the Hern's Bill into the ground, and breaking his Wings and Legs, that the <hi>Hawk</hi> may with more ease plume and foot him. Then reward her as before, with the Brains,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100171:110"/>
Marrow of the Bones, and Heart, making thereof an <hi>Italian Soppa.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus much of a Train-Hern. Now to fly the wild Hern, it is thus: If you find a wild Hern at Siege, win in as nigh unto her as you can, and go with your <hi>Hawk</hi> under the Wind; and having first loosed her Hood in a readiness, as soon as the Hern leaveth the Siege, off with her Hood, and let her fly. If she climb to the Hern and bring her down, run in (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to rescue her, thrusting her Bill into the ground, breaking her Wings and Legs, and rewarding her as aforesaid on your Hawking-glove.</p>
                        <p>Now if your Faulcon beat not down the Hern, or do give him over, never fly your Faulcon again at a Hern, unless with a <hi>Make-hawk</hi> well entred; for the Coward by this means, seeing another fly at the Hern and bind with her, takes fresh courage. And if they kill the Hern flying both together, then must you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them both together while the Quarry is hot, making for them a <hi>Soppa</hi> as aforesaid. This is the onely way to make them both bold and perfect Hern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Haggard</hi> is by some called the <hi>Peregrin-Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> because, say some, she is brought from a Country forrein and remote; and therefore others call them <hi>Travellers,</hi> or <hi>Passengers.</hi> But if there be no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100171:111"/>
other reason for the name but this, all other <hi>Hawks</hi> coming from exotick places might borrow that appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                        <p>Upon a threefold consideration, I conceive they are called <hi>Haggard</hi> or <hi>Peregrin-faulcons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, because their Eyrie was never found in any Country by any man that ever I could hear or read of.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, because these Faulcons rangle and wander more than other Faulcon doth, still seeking strange and forreign Coasts; so that where-ever they come they may be justly called <hi>Peregrins</hi> or <hi>Forreigners.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, and lastly, she never takes up her habitation long in a place.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Haggard</hi> is not inferiour to any other Faulcon, but very tender, and cannot endure hard weather, say some; but my experience hath found it otherwise. The reason that may be alleadged is this; first, she tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels far, as a Stranger, and comes into Countries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the hardest time of the year: next, she is a hot <hi>Hawk,</hi> which may be gathered from her high fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where the Air is much colder than below, and therefore ought to be more hardy: lastly, she meweth with more expedition (if she once begin to cast her Feathers) than other Faulcons do.</p>
                        <p>They are of shape like other Faulcons; but as to mould they are of three sorts, large, middle-siz'd, and little; some long-shaped, some short-trussed; some larger, some less.</p>
                        <p>They have a fourfold Mail, blank, russet, brown and Turtle.</p>
                        <p>The goodness of her Shape consists in having her Head plum'd dark or blank, flat on the top with a white Wreath environing the same, a large blue ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Beak, wide Nares, a great black full Eye, high stately Neck, large Breast, broad Shoulders, a great
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100171:111"/>
Turtle-coloured Feather, long Veins and Sails, but slender shaped, a long Train, high Thighs, and white on the Pendant Feathers, a large wide Foot, with slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Stretchers, and Talons tending somewhat to an azure colour.</p>
                        <p>You may know her in her flight from another by the stirring of her Wings; for she useth no thick stroak, but getteth up to her <hi>Mountee</hi> leisurely, without any great making out: besides she may be known by her extraordinary large Sails.</p>
                        <p>The differences between the <hi>Haggard</hi> and <hi>Faulcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle</hi> are these:</p>
                        <p>First, the <hi>Haggard</hi> is larger, being longer-armed with longer Beak and Talons, having a higher Neck, with a long and fair-seasoned Head.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, her Beam-feathers in flight are longer than the <hi>Faulcon-gentle's,</hi> her Train somewhat larger: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the <hi>Haggard</hi> hath a flat Thigh, and the other's is round.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Haggard</hi> will lie longer on the Wing.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Haggard</hi> at long flight exceeds the <hi>Faulcon-gentle;</hi> which last fleith with more speed from the Fist than the other. For maintenance of Flight and goodness of Wing the <hi>Haggard</hi> exceeds all other <hi>Hawks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, and lastly, the <hi>Haggard</hi> is more deliberate and advised in her Stooping than the <hi>Faulcon-gentle,</hi> who is more hot and hasty in her Actions, and missing the Fowl, is apt presently to fly on head at the Check.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Barbary,</hi> or, as some call her, the <hi>Tartaret-Faulcon,</hi> is a Bird seldom found in any Country, and is called a <hi>Passenger</hi> as well as the <hi>Haggard.</hi> They are somewhat lesser than the <hi>Tiercel-gentle,</hi> and plum'd red under the Wings, strong-armed, with long Talons and Stretchers.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Barbary-Faulcon</hi> is venturously bold, and you may fly her with the <hi>Haggard</hi> all <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June.</hi> They are <hi>Hawks</hi> very slack in mewing at first; but when once they begin, they mew their Feathers very fast.</p>
                        <p>They are called <hi>Barbary-Faulcons,</hi> because they make their passage through that Country and <hi>Tunis,</hi> where they are more frequently taken than in any other place, namely in the Isles of the <hi>Levant, Candy, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Rhodes.</hi> In my opinion, she is a <hi>Hawk</hi> of not much value, and therefore I shall leave her, to speak of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of greater reputation.</p>

                           <hi>Of the</hi> GERFAULCON.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Gerfaulcon</hi> is a very fair <hi>Hawk,</hi> and of great force, especially being mewed: she is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, having long Stretchers and Singles; she is fierce and hardy of nature, and therefore difficultly to be reclaimed. She is a lovely Bird to behold, larger than any kind of Faulcon: her Eyes and Head are like the <hi>Haggard's.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100171:112"/>
                        <p>Her Beak is great and bending: she hath large Nares, and a Mail like a <hi>Lanner's;</hi> her Sails are long and sharp-pointed; her Train much like the <hi>Lanner's;</hi> she hath a large Foot marble-seared, and is plumed blank, brown, and russet. She expects great civility from her Keeper, who must exercise a great deal of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience on her.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Gerfaulcon's</hi> Eyrie is in some parts of <hi>Prussia,</hi> and on the borders of <hi>Russia;</hi> and some come from the Mountains of <hi>Norway,</hi> and from <hi>Germany:</hi> These may be also called <hi>Passengers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By reason of the fierceness and hardiness of this Bird, she is very hardly manned and reclaimed; but being once overcome, she proves an excellent <hi>Hawk,</hi> and will scarce refuse to fly at any thing.</p>
                        <p>Their Beaks are blue, so are the Sears of their Legs and Feet, having Pounces and Talons very long.</p>
                        <p>These <hi>Hawks</hi> do not fly the River, but always from the Fist fly the Herns, Shovelers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In going up to their Gate they do not hold that course or way which others do; for they climbe up upon the Train when they find any Fowl, and as soon as they have reacht her they pluck her down, if not at the first, yet at the second or third encounter. You must feed and reward them like other Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</p>
                        <p>They are very crafty, and covet to keep their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings long through sloth; therefore instead of Cotton give them a Casting of Tow, and be sure to keep them sharp set.</p>
                        <p>In the Manning and Reclaiming you must by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness make her gentle and familiar with you. When you have taught her to be lured loose, then learn her to come to the Pelts of Hens, or any other Fowl: but let her not touch any living flesh, for fear that draw her love away from your Voice and Hand.</p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:100171:113"/>
                        <p>All this time you must be close by her, about her, and upon your Knees, using your Voice unto her, with her dinner and supper clean drest and washt, giving her still some bits thereof with your hand, that she may the more delight therein. By doing thus frequently you will so win her, that should she be guilty of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, yet by this means she will be reclaimed, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that errour.</p>
                        <p>Let the Ostrager have especial care how he make his <hi>Gerfaulcon</hi> at first, and indeed all other <hi>Hawks;</hi> for as they are made then, he shall ever find them after; and if they are well made, they are twice made, and for ever made: and therefore have a care of two much precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in posting them forward from one lesson to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before they are perfect in any thing.</p>
                        <p>If you train her with Doves, she will not carry a feather from you. But first before you spring her any Doves, let her kill four or five at Lure close by your foot, having a pair of short Creances at your Lure.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that the <hi>Gerfaulcon</hi> is most desired for her high-flying, and is best at Hern and the Mountee: and that you may bring her to perfection herein, play with your entermewed <hi>Gerfaulcon</hi> the first year, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her all imaginable kindness, and using all possible means to make her love you. When you have brought her forward, give her often Castings to cleanse and purge her, also to prevent the growth of too much glut and fatness in her inward parts, which will indanger her life.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Saker</hi> is a Passenger or Peregrin-Hawk, for her Eyrie hath not been found by any. They are found in the Isles of the <hi>Levant, Cyprus, Rhodes,</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> and in several other Islands in the Sea.</p>
                        <p>She is somewhat larger than the <hi>Haggard-faulcon;</hi> her Plume is rusty and ragged; the Sear of her foot and Beak like the Lanner; her Pounces are short, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she hath great strength, and is hardy to all kind of Fowl. She is more disposed to the Field a great deal than to the Brook, and delights to prey on great Fowl, as the Hern, the Goose, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the Crane, she is not so free to fly at her as the <hi>Haggard-faulcon.</hi> The <hi>Saker</hi> is good also for lesser Fowl, as Pheasant, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is nothing so dainty of her Diet as <hi>Hawks</hi> long-winged.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Hawk</hi> will make excellent sport with a Kite, who, as soon as she sees the <hi>Saker</hi> (the Male whereof is called a <hi>Sakaret</hi>) cast off, immediately betakes her self to, and trusts in the goodness of her Wings, and getteth to her pitch as high as possibly she may, by making many Turns and Wrenches in the Air: which if well observed, together with the variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests and bickerings that are between them, it cannot but be very pleasant and delightful to the beholder. I have known in a clear day and little wind stirring, that both the <hi>Saker</hi> and Kite have soar'd so high that the sharpest eye could not discern them, yet hath the <hi>Saker</hi> in the encounter conquered the Kite, and I have seen her come tumbling down to the ground with a strange precipitancy.</p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:100171:114"/>
                        <p>Of all Birds the <hi>Saker</hi> hath the longest Train. This <hi>Hawk</hi> will fly at Hern, Kite, Pheasant, Partridge, Quail, and sometimes at the Hare; but her chiefest excellency consists in her flying at the Crane. Now because we have but few of them in <hi>England,</hi> I shall desist from speaking farther of the <hi>Saker,</hi> onely that she is made to the Lure as other <hi>Hawks</hi> are: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all Faulcons are made after the same manner, yet are not flown withal alike; for <hi>Sakers, Lanners, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulcons, Mylions,</hi> and <hi>Merlins</hi> do not fly the River; if any do, it is very rarely.</p>

                           <hi>Of the</hi> LANNER, LANNERET, <hi>and</hi> TUNISIAN.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Lanner</hi> is a <hi>Hawk</hi> common in all Countries, especially in <hi>France,</hi> making her Eyrie on high Trees in Forrests, or on high Cliffs near the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</p>
                        <p>She is lesser than the <hi>Faulcon-gentle,</hi> fair-plumed when an Enter-mewer, and of shorter Talons than any other Faulcon. Those who have the largest and best-seasoned Heads are the best Lanners.</p>
                        <p>With the <hi>Lanner</hi> or <hi>Lanneret</hi> you may fly the River; and both are very good also for the Land.</p>
                        <p>They are not very choice in their Food, and can better away with gross Victuals than any other <hi>Hawk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mew'd <hi>Lanners</hi> are hardly known from the <hi>Soar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks,</hi> (and so likewise the <hi>Saker</hi>) because they do not change their Plume.</p>
                        <p>You may know the <hi>Lanners</hi> by these three tokens. 1. They are blanker <hi>Hawks</hi> than any other. 2. They
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100171:114"/>
have less Beaks than the rest. 3. And lastly, They are less armed and pounced than other Faulcons.</p>
                        <p>Of all <hi>Hawks</hi> there is none so fit for a young Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner as the <hi>Lanner,</hi> because she is not inclined to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, and seldom melts Grease by being over-flown.</p>
                        <p>There are a sort of <hi>Lanners</hi> which Eyrie in the <hi>Alps,</hi> having their Heads white and flat aloft, large and black Eyes, slender Nares, short and thick Beaks, and lesser than the <hi>Haggard</hi> or <hi>Faulcon-gentle.</hi> Some are indifferent large, some less, and others middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sized.</p>
                        <p>Their Mail is marble or russet; their Breast-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers white and full of russet spots; the points and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of their Feathers full of white drops; their Sails and Train long: they are short Leg'd, with a foot less than that of a Faulcon, marble-seer'd; but being mew'd the Seer changeth to a yellow.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Lanner</hi> never lieth upon the Wing after she hath flown to Mark, but after once stooping she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Point, and then, like the <hi>Goshawk,</hi> waits the Fowl.</p>
                        <p>If she miss at the first down-fall and kill not, she will consult her advantage to her greatest ease.</p>
                        <p>These kind of <hi>Hawks</hi> are highly prized in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> neither is she despiseable in <hi>England;</hi> but we look upon them as slothful and hard-metled: and therefore if you intend to have any good of her, keep a strict hand over her; for she is of an ungrateful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and will slight your Kindnesses, contrary to the nature of the <hi>Faulcon-gentle,</hi> who for one good usage will return a treble courtesie, and the better she is rewarded, the better she will fly.</p>
                        <p>They are flown at Field or Brook, and are <hi>Hawks</hi> that maintain long flights, whereby much Fowl is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (and more than by a better <hi>Hawk</hi>) by reason of Dogs and Hawking-poles.</p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:100171:115"/>
                        <p>If you will fly with a <hi>Lanner,</hi> you must keep her very sharp: and because they keep their Castings long, by reason they are hard-metled <hi>Hawks,</hi> give them therefore hard Castings made of Tow and knots of Hemp.</p>
                        <p>In the reclaiming the <hi>Lanner</hi> and the <hi>Lanneret</hi> much pains and labour must be taken, and the chiefest thing is to make her well acquainted with the Lure, which must be garnished with hard washt meat, and let her receive the major part of her Reward in bits from your hand: as for the rest of her Training, take the same course which I have directed in the manning and ordering of the <hi>Haggard-faulcon.</hi> But above all take pains to stay her, and by your utmost Art restrain her from dragging or carrying any thing from you, to which ill quality she is more inclined than any other <hi>Hawk</hi> whatever.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this Chapter, I come next to the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisian-Faulcon,</hi> which is not much different in nature from the <hi>Lanner,</hi> yet somewhat less, but in Foot and Plume much alike. She hath a large round Head, and is more creese than the <hi>Lanner,</hi> and more heavy and sluggish in her flight.</p>
                        <p>She is called a <hi>Tunisian-faulcon,</hi> from <hi>Tunis</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of <hi>Barbary,</hi> the Country where she usually makes her Eyrie.</p>
                        <p>They are excellent <hi>Hawks</hi> for the River, lying long upon the Wing, and will fly the Field also very well.</p>
                        <p>They naturally delight to seize upon the Hare, and will strike boldly at her. Much more might be said of her, which I here omit, she being a <hi>Hawk</hi> not very common in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having cursorily discourst in as good a method as I could of the seven sorts of Faulcons, with their Manning, Reclaiming, Luring, Training, Staying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:100171:115"/>
I shall proceed to give you an account of some other <hi>Hawks,</hi> which I propounded and promised in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Treatise: take them thus in order.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>Of the <hi>MERLIN.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Merlin</hi> in Plume is much like the <hi>Haggard-Faulcon,</hi> also in the Sear of the Foot, Beak, and Talons, and is much alike in Conditions.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Merlin</hi> well mann'd, lur'd, and carefully lookt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will prove an excellent <hi>Hawk.</hi> Their flight is swifter than any other <hi>Hawk,</hi> and naturally they flie at Partridge, Thrush, and Lark.</p>
                        <p>It is a Bird very busie and unruly, and therefore the Faulconer ought to take special heed and care of them, lest unnaturally they eat off their own Feet and Talons, which several of them have been known to do, and die thereby. For which cause, <hi>Merlins</hi> ought not to be mew'd or intermew'd, because in the Mew they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten spoil themselves.</p>
                        <p>She is accounted a <hi>Hawk</hi> of the Fist, and not of the Lure; but to my knowledge she may be brought to love the Lure very well.</p>
                        <p>She is very venturous and hardy, which may appear by her flying at Birds as big or bigger than her self, with such eagerness, as that she will pursue them even into a Town or Village.</p>
                        <p>If you will flie with a <hi>Merlin</hi> at a Partridge, chuse the <hi>Formal,</hi> which is the Female. The <hi>Jack</hi> is not worth the Training.</p>
                        <p>When you have made her to the Lure, and that she will patiently endure the Hood, then make her a Train with a Partridge: if she foot and kill it, reward her
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100171:116"/>
well, suffering her to take her pleasure thereon. After this, fly her at the wild Partridge; if she take or mark it at first or second flight, being retrieved by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels, feed her upon it with a reasonable Gorge, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with your Voice in such manner that she may know it another time. If she prove not hardy at first Train, try her with a second or third: if she prove not then, she will prove nothing worth.</p>
                        <p>If you fly the <hi>Merlin</hi> at Lark or Linnet, let it be with a Cast of <hi>Merlins</hi> at once, because they love to fly in company: besides, it is a greater delight to the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators to see them fly together; you shall observe the one climb to the Mountee above the Lark, and the other to lie low for her best advantage.</p>
                        <p>When your <hi>Merlin</hi> is throughly manned and made gentle, (which you must bring to pass according to the method propounded for other <hi>Hawks</hi>) I say, when she is reclaimed, you may then carry her into the fields; where having found a Lark or Linnet, get as near as you can into the Wind to the Bird; and as soon as the Bird riseth from the ground, unhood your Cast of <hi>Merlins</hi> and cast them off, and when they have beaten down the Lark, let them feed a little thereon.</p>
                        <p>There is a sort of Larks which I would not advise the Faulconer to fly at, and they are called <hi>Cut-larks,</hi> which do not mount as the long-spur'd field-Lark, but fly straight forward, to the endangering the loss of your <hi>Hawk</hi> without any pastime or pleasure.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>Of the Mewing of <hi>Merlins, Faulcons, Gerfaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> and <hi>Mylions</hi> at Stock or at Large: and which is the best way of Mewing.</head>
                        <p>It is the opinion of some, (but how commendable, I will leave the Reader to judge) that <hi>Merlins</hi> cannot
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100171:116"/>
be mew'd, or if they be, that they are very rarely good afterwards. Experience tells me the contrary: for if they be hardy, and have flown well in their Soarage, they have proved much better after mewing than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>The time of mewing for Faulcons should be about the latter end of <hi>April;</hi> at which time set down your Faulcons, diligently observing whether they be louzy or not: if they are, pepper them, and that will infallibly kill the Lice. You must also scour them, before you cast them into the Mew.</p>
                        <p>Mewings are of two sorts; the one loose and at large, the other at the Stock or Stone.</p>
                        <p>Mewing at large is thus in short: If your Room be large, by divisions you may mew four Faulcons at once, each partition consisting of about twelve foot square, and as much in height, with two Windows two foot broad, the one opening to the North, for the benefit of cold Air; the other to the East, for the beneficial warmth of the Sun. At your East-window let there be a Board two foot broad, even with the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Window, with a Lath or Ledge round; in the middle set a green Turff, laying good store of Gravel and Stones about it, that your <hi>Hawk</hi> may take them at her pleasure.</p>
                        <p>If your Faulcon be a great Bater, let your Chamber be on the ground, which must be covered four fingers thick with gross Sand, and thereon set a Stone some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what taper, of about a Cubit in height, on which they love to sit, by reason of its coolness.</p>
                        <p>Make her two Perches, at each Window one, to recreate her self as she pleaseth, either with Heat or Cold.</p>
                        <p>Every week or fortnight set her a Bason of Water to bathe in; and when she hath bathed therein, take it away the night following.</p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100171:117"/>
                        <p>Your Mew must have a Portal to convey in the Hack, a thing whereon the meat is served. I need not prescribe the manner how to make it, since it is a thing so generally known already.</p>
                        <p>You ought to keep one set-hour in feeding; for so will she mew sooner and better: when she hath fed and gorged her self, then remove the Stick from the Hack on which the meat was fastened, to keep her from dragging it into the Mew.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of most, it is better Mewing at the Stock or Stone, which must be performed thus: Make choice of a Ground-room remote from noise or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people, and therein set a Table of what length you think is most convenient for the number of your Faulcons, and of about six foot in breadth, with thin Boards along the sides and ends, about four fingers high from the superficies of the Table, which must stand on Tressels about three foot high from the ground. Let this Table be covered indifferently thick with great Sand mixt with small Pebbles, in the midst whereof place a pyramidal Free-stone about a yard in height, unto which tye your Faulcon, Gerfaulcon, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin or Mylion: then take a small Cord of the bigness of a Bow-string, and put it through a Ring or Swivel, and bind it about the Stone in such sort that the Swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel may go round the Stone without let or hindrance, and thereunto tye the Lease of your <hi>Hawk.</hi>

                        <p>Here note, that if you mew more than one <hi>Hawk</hi> in one Room, you must set your Stones at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that when they bate they may not crab one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                        <p>The reason of placing this Stone is, because the Faulcon delights to sit thereon for its coolness sake, and the little gravelly stones the <hi>Hawk</hi> frequently swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to cool her within. The Sand is necessary to preserve their Feathers when they bate, and their Mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100171:117"/>
are the more easily cleansed. The little Gord with the Swivel tyed about the Stone, is to keep the <hi>Hawk</hi> from tangling when she bateth, because the Ring will still follow her.</p>
                        <p>All day let your <hi>Hawk</hi> stand hooded, onely when you take her on your Fist to feed: at night unhood her; and lest any accident should happen in the night, prejudicial to the <hi>Hawk,</hi> the Faulconer ought to lie in the Mew.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Hobby</hi> hath a blue Beak, but the Seer thereof and Legs are yellow: the Crinets or little Feathers under her Eye are very black; the top of her head is betwixt black and yellow, and she hath two white seams on her Neck; the Plumes under the Gorge and about the Brows, are reddish, without spot or drop; the Breast-feathers are brown for the most part, yet powdered with white spots; her Back, Train, and Wings are black aloft, having no great scales upon the Legs, unless it be a few beginning behind the three Stretchers and Pounces, which are very large in respect of her short Legs; her Brail-feathers are engouted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt red and black; the Pendant-feathers (which are those behind the Thigh) are of a rusty smoaky complexion. The daring <hi>Hobby</hi> may be well called so, for she is nimble and light of Wing, and dares encounter Kites, Bazzards, or Crows, and will give souse for souse, blow for blow, till sometimes they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100171:118"/>
seize and come tumbling down to the ground both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                        <p>They are chiefly for the Lark, which poor little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so dreads the sight of a <hi>Hobby</hi> soaring in the Air over her, that she will rather chuse to commit her self to the mercy of Man or Dogs, or to be trampled on by Horses, than venture her self into that Element where she sees her mortal Enemy soaring.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hobby</hi> makes excellent sport with Nets and Spaniels, which is performed after this manner. The Dogs range the field to spring the Fowl, and the <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> soar over them alost in the Air: the silly Birds, fearing a Conspiracy between the Hawks and Dogs to their utter destruction, dare not commit themselves to their Wings, but think it safer to lie close to the ground, and so are taken in the Nets. This sport is called <hi>Daring.</hi>

                        <p>THere are several sorts of <hi>Goshawks,</hi> and they are different in goodness, force, and hardiness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of their choice in Cawking: at which time when <hi>Hawks</hi> begin to fall to liking, all Birds of Prey do assemble themselves with the <hi>Goshawk,</hi> and flock together.</p>
                        <p>The Female is the best: and although there be some <hi>Goshawks</hi> which come from <hi>Sclavonia, Sardinia, Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy, Russia, Puglia, Germany, Armenia, Persia, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> yet there are none better than those which are bred in the North parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Ulster,</hi> but more especially in the County of <hi>Tyrone.</hi>

                        <p>Take these Rules as to the goodness of her propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or shape.</p>
                        <p>She ought to have a small Head, her Face long and straight, a large Throat, great Eyes, deep set, the Apple of the Eye black, Nares, Ears, Back, and Feet large and blank; a black long Beak, long Neck, big Breast, hard flesh, long Thighs, fleshy, the bone of the Leg and Knee short, long large Pounces and Talons. From the Stern or Train to the Breast forward she ought to grow round: the Feathers of the Thighs towards the Train should be large, and the Train-feathers short, soft, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tending to an Iron Mail. The Brayl-feathers ought to be like those of the Breast, and the Covert-feathers of the Train should be spotted and full of black rundles; but the extremity of every Train-feather should be black streaked.</p>
                        <p>The sign of force in a <hi>Goshawk</hi> is this: Tye divers of them in several places of one Chamber or Mew, and that <hi>Hawk</hi> that doth slise and mewt highest and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest off from her, is without question the strongest <hi>Hawk;</hi> for the high and far mewting argues a strong Back.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>She ought to be kept with great care, because she is very choice and dainty, and looks to have a nice hand kept over her.</p>

                        <p>First trim them with Jesses, Bewets, and Bells, as soon as they come to your hands; keep them seeled some time, hooding and unhooding them often, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to feed on the Fist three or four days, or till they have left their Rammageness and become gentle: having so done, unseel them by Candle-light at night, causing them to tire or plume upon a Wing or Leg of a Pullet; and be sure to deal gently and mildly with them until you have won and throughly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them: then you may go into some pleasant field, and first give them a bit or two hooded on your Fist, and the like unhooded, cast them down fair and softly on some Pearch, and make them come from it to your Fist, calling to them with a Faulconer's usual terms; and when they come, feed them, calling all the while in the same manner to make them acquainted with your voice. The next day you may call them with a Creance at a farther distance, feeding them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>When you have thus called your <hi>Goshawk</hi> abroad three or four days, and that you find her grow cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then take her on your Fist, and mount on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and ride with her an hour or two, unhooding and hooding her sometimes, giving her a bit or two in sight of your Spaniels, that she may not be afraid of them: this being done, set her on a Tree with a short Greance tied to her Loins, and going half a score yards from her on Horseback, call her to your Fist accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to art; if she come, reward her with two or three bits, and cast her up again to the Tree: then throw out a dead Pullet (to which she was used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) about a dozen yards from her; if she fly to it and seize it, let her feed three or four bits upon it; ride

the mean while about her on Horseback, and rate back your Spaniels, because they shall not rebuke her at first, and make her ever after afraid of them: then alight, and gently take her on your Fist, feed her, hood her, and let her plume or tire.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that the <hi>Goshawk</hi> is a greater Poulterer, and therefore it would be more requisite to throw out a dead Partridge, or one made artificially with its Wing, Tail and Plumage; which will cause her to know Partridge better, and Poultry less.</p>

                        <p>If the Partridge spring, let her fly: if she mark one, two, three, or more on the ground, then go to her and make her take Pearch on some Tree thereby: then if you can retrive the Partridge with your Spaniels, as soon as they spring it you must cry, <hi>Howit, howit,</hi> and retrive it the second time, crying when it springeth as aforesaid: if your <hi>Hawk</hi> kill it, feed her upon it.</p>
                        <p>If it so happen your Spaniels should take it (as it is very frequent for hot Spaniels to light upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, being either flown out of breath, or overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with fear) then alight from your Horse, and taking it speedily from the Dogs, cast it out to your <hi>Hawk</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ware Hawk, ware,</hi> and let her feed thereon at her pleasure.</p>
                        <p>After this you must not fly her in two days: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fed on bloudy meat, she will not so soon be in good case to fly again; for such meat is not so easily endewed by a <hi>Hawk</hi> as the Leg of a Chicken or the like,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100171:120"/>
Using her thus three or four times, she will be well in bloud, and become an excellent Flier at this pleasant Field flight.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that you must do at first with her as with other <hi>Hawks,</hi> that is, feel and watch her, and win her to feed, to the Hood, to the Fist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then enter her to young Partridges till <hi>November,</hi> at which time both Trees and Fields become bare and empty: then you may enter her to the old <hi>Rewen,</hi> setting her short and eager; if she kill, feed her up with the Partridge three or four times, and this will bring her to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p>If your <hi>Hawk</hi> be a good Partridger, let her not fly at the Powt or Pheasant, for they fly not so long a Flight as the Partridge; and therefore the <hi>Goshawk,</hi> being more greedy of Prey than any other <hi>Hawk,</hi> (yet desirous of ease, would always covet short Flights, not caring to hold out: not but that there are some good both for long and short flights, but they are rarely sound.</p>
                        <p>Besides, you must have a great care in keeping them in good order, with Flying, Bathing, Weathering, Tiring, and Pluming.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Goshawk</hi> (especially Soars and Niasses) are very loving to and fond of man, and therefore should be flown with a little more Rammage, else frequently, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two or three stroaks with their Wings, they will give over the flight, and return to the Keeper: wherefore you must fly with them as soon as you can. And yet there is an evil which attends this direction, and that is, by flying over-soon you will pull down your <hi>Hawk</hi> and make her poor, from whence proceeds fearfulness and cowardise. To remedy which, you must give your <hi>Hawk</hi> some respite, and set her up again before you fly her. There are some <hi>Goshawks</hi> (but very few) which will not fly when they are in good plight: then must you bate their flesh, and pinch them with scouring, washt meat, and the like. But the best way of flying such an one is when she is lusty and high: and to adde to her vivacity and courage, let her be set abroad in the morning an hour or two, when the weather is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cold; for being so weather'd, when she hath flown a Partridge to the Mark, she will not away until it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved by the Spaniels.</p>

                        <p>First, make her to the Fist, as is prescribed in her making to the Field: then carry her into the field without Bells, and with a live Duck, which you must give to one of the company, who must hide himself in some Ditch or Pit with the Duck tied to a Creance: then must you draw near him with your <hi>Hawk</hi> unhood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on your Fist, and giving him some private notice to throw out the Duck, cast off your <hi>Hawk;</hi> and if she take it at the Source, let him reward and feed her with a reasonable Gorge: then take her upon your Fist and hood her, permitting her to tire and plume upon the Leg or Wing of the Duck.

                        <p>Having flown with a <hi>Goshawk, Tiercel, Soar,</hi> or <hi>Haggard</hi> till <hi>March,</hi> give her some good Quarry in her Foot, and having seen her clean from Lice, cut off the Buttons of her Jesses, and throw her into the Mew; which Room should be on the ground, and scituated towards the North, if possible.</p>
                        <p>Let the Pearches therein be lined with Canvas or Cotton; for otherwise by hurting her Foot she may get the Gout or Pynn.</p>
                        <p>Let the Mew have also a Window towards the East, and another Northward. There must be also a Bason of Water in the Mew for bathing, which must be shifted every three days.

                        <p>About the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> if you find your <hi>Goshawk</hi> fair mew'd and hard penn'd, then give her Chickens, Lambs-hearts, or Calves-hearts, for about twenty days together, to scour her, and make her slise out the slimy substance and glitt out of her Pannel, and enseam her.</p>
                        <p>Having done thus, some Evening draw her out of the Mew, and new furnish her with Jesses, Bells, Bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and all other things needful for her: then keep her seel'd two or three days, till she will endure the Hood patiently; for mewed Hawks are as impatient of the Hood as those newly taken.</p>

                        <p>When you find your <hi>Goshawk</hi> feed eagerly, and that you think in your judgement she is enseamed, and that you may boldly fly with her, then go with her into the Field; she will then bate, (if empty) and fly of her own accord: if she kill, feed and reward her; but if she fly to the mark with a Partridge, then must you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it, and serve her as afore declared.</p>

                        <p>For in a manner the major part of a Faulconer's skill consists in coying and kind usage of his <hi>Hawk,</hi> so cherishing her that she may take delight in her Flight.</p>
                        <p>At the first entring of his <hi>Hawk</hi> he ought always to have a Train-Partridge in his Bag, to serve her with when need requires, to purchase her love: and let him take such observations which may keep his <hi>Hawk</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in good order. As first, he must know naturally all <hi>Goshawks</hi> are full of moist humours, especially in the Head, and therefore let him ply them with Tiring and Pluming morning and evening; for that will open them in the Head, and make them cast water thereat. Let the <hi>Goshawk's</hi> tiring be a Rum of Beef, a Pinion or the Leg of a Chicken, given by the fire, or in the warm Sun: this not onely opens her Head, but keeps her from slothfulness in good exercise.</p>

                        <p>Give her every night Casting of Feathers or Cotton, and in the morning mark whether it be wrought round or not, whether sweet or not, whether moist or dry, and of what colour the water is that drops out of the Casting: by these means he shall know what condition his <hi>Hawk</hi> is in.</p>
                        <p>He also ought to regard her Mewts, to see whether they be clean or not, and give remedies accordingly. He ought also to consider the season; for in cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he must set his <hi>Hawk</hi> in some warm place where fire is made; he must line the Pearch with Canvas or Cotton, and must set it so far from the Wall that the <hi>Hawk</hi> hurt not her Feathers when she bateth. If the weather be temperate, he may then set her in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine for an hour or two in the morning.</p>
                        <p>Let no Hens or Poultry come near the place where your <hi>Hawk</hi> doth Pearch; and in the Spring offer her water every week, or else she will soar away from you when she flieth, and you may go look her.</p>
                        <p>If your <hi>Hawk</hi> bathe her self spontaneously in cold weather after her flight, go presently to the next house and weather her with her Back to the fire, and not her Gorge, for that will make her sick: and dry your <hi>Hawk</hi> if you have carried her in the Rain.</p>
                        <p>A good Faulconer will always keep his <hi>Hawk</hi> high and lusty, yet so that she may be always in a condition to fly best.</p>
                        <p>Also he must keep his <hi>Hawk</hi> clean, and her Feathers whole: and if a Feather be broken or bruised, he must presently imp it; and to that end he must have his Imping-needles, his Semond, with other Instruments always in readiness.</p>
                        <p>The first year it is most requisite to fly your <hi>Goshawk</hi> to the Field, and not to the Covert; for so they will learn to hold out, and not turn tail in the midst of their slight: and when they are mewed <hi>Hawks,</hi> you
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100171:123"/>
may make them do what you will: and it is better to let her be a little rammage than to be overman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                        <p>Her feeding is best on hot meats: and if you would instruct her to kill great Fowl, make her Trains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and if you would have her continue those Flights, never fly her at less, for that will take her off from them and spoil her. If you will make her to fly with a Dog to assist her, then feed your <hi>Hawk</hi> with great Fowl, and your Dogs with flesh tied under their Wings. If you train your <hi>Hawk</hi> with them, rewarding her upon the Train, and your Dog with her, this will make them acquainted together.</p>
                        <p>Thus continue doing till your Dog throughly knows his duty: and be sure to keep your Dog tied up; for if you let him go loose, it will spoil the best Dog that is: and never give him a reward, but when he maketh in at such Fowls to rescue the <hi>Hawk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Call your <hi>Goshawk</hi> to no other thing than your Fist, and oftentimes spurt good wine on your <hi>Goshawks</hi> Sears: And note, that in all her Distempers sweet things are best to be administred in her Medicines.</p>

                        <p>THe last <hi>Hawk</hi> which we shall treat of, is the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-hawk;</hi> of which there are several kinds, and of different Plumes.</p>
                        <p>For the kinds, there is the <hi>Sclavonian, Calabrian, Corsican, German, Vicentian,</hi> and <hi>Veronian, Alpisan, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bean,</hi> and <hi>Bergamascan,</hi> in the black Vale near the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Valtolina.</hi> It is needless to give you a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of them.</p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:100171:124"/>
                        <p>Their Plumes are different: some are small plumed and blank <hi>Hawks,</hi> others of a larger Feather, some plumed like the Quail, some brown or Canvas-mail'd, and others have just thirteen Feathers in their Train, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To be short, this Character I mav justly give the <hi>Sparrow-hawk</hi> in general, that she is in her kind, and for that Game her strength will give her leave to kill, a very good <hi>Hawk.</hi> Besides, he that knows how to man, reclaim, and fly with a <hi>Sparrow-hawk,</hi> may easily know how to keep and deal with all other <hi>Hawks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And herein lieth an excellency in the <hi>Sparrow-hawk,</hi> she serves both for Winter and Summer with great pleasure, and will fly at all kind of Game more than the Faulcon.

                        <head>How to make a <hi>Sparrow-hawk,</hi> whether Eyess, Brancher, Soar, Mew'd, or Haggard.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sparrow-hawks</hi> are to be considered as all other kinds of <hi>Hawks</hi> are, according to their age and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
                        <p>The several kinds of <hi>Sparrow-hawks</hi> may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under these five heads; the <hi>Eyesses</hi> or <hi>Nyesses, Branchers, Soars, Mew'd,</hi> and <hi>Haggards.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Eyesses,</hi> are mewed in the Wood, and are taken in the Eyrie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Branchers,</hi> are those which have forsaken the Eyrie, and are fed near it by the old ones on Boughs and Branches.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Soar-hawks,</hi> are so called, because, having forsaken
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100171:124"/>
the Eyrie, and beginning to prey for themselves, they soar up alost for pleasure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mew'd Hawks,</hi> are such which have once or more shifted the Feather.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, <hi>Haggards,</hi> are they which prey for themselves, and do also mew in the Wood or at large.</p>
                        <p>This division of kindes is not peculiar to the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-Hawk,</hi> but common to all: give me leave to run them over in order as I have set them down.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Eyress</hi> or <hi>Nyess,</hi> (which is of greatest difficulty to bring to any perfection) you must first feed her in some cool Room which hath two Windows, the one to the North, and the other to the East, which must be open, and barred over with Laths, not so wide for a <hi>Hawk</hi> to get out, or Vermin to come in: strow the Chamber with fresh Leaves, and do in every respect to this Room as I have ordered in a former Chapter for the Mewing the Faulcon.</p>
                        <p>You must feed your <hi>Eyess</hi> with Sparrows, young Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and Sheeps-hearts. Whilst she is very young and little you should cut her meat, or shred it into small pellets, and feed her twice or thrice a day, according as you find her endew it or put it over.</p>
                        <p>When she is full summed and flieth about, then give her whole small Birds, and sometimes feed her on your Fist, suffering her to strain and kill the Birds in your hand; and sometimes put live Birds into the Chamber where she is, that she may learn to know to foot and to kill them; and let her feed upon them in your presence: by this course you will not onely neul her, but take her off from that scurvy quality of hiding her Prey when she hath seized it, a natural property belonging to all Eyesses. Likewise every morning go into the Room, call her to your Fist, whistle and use such terms as you would have her hereafter acquainted with. When she hath put forth all her Feathers and is full
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100171:125"/>
summed, then take her out of the Chamber, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish her with Bells, Bewets, Jesses, and Lines.</p>
                        <p>It will be altogether requisite to seel her at first, that she may the better endure the Hood and handling: and let it be a Rufter-hood that is large and easie, which you must pull off and put on fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, stroaking her often on the head, till she will stand gently.</p>
                        <p>In the Evening by Gandle-light unseel her, giving her somewhat to tire upon, handling and stroaking her Feathers gently, hooding and unhooding her as often as you think fit.</p>
                        <p>Before I proceed any farther, I shall inform you how to Seela <hi>Hawk</hi> after the best manner. Take a Needle threaded with untwisted Thread, and casting your <hi>Hawk</hi> take her by the Beak, and put the Needle through her Eye-lid, not right against the sight of the Eye, but somewhat nearer the Beak, that she may have liberty to see backward; and have especial care that you hurt not the Web: then put your Needle through the other Eye-lid, drawing the ends of the Thread together, tie them over the Beak, not with a straight knot, but cut off the Threads near to the end of the knot, and so twist them together, that the Eye-lids may be raised so upwards that the <hi>Hawk</hi> may not see at all, but as the Thread shall slacken, she shall be able to see backwards only, which is the cause that the Thread is put nearer the Beak.</p>
                        <p>When your <hi>Eyess</hi> is well won to the Hood, and to the Fist, let her kill small birds thereon; then call her two or three days or longer, till she will come far off; then take a live Pidgeon tied by the Foot with a Creance, and stir it till your <hi>Hawk</hi> will bate at it and seize it, but not far off that you may quickly help her at the first, lest the Pidgeon struggling with her she prove too strong, and so discourage your young <hi>Hawk:</hi>
                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100171:125"/>
then let her plume and foot her, and feed her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, whistling the while, that she may know it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time: then hood her, and let her plume and tire a little.</p>
                        <p>You may use her to Trains of Chicken and Quail: and when she will seize readily by often Training, ride out with her in the morning into the Fields, where calling your <hi>Sparrow-hawk</hi> to your Fist, and giving her a bit or two, go with your Spaniels to seek some Beavy of young Quails, advancing your Fist aloft, that your <hi>Hawk</hi> may see them when they spring, flying her at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: if she kill reward her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if she miss, serve her with the Train of a Quail.</p>
                        <p>Let your Dogs hunt on your right hand when they range, but especially when they quest and call, to the end you may the better cast off your <hi>Hawk.</hi> When your <hi>Hawk</hi> is throughly entred and well nouzled, you may then hold your hand low, for she will now bate at the Whur: but whatsoever you do, have a quick eye and a good regard to the Spaniels, not coveting to be too near them, but a little above them, that you may let your <hi>Hawk</hi> fly coasting at the advantage when the Game springeth.</p>

                           <pb n="78" facs="tcp:100171:126"/>
because they have been accustomed to prey for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p>Above all things, the Faulconer must take them off from their ill custom of carrying, and that may be done by serving them with great Trains, whereby they will learn to abide on the Quarry.</p>
                        <p>Be very mindful of coying them as much as you can, for they will remember a kindness or injury better than any other <hi>Hawk.</hi>

                        <p>If the <hi>Hawk</hi> be newly taken, and will not feed, then rub her Feet with warm flesh, whistling to her, and sometimes putting the flesh unto her Beak: if she will not yet feed, rub her Feet with a live Bird; if at the crying of the Bird the <hi>Hawk</hi> seizeth it with her Feet, it is a signe she will feed; then tear off the Skin and Feathers of the Bird's Breast, and put the Bird to her Beak, and she will eat.</p>
                        <p>When she will feed upon your whistle and chirp, then hood her with a Rufter-hood, and feed her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning; and when she hath endewed, give her a Beaching in the day-time, and every time you hood her, give her a bit or two; at evening give her the Brains of a Hen for her supper: and in every thing else order these <hi>Hawks</hi> aforesaid, as you do the Faulcon and the rest.</p>

                        <p>If you will have your <hi>Sparrow-hawk</hi> to fly at Quail, Partridge, or Pheasant-powt, then you must draw her in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and bear her on the Fist till she be clean and throughly enseamed.</p>

                        <p>Others keep their <hi>Sparrow-hawks</hi> on the Pearch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>March,</hi> and then throw them into the Mew, peper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for Lice, if they have any. Her Mew should be a Chamber alost from the ground, eight or nine foot long, and about six foot broad: her Windows and Pearches must be like the Goshawks.</p>
                        <p>Her Mew being thus provided, in <hi>May</hi> go in to her in an Evening by Candle-light, and taking her up soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pull out all her Train-feathers one after another: this shall make her mew the faster, especially if you feed her with hot meat and Birds, observing a certain hour to feed her in.</p>
                        <p>Once in fourteen days set water before her in the Mew: if you perceive she hath any Feathers or Down which stand staring upon her Back, sitting as if she would rouze, then set her water sooner. If you put water by her continually, it delays her Mewing; and to keep it always from her, causeth her to mew her Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers uncleanly: but water once in a fortnight is the best Medium for her Mewing between those two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.</p>

                        <p>A Faulconer ought to consult and consider the quality and mettle of his <hi>Hawks,</hi> and to know which of them he shall fly with early, and with which late.</p>
                        <p>He must be fond of his <hi>Hawk,</hi> patient, and cleanly in keeping her from Lice, Mites, and the like Vermin. He must rather keep his <hi>Hawks</hi> high and full of flesh, than poor and low, which makes them more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to infirmities than when they are in very good plight.</p>
                        <p>Every night after flying, he must give his <hi>Hawk</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, sometimes Plumage, sometimes Pellets of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and sometimes Physick, as he shall find her disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by her Casting or Mewt.</p>
                        <p>Every night he must make the place very clean un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Pearch, that he may know by her Casting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Hawk</hi> stands in need of Scourings upwards or downwards.</p>
                        <p>Let him remember every Evening to weather his <hi>Hawk,</hi> excepting such days wherein she hath bathed; after which, in the Evening she should be put into a warm Room on a Pearch with a Candle burning by her, where she must sit unhooded, if she be not ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to the intent she prune and pick her self, and rejoyce by enoiling her self after bathing: and in the morning he ought to weather her, and let her cast, if the hath not done it already, keeping her still hooded till he carry her to the field.</p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:100171:127"/>
                        <p>In feeding his <hi>Hawk</hi> he must have a care of feeding her with two sorts of meat at one time; and what he giveth her must be very sweet.</p>
                        <p>If he have an occasion to go abroad, let him have a care that he pearch not his <hi>Hawk</hi> too high from the ground, for fear of bating and hanging by the Heels, whereby she may spoil herself.</p>
                        <p>He ought to carry to the Field with him Mummy in powder, with other Medicines; for frequently the <hi>Hawk</hi> meets with many accidents, as bruises at encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither must he forget to carry with him any of his necessary Hawking-implements.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, he must be able to make his Lures, Hoods of all sorts, Jesses, Bewets, and other needful Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his <hi>Hawk:</hi> neither must he be without his Coping-Irons to cope his <hi>Hawk's</hi> Beak, if it be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown, and to cope her Pounces and Talons, as need shall require: neither must he be without his Cauteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing-Irons.</p>
                        <p>Let these Instructions suffice, I being willing to leave the rest to the care and observation of the ingenious Faulconer.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100171:128"/>
befalling <hi>Hawks,</hi> both in their Fights and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</p>
                        <p>Before we shall characterize their Maladies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe Rules for their Cures, it will not be irrequisite to tell you that <hi>Hawks,</hi> as well as men, (which seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what strange) have four Complexions, the true indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators of their natures: and as in man his natural Complection and Constitution is known by his Skin, so is the Temperament and natural Disposition of a <hi>Hawk</hi> by her Coat and Plume. This opinion hath not been onely averr'd by the Ancients, but confirmed by the modern experience of the Skilful in the noble Art of Hawking. Take it in this manner.</p>

                        <head>Of <hi>Castings,</hi> and <hi>Mewtings,</hi> either good or bad according to their several Complexions and Smells.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Castings</hi> are of two sorts, <hi>Plumage,</hi> or <hi>Cotton:</hi> the latter is most commonly given in Pellets, which must be about the bigness of an Hazie-nut, made of fine soft
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100171:128"/>
white Cotton: after she hath supp'd you must convey this into her Gorge.</p>
                        <p>In the morning diligently observe how she hath rolled and cast it, whereby you shall know whether she be in a bad or good condition: for example, if she cast it round, white, not stinking, nor very moist or waterish, you may conclude her sound; but if she roll it not well, but cast it long, with properties contrary to the former, then she is unfound and full of Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                        <p>Besides, if her Casting be either black green, yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, slimy, or stinking, it denotes your <hi>Hawk</hi> to be diseased. The former Casting is remedied by hot meats; the latter by feeding her well, and washing her meats in cool water, as of Endive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and give her one or two Castings of Cotton, incorporating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Incense and Mummy. But if she continue not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in this condition, give her an upward Scowring made thus: Take Aloes pulverized one scruple, powder of Clove four grains, powder of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebs three grains; incorporate these, and wrap them in Cotton, and give it your <hi>Hawk</hi> empty, having no meat in her Pannel.</p>
                        <p>Casting of <hi>Plumage</hi> is to be observed as the former Casting: that is, if in the morning you find them round and not stinking, it is a good signe; but if long, slimy, with indigested flesh sticking to the same, and having an ill scent, it is very bad. Here note, that by how much the more sweet or stinking the Casting is, by so much is the <hi>Hawk</hi> in a better or worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mewts</hi> must be observed as well as Castings, in this manner: If the Mewt be white, not very thick nor clear, having no black spot in it, or but very little, it is a signe of the healthy constitution of the <hi>Hawk;</hi> but if it be white and very thick in the middle, though it
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100171:129"/>
doth not import sickness, yet it sheweth her to be too gross and over-full of Grease; which you must remedy by giving her moist meats, as the Heart of a Calf or Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for two mornings after give her some Sugar-candy, or else the Gut of a Chicken well washt and fill'd with Oyl-Olive: either of these will scour her, and make her to slise freely.</p>
                        <p>It is a very bad and mortal signe, to see your <hi>Hawk's</hi> Mewt full of variety of colours: therefore you must speedily prevent ensuing mischiefs by giving her Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my purified and beaten to powder, wrapping it in Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
                        <p>If the Mewt be more yellow then white, then doth she abound with Choler proceeding from great Flights in hot weather, also from much Bating. This is reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died by washing her meat in Bugloss, Endive, Borage, and such-like cold Waters, wringing the said meat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have so washed it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>black</hi> Mewt is a most deadly signe, and if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue four days she will peck over the Pearch and die. If she mewt so but once, there is no great danger, for it proceeds either from the Blood or Guts of the Fowl in tiring, or else-from being gorged with filthy meats: in this case give her good warm meat and Cotton-casting, with the powder of Gloves, Nutmeg, and Ginger, or Mummy alone.</p>
                        <p>If the Mewt be <hi>green,</hi> it is a bad signe, and denotes her troubled with an infected and corrupt Liver, or with some Apostume, unless she be a Rammage-<hi>Hawk,</hi> and then that signe holds not good. Her cure is, by feeding her with meat powdered with Mummy; if she will not take it with her Food, then give it her in a Scowring or Casting: but if this ill-colour'd Mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting continue still, then give her a Scowring of Agarick, and after that another of Incense pulverized to comfort her.</p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:100171:129"/>
                        <p>The dark <hi>sanguine</hi> Mewt with a black in it is the most deadly signe of all, and differs but little, if any thing, from the former black Mewt. A <hi>Hawk</hi> mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after this manner is irrecoverable, and therefore it is needless to prescribe a Cure.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the <hi>gray</hi> Mewt like sour Milk, is a mortal token, yet curable, as shall be shewn hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Thus you see how requisite it is for a Faulconer to observe diligently every morning his <hi>Hawk's</hi> Castings and Mewtings, that knowing thereby their Maladies, he may timely finde out their Remedies. Let us now proceed to their particular Diseases.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Cataract</hi> in the Eyes of a <hi>Hawk,</hi> is a malady not easily removed, and sometimes incurable, when it is too thick and of a long continuance.</p>
                        <p>It proceedeth from gross Humours in the Head, which frequently do not onely dim, but extinguish the sight: and sometimes the Hood is the cause of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                        <p>The cure must be effected by Scowring her two or three days with Aloes or Agarick: then take the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of washt Aloes finely beaten one scruple, and two scruples of Sugar-candy; mingle these together, and with a Quill blow it into your <hi>Hawk's</hi> Eye afflicted as aforesaid three or four times a day. This is the gentlest and most Soveraign Medicine of any yet I have tried. But if this will not do, you must use stronger Medicines, as the juice of Celandine-roots, bathing their eyes often with warm Rose-water wherein hath been boil'd the seeds of Fenugreek.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>The <hi>Pantas</hi> is a dangerous Distemper, and few <hi>Hawks</hi> escape which are afflicted therewith. It happens when the Lungs are as it were so baked by excessive heat, that the <hi>Hawk</hi> cannot draw her breath, and when drawn, cannot well emit it again. You may judge of the beginning of this Distemper by the <hi>Hawk's</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring much in the Pannel, moving her Train of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up and down at each motion of her Pannel; and she cannot many times mewt or slise; or if she do, she drops it fast by her. It is known likewise by your <hi>Hawk's</hi> frequent opening her Clap and Beak.</p>
                        <p>The best Remedy is, to scour your <hi>Hawk</hi> with good Oyl-Olive well washed in several Waters till it become clear and white, which you must do after this manner: Take an earthen Pot with a small hole in the bottom thereof, which you must stop with your Finger; then pour therein your Oyl with a quantity of Water, and coil these together with a Spoon till the Water grow darkish; after which remove your Finger, and the Water will run out, but the Oyl remain behind floating on the top; thus do seven or eight times, till you have throughly purified the Oyl: Then take a Sheep's Gut above an Inch long for a Faulcon and Goshawk, but of less length for lesser <hi>Hawks,</hi> and fill it with this Oyl, and fasten it with Thread at both ends. Your <hi>Hawk</hi> having first cast, convey this Gut into her Throat, holding her on the Fist till she make a Mewt; an hour after she hath done mewting feed her with a Calf's Heart or a Pullet's Leg, giving her every third or fourth day a Cotton casting with Cubebs and Cloves. I shall onely adde one Receipt more for the <hi>Pantas</hi> or <hi>Asthma,</hi> and that is the Oyl of sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds poured into a washt Chicken's Gut, and given

                        <p>There are a sort of Worms an Inch long, which frequently afflict <hi>Hawks,</hi> proceeding from gross and viscous Humours in the Bowels, occasioned through want of natural heat and ill digestion.</p>
                        <p>You may know when she is troubled with them by her casting her Gorge, her stinking Breath, her trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and writhing her Train, her croaking in the night, her offering with her Beak at her Breast or Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and by her Mewt being small and unclean.</p>
                        <p>You may cure her of them with a Scowring of washt Aloes, Hepatick, Mustard-seed, and Agarick, of each an equal quantity; or the powder of Harts-horn dried; or lastly, a Scowring of white Dittander, Aloes, Hepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick washt four or five times, Cubebs, and a little Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron wrapt in some flesh, to cause her to take it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                        <p>There are several sorts of <hi>Filanders,</hi> but I shall speak but of one sticking to the Reins. They are Worms as small as a Thread, and about an Inch long, and lie wrapt up in a thin Skin or Net near the Reins of a <hi>Hawk,</hi> apart from either Gut or Gorge.</p>
                        <p>You shall know when your <hi>Hawk</hi> is troubled with them, by her poverty, by ruffling her Train, by strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fist or Pearch with her Pounces, and lastly, by croaking in the night when the Filanders prick her. You must remedy this Malady betimes, before these Worms have enlarged themselves from their proper station, roving elsewhere to your <hi>Hawk's</hi> ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>

                        <p>You must not kill them as other Worms, for fear of Impostumes from their corruption, being incapable to pass away with the <hi>Hawk's</hi> Mewt; but onely stupifie them, that they may be offensive but seldom; and that is done thus: Take a head of Garlick, taking away the outmost rinde; then with a Bodkin heated in the fire, make holes in some Cloves, then steep them in Oyl three days, and after this give her one of the Cloves down her Throat, and for forty days after she will not be troubled with the Filanders. Wherefore a Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will shew himself prudent, if, seeing his <hi>Hawk</hi> low and poor, he give her once a month a Clove of this Garlick for prevention of the Filanders.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100171:131"/>
her Back and Train against the Sun; then hold in your hand a small Stick about a handful long, with a piece of soft Wax at the end of it, and with that (whilst the <hi>Hawk</hi> is weathering her self) take away those Vermin crawling upon the Feathers.

                        <p>In the first place, never give them a great Gorge, especially of gross meats, as Beef, Pork, and such as are hard to be endewed and put over.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, never feed them with the flesh of any Beast that hath lately gone to Rut; for that will insensibly destroy them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if you are constrained to give your <hi>Hawk</hi> gross food, let it be well soaked first in clean Water, and afterwards sufficiently wrung; in Summer with cold Water, in Winter with luke-warm Water.</p>

                        <p>Ever observe to reward your <hi>Hawks</hi> with some good live meat, or else they will be brought too low: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the serving them with washt meats is the way to keep them in health.</p>
                        <p>I shall conclude how to keep <hi>Hawks</hi> in perfect health with this most excellent Receipt. Take Germander, Pelamountain, Basil, Grummel-seed, and Broom-flowers, of each half an ounce; Hyssop, Sassifras, Polypodium, and Horse-mints, of each a quarter of an ounce, and the like of Nutmegs; Cubebs, Borage, Mummy, Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Sage, and the four kinds of Mirobolans, of each half an ounce; of Aloes Succotrine the fifth part of an ounce, and of Saffron one whole ounce. All these you must pulverize, and every eighth or twelfth day give your <hi>Hawks</hi> the quantity of a Bean thereof with their meat. If they will not take it so, put it into a Hens Gut tied at both ends, and let him stand empty an hour after.</p>

                        <p>You may perceive it by this; the Beak will grow rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and it will begin to separate from the Head.</p>
                        <p>To remedy this Malady, you must take the Gall of a Bull, and break it into a Dish, and adde thereto the powder of Aloes-Succatrine: mingle these well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and anoint the Clap or Beak of your <hi>Hawk</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and the very place where the <hi>Formica</hi> grows, twice a day; but touch not her Eyes or Nares: continue thus doing till your <hi>Hawk</hi> be perfectly cured, and bathe her with Orpiment and Pepper to keep her from other Vermin.</p>

                        <p>This happens either by being foul within, or by a Surfeit; or else when she was low and poor her Keeper over-gorged her, by being too hasty to set her up, and she being weak was not able to put over and endew, and surfeited thereupon.</p>
                        <p>The Cure whereof is this: You must feed her with light meats, and a little at once, as with young Rats and

                        <head>How to scour <hi>Hawks</hi> before you cast them into the Mew.</head>
                        <p>When Mewing-time is come, you must scour and cleanse your Hawks; for in luring and flying-time by foul feeding they ingender Filanders and other Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, whereof they die for want of timely care and cure.</p>
                        <p>When you set down your Hawk use the same as you find Page 246, which will not only kill the Worm, but scour a Hawk also.</p>
                        <p>The best way is, (when you mean to cast a Hawk into the Mew) first to scour her well according to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer directions, to cope her, and set her up well in flesh, to discharge her as near as you can of all Diseases, also to free her from Mites and Lice, to set her Water, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to feed her with young Rats, Mice, Dogs-flesh, Pigeons, Rabbets, and now and then with some liquid thing and meats laxative.</p>
                        <p>Take notice of this special Observation: A Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is not to be cast in loose to the Mew, but is to be mewed on the Fist; for otherwise she will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too coy and strange: and if she fall to bating
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100171:135"/>
and beating her self for heat, then must you hood her up, or bespout her with cold water, which is the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to make her leave Bating.</p>
                        <p>You must continue her on the Fist till she begin to shed her Feathers; then set her down, and tie her to a Stone or Pearch, as you do the rest; and after she hath mewed and comes to fly, then let her stand on a Block or Billet cased or rolled. In the same manner mew Goshawks, Tierces, and Sparrow-hawks; onely they will not be born on the Fist, but be at liberty in the Mew, and very cleanly served.</p>
                        <p>Fifteen or twenty days before you draw your Hawk out of the Mew, you must begin to abate her of her diet, the sooner and better to enseam her. And forget not to feed her with washed meat, which will prevent many dangers that may follow.</p>
                        <p>Many more Diseases there are incident, and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happening to Hawks, of which with their Cures there are large Discourses written in <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> and therefore I thought fit to insert in this place no other Maladies than what most usually occur: If you desire to be further satisfied, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to those larger and (it may be) less useful Volumes.</p>

                        <hi>OF FOWLING: OR,</hi> The compleat Art and Secrets of <hi>Fowling,</hi> either by Water or by Land, according to ancient and modern Experience.</head>
                     <p>What <hi>Fowling</hi> is; with the nature and diversity of all manner of <hi>Fowl.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>FOWLING is used two manner of ways: either by Enchantment, or Enticement; by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or wooing the Fowl unto you by Pipe, Whistle, or Call; or else by Engine, which unawares surprizeth them.</p>
                     <p>Fowl are of divers sorts, which alter in their nature as their Feathers; but by reason of their multiplicity, I shall for brevity-sake distinguish them onely into two kinds, Land and Water-Fowl.</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:100171:139"/>
                     <p>The Water-fowl are so called from the natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light they still take in and about the Water, gathering from thence all their food and nutriment.</p>
                     <p>Here note, that Water-fowl are in their own nature the subtilest and wisest of Birds, and most careful of their own safety: Hence they have been formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an orderly and well-governed Camp, having Scouts on land afax off, Courts of Guards, Sentinels, and all-sorts of other watchful Officers surrounding the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to give an alarm on any approach of seeming dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>For in your observation you may take notice, that there will be ever some straggling Fowl, which lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof from the greater number, which still call first. Now it is the nature of Water-fowl to fly in great Flocks, having always a regard to the general safety; so that if you see a single Fowl, or a couple fly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you may imagine they have been somewhere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted from the rest by some sudden amazement or apprehension of danger: but so naturally are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to society, that they seldom leave wing till they meet together again. And this is occasioned not only by the near approach of men, but also by the beating of Haggards on the Rivers, as also by the appearance of the very bold <hi>Buzzard</hi> and <hi>Ring-tail.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of Water-fowl there are two sorts; such as live of the water, and such as live on the water: the one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their sustenance from the water without swimming thereon, but wading and diving for it with their long Legs: The other are Web-footed and swim, as the <hi>Swan, Goose, Mallard,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:100171:139"/>
                        <head>Of the Haunts of Fowl.</head>
                        <p>THe thing of greatest moment for the Fowler to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, is the Haunts of Fowl. In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you are to understand, that all sorts of greater Fowl, <hi>viz.</hi> those who divide the foot, have their resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by the edge of Rivers that are shallow, Brooks, and Plashes of water: and these appear not in Flocks, but you shall see here one single, there a couple, and the like; which makes them difficult to be taken by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or Device; but they are the best flights for <hi>Hawks</hi> that can be imagined.</p>
                        <p>Likewise these Fowl delight in low and boggy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the more sedgie, marish and rotten such grounds are, the fitter they are for the haunting of these Fowl.</p>
                        <p>They love also the dry parts of drowned Fens, which are overgrown with tall and long Rushes, Reeds, and Sedges.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, they delight in half-drowned Moors, or the hollow vales of Downs, Heaths, or Plains, where there is shelter either of Hedges, Hills, Tufts of Bushes or Trees, where they may lurk obscurely.</p>
                        <p>Now the lesser Fowl, which are Web-footed, haunt continually drowned Fens, where they may have continually plenty of Water, and may swim un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed by man or beast: Their haunt is likewise in the main Streams of Rivers, where the Current is swiftest and least subject to freez; and the broader and deeper such Rivers are, the greater delight these Fowl take therein, the <hi>Wild-goose</hi> and <hi>Barnacle</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, who abide no Waters above their sounding; for when they cannot reach the Ouze, they instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remove thence, seeking out more shallow places.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100171:140"/>
These two last named are infinitely delighted with green Winter-corn, and therefore you shall see them evermore where such Grain is sown, especially if the ends of the Lands have much water about them.</p>
                        <p>Likewise these smaller Fowl do very much frequent small Brooks, Rivers, Ponds, drowned Meadows, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, Moors, Plashes, Meres, Loughs and Lakes, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if well stored with Islands unfrequented, and well furnished with Shrubs, Bushes, Reeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then they will breed there, and frequent such places both Summer and Winter.</p>

                        <head>The readiest way of taking great Fowl with <hi>NETS.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe first thing you are to consider, is the making of your Nets, which must be of the best Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread, with great and large Meshes, at least two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from point to point: for the larger the Meshes are, (so that the Fowl cannot creep through them) the better it is; for they more certainly intangle them.</p>
                        <p>Let not your Nets be above two fathom deep, and six in length, which is the greatest proportion that a man is able to overthrow. Verge your Net on each side with very strong Cord, and extend it at each end upon long Poles made for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>Having thus your Nets in readiness, let the Fowler observe the haunts of Fowl, that is to say, their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening feedings, coming at least two hours before those seasons; then spreading his Net smooth and flat upon the ground, staking the two lower ends firm thereon, let the upper ends stand extended upon the long Cord, the farther end thereof being staked
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100171:140"/>
fast down to the Earth two or three fathom from the Net; and let the stake which staketh down the Cord stand in a direct and even line with the lower Verge of the Net, the distance still observed: then the other end of the Cord, which must be at least ten or twelve fathom long, the Fowler shall hold in his hand at the uttermost distance aforesaid, where he shall make some artificial shelter either of Grass, Sods, Earth, or such like matter, whereby he may lie out of the sight of the Fowl.</p>
                        <p>Observe to let the Net lie so ready for the Game, that upon the least pull it may rise from the Earth and fly over.</p>
                        <p>Strew over all your Net, as it lies upon the ground, some Grass, that you may hide it from the Fowl. It will not be amiss (but altogether requisite) to stake down near your Net a live <hi>Hern,</hi> or some other Fowl formerly taken, for a <hi>Stale.</hi> When you observe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Fowl come within the verge of your Net, then draw your Cord suddenly, and so cast the Net over them: Continue thus doing till the Sun be near an hour high, and no longer; for then their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is over for that time; and so do at Evening from about Sun-set till Twilight. By this means you may not only take great quantities of larger Wild-fowl, but also <hi>Plover,</hi> which takes his food as much from Land as Water.</p>

                        <head>How to take small Water-fowl with Nets.</head>
                        <p>LEt your Nets be made of the smallest and strongest packthread, and the Meshes nothing near so big as those for the greater Fowl, about two foot and a half or three foot deep; line these Nets on both sides with false Nets, every Mesh being about a foot and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100171:141"/>
a half square each way, that as the Fowl striketh ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through them or against them, so the smaller Net may pass through the great Meshes, and so streighten and entangle the Fowl.</p>
                        <p>These Nets you must pitch for the Evening-flight of Fowl before Sun-set, staking them down on each side of the River about half a foot within the water, the lower side of the Net being so plumb'd that it may sink so far and no farther: Let the upper side of the Net be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced slantwise, shoaling against the water, yet not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the water by near two foot; and let the strings which support this upper side of the Net be fastned to small yielding Sticks prickt in the Bank, which as the Fowl strikes may give liberty to the Net to run and entangle them. Thus place several of these Nets over divers parts of the River, about twelvescore one from another, or as the River or Brook shall give leave; and be confident, if any Fowl come on the River that night, you shall have your share.</p>
                        <p>And that you may the sooner obtain your desire, take your Gun and go to all the Fens and Plashes that are a good distance from your Nets, and fire it three or four times; which will so affright the Fowl, that they will instantly post to the Rivers; then plant your Nets upon these Fens and Plashes.</p>
                        <p>In the Morning go first to the River and see what Fowl are there surprized; and having taken them up with your Nets, if you espy any Fowl on the River, discharge your Gun, which will make them fly to the Fens and Plashes, and then go and see what you have taken: Thus you shall be sure to be furnished with some, though there be never so few abroad.</p>

                        <head>How to take all manner of small Birds with Bird-Lime.</head>
                        <p>IN cold weather, that is to say, in Frost or Snow, all sorts of small Birds do congregate in Flocks, as <hi>Larks, Chaffinches, Lennets, Gold-finches, Yellowhammers, Buntings, Sparrows,</hi> &amp;c. all these but the <hi>Lark</hi> do perch on Trees or Bushes as well as feed on the ground: If you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they resort about your House or Fields adjacent, then use your Bird-lime that is well prepared, and not over old; order it after this manner: Take an Earthen dish and put the Bird-lime into it, and add thereunto some fresh Lard, or Capons-grease, putting an ounce of either to a quarter of a pound of Bird-lime: then set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it over the fire, let it melt gently together; but let it not boil by any means, for if you do, you will take away the strength of the Bird-lime, and so spoil it. Having thus prepared it, get a quantity of Wheat-ears, as many as you think you shall conveniently use, and cut the Straw about a foot long besides the Ears; then from the bottom of the Ears to the middle of the Straw lime it about six inches: the Lime must be warm when you lime the straw, that so it may run thin upon the straw, and therefore the less discernable, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not suspected by the Birds.</p>
                        <p>Having thus got your Lim'd-straws in this manner ready, go into the field adjacent to your house, and carry a bag of Chaff and thresht Ears, and scatter these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twenty yards wide, (it is best in a Snow) then take the Lim'd-ears and stick them up and down with the Ears leaning, or at the end touching the ground; then retire from the place, and traverse the grounds all round about; the Birds hereupon being disturbed in their other haunts fly hither, and pecking at the ears of Corn, finding that they stick unto them, they straightways mount up
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100171:142"/>
from the Earth, and in their flight the Bird-limb'd straws lap under their Wings, and falling are not able to disengage themselves from the Straw, and so are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly taken.</p>
                        <p>By the way take this caution; do not go and take up five or six you see entangled, for that may hinder you it may be from taking three or four dozen at one time. If they be <hi>Larks</hi> that fall where your Bird-lim'd Straws do lie, go not a near them till they spontaneous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rise of themselves, and flying in great Flocks; I can assure you I have caught five dozen at one lift.</p>
                        <p>You may lay some nearer home to take <hi>Finches, Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Yellowhammers,</hi> &amp;c. who resort near to Houses, and frequent Barn-doors, where you may easily take them after the same manner as aforesaid. The taking of <hi>Sparrows</hi> is a very great benefit to the Husbandman, for they are his and the Farmers principal Enemies, of all small Birds; insomuch as I dare assure them, that every dozen of <hi>Sparrows</hi> taken by them in the Winter, shall save them a quarter of Wheat before Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest be ended. In the taking of them, you may stick the top of your House if thatcht; and though you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the Birds, yet the destruction of them will be a great advantage. Before a Barn-door if you lay your Twigs, or Lim'd-straws, you may there take them with abundance of other small Birds. The <hi>Sparrow</hi> is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent food, and a great restorer of decayed Nature. You may also take them at roost in the Eaves of Thatcht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, by coming in the night with a Clap-net, and rubbing the Net against the hole where they are flying out, you clap the Net together, and forsake them: the darkest night with a Lanthorn and Candle is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est time to take them.</p>
                        <p>Having performed your Morning Birding-recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, go bait the same place where you were before, and bait it with fresh Chaff and Ears of Corn, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100171:142"/>
let them rest till next Morning; then take some fresh Wheat-ears again, and stick them as aforesaid: and when you bait in the Afternoon, take away all your Lim'd Ears, that so the Birds may feed boldly, and not be frighted or disturbed against next Morning.</p>

                        <head>How to take Great Fowl with <hi>LIME-TWIGS.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>YOu must supply your self with good store of Rods, which are long, small, and straight-grown Twigs, being light and apt to play to and fro.</p>
                        <p>Lime the upper-part of these Twigs, holding the Bird-lime before the fire, so that it may melt, for the better besmearing them.</p>
                        <p>Having first well acquainted your self where these Fowl do frequent Morning and Evening, you must then observe before Sun-set for the Evening-flight, and before day for the Morning, that you plant your Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigs where these Fowl haunt, pinning down for a Stale one of the same Fowl alive (which you have formerly taken for that purpose) which you intend to catch with your Bird-lime. Round about the Stale (giving the Fowl liberty to flutter to and fro) prick your Twigs in rows a foot distant one from the other, till you have covered all the place so haunted, that there shall be no room left, but that they must certainly fall foul with the Lime-twigs.</p>
                        <p>Prick the Rods sloaping with their heads bending into the Wind about a foot or somewhat more above ground: If you please (and I think it the best way) you may cross-prick your Rods, that is, one point in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wind, and another against the wind; by which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100171:143"/>
means you may take the Fowl which way soever they come.</p>
                        <p>Place also a Stale some distance from your Limetwigs, and fasten small strings to it, which upon the sight of any Fowl you must pull, then will your Stale flutter, which will allure them down.</p>
                        <p>If you see any taken, do not run instantly and take them up if you see any Fowl in the air; for by their fluttering others will be induced to swoop in among them. It will not be amiss to have a well-taught Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel with you for the retaking of such Fowl (as it is common) which will flutter away with the Limetwigs about them.</p>
                        <p>If you intend to use these Twigs for smaller Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl, and such as frequent the water only, then must you fit them in length according to the depth of the River; and your Lime must be very strong Water-lime, such as no wet or frost can injure. Prick these Rods in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as you did the others on the Land, as much of the Rod as is limed being above water; and here and there among your Rods you must stake down a live Stale, as a <hi>Mallard,</hi> a <hi>Widgeon</hi> or <hi>Teal:</hi> and thus you may do in any shallow Plash or Fen.</p>
                        <p>You need not wait continually on your Rods, but come thrice a day, and see what is taken, <hi>viz.</hi> early in the Morning, at high Noon, and late in the Evening; but come not unattended with your Water-spaniel: for if you perceive any of your Rods missing, you may conclude some Fowl are fastned to them which are crept into some Hole, Bush, or Sedge by the River side, and then will your Dog be very necessary for the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                        <p>Do not beat one Haunt too much, but when you find their numbers fail, remove and find out another, and in three weeks time your first will be as good as ever.</p>

                        <head>Of the great and lesser <hi>SPRINGES.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>HAving noted the Morning and Evening feeding of divided-footed-Fowl, observing the Furrows and Water-Tracts where they usually stalk and pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to find Worms, Float-Grass-roots, and the like; you must mark where many Furrows meet in one, and break out as it were into one narrow passage, which so descending, afterwards divides it self into other parts and branches; then mark how every Furrow breaketh and cometh into this Center or little Pit, which is most paddled with the Fowl, or which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest for Fowl to wade in: This being done, take small and short Sticks, and prick them cross-wise athwart over all the other passages, one Stick within half an Inch of the other, making as it were a kind of Fence to guard every way but one which you would have the Fowl to pass: if they stand but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than a handful above the Water, such is the nature of the Fowl that they will not press o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, but stray about till that they find the open way.</p>
                        <p>Having thus hemmed in all ways but one, take a stiff Stick cut flat on the one side, and prick both ends down into the Water, and make the upper part of the flat side of the stick to touch the water, and no more: then make a Bow of small Hazel or Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low made in the fashion of a Pear, broad and round at one end, and narrow at the other; at least a foot long, and five or six Inches broad, and at the narrow end make a small nick: then take a good stiff-grown plant of Hazel, clean without knot, three or four Inches about at the bottom, and an Inch at the top,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100171:144"/>
and having made the bottom-end sharp, at the top you must fasten a very strong Loop of about an hundred Horse-hairs plaited very fast together with strong Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread, and made so smooth that it will run and slip at pleasure: Let the Loop be of the just quantity of the hoop, made Pear-wise as aforesaid: then hard by this Loop you must fasten a little broad thin Tricker within an Inch and half of the end of the Plant, which must be made equally sharp at both ends: thrust the bigger sharp end of the Plant into the ground close by the edge of the water, the smaller-end with the Hoop and the 'Tricker must be brought down to the first Bridge, and then the Hoop made Pear-wise being laid on the Bridge, one end of the Tricker must be set upon the nick of the Hoop, and the other end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a nick made on the small end of the Plant, which by the violence and bend of the Plant shall make them stick and hold together until the Hoop be moved. This done, lay the Swickle on the Hoop in such fashion as the Hoop is proportioned; then from each side of the Hoop prick little Sticks, making an impaled path to the Hoop; and as you go farther and farther from the Hoop or Springe, so make the way wider and wider, that the Fowl may enter a good way before it shall perceive the Fence. By this means the Fowl will be enticed to wade up to the Springe, which shall be no sooner toucht, but that part of the Bird so touching will be instantly ensnared: And thus according to the strength of the Plant you shall take any Fowl of what bigness soever.</p>
                        <p>The Springe for lesser Fowl, as <hi>Woodcock, Snipe, Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> &amp;c. is made after the fashion aforesaid, only differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in strength according unto the bigness of the Birds you intend to catch.</p>
                        <p>The main plant or Sweeper you may make of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Osier, or any stick that will bend and return to its proper straightness.</p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:100171:144"/>
                        <p>This device is for the Winter only, when much wet is on the ground, and not when the Furrows are dry. Now if the waters be frozen, you must make plashes; and the harder the Frost, the greater resort will there be of these smaller Fowl.</p>

                           <hi>Of the</hi> FOWLING-PIECE <hi>and the</hi> STALKING-HORSE.</head>
                        <p>THat is ever esteemed the best Fowling-piece which hath the longest Barrel, being five foot and a half or six foot long, with an indifferent bore, under Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuss.</p>
                        <p>Provide the best sort of Powder as near as you can, and let it not be old, for keeping weakens it much, especially if it grow damp; therefore when you have occasion to use it, dry it well in a Fire-shovel, and sift it through a fine Searcher to take away that dust which hindreth the more forcible effects, and fouleth your piece.</p>
                        <p>Let your Shot be well sized, and of a moderate big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for if it be too great, then it scatters too much: if too small, it hath not weight nor strength sufficient to do execution on a large Fowl.</p>
                        <p>Shot being not to be had at all times, and in all places, suitable to your occasions and desires, I shall therefore here set down the true process of making all sorts and sizes under Mould-shot.</p>
                        <p>Take what quantity of Lead you please, and melt it down in an Iron Vessel, and as it melts keep it stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with an Iron-Ladle, and clear it of all impurities whatsoever that may arise at the top by skimming them off. Then when the Lead begins to be of a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100171:145"/>
greenish colour, strew on it <hi>Auripigmentum</hi> finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as much as will lie on a Shilling to 12 pound of Lead. Then stir them together, and the <hi>Auripigmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> will flame.</p>
                        <p>Your I adle ought to have a Notch on one side of the Brim for the more easie pouring out of the Lead, and the Ladle ought to remain in the melted Lead, that the heat may be agreeable to it, to prevent all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which may happen through excess of heat or cold. Then try your Lead by droping it into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If the drops prove round, then the temper of the heat is right; but if the Shot have Tails, then there is want both of heat and <hi>Auripigmentum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then take a Copper-plate about the size of a Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-plate, with an hollowness in the midst about three inches compass, with about forty holes bored accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the size of the Shot you intend to cast. The hollow bottom should be thin, but the thicker the brim the better, because it will longer retain the heat. Place it on an Iron frame over a Bucket of water, about four Inches from it, and spread burning Coals on the plate to keep the Lead melted upon it.</p>
                        <p>Then take up some Lead and pour it gently on the Coals on the plate, and it will force its way through the holes into the water, and form it self into Shot. Thus do till all your Lead be run through the holes of the plate: observing to keep your Coals alive, that the Lead may not cool, and so stop up the holes. Whilst you are casting your Shot, another person may catch some of the Shot with another Ladle, placed four or five inches (underneath the bottom of the plate) in the water, and by that means you may discern if there are any defects in your process, and rectifie them.</p>
                        <p>The chief business is to keep your Lead in a just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat, that it be not so cold as to fill up the holes, nor so hot as to make the Shot crack. To remedy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100171:145"/>
the coolness of your Lead and plate, you must blow your Coals; to remedy the beat, you must refrain working till it be cool enough, observing, that the cooler your Lead, the larger your Shot; the hotter, the smaller.</p>
                        <p>When you have cast your Shot, take them out of the water and dry them over the fire with a gentle heat, and be sure to keep them continually stirred that they melt not. When they are dry you are to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the great Shot from the small, by the help of Sieves made on purpose, according to their several sizes. If you would have very large Shot, you may with a stick force the Lead to trickle out of your Ladle into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without the plate.</p>
                        <p>If it stop on the plate, and yet the plate be not too cool, give but the plate a little knock, and it will run again. Take care that none of your Instruments be greasie. When you have separated your Shot, if any prove too large for your purpose, or any ways imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, 'tis only your pains lost, and it will serve again at your next operation.</p>
                        <p>In shooting, observe always to shoot with the wind, if possible, and not against it; and rather side-ways, or behind the Fowl, than full in their faces.</p>
                        <p>Next, observe to chuse the most convenient shelter you can find, as either Hedge, Bank, Tree, or any thing else which may abscond you from the view of the Fowl.</p>
                        <p>Be sure to have your Dog at your heels under good command, not daring to stir till you bid him, having first discharged your Piece: for some ill-taught Dogs will upon the snap of the Cock presently rush out, and spoil all the sport.</p>
                        <p>Now if you have not shelter enough, by reason of the nakedness of the Banks and want of Trees, you must creep upon your hands and knees under the Banks,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100171:146"/>
and lying even flat upon your Belly, put the nose of your Piece over the Bank, and so take your level; for a Fowl is so fearful of man, that though an Hawk were soaring over her head, yet at the sight of a man she would betake her self to her wing, and run the risque of that danger.</p>
                        <p>But sometime it so happeneth that the Fowl are so shie, there is no getting a shoot at them without a Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-horse, which must be some old Jade trained up for that purpose, who will gently, and as you will have him, walk up and down in the water which way you please flodding and eating on the Grass that grows therein.</p>
                        <p>You must shelter your self and Gun behind his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoulder, bending your body down low by his side, and keeping his body still full between you and the Fowl: being within shot, take your level from before the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Horse, shooting as it were between the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Neck and the water; which is much better than shooting under his Belly, being more secure, and less perceiveable.</p>
                        <p>Now to supply the want of a Stalking-horse, which will take up a great deal of time to instruct and make fit for this exercise, you may make one of any pieces of old Canyas, which you must shape into the form of an Horse, with the head bending downwards as if he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. You may stuff it with any light matter; and do not forget to paint it of the colour of an horse, of which the brown is the best; and in the midst let it be fix'd to a Staff with a sharp Iron at the end, to stick into the ground as you shall see occasion, standing fast whilst you take your level.</p>
                        <p>It must be made so portable, that you may bear it with ease in one hand, moving it so as it may seem to graze as you go. Let the stature of your artificial Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-horse be neither too low nor too high; for the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100171:146"/>
one will not abscond your body, and the other will be apt to frighten the Fowl.</p>
                        <p>Instead of this Stalking-horse, you may fashion out of Canvas painted an Ox or Cow: and this change is necessary, when you have so beaten the Fowl with your Stalking-horse, that they begin to find your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and will no longer endure it, (as it frequently falls out.) Then you may stalk with an Ox or Cow, till the Stalking-horse be forgotten, and by this means make your sport lasting and continual.</p>
                        <p>Some there are that stalk with Stags or Red-Deer form'd out of painted Canvas, with the natural Horns of Stags fixt thereon, and the colour so lively painted, that the Fowl cannot discern the fallacy; and these are very useful in low Fenny grounds, where any such Deer do usually feed; and are more familiar with the Fowl, and so feed nearer them than Ox, Horse, or Cow: by which means you shall come within a far nearer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                        <p>There are other dead Engines to stalk withal, as an artificial Tree, Shrub, or Bush, which may be made of small Wands, and with painted Canvas made into the shape of a Willow, Poplar, or such Trees as grow by Rivers and Water-sides; for these are the best.</p>
                        <p>If you stalk with a Shrub or Bush, let them not be so tall as your Tree, but much thicker; which you may make either of one entire Bush, or of divers Bushes interwoven one with another, either with small Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy-wands, Cord, or Pack-thread, that may not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: and let not your Bush exceed the height of a man, but be thicker than four or five, with a Spike at the bottom to stick into the ground whilst you take your level.</p>

                        <head>How to take all manner of Land fowl by day or night.</head>
                        <p>SInce the dissolution and spoil of Paradise, no man hath either seen, or can give the names of all Land-fowl whatever, there being such great variety, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Country producing some particular sorts which are unknown to other Nations.</p>
                        <p>To avoid prolixity, I shall rank them under two heads.</p>
                        <p>The first are such who are either fit for Food or Pleasure, either for eating or singing: for eating, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> of all sorts. <hi>Rook, Pheasant, Partridge, Quails, Rail, Felfares,</hi> &amp;c. and for eating or singing, the <hi>Blackbird, Throstle, Nightingale, Linnet, Lark,</hi> and <hi>Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, such as are for Pleasure onely, and they are all manner of birds of Prey, as <hi>Castrels, Ring-tails, Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The general way of taking these Land-fowl of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts together, is either by day or by night. If by day, it is done with the great Net, commonly called the <hi>Crow-net,</hi> and not at all differs in length, depth, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mesh, manner of laying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the <hi>Plover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;</hi> onely it will not be amiss if the Cords be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>This Net you may lay before Barn-doors, or where Corn hath been winnowed, also in Stubble-fields, so concealing the Net that the Fowl may not discern the Snare. When you perceive a quantity within the Net scraping for food, and you lie concealed afar off, with your Cord in your hand suddenly pull the Net over upon them.</p>
                        <p>You may do well to take notice of their Morning

and Evening Haunts, to worm and feed upon the Greenswarth; and here lay your Net, and it will prove as effectual as in other places, so that you observe to abscond your self in some Covert so as not to be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried: in the next place, pull not too hastily, but wait for a good number of Fowl within the Net, and then pull freely and quickly; for the least deliberation after the Net is raised, is the ruine of your design.</p>
                        <p>Thus much for Day-fowling with the Net: now if you will prosecute your sport by Night, you must do it according to the nature and manner of the Country, or situation or fashion of the ground, whether Woody, Mountainous, or Champain.</p>
                        <p>In plain and Champain Countries you must use the <hi>Low-bell,</hi> from the end of <hi>October</hi> until the end of <hi>March;</hi> and this method you must follow.</p>
                        <p>The day being shut in, the air mild without Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine, take a <hi>Low-bell,</hi> (which must have a deep and hollow sound, for if it be shrill it is stark naught) and with it a Net whose Mesh is twenty yards deep, and so broad, that it may cover five or six Lands or more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the company you have to carry it. With these Instruments go into any stubble Corn-field, but Wheat is the best. He that carries the Bell must go foremost, toling the Bell as he goes very mournfully, letting it but now and then knock on both sides: after him must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Net, born up at each corner and on each side by several persons; then another must carry some Iron or stony Vessel which may contain burning, but not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Coals, and at these you must light bundles of straw: or you may carry Links with you. And having pitcht your Nets where you think the Game lies, beat the ground and make a noise, and as the Fowl rise they will be entangled in the Net. Thus you may take good store of <hi>Partridge, Rails, Larks, Quails,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Having so done, extinguish your Lights, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

laying your Net in some other place as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that the sound of the <hi>Low-bell</hi> makes the Birds lie close, so as they dare not stir whilst you are pitching the Net, for the sound thereof is dreadful to them; but the sight of the Fire much more terrible, which makes them instantly to fly up, and so they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come entangled in the Net.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if you intend to have the full fruition of your sport, you must be very silent, and nothing must be heard but the sound of the <hi>Low-bell</hi> till the Net is placed and the Lights blazing; but as soon as they are extinguished a general silence must be again.</p>
                        <p>The Trammel is much like this Net for the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> and may be necessarily used on the same grounds; onely it ought to be longer, though not much broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p>When you come to a place fit for your purpose where Birds lodge on the Earth, you shall then spread your Trammel on the ground; and let the farthest end thereof, being plumb'd with Lead, lie loose on the ground; but let the foremost ends be born up by two men, and so trail the Net along, keeping the foremost ends a yard or more distance from the ground.</p>
                        <p>On each side of the Net carry Wisps of Straw light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or Links, and let some beat the ground with long Poles; and as the Birds rise under the Nets, take them. And thus you may continue doing as long as you please, to your great profit and pleasure.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The manner is: you must be very silent till your Lights are blazing, and you may either carry Nets or none: if none, you must then have long Poles with great bushy tops fixt to them; and having from a <hi>Cresset</hi> or vessel to carry fire in, lighted your Straw, or other bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing combustible matter, then must you beat those Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes where you think Birds are at roost; which done, if there be any in those Bushes or Trees, you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly see them fly about the Flames: for it is their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, through their amazedness at the strangeness of the Light, and extream darkness round about it, not to depart from it, but they will even scorch their Wings in the same, so that those who have the bushy Poles may beat them down as they please, and take them up. Thus you may continue your sport as long as it is very dark, and no longer.</p>

Sun-rising. Where note, the milder the Air, the brighter the Sun, and the pleasanter the Morning is, the better will your sport be, and of longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                        <p>Let the place you elect for this purpose be plain and Champain, either on Barley-stubbles, green Lays, or level and flat Meadows; and these places must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from any Villages, but near adjacent to Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields.</p>
                        <p>The fashion of a Day-net is this: you must make them of fine Packthread, the Mesh small, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half an Inch square each way; let the length be about three fashom, the breadth one fathom and no more: the shape is like the Crow-net, and it must be verg'd about in the same manner with a strong small Cord, add the two ends extended upon two small long Poles suitable to the breadth of the Net, with four stakes, Tail-strings, and Drawing-lines, as afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: only whereas that was but one single Net, here must be two of one length, breadth and fashion. These Nets must be laid opposite to each other, yet so close and even together, that when they are drawn and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over, the sides and edges may meet and touch one the other.</p>
                        <p>These Nets being staked down with strong Stakes very stiffly on their Lines, so as with any nimble twitch you may cast them to and fro at your pleasure; you shall then to the upper ends of the foremost staves fasten your Hand lines or drawing Cords, which must be at the least a dozen, a fathom long; and so extend them of such a reasonable streightness, as with little strength they may raise up the Nets and cast them over.</p>
                        <p>When your Nets are laid, some twenty or thirty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, beyond them place your Stales, Decoys, or playing Wantons, upon some pearching Boughs, which will not only entice Birds of their own Feather to stoop, but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100171:149"/>
but also <hi>Hawks</hi> and Birds of Prey to swoop into your Nets.</p>
                        <p>Remember to keep the first half dozen you take alive for Stales, and to that end have a Cage or Linnen-bag to put them in: The rest squeez in the hinder-part of the head, and so kill them. And thus do every day.</p>

                        <head>Of taking small Birds which use Hedges and Bushes with <hi>Lime-twigs.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe great Lime-bush is best for this use, which you must make after this manner: Cut down the main Arm or chief Bough of any bushy Tree, whose branches or Twigs are long, thick, smooth and straight, without either pricks or knots; of which the Willow or Birch-tree are the best: when you have pickt it and trimm'd it from all superfluity, making the Twigs neat and clean; take then of the best Bird-lime, well mixed and wrought together with Goose-greace or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon's-greace, which being warmed, lime every Twig therewith within four fingers of the bottom. The body, from whence the branches have their rise, must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd with Lime.</p>
                        <p>Be sure you do not dawb you Twigs with too much Lime, for that will give distaste to the Birds; yet let none want its proportion, or have any part left bare which ought to be toucht: for, as too much will deter them from coming, so too little will not hold them when they are there.</p>
                        <p>Having so done, place your Bush on some Quick-set or dead Hedge neer unto Towns-ends, back-yards, old houses, or the like; for these are the resort of small Birds in the Spring-time: in the Summer and Harvest in Groves, Bushes, White-thorn-trees, Quick-set-hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100171:150"/>
neer Corn-fields, Fruit-trees, Flax and Hemp-lands; and in the winter about Houses, Hovels, Barns, Stacks, or those places where stand ricks of Corn, or scattered Chaff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As near as you can to any of these haunts plant your Lime-bush, and plant your self also at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent distance undiscovered, imitating with your mouth the several Notes of Birds, which you must learn by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practice, walking the Fields for that very purpose often, observing the variety of several birds sounds, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially such as they call one another by. I have known some so expert herein, that they could imitate the Notes of twenty several sorts of Birds at least, by which they have caught ten Birds to anothers one that was ignorant therein.</p>
                        <p>But if you cannot attain to it by your industry, you must then buy a <hi>Bird-call,</hi> of which there are several sorts, and easie to be framed, some of Wood, some of Horn, some of Cane, and the like.</p>
                        <p>Having first learned how to use this Call, you shall sit and call the Birds unto you; and as any of them light on your Bush, step not to them till you see them sufficiently entangled: Neither is it requisite to run for every single Bird, but let them alone till more come, for their fluttering is as good as a Stale to entice more.</p>
                        <p>This Exercise you may use from Sun-Rising till ten a clock in the Morning, and from one till almost Sun-set.</p>
                        <p>You may take these small Birds with Lime-twigs onely, without the Bush. When I was a boy, I have taken two or three hundred small Twigs about the bigness of Rushes, and about three Inches long, and have gone with them into a field where were Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks; upon the tops of half a score, lying all round together, I have stuck my Twigs, and then have gone
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100171:150"/>
and beat that field, or the next to it, where I saw any Birds; and commonly in such fields there are infinite numbers of <hi>Linnets</hi> and <hi>Green-birds</hi> which are great lovers of Hemp-seed. I say, they fly in such vast flocks, I have caught at one fall of them upon the Cocks eight dozen at a time.</p>
                        <p>But to return, there is a pretty way of taking Birds with Lime-twigs, by placing near them a Stale or two made of living <hi>Night-baits,</hi> placing them aloft, that they may be visible to the Birds thereabouts; which will no sooner be perceived, but every Bird will come and gaze, wondering at the strangeness of the sight: then they having no other convenient lighting-place but where the Lime-twigs are, you may take what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you list of them.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Owl</hi> is a far better Stale than the <hi>Bat,</hi> being bigger, and more easily to be perceived; besides, he is never seen abroad, but he is followed and persecuted by all the birds near adjacent.</p>
                        <p>If you have not a living <hi>Bat</hi> or <hi>Owl,</hi> their skins will serve as well being stuffed, and will last you twenty years. There are some have used an <hi>Owl</hi> cut in Wood, and naturally painted, with wonderful success.</p>
                        <p>It is strange to me that this Bird above all others should be so persecuted by all Birds whatsoever, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the <hi>Goose;</hi> and therefore some arch Cracks in <hi>Lincoln-shire</hi> and other places where are great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Geese,</hi> observing their tempers, have made great advantage of them; for by only throwing a live <hi>Owl</hi> among a flock of <hi>Geese,</hi> they got as many Quills as they knew what to do with; for the <hi>Geese</hi> endeavouring to beat the <hi>Owl</hi> with their wings, never left till they did beat the Quills out of their wings, and commonly the best, which are Seconds.</p>

                        <head>How to make the best sort of Bird-lime, and how to use it.</head>
                        <p>TAke at Midsummer the bark of Holly, and pill it from the Tree, so much as will fill a reasonable big Vessel; then put to it running Water, and set it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fire, and boil it till the grey and white bark rise from the green, which will take up sixteen hours in the boiling: then take it from the fire, and separate the barks after the water is very well drain'd away: then take all the green bark, and lay it on the ground in a close place and moist floor, and cover it over with all manner of green Weeds, as Hemlock, Docks, Thistles, and the like; thus let it lie ten or twelve days, in which time it will rot, and turn to a filthy slimy matter. Then take it and put it into a Mortar, and there beat it till it become universally thick and tough, without the discerning of any part of the bark or other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; then take it out of the Mortar, and carry it to a running Stream, and there wash it exceedingly, not leaving any more or foulness within it; then put it up in a very close Earthen pot, and let it stand and purge for divers days together, scumming it as often as any foulness arises for four or five days: when you perceive no more Scum, you shall then take it out of that Pot, and put it into another clean Earthen Vessel, cover it close, and keep it for your use.</p>
                        <p>When you are about to use your Lime, take what quantity you think fit and put it into a Pipkin, adding thereto a third part of Goose-greace or Capons-greace finely clarified, and set them over a gentle fire, and there let them melt together, and stir them continually till they are well incorporated: then take it from the fire, and stir it till it be cold.</p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:100171:151"/>
                        <p>When your Lime is cold, take your Rods and warm them a little over the fire; then take your Lime and wind it about the tops of your Rods, then draw your Rods a sunder one from the other, and close them again, continually plying and working them together, till by smearing one upon another, you have equally bestowed on each Rod a sufficient proportion of Lime.</p>
                        <p>If you lime any Strings, do it when the Lime is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot and at the thinnest, besmearing the Strings on all sides, by folding them together and unfolding them again.</p>
                        <p>If you lime Straws, it must be done likewise when the Lime is very hot, doing a great quantity together, as many as you can well grasp in your hand, tossing and working them before the fire till they are all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smear'd, every Straw having his due proportion of Lime: having so done, put them up in cases of Leather till you have occasion to use them.</p>
                        <p>Now to prevent the freezing of your Lime either as it is on Twigs, Bushes, or Straws, you must adde a quarter as much of the Oyl called <hi>Petroleum</hi> as of your Capons-grease, mix them well together, and then work it on your Rods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so it will ever keep supple, tough, and gentle, and will not be prejudiced should it freeze never so hard.</p>

Having thus mingled them, boil them all gently together over a small fire, stirring it continually; then take it from the fire and let it cool: When at any time you have occasion to use it, warm it, and then anoint your Twigs or Straws, or any other small things, and no Water will take away the strength thereof.

If there be any other open place near to that where your Twigs are planted, you must beat them up: The reason why they delight to haunt open places, and where Springs do gently run, is because they cannot feed, by reason of their Bills, in places that are hard and stony; and about these Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, in snowy Weather, they very much resort.</p>

                        <p>TAke some thick Brown-paper, and divide a sheet into eight parts, and make them up like Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaves; then lime the inside of the Paper a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; (let them be limed three or four days before you set them) then put some Corn in them, and lay threescore or more of them up and down the ground; lay them as near as you can under some clod of Earth, and early in the Morning before they come to feed; and then stand at a distance, and you will see most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent sport; for as soon as <hi>Rooks, Crows,</hi> or <hi>Pigeons</hi> come to peck out any of the Corn, it will hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head, and he will immediately fly bolt upright so high, that he shall soar almost out of sight; and when he is spent, come tumbling down as if he had been shot in the Air. You may take them at Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-time when the <hi>Rooks</hi> and <hi>Crows</hi> follow the Plough; but then you must put in Worms and Maggots of the largest size.</p>

                        <p>And as you take these great Land-fowl with this drunken device, so you may take the middle and smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler sort of Birds, if you observe to boil with what food they delight in, a quantity of this <hi>Nux vomica.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some, instead of <hi>Nux vomica,</hi> use the Lees of Wine, the sharper and quicker they are, the better, boiling their Grains in these Lees, also Seeds or any other food, and strewing them in the Haunts of those Birds you would surprize. These do as effectually as <hi>Nux vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> and it's the cleanlier and neater way, there being not that poysonous quality in them.</p>
                        <p>You may chuse whether you will boil your Grain or Seed in the aforesaid Lees; for they will be every whit as effectual if onely steeped a considerable while there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, giving them leave to drink in the Lees till they are ready to burst before you use them.</p>
                        <p>Others, having neither <hi>Nux vomica,</hi> nor Wine-lees, take the Juice of Hemlock, and steep their Grains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, adding thereto some Henbane-seed or Poppy-seed, causing them to be infused therein four or five days; then draining the Grain or Seed from the Liquor, strew them as aforesaid. The Birds having tasted hereof, are immediately taken with a dizziness, which will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue some hours, so that they cannot flie; but they will recover again, if you kill them not. If you intend them for food, let them be first recovered.</p>
                        <p>Thus much for the Land; now let us speak of the Water-fowl.</p>

Roots and all, and having cleansed them very well, put them into a Vessel of clear running Water, and there let them lie in steep twenty four hours; then never shift them from the Water, but boil them together till the Water be almost consumed: then take it off, and set it a cooling. Then take a quantity hereof, and go to the Haunts of any of the aforesaid Fowl, and there spread of this Bait in sundry and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places; and those that shall taste hereof will be taken with the like drunken dizziness as the former. To make this Confection the more effectual, it will be requisite to adde a quantity of Brimstone thereunto in its boiling.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100171:158"/>
himself to fishing again. I have been informed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that he saw a <hi>Carp</hi> taken out of a <hi>Hern's</hi> Belly which was nine Inches and an half long.</p>
                        <p>Several Gentlemen that have kept <hi>Herns</hi> tame, have put Fish in a Tub, and tried the <hi>Hern</hi> how many small <hi>Roaches</hi> and <hi>Dace</hi> he would eat in a day, and they have found him to eat about fifty in a day, one day with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                        <p>One <hi>Hern</hi> that haunts a Pond, in a Twelvemonths time, shall destroy a thousand Store-<hi>Carps;</hi> and when Gentlemen sue their Ponds, they think their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have robbed them, not in the least considering an <hi>Hern</hi> is able to devour them in half a years time, if he put in half as many more.</p>
                        <p>Now since this ravenous Fowl is so destructive to Ponds and Fish of the River, it will be very necessary to find out a way to destroy that, that destroys so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which may be done in this manner.</p>
                        <p>Having found out his haunt, get three or four small <hi>Roaches</hi> or <hi>Dace;</hi> and have a strong Hook with Wyre to it, draw the Wyre just within the skin of the said Fish, beginning without side of the Gills, running of it to the Tail, and then the Fish will live five or six days. Now if the Fish be dead, the <hi>Hern</hi> will not meddle with him. Let not your Hook bee too rank; then having a strong Line with Silk and Wyre, about two yards and a half long, (if you twist not Wyre with your Silk, the sharpness of his Bill will bite it in two immediately) and tye a round Stone about a pound-weight to the Line, and lay three or four Hooks, and in two or three nights you shall not fail to have him if he comes to your Pond. Lay not your Hooks in the water so deep that the <hi>Hern</hi> cannot wade unto them. Colour your Line of a dark green, for an <hi>Hern</hi> is a subtile Bird.

                        <head>How to take <hi>PHEASANTS</hi> several ways.</head>
                        <p>THe taking of <hi>Pheasants</hi> is to be performed three several ways, by Nets, by Lime-bush, or else by other particular Engines, which shall be discours'd of hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The taking of <hi>Pheasants</hi> with Nets, is done either generally, or particularly: generally, when the whole Eye of <hi>Pheasants</hi> is taken, that is the old Cock and old Hen with all their Powts, as they run together in the obscure Woods; or particularly, when you take none but the old <hi>Pheasants,</hi> or the young, being of an age fit to couple or pair.</p>
                        <p>For the greater facility of taking <hi>Pheasants,</hi> you must first understand their Haunts, which are never in open Fields, but in thick young Copses well grown, and not in old high Woods.</p>
                        <p>Having thus found out their Coverts, which must be solitary and untraced by Men or Cattel, the next thing will be how to find out the Eye or Brood of <hi>Pheasants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first way, is by going into these young Copses, and carefully viewing the same, searching every where; and by that means at last finding where they run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as Chickens after a Hen. Or, secondly, you must rise early in a Morning, or come late in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and observe how and when the old Cock and Hen call their young ones to them, and how the young ones answer back unto them again; and so from that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100171:159"/>
sound direct your Path as near as you can to the place where they are, lying there down so close you may not be discerned; by which means you will know where they meet, and how accordingly you may pitch your Nets.</p>
                        <p>But the most certain way of finding them out, is to have a natural <hi>Pheasant</hi>-call, which you must learn how to use, understanding all their Notes, and how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them: For they have several Notes, and all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; one to cluck them together when the Hen would brood them, another to chide them when they straggle too far, a third to call them to meat when she hath found it, a fourth to make them look out for food themselves, and a fifth to call them about her to sport withal. You must use your Call in the morning early, at which time they straggle abroad to find Provender; or else in the Evening just about Sun-setting, which is their time likewise for feeding.</p>
                        <p>Now although these are the best times to use your Call, yet you may call them at any other time of the day, onely altering your Note. Just at, or before Sun-rising, your Note must be to call them to feed, and so at Sun-set: but in the Forenoon and Afternoon your Notes must be to cluck them together to brood, or to chide them for straggling, or to give them notice of some approaching danger.</p>
                        <p>Knowing your Notes, and how to apply them, with the places where <hi>Pheasants</hi> haunt, which you shall know by the strength of the under-growth, obscureness, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and solitariness of the place, you must then lodge your self as close as possible, and then call at first very softly, lest the <hi>Pheasants</hi> being lodg'd very near you, should be affrighted at a loud Note; but if nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, raise your Note higher and higher, till you extend it to the utmost compass: and if there be a <hi>Pheasant</hi> within hearing, she will answer in a Note as loud as your
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100171:159"/>
own, provided it be not untunable, for that will spoil all.</p>
                        <p>As soon as you hear this answer, if it be from afar, and from one single Fowl, creep nearer and nearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, still calling, but not so loud; and as you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer to it, so will the <hi>Pheasant</hi> to you; and as you alter your Note, so will she: and in all points you must endeavour to imitate her, and in fine you will get sight of her, either on the Ground or Pearch: Then cease your calling, and spread your Net between the <hi>Pheasant</hi> and your self, in the most convenient place you can find, with all secrecy and silence, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one end of the Net fast to the ground, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other end by a long Line in your hand; by which, when any thing straineth it, you may pull the Net close together: which done, call again, and as soon as you perceive the <hi>Pheasant</hi> come underneath your Net, then rise up and shew your self, that by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Pheasant</hi> an affright, he may offer to mount, and so be entangled within the Net.</p>
                        <p>Now if it so fall out that you hear many answers, and from divers corners of the Wood, then stir not at all, but keep your place; and as you hear them by their sounds to come nearer and nearer unto you, so shall you in the mean time prepare your Nets ready, and spread them conveniently about you, one pair of Nets on the one side, and another on the other side; then lie close, and apply your self to the Call till such time as you have allured them under your Nets; then stand up and shew your self, which will affright them and make them mount, whereby they will be entangled.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100171:160"/>
large and square, almost an inch between Knot and Knot; let the length of it be about three fathom, and the breadth about seven foot, and verge it on each side, with strong small Cord, and let the ends be also so, that it may lie compass-wise and hollow.</p>
                        <p>Some make these Nets of a much larger size; but then they are too cumbersome, and hardly to be ruled with one hand: but the others are readier to pitch, and better to take, also more nimble for any purpose you shall employ them to.</p>

                        <p>The driving and taking young <hi>Pheasants</hi> in Nets is done after this manner. Having either by your eye or Call found out an Eye of <hi>Pheasants,</hi> you must then (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the wind with you, for they will naturally run down the wind) place your Nets cross the little Pads and ways which you see they have made, (for they will make little Paths like Sheep-tracks) and as near as you can, come to some special Haunts of theirs, which you shall know by the bareness of the ground, Mutings, and loose Feathers which you shall find there: and these Nets must be placed hollow, loose, and circular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the nether part thereof being fastened to the ground, and the upper side lying hollow, loose, and bending, so that when any thing rusheth into it, it may fall and entangle it: which done, you must go before where you found the Haunt, and there with your Call (if you find the Eye is scattered and separated one from the other) you must call them together.</p>
                        <p>Then take your Instrument called a <hi>Driver,</hi> which is made of strong white Wands or Osiers set fast in a handle, and in two or three places twisted about and bound with other Wands, bearing the shape of those
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100171:160"/>
things Cloath-dressers usually dress their Cloath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: I say, with this Driver you must make a gentle noise, raking upon the Boughs and Bushes round about you; which as soon as Powts do hear, they will instantly run from it a little way, and then stand and listen, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping all close together: then give another rake, at which they will run again as before: And by thus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, you will drive them like so many Sheep before you which way or whither you please, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at last into your Nets.</p>
                        <p>In using your Driver there are two things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. The first is Secrecy, in concealing your self from the sight of the <hi>Pheasants;</hi> for if they chance to see you, they will instantly hide themselves in Holes and bottoms of Bushes, and will not stir from thence by any means whatever, as long as any day endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
                        <p>The other thing to be observed, is Time and Leisure in the work; for there is nothing obstructs this Pastime more than too much haste: for they are very fearful Creatures, and are soon startled; and when once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd, their fears will not suffer them to argue or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the affrighting object; but the very first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension is sufficient to make them all fly at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, without staying to behold what they are so much afraid of.</p>

                        <head>Of taking <hi>Pheasants</hi> with a Lime-bush.</head>
                        <p>Having observed their Haunts as aforesaid, take a Bush, or single Rods, and trim them with the best and strongest Lime that can be got: let your Rods be twelve inches; your Lime-bush must not contain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eight Twigs, being the Top-branch of some Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-tree, with an indifferent long Handle, made sharp

                        <p>When you have placed your Bush or Rods, take out your Call, but remove not from your place, lying close without discovery. If your Call be good, and you have skill to use it, you will quickly have all the <hi>Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants</hi> within hearing about you; and if one happen to be entangled, she will go near to entangle all the rest, either by her extraordinary fluttering, or their own amazement and confusion. And as they are taken by the Rods on the ground, so you will surprize them with your Bushes; for being scared from below, they will mount to the Pearch or Bushes, to see what becomes of their fellows, and be there taken themselves.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that it is very requisite to count all your Rods, and when you have gathered up your <hi>Pheasants,</hi> see what Rods you have missing, and then conclude from the miss of them, that some <hi>Pheasants</hi> are run with them into the Bushes; and therefore it will be necessary to have a Spaniel which will fetch and carry, and one that will not break nor bruise either Flesh or Feather.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100171:162"/>
number, sometimes five and twenty: nay, I have heard of thirty in a Covie.</p>
                        <p>Now after the Winter-season is come, and that these Stubble-fields are plough'd up, or over-soiled with Cattle, then do these <hi>Partridges</hi> resort into the up-land Meadows, and do lodge in the dead Grass or Fog un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hedges, amongst Mole-hills, or under the Roots of Trees: Sometimes they resort to Copses and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods, especially if any Corn-fields are near adjacent, or where grows Broom, Brakes, Fern, or any Covert whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>In the Harvest-time, when every Field is full of men and Cattle, then you shall find them in the day-time in the Fallow-fields which are next adjoyning to the Corn-fields, where they lie lurking till the Evening, and then they feed among the Shocks or Sheaves of Corn; and so they do likewise early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>When you know their Haunts according to the scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Country and season of the year, your next care must be to find them out in their Haunts; which is done several ways. Some do it by the Eye onely; and this Art can never be taught, but learned by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Experience, distinguishing thereby the colour of the <hi>Partridge</hi> from that of the Earth, and how and in what manner they lodge and couch together: for which purpose you may come near enough to them, for they are a very lazy Bird, and so unwilling to take the Wing, that you may even set your foot upon them before they will stir, provided you do not stand and gaze on them, but be in continual motion; otherwise they will spring up and be gone.</p>
                        <p>There is another way to discover them, and that is by going to their Haunts very early in the Morning, or at the close of the Evening, which is called the <hi>Jucking-time,</hi> and there listening for the calling of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100171:162"/>
Cock-<hi>Partridge,</hi> which will be very loud and earnest; and after some few calls the Hen will answer, and by this means they meet together; which you shall know by their rejoycing and chattering one with another: upon the hearing of which, take your range about them, drawing nearer and nearer to the place you heard them <hi>juck</hi> in; then cast your eye towards the Furrows of the Lands, and there you will soon find where the Covie lies, and so take them as your fancy shall lead you.</p>
                        <p>The best, safest, and easiest way for finding of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges</hi> is by the Call, having first learn'd the true and natural Notes of the <hi>Partridge,</hi> knowing how to tune every Note in its proper Key, applying them to their due times and seasons.</p>
                        <p>Being perfect herein, either Mornings or Evenings (all other times being improper) go to their Haunts, and having convey'd your self into some secret place where you may see and not be seen, listen a while if you can hear the <hi>Partridges</hi> call; if you do, answer them again in the same Note, and as they change or double their Notes, so must you in like manner: thus continue doing till they draw nearer and nearer unto you. Having them in your view, lay your self on your back, and lie as if you were dead without motion, by which means you may count their whole number.</p>
                        <p>Having attained to the knowledge of discovering them where they lie, the next thing will be a ready way how to catch them.</p>

                        <p>The Driving of <hi>Partridges</hi> is more delightful than any other way of taking them: The manner of it is thus.</p>
                        <p>Make an Engine in the form and fashion of a Horse, cut out of Canvas, and stuff it with Straw, or such light matter: with this artificial Horse and your Nets you must go to the Haunts of <hi>Partridges,</hi> and having found out the Covie, and pitcht your Nets below, you must go above, and taking the advantage of the Wind, you must drive downward: Let your Nets be pitcht slope-wise and hovering. Then, having your Face covered with something that is green, or of a dark blue, you must, putting the Engine before you, stalk towards the <hi>Partridges</hi> with a slow pace, raising them on their Feet, but not their Wings, and then will they run na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally before you.</p>
                        <p>If they chance to run a by-way, or contrary to your purpose, then cross them with your Engine, and by so facing them, they will run into that track you would have them: Thus by a gentle slow pace you may make them run and go which way you will, and at last drive them into your Net, and so dispose of them at your pleasure.</p>

                        <head>How to take <hi>Partridges</hi> with a Setting-dog.</head>
                        <p>There is no Art of taking <hi>Partridges</hi> so excellent and pleasant as by the help of a Setting-dog: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before we proceed to the Sport, we shall give you an account what this Setting-dog is.</p>
                        <p>You are to understand then, that a Setting-dog is a certain lusty Land-spaniel, taught by nature to hunt the <hi>Partridge</hi> more than any chace whatever, running the fields over with such alacrity and nimbleness, as if there was no limit to his fury and desire, and yet by art under such excellent command, that in the very height of his career by a Hem or sound of his Master's voice he shall stand, gaze about him, look in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters face, and observe his directions, whether to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, stand still, or retire: nay, when he is even just upon his Prey, that he may even take it up in his mouth, yet his obedience is so framed by Art, that presently he shall either stand still, or fall down flat on his belly, without daring either to make any noise or motion till his Master come to him, and then he will proceed in all things to follow his directions.</p>
                        <p>Having a Dog thus qualified by Art and Nature, take him with you where <hi>Partridges</hi> do haunt, there cast off your Dog, and by some word of encouragement which he is acquainted with, engage him to range, but never too far from you; and see that he beat his ground justly and even, without casting about, or flying now here now there, which the mettle of some will do, if not corrected and reproved. And therefore when you perceive this fault, you must presently call him in with a Hem, and so check him that he dare not do the like again for that day; so will he range afterwards with more tem perance, ever and anon looking in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100171:164"/>
face, as if he would gather from thence whether he did well or ill.</p>
                        <p>If in your Dog's ranging you perceive him to stop on the sudden, or stand still, you must then make in to him, (for without doubt he hath set the <hi>Partridge</hi>) and as soon as you come to him, command him to go nearer: but if he goes not, but either lies still or stands shaking of his Tail, as who would say, Here they are under my nose, and withal now and then looks back; then cease from urging him further, and take your circumference, walking fast with a careless eye, looking straight before the nose of the Dog, and thereby see how the Covy lie, whether close or strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling.</p>
                        <p>Then commanding the Dog to lie still, draw forth your Net, and prick one end to the ground, and spread your Net all open, and so cover as many of the <hi>Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> as you can; which done, make in with a noise, and spring up the <hi>Partridges;</hi> which shall no sooner rise, but they will be entangled in the Net. And if you shall let go the old Cock and Hen, it will not onely be an act like a Gentleman, but a means to increase your Pastime.</p>

                        <p>FRom what is contain'd in the foregoing Chapters, you may collect a method how to take other Fowl, as <hi>Rails, Quails, Morepoots,</hi> &amp;c. all which are very good flights for <hi>Hawks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Their haunts are much alike with those of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge;</hi> onely the <hi>Quail</hi> loves most the Wheat-fields,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100171:165"/>
the <hi>Morepoot</hi> most the Heath and Forest-grounds, and the <hi>Rails</hi> love the long high Grass where they may lie obscure.</p>
                        <p>The way of finding them is like that of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> by the Eye, the Ear, and Haunt: but the chief way of all to find them out is the Call or Pipe, to which they listen with such earnestness, that you can no sooner imitate their Notes, but they will answer them, and will pursue the Call with such greediness, that they will play and skip about you, nay run over you, especially the <hi>Quail.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The notes of the Male and Female differ very much, and therefore you must have them both at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and when you hear the Male call, you must answer in the Females note; and when the Female calls, you must answer in the Males note: and thus you will not fall to have them both come to you, who will gaze and listen till the Net is cast over them.</p>
                        <p>The way of taking these Birds is the same with that of the <hi>Partridge,</hi> and they may be taken with Nets or Lime, either Bush or Rod, or Engine, which you must stalk with; or by the Setting-dog, which I shall treat of in the next Chapter.</p>

                           <hi>How to elect and train a</hi> SETTING-DOG <hi>from a Whelp till he come to perfection.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe Dog which you elect for Setting must have a perfect and good scent, and be naturally addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the hunting of Feathers. And this Dog may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Land-spaniel, Water-spaniel, or Mungrel of them both; either the Shallow-flewed Hound, Tumbler,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100171:165"/>
Lurcher, or small bastard Mastiff. But there is none better than the Land-spaniel, being of a good and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble size, rather small than gross, and of a courageous mettle; which though you cannot discern being young, yet you may very well know from a right breed, which have been known to be strong, lusty and nimble Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, of active Feet, wanton Tails, and busie Nostrils; whose Tail was without weariness, their Search with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changeableness, and whom no delight did transport beyond fear or obedience.</p>
                        <p>When you have made choice of your Dog, begin to instruct him about four months old, or six months at the uttermost.</p>
                        <p>The first thing that you shall teach your Dog, is to make him loving and familiar with you, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you from any other person, and following you where-ever you go. To effect this the better, let him receive his food as near as you can from no other hand but your own; and when you correct him to keep him in awe, do it rather with words than blows.</p>
                        <p>When you have have so instructed your Dog that he will follow none but your self, and can distinguish your frown from your smile, and smooth words from rough, you must then teach him to couch and lie down close to the ground; first, by laying him often on the ground, and crying, <hi>Lie close.</hi> When he hath done any thing to your mind and pleasure, you must then reward him with a piece of Bread: if otherwise, chastise him with words, but few blows.</p>
                        <p>After this, you must teach him to come creeping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you with his Belly and Head close upon the ground, as far or as little a way as you shall think fit: and this you may do by saying, <hi>Come nearer, come nearer,</hi> or the like; and at first, till he understand your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by shewing him a piece of Bread or some other
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100171:166"/>
food to entice him to you. And this observe in his creeping to you, if he offer to raise his Body or Head, you must not onely thrust the rising-part down, but threaten him with your angry voice; which if he seem to slight, then add a sharp jerk or two with a Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord-lash.</p>
                        <p>You must often renew his Lessons till he be very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, still encouraging him when he does well.</p>
                        <p>If you walk abroad with him, and he take a fancy to range, even when he is most busie speak to him, and in the height of his pastime make him fall upon his Belly and lie close, and after that make him come cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to you.</p>
                        <p>After this teach him to lead in a String or Line, and to follow you close at your heels without trouble or straining of his Collar.</p>
                        <p>By that time he hath learned these things aforesaid, I conceive the Dog may be a twelvemonth old; at which time the season of the year being fit, take him into the field and permit him to range, but still in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to your command. But if through wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he chance to babble or open without cause, you must then correct him sharply, either with a Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord-lash, or biting him hard at the Roots of his Ears.</p>
                        <p>Having brought him to a good temper and just o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, then, as soon as you see him come upon the Haunt of any <hi>Partridge,</hi> (which you shall know by his greater eagerness in hunting, as also by a kind of whimpering and whining in his voice, being very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to open, but not daring) you shall speak to him, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him take heed, or the like: but if notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he either rush in and spring the <hi>Partridge,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and so the <hi>Partridge</hi> escapeth, you must then correct him severely, and cast him off again, and let him hunt in some haunt where you know a Covy lies,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100171:166"/>
and see whether he hath mended his fault: And if you catch any with your Nets, give him the Heads, Necks, and Pinions for his future encouragement.</p>
                        <p>Many more observations there are, which are too numerous here to recite; wherefore I shall desist, and give you an account of a Water-dog, and so finish this present Discourse.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>How to train a <hi>WATER-DOG,</hi> and the use thereof.</head>
                        <p>I Shall begin with the best proportion of a <hi>Water-dog,</hi> and first of his colour. Although some do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much to the colour, yet experience lets us know they are uncertain observations.</p>
                        <p>To proceed then, your Dog may be any colour and yet excellent; but chuse him of Hair long and curled, not loose and shagged: his Head must be round and curled, his Ears broad and hanging, his Eye full, lively and quick, his Nose very short, his Lip Hound-like, his Chaps with a full set of strong Teeth, his Neck thick and short, his Breast sharp, his Shoulders broad, his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs straight, his Chine square, his Buttocks round, his Belly gaunt, his Thighs brawny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the training this Dog, you cannot begin too soon with him; and therefore as soon as he can lap, you must teach him to couch and lie down, not daring to stir from that posture without leave. Observe in his first teaching to let him eat nothing till he deserve it; and let him have no more Teachers, Feeders, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishers, or Correctors but one; and do not alter that word you first use in his information, for the Dog takes notice of the sound, not the language.</p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:100171:167"/>
                        <p>When you have acquainted him with the word sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Lesson, you must then teach him to know the word of Reprehension, which at first should not be used without a Jerk. You must also use words of che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, to give him encouragement when he does well: and in all these words you must be constant, and let them be attended with spitting in his mouth, or che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing of the hand. There is also a word of Advice, instructing him when he does amiss.</p>
                        <p>Having made him understand these several words, you must next teach him to lead in a string or Collar orderly, not running too forward, nor hanging back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. After this you must teach him to come close at your heels without leading; for he must not range by any means, unless it be to beat Fowl from their Covert, or to fetch the wounded.</p>
                        <p>In the next place you must teach him to fetch and carry any thing you throw out of your hands. And first try him with the Glove, shaking it over his Head, and making him snap at it; and sometimes let him hold it in his mouth, and strive to pull it from him; and at last throw it a little way, and let him worry it on the ground: and so by degrees make him bring it you where-ever you throw it. From the Glove you may teach him to fetch Cudgels, Bags, Nets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you use him to carry dead Fowl, it will not be amiss; for by that means he will not tear or bruise what Fowl you shoot.</p>
                        <p>Having perfected this Lesson, drop something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you which the Dog doth not see; and being gone a little way from it, send him back to seek it, by saying, <hi>Back, I have lost.</hi> If he seem amazed, point with your Finger, urging him to seek out, and leave him not till he hath done it. Then drop something at a greater distance, and make him find out that too, till you have brought him to go back a mile.</p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:100171:167"/>
                        <p>Now may you train him up for your Gun, making him stalk after you step by step, or else couch and lie close till you have shot.</p>
                        <p>Many more necessary Rules there are, which for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity sake I must omit.</p>
                        <p>The last use of the Water-dog is in moulting-time, when Wild-fowl cast their Feathers and are unable to fly, which is between Summer and Autumn: at this time bring your Dog to their Coverts, and hunt them out into the stream, and there with your Nets surprize them, driving them into them; for at this time sheep will not drive more easily. And though some may object, that this sickly time is unseasonable; yet if they consider what excellent food these Fowl will prove when cramm'd, the taking of them may be very excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable. I have eaten of them after they have been fed a while with Livers of Beast, Whey, Curds, Barley, Paste, scalded Bran, and such-like; they have proved excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fat, and have tasted not so fishy as they do by their natural feeding, but exceeding sweet, and deserve to be preferred before any Fowl whatever.</p>

                     <p>IN the preceeding Discourse I have given you a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary account of the several ways and artifices which are used to take either Land-fowl, or Fowl properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Water.

                        <head>Of the <hi>NIGHTINGAL.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>ACcording to the judgment of most men, the <hi>Nightingale</hi> carries the Bell from all other Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-birds, opening her charming Mouth not onely sweetly, but with much variety of pleasant Notes: It is but a small Bird, yet hath a loud voice; which made the Poet call her-----<hi>Vox, &amp; praeterea nihil.</hi> They are so well known, a description of them would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; and are not onely esteemed of here, but in <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts.</p>
                        <p>They appear to us at the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and very few know where they inhabit all the Winter; some think they sleep all that season.</p>
                        <p>She makes her Nest commonly about two foot above ground, either in thick Quick-set-hedges, or in Beds of Nettles where old Quick-set hath been thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. She hatcheth her young ones about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May,</hi> and naturally delights to frequent cool places, where small Brooks are garnished with pleasant Groves, and Quick-set-hedges are not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Nightingale</hi> which in my opinion is the best to keep, is he that is the earliest Bird of the Spring; for he will sing the better, having more time to hear the Old one sing than those that are hatched later.</p>
                        <p>The young <hi>Nightingales</hi> must be taken out of their Nests when they are indifferently well fledg'd in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity: for if well feathered, they will become sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; and if too little, they are so tender the cold will kill them.</p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:100171:169"/>
                        <p>For their meat give them lean Beef, Sheeps-heart, or Bullocks-heart, taking away first the fat Skin that covereth it, and take away the Sinews; after this, soak the like quantity of white Bread in water, and squeeze out some of the water; then mince it small; then feed them with a Stick, taking upon the point thereof the quantity of a Grey Pea, and give every one of them three or four such gobbets in an hour, as long as they shall endure to be in the Nest: when they are able to flie out of the Nest, then put them into a Cage with several Pearches for them to sit upon, and line them with some green Bays, for they are very subject to the Cramp at first; and at the bottom of the Cage put in some Moss or Hey, as well for other Birds as the <hi>Nightingale:</hi> it is safe to line their Cages against Winter, or keep them in some warm place. When they are first Caged, continue for a while to put some of their Meat by them mingled with Ants, which will induce them to feed themselves.</p>
                        <p>In the Summer you must feed them every day with fresh Meat, otherwise it will quickly grow stale or stink. When they begin to moult, give them half Egg hard boiled, and half Sheeps-heart mingled with Saffron and Water. Here note, Duck-eggs will kill them: you may give them sometimes red Worms, Caterpillars, and Hog-lice; Meal-worms make them familiar, suffering them to take them out of your hand.</p>
                        <p>The way of taking Old and Young is thus: For the Young, observe where the Cock sings; and if he sings long, the Hen is not far from that place, who oftentimes betrays her Off-spring by being too careful; for when you come near her Nest, she will <hi>Sweet</hi> and <hi>Cur:</hi> if notwithstanding this, you cannot find her Nest, stick a Meal-worm or two upon a Thorn, and then lying down or standing, observe which way
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100171:169"/>
it is carried by the Old one, and drawing near, you will hear the young ones when she feeds them. When you have found out the Nest, touch not the young; for if you do, they will not tarry in the Nest.</p>
                        <p>The way to take <hi>Branchers,</hi> by others called <hi>Pushers,</hi> (because when throughly fleg'd the Old ones push them out of the Nest) I say, you must take them after this manner: When you have found where they are, which you shall know by their <hi>Curring</hi> and <hi>Sweeting;</hi> (for if you call true, they will answer you immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:) having your Tackle all ready, scrape, in the Ditch or Bank-side, the Earth about three quarters of a yard square, that it may look fresh; then take a Bird-trap, or Net-trap, which you must make after this fashion.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>How to make a Net-trap for <hi>Nightingales.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Take a Net made of green Silk or Thread, about the compass of a yard, made after the fashion of a Shove-net for Fishes; then get some large Wyre, and bending it round, joyn both ends, which you must put into a short Stick about an Inch and an half long; then you must have a piece of Iron with two Cheeks and a hole on each side, through which you must put some fine Whip-cord three or four times double, that so it may hold the piece of Wood the better unto which the ends of the Wyre are put, and with a Button on each side the Iron, twist the Whip-cord, that so the Net may play the quicker: you must fasten the Net to the Wyre as you do a Shove-net to the Hoop; then get a Board of the compass of your Wyre, and joyn your two cheeks of Iron at the handle of your Board; then make a hole in the middle of your Board; and put a piece of Stick of about two Inches long, and a Hole at the Top of your Stick, which you must
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100171:170"/>
have a Peg to put in with two Wyres, an Inch and half long, to stick your Meal-worm upon; then tye a String in the middle of the top of your Net, drawing the Net up, having an eye at the end of the handle to put your Thread through, pull it till it stands upright, then pull it through the hole of the Stick that stands in the middle of your Board, and put your Peg in the hole, and that will hold the String that the Net cannot fall down: you must put two Worms upon the Wyres, before you put it into the hole, and set it as gently as you can, that it may fall with the first touch of the <hi>Nightingale:</hi> When you have your Net and Worm ready, having first scraped the place, then put some Ants in your Trap-cage, and upon your Board put some Worms upon Thorns, and set them at the bottom of your Trap-cage, little holes being made for the same purpose to stick in the ends of your Thorns: Then plant your Trap near to the place where you heard them call, either in the Ditch, or by the Bank-side, or corner of a Hedge, and then walk away; you may set what number of Trap-cages you think convenient. Do what is here proposed, and you need not doubt the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of your desires satisfied.</p>
                        <p>Having taken your <hi>Nightingales,</hi> (the times is in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>August</hi>) tye the ends of their Wings with some brown Thread, that so they may be disenabled to hurt themselves by beating their tender bodies against the top and Wyres of the Cage.</p>
                        <p>Let the Cage be covered above half with green Bays, and for four or five days let him be very little distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by company; but withal forget not to feed them half a dozen times every day with Sheeps-heart and Egg shred very fine, and mingle red Ants therewith, and a few red Earth-worms would not do amiss.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that no <hi>Nightingale</hi> at first taking will eat any other food than what is living, as Worms,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100171:170"/>
Ants, Flies, or Caterpillars; which through sullenness if he will not eat, then take him out, and upon the point of a Stick (first opening his Bill) give him four or five gobbets one after another; then turn him into the Cage, strowing the bottom thereof with Egg and minced Sheeps-heart mingled with some Pismires. These <hi>Nightingales</hi> that are taken at this time of the year, will not sing till the middle of <hi>October,</hi> and then they will hold in song till the middle of <hi>June:</hi> But the <hi>Nightingales</hi> that are taken from the first of <hi>April</hi> to the twentieth, are the best Birds for Song in the whole Universe; and these are taken with Trap-cages or Trap-nets, as the Branchers aforesaid, in <hi>June, July;</hi> and <hi>August.</hi> Here observe, that Nestlings nor Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers (except they have an old Bird to sing over them) have not the true Song for the first twelve months. When you have so tamed them that they begin to <hi>Cur</hi> and <hi>Sweet</hi> with chearfulness, and record softly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it is a certain signe that they eat, and then you need not trouble your self with feeding them; but if they sing before they feed, they commonly prove most excellent Birds: Those Birds that are long a feeding, and make no <hi>Curring</hi> nor <hi>Sweeting,</hi> are not worth the keeping. If you have a Bird that will flutter and bolt up his head in the night against the top of the Cage, keep him not, for he is not onely good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but his bad example will teach the best of your Birds to do the like.</p>
                        <p>Now to the intent you may not keep Hens instead of Cocks, and so not onely be at useless charge, but be frustrated of your expectation, you shall distinguish their Sexes by these observations. The Cock in the judgment of some is both longer and bigger: others say the Cock hath a greater Eye, a longer Bill, and a Tail more reddish: others pretend to know them by the Pinion of the Wing, and Feathers on the Head.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100171:171"/>
These Rules I look not upon as infallible, having found them contrary to truth by my own experience: Now to undeceive you, take these true Experimental Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations. First, take notice that if any of your Nest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings (before they can feed themselves) do Record a little to themselves, and in their Recording you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Throats to wag, you need not doubt that they are Cocks; but when they come to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the Hen will Record as well as the Cock; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mark them when young, for it is very difficult to distinguish afterwards.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Branchers,</hi> whether Cocks or Hens (when taken and do feed themselves) will Record; but the Cock does it much longer, louder, and oftener.</p>
                        <p>The best sort of <hi>Nightingales</hi> frequent High-ways, Orchards, and sing close by houses: these when taken will feed soonest, being more acquainted with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of people; and after their feeding will grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, and sing speedily. Observe, not to untye too soon the Wings of your <hi>Nightingale;</hi> for if he be not very familiar and tame when he is untyed, he will be apt to beat himself against the Cage, and so spoil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                        <p>Now as to their Diseases and Cures, observe this, that at the latter end of <hi>August</hi> they grow very fat, either abroad or in a Cage: when it begins to abate when they do not sing, it is a dangerous signe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to remedy this, keep them very warm, giving them Saffron in their meat or water: when you perceive the growth of their fat, purge them thrice a Week for a Month, either with a Worm which is found in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon-houses, or with a speckled Spider, which you may find plentifully about Vines, Currans, or Goose-berry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes in <hi>August,</hi> and at no time else. If they are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, put into their Drinking-pot some Liquorish with a little white Sugar-candy, giving them to feed
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100171:171"/>
on Sheeps-heart shred small, some Meal-worms, and Eggs mingled with Pismires. It is strange that some of these Birds when fat will fast three weeks, which I have known; but it is better when they eat.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nightingales</hi> kept in a Cage two or three years, are subject to the Gout: for their Cure, take fresh Butter and anoint their Feet four or five days, and they will be well again. Here note, that for want of keeping them clean, their Feet are clog'd, and then their Claws will rot off, and are subject to Gout and Cramp, and will take no delight in themselves; to prevent these mischiefs, put dry Sand into the bottom of their Cages.</p>
                        <p>They are likewise troubled with Aposthumes and breaking out about their Eyes and Neb; for which, use Gapons-grease. And thus much of the Diseases of the <hi>Nightingale.</hi>

                           <hi>Of the</hi> CANARY-BIRD.</head>
                        <p>THough many of these Birds are lately brought from <hi>Germany,</hi> and therefore are called by the name of that Country, yet undoubtedly their Original procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Canary-Islands. They are in colour much like our <hi>Green-birds,</hi> but differ much in their Song and Nature; and in this they differ from all Birds: For as others are subject to be fat, the Cocks of these never are, by reason of the greatness of their mettle, and their lavish singing; either of these will not suffer him to keep hardly flesh upon his back.</p>
                        <p>The best of them are shaped long, standing straight and boldly.</p>
                        <p>Before you buy either these <hi>German</hi> or <hi>Canary-birds,</hi> hear them sing, and then you will know how to please
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100171:172"/>
your Ear or fancy, either with Sweet-song, Lavish-note, or Long-song, which is best, having most variety of Notes. Some like those that <hi>whisk</hi> and <hi>chew</hi> like unto a <hi>Tit-lark;</hi> others are for those that begin like a <hi>Skie-lark,</hi> and so continue their Song with a long, yet sweet Note; a third sort are for those that begin their Song with the <hi>Skie-lark,</hi> and then run upon the Notes of the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> which is very pleasant if he does it well: The last is for a loud Note and lavish, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no more in it than a noise.</p>
                        <p>If you would know whether your <hi>Canary-bird</hi> be in health before you purchase him, take him out of the Store-cage, and put him into a clean Cage alone; where if he stand boldly without crouching, without shrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Feathers, and his Eyes looking brisk and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; these are good signes of a healthy Bird: But now observe, if he bolts his Tail like a <hi>Nightingale</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath dunged, if shews he is not well; though he seem lively for the present, there is some Distemper near attending: likewise if he either dung very thin and watry, or of a slimy white, and no blackness in it; these are dangerous signes of death approaching.</p>
                        <p>These Birds are subject to many Diseases, as Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthumes which afflict their head, and are of a yellow colour, causing a great heaviness, and withal a falling from the Pearch, and death ensuing, if this Malady be not speedily cured. The most approved Cure is to make an Ointment of fresh Butter and Capons-grease melted together, and anoint therewith the Bird's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posthume three or four days together: if it become soft, open it gently and let out the matter; then anoint the place with some of the same Ointment, and this will immediately cure him: during the Cure, give him Figs, and Liquorish, and white Sugar-candy in his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Canary-birds</hi> above three years old are called <hi>Runts;</hi>
                           <pb n="163" facs="tcp:100171:172"/>
at two years old they are called <hi>Eriffs;</hi> and those of the first year are called <hi>Branchers;</hi> when they are new flown and cannot feed themselves, they are called <hi>Pushers;</hi> and those that are brought up by hand, <hi>Nest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi> Now since there are but few <hi>Canary-birds</hi> which breed in <hi>England,</hi> it being so great a trouble to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, I shall here insert nothing concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering when they intend or begin to build; what things are necessary for them when they begin to breed; how to order them when they have young ones; or how to breed the young ones when taken out of the Nest: Those who intend to be informed of every thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, may easily be instructed by applying themselves to several <hi>Germans</hi> in and about the City, who make it their business to breed <hi>Canary-birds</hi> after the best (<hi>German</hi>) fashion.</p>

                        <p>AS some do esteem the <hi>Nightingale</hi> to be the best Singing-bird in the World, so in my opinion the <hi>Black-bird</hi> is the worst; yet they are as frequently kept as their betters, and are in great estimation amongst the Vulgar; for no other reason that I know, than for the loudness and coarseness of his Song, as they are Borish in their Speech, and have little but rusticity in their Conditions. To be short, he is better to be eaten than kept, and is much sweeter to the Palate when dead, than to the Ear when living.</p>
                        <p>She builds her Nest upon old Stumps of Trees by Ditch-sides, or in thick Hedges. As they begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that is, in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> (when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the Woods are full of Snow) so they breed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100171:173"/>
often, that is, three or four times a year, according as they lose their Nest.</p>
                        <p>The young <hi>Black-birds</hi> are brought up almost with any meat whatsoever; but above all, they love Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, Sheeps-heart, hard Eggs, and white Bread and Milk mixt together.</p>
                        <p>This Bird sings somewhat more than three months in the year; his Note, as I said, is harsh, therefore to adde a value to him, let him be taught to whistle; yet put Song and Whistle together, in my judgment it is fitter for a large Inne than a Lady's Chamber.</p>

                        <p>The first is the largest of all the five, and the most beautiful; it feeds for the most part on the Berries of Mistletoe: and since that they are so good against the Falling-sickness and Convulsions, these <hi>Throstles,</hi> when dried and pulverized and drank in the water of Mistle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe, or Black-cherry-water, are much more effectual against those two Distempers. He sings but little, and therefore though the young ones are easie to be brought up, being hardy, yet he is not worth the keeping; for his Notes are rambling and confused, yet not lavish neither.</p>
                        <p>The second is the <hi>Felfare,</hi> who comes into <hi>England</hi> before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and goes away about the beginning of <hi>March.</hi> In hard weather they feed on Hips and Haws; but when it is indifferently warm, there being neither Frost nor Snow on the ground, they feed on young Grass and Worms.</p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:100171:173"/>
                        <p>They breed upon certain Rocks near the Scotish Shore three or four times a year, and are there in very great numbers: They are not so fit for the Cage as the Spit, having a most lamentable untun'd chattering tone: in Frost and Snow they are very fat, and then are most delicate food; but being killed in open wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are so bitter, that they are not worth the eating.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Wind-throstle,</hi> (or <hi>Whindle</hi>) which travels with the <hi>Felfare</hi> out of the North, is a smaller Bird, with a dark red under his Wing. He breeds in Woods and Shaws as <hi>Song-throstles</hi> use to do, and hath an indifferent Song, exceeding the two former; but yet they are fitter for the Pot or Spit than for a Cage of Avery.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is the <hi>Wood-song-thrustle,</hi> and sings most incomparably, both lavishly, and with variety of Notes: To adde to his estimation, he sings at least nine of the twelve months in the year.</p>
                        <p>They build about the same time, place, and manner as the <hi>Black-bird</hi> does: her policy in the building of her Nest is much to be admired, since the composure cannot be mended by the art of Man: Besides the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious building, she leaves a little hole in the bottom of her Nest, as I conceive to let out the Water, if a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent shower should come, that so her Eggs or young ones may not be drowned.</p>
                        <p>They go very soon to Nest if the Weather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, and breed three times a year, that is, in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April, May</hi> and <hi>June;</hi> but the first Birds u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually prove the best.</p>
                        <p>Take them in the Nest when they are fourteen days old, and keep them warm and clean, not suffering them to sit on their Dung, but so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it, that they dung over the Nest. Feed them with raw Meat and some Bread chopped together
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100171:174"/>
with bruised Hemp-seed, wetting your Bread before you mingle it with the meat.</p>
                        <p>Being throughly fledg'd, put them into a Cage where they may have room enough, with two or three Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and some Moss at the bottom of the Cage, to keep them clean; for otherwise they will be troubled with the Cramp, and for want of delighting in themselves the singing will be spoil'd.</p>
                        <p>Bread and Hemp-seed is as good food for them as can be given: and be mindful of furnishing them at least twice a week with fresh water, that they may bathe and prune themselves therein, otherwise they will not thrive.</p>
                        <p>The fifth and last is the <hi>Heath-throstle,</hi> which is the least we have in <hi>England,</hi> having a dark breast. Some are of opinion that this bird exceeds the <hi>Song-throstle,</hi> having better Notes, and neater Plume.</p>
                        <p>The Hen builds by the Heath-side in a Furz-bush, or stump of an old Haw-thorn, and makes not Shaws and Woods her haunt as other <hi>Throstles</hi> do. She begins not to breed till the middle of <hi>April,</hi> and breeds but twice in a year; and if kept clean and well fed, will sing three parts in four of the whole year. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of breeding is in like-sort as the former.</p>
                        <p>To know the Cock from the Hen, according to old Country-judgment, is to chuse the top-bird of the Nest, which commonly is most fledg'd. Others think that to be the Cock which hath the largest Eye, and most spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles on his breast. Others chuse the Cock by the pinion of his Wing, if it hath a very dark black that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross it; but above all, chuse him thus: If his Gullet be white with black streaks on each side, his spots on his Breast large and black, having his head of a light shining brown, with black streaks under each Eye and upon the pinion of the Wing; these are the best marks that ever I observed.</p>

                        <p>IT is the opinion of some, that this little King of Birds for sweetness of Note comes not much short of the <hi>Nightingale.</hi> It is a very tender Bird, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must have its Cage lined. They breed very early in the Spring, and commonly thrice a year.</p>
                        <p>When the young are about ten days old, take them from the old ones, and keep them in a little Bower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basket: if they tarry long in the Nest, they will be sullen, and therefore more difficultly brought up: you must feed them as you feed the <hi>Nightingale</hi> in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects: finding them grow strong, put them into a Cage, put Moss in the bottom thereof, and let them stand warm.</p>
                        <p>The way of taking a <hi>Robin-red-breast</hi> is so easie and common, that every Boy knows how to take him in a Pit-fall; but with a Trap-cage and a Meal-worm you may take half a score in a day: Hearing them sing, keep those birds which most delight you. If you take any without hearing them sing, thus you shall know whether he be Cock or Hen; if a Cock, his breast will be of a darker red, and his red will go farther up upon the head than the Hens.</p>

                        <p>THis Bird in my opinion is a pretty sweet dapper Songster, being of a nature chearful; as he is pleasant to the Ear, so he is to the Eye; and when he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100171:175"/>
sings cocks up his Tail, and throws out his Notes with so much alacrity and pleasure, that I know not any bird of its bigness more delights the sense of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                        <p>This Bird builds twice a year, about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> in shrubs where Ivy grows thick, and sometimes in old Hovels and Barns. They lay a numerous quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Eggs; and I can assure you I have seen a Nest containing two and twenty: herein are two things greatly to be wondred at; first, that so small a bird should cover such a great quantity of Eggs; secondly, when they have hatched, to feed them all, and not to miss one bird, and in the dark also.</p>
                        <p>Their second time of breeding is in the middle of <hi>June:</hi> of either breed, what you intend to keep must be taken out of the Nest at thirteen or fourteen days old. Let their food be Sheeps-heart and Egg minced very small, or Calves or Heifers-heart; but be sure to clear them of the Fat and Sinews, which must be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule to be observed for all Meat-birds. Feed them in the Nest every day very often, but a little at a time; let the instrument you feed them with be a Stick; and when you observe them to pick it off of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, then eage them, and putting meat to them in a little Pan, and about the sides of the Cage, to entice them to eat; however, have a care to feed them too, lest they neglect themselves and die. When they can feed themselves very well, give them once in three days a Spider or two. You may teach them to whistle tunes if you so desire it; for they are easily taught, being a bird that's very docible. Here note, if they be fed with Paste, they will live longer than if they fed upon Hearts. The brownest and largest of the young <hi>Wrens</hi> are the Cocks.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>SOme prefer the <hi>Wood-lark</hi> before the <hi>Nightingale;</hi> but it is of this bird as all others, some are more excellent in length and sweetness of Song.</p>
                        <p>This bird breeds the soonest of any we have, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his extraordinary mettlesomeness: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they are not taken in the beginning of <hi>February</hi> at least, they grow so rank that they will prove good for nothing.</p>
                        <p>The places this bird most delights in are gravelly grounds, and Hills lying towards the Orient, and in Oat-stubs. Their building is in your Laiers grounds, where the Grass is rank and russet, making their Nests of Bennet-grass, or dead Grass of the field under some large Tuffet, to shelter them from the injury of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>This Bird hath very excellent pleasant Notes, with great variety, insomuch that I have observed some have had almost thirty several Notes; which if they sing lavish, is a most ravishing melody or harmony, if the <hi>Nightingale</hi> joyn in consort.</p>
                        <p>These Birds are never bred from the Nests as ever I could hear: I have several times attempted it, but to no purpose; for notwithstanding my greatest care, they died in a Week, either of the Cramp or Scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                        <p>The times of the year to take them are <hi>June, July, August;</hi> and then they are called young <hi>Branchers,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not yet moulted. They are taken likewise at the latter end of <hi>September;</hi> but having then moulted, the young and old are not distinguishable.</p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:100171:176"/>
                        <p>Lastly, they are taken from the beginning of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> to the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> at which time they are all coupled and returned to their Breeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places.</p>
                        <p>The way to take them in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> is with an Hobby, after this manner: get out in a dewy Morning, and go to the sides of some Hills which lie to the rising of the Sun, where they most usually fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and having sprung them, observe where they fall; then surround them twice or thrice with your Hobby on your Fist, causing him to hover when you draw near, by which means they will lie still till you clap a Net over them, which you carry on the point of a Stick.</p>
                        <p>If three or four go together, take a Net like one made for <hi>Partridges:</hi> when you go with a Setting-dog onely, the Mesh must be smaller, that is, a Lark-mesh; and then your Hobby to the <hi>Lark</hi> is like a Setting-dog to <hi>Partridges,</hi> and with your Net at one draught you may take the whole flock.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Wood-lark</hi> that is taken in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> will sing presently, but will not last long, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their moulting. That which is taken in <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> and <hi>February</hi> will sing in five or six days, or sooner; and these are the best, being taken in full stomack, and are more perfect in their Song than those taken at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seasons.</p>
                        <p>If in the Cage you find him grow poor at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring, give him every two or three days a Turff of Three-leav'd-grass, (as is used to the <hi>Skie-lark</hi>) and boil him a Sheeps-heart and mince it small, mingling it among his Bread, Egg, and Hemp-seed, which will cause him to thrive extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily.</p>
                        <p>If he be troubled with Lice, (a Distemper he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly afflicted withal) take him out of the Cage, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100171:176"/>
smoak him with Tobacco; give him fresh gravel, and set him in a hot place where the Sun shines, and this will cure him if he have strength to bask in the Sand.</p>
                        <p>If you would have him sing lavish, feed him with Sheeps-heart, Egg, Bread and Hemp-seed mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put into his water a little Liquorish, white Sugar-candy, and Saffron: Let this be done once a week.</p>
                        <p>Upon the first taking of your <hi>Wood-lark</hi> thus must you do; you must put into your Cage two Pans, one for minc'd meat, and another for Oat-meal and whole Hemp-seed. Then having boil'd an Egg hard, take the crums of white Bread; the like quantity of Hemp-seed pounded in a Mortar, and mingle your Bread and it with your Egg minc'd very small, and give it him. Let there be at the bottom of the Cage fine red Gravel, and let it be shifted every week at farthest; for he delights to bask in the Sand, which will not be convenient if foul'd with his Dung. Let the pearch of the Cage be lin'd with green Bays, or which is better, make a pearch of a Mat: and lest they should not find the Pan so soon as they should do, to prevent famine, strew upon the Sand some Oat-meal and Hemp-seed.</p>
                        <p>How to know the Cock is thus: first, the largeness and length of his Call: Secondly, his tall walking: Thirdly, at Evenings the doubling of his Note, which Artists call <hi>Cuddling;</hi> but if you hear him sing strong, you cannot be deceived.</p>
                        <p>Here note, that if a Bird sings not that is taken in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>January</hi> within one month after, you may conclude him not worth the keeping, or else is an Hen infallibly.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Wood-lark</hi> as it is naturally endewed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable notes, so it is a tender Bird, and difficult to be kept; but if rightly ordered, and well look'd to,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100171:177"/>
will be a most delightful Songster to its Master growing better and better every year even to the very last.</p>
                        <p>These Birds are very subject to the Cramp, Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness in the Head, and to Louziness. The best reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to prevent the Cramp, is to shift the Cage often with fresh Gravel, otherwise the Dung will clog to their feet which causeth the Cramp. The giddiness of the Head proceedeth from feeding upon much Hemp-seed: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this distemper, give him some Gentles, (the common Bait for Fisher-men) Hog-lice, Emmets and their Eggs, with Liquorish, all put into water, we serve in their stead, and will cure immediately. Louzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (which causeth leanness in this bird) is cured as said before by smoaking Tobacco.</p>

                        <p>THere is a great difference between one <hi>Skie-lark</hi> and another; for one may not be worth two pence, when another shall be worth two pounds.</p>
                        <p>This Bird is very hardy, and will live upon any food in a manner, so that he have but once a weeks Turff of Three-leav'd-grass. As the <hi>Wood-lark</hi> hath young ones in <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>Skie-lark</hi> hath rarely any till the middle of <hi>May.</hi> They commonly build in Corr or thick high grass Meadows, and seldom have more than four: take them at a fortnight old, and at fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> give them minced sheeps-heart with a chopt hard Egg mingled: when they can feed alone, give them Bread Hemp-seed, and Oat-meal; let the Bread be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100171:177"/>
with Egg, and the Hemp-seed bruised: Let them have Sand in the bottom of their Cage; Pearches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are to no purpose.</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>Wood-lark</hi> is taken with Net and Hobby, so may the <hi>Skie-lark</hi> be taken also. They are taken like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in dark nights with a Trammel; this Net is about six and thirty yards long, and six yards over, run through with six ribs of Pack-thread; which ribs at the ends are put upon two Poles sixteen foot long, made taper at each end, and so is carried between two men half a yard from the ground; every six steps touching the ground, to cause the Birds to fly up, otherwise you may carry the Net over them without disturbing them: hearing them fly against the Net, clap it down, and they are safe under it. This is a very murdering Net, taking all sorts of birds that it comes near, as <hi>Partridges, Quails, Woodcocks, Snipes, Felfares,</hi> and what not, almost in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very dark night.</p>
                        <p>The next way of taking them is with a pair of Day-nets and a Glass, which is incomparable pastime in a Frosty Morning. These Nets are commonly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Foot deep, and Fifteen long, knit with your French Mesh, and very fine Thread. These Nets take all sorts of small Birds that come within their Compass, as <hi>Bunting-larks,</hi> and <hi>Linnets</hi> in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                        <p>These <hi>Larks</hi> are also taken by a Low-bell, with a great light carried in a Tub both by one man, and the Net by another; this Bell and Light so amazeth them, that they lie as dead, and stir not till the Net overcast them. By this Bell are all sorts of Fowls and Birds taken, as <hi>Partridge</hi> and <hi>Pheasant;</hi> and if the Bell be loowd, or very deep, <hi>Duck, Mallard, Woodcock,</hi> and <hi>Snipe</hi> may be taken.</p>
                        <p>The last way of taking <hi>Larks</hi> is in a great Snow, by taking an hundred or two hundred yards
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100171:178"/>
of Pack-thread, fastning at every six inches a Noose made with Horse-hair; two hairs are sufficient. Now since I have already described this way of taking <hi>Larks,</hi> I shall desist, and onely inform you that those <hi>Larks</hi> you intend to preserve for singing, must be taken in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November:</hi> Chuse the straightest, largest, and loftiest Bird, and he that hath most white on his Tail, for these are the marks of the Cock. Observe in this Bird, as in all others, that you give no salt Meat, nor Bread season'd with salt.</p>

                        <p>THeir Nests are usually in Thorn-bushes and Furt-bushes; and some of the hotter sort of them will breed four times a year. The young ones may be taken at four days old, if you intend to teach them to whistle, or learn the Song of other Birds: for being so young, they know not the tune of the old Bird. Being so young, keep them very warm, and feed them often, and a little at a time: there must be bruised soaked Rape-seeds, with the like quantity of white bread, of which there must be fresh made every day to prevent sowring, which will make them scowr to death: let not their Meat be too dry, for fear of being Vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt. If you intend they shall whistle, do you whistle to them in the time of Feeding, being more apt to learn before they can crack hard seeds. Whatever Bird you intend your <hi>Linnet</hi> shall learn his Notes of, hang him under it, and he will perfectly imitate him: nay, so docible this Bird is, as I have been credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that some of them have been taught to speak. To know the Cock from the Hen, must not alway
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100171:178"/>
be discovered by their Breasts; but the Cock is best known by the brownness of his Back and the white in his Wing; that is to say, take your young <hi>Linnet</hi> when the Wing-feathers are grown, and stretch out his Wing, holding his body fast with the other hand; and then observe the white upon the fourth, fifth, and sixth Feather; if it cast a glistering white, and the white goes close to the Quil, this is a sure sign of a Cock.</p>
                        <p>Many are the Diseases of this Bird, as the Ptisick, known by his panting, staring Feathers, lean Breast, and spilling his Seeds up and down the Cage; and this Disease happens for want of Water, or for want of green Meat in the Spring: He is troubled also with Streins or Convulsions of the Breast: Sometimes he is afflicted with hoarsness in his voice, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strein'd in singing: he is sometimes melancholy, at other times afflicted with scowring, of which there are three sorts; the first is thin, and with a black or white substance in the middle, not very dangerous; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is between a black and white, clammy and stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is bad; but the third and last is most mortal, which is the white clammy scowring: The several Cures I shall not here set down for brevity sake, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the care of the Bird-merchant.</p>

You must take the young ones with the Nest at ten days old, and feed them after this manner: Take some of the best Hemp-seed, pound it, sift it, and mix it with the like quantity of white bread, with some flower of Canary-seeds; and taking up the quantity of a white Pea upon a small Stick, feed them therewith three or four bits at a time, making fresh every day: You must keep these Birds very warm till they can feed themselves, for their nature is very tender.</p>
                        <p>For the purgation of this Bird, as well as all others which feed on Hemp-seed, take the seeds of Mellons, Succory, and Mercury, which is a principal Herb for the <hi>Linnet;</hi> but the best for the <hi>Gold-finch</hi> are Lettice and Plantain; and nothing can be more wholesome for him than Wall or Loom-earth, and some fine Sand, and a lump or two of Sugar put always into his Cage.</p>

                        <p>THis Bird is very short in his Song, and no variety in it; yet some fancy him for his <hi>Whisking, Turring,</hi> and <hi>Chewing:</hi> He commonly appears at that time of the year that the <hi>Nightingale</hi> does, which is the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and leaves us at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>September:</hi> They are fed when taken as the <hi>Nightingale;</hi> you must cram him at first, for he will not feed himself, by reason he always feeds on live

meat in the field, for which cause he is unacquainted with the meat we offer him: when he comes to feed of himself, he will eat what the <hi>Wood-lark</hi> eats, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most any other meat.</p>
                        <p>This Bird breeds about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and builds her Nest on the ground by some Pond-side or Ditch-side, and feeds her young with Caterpillars or Flies. They are easily brought up being hardy, and are not subject to Colds or Cramps as other Birds are, but live long if preserved with care. If you breed up this Bird young and cleanly, you may please your self with his Song; all that I can say of it is, <hi>Short and sweet.</hi>

                        <p>THere is no scarcity of this Bird, and in my mind fitter for the Spit than a Cage, having but one short plain Song, yet for that he is admired by some, and kept very charily.</p>
                        <p>They build their Nests in Hedges and Trees of all sorts, and have young ones twice or thrice a year; they are seldom bred up from the Nest, because they are not apt to take another Birds Song, nor to whistle. The <hi>Essex-finch</hi> is best both for length of Song, and variety, concluding it with several Notes very prettily. He is very little subject to any Disease, onely he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to be very lousie, if he be not sprinkled with a little Wine twice or thrice a month.</p>

                        <p>THis Bird is generally kept by all sorts of people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any other bird for whistling; but their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test fault is, they have them too fledg'd out of the Nest, and that makes them retain commonly so much of their own harsh Notes: therefore those who do intend to have them excellent, and avoid their own squeaking Notes, must take them from the old ones at the end of three or four days; and thus you must do to all birds you would learn to whistle, or speak, or learn another birds Song by hanging under him.</p>

                        <p>THis Bird is a Fore-runner of the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> and is of a very sullen dogged temper in a cage; but abroad is very chearful, and hath a very pleasant kind of whistling Song.</p>
                        <p>The Cock is fair and beautifully coloured, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the eye. They breed thrice a year; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>April,</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> and towards the latter end of <hi>June.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They build usually in holes of hollow Trees, or under house-eaves: She is the shiest bird I know of her building; for when she is about her Nest, if she perceive any look on, she forsakes it; and if you touch an Egg she never comes more to the Nest, and if she have young ones and you do the like, she will either starve them, or break their Necks over the Nest.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100171:180"/>
Now though the old ones are thus dogged, yet if you bring up their young, their nature will alter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very tame.</p>
                        <p>You must take them out of the Nest about ten days old; if they stay longer, they will learn somewhat of the old one's sullen temper. You must feed them with Sheeps-heart and Eggs chopped and mixt together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the quantity of three white Peas, upon the end of a Stick, when they open their mouths: when they will thus feed, put them into a Cage with meat about it, and a Pan of meat therein; and though he feed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet it will be very sparingly for four or five days, wherefore you must now and then feed him your self. Keep him warm in the Winter, and he will sing as well in the night as the day.</p>

You may feed them with white Bread and Rape bruised and soaked together: He is apter to take the Whistle than another Bird's Song.

                           <hi>Of the</hi> HEDGE-SPARROW.</head>
                        <p>THis is not so despicable a bird as some would have it; for if you will mind its Song, you will find very delightful Notes, and sings early in the Spring with great variety. Old or young become tame very quickly, and will sing in a short time after they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; so that you take them at the latter end of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> or beginning of <hi>February:</hi> they will feed almost on any thing you give them.</p>
                        <p>They commonly build in a White-thorn or private Hedge, laying Eggs much different from other Birds, being of a very fine blue colour. This Bird is very tractable, and will take any bird's Song almost, if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken young out of the Nest. I shall only speak a few Experiments of others, and deliver some Observations of my own concerning the length of Birds lives, and which are most proper for whistling, and so shall end this Treatise.</p>
                        <p>First, As to the length of Birds Lives: Among <hi>Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales</hi> some live but one year, some three, some five, some eight, and some twelve; singing better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the first seven or eight years, and after that decline by little and little: They must have careful keepers that can preserve their lives to the fifth year;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100171:181"/>
experience informs us, where one lives to that age, an hundred die.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Wood-lark</hi> seldom lives in a Cage above six years, and hardly five.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Robin-red-breast</hi> rarely lives above seven years; for he is a tender Bird, and much subject to the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-sickness, Cramp, and Oppression of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Skie-lark</hi> as he is a hardy Bird, so he is long liv'd also. All sorts of Seed-birds live longer than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny soft-beak'd Birds, especially the <hi>Canary</hi> and <hi>Linnet.</hi> I have known a <hi>Canary-bird</hi> live and sing within a year of twenty; in like manner the <hi>Linnet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So much as to the Lives of Singing Birds; let us now consider which are most fit for Whistling.</p>
                        <p>In the first place I look upon the <hi>Starling</hi> to be the best; and never heard better than at the <hi>Grey-Hound</hi> in St. <hi>Mary Ax,</hi> taught and sold by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Master of that House. But since I have spoken of the <hi>Starling</hi> and <hi>Bull-finch</hi> already, I shall insist no farther.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Black-bird</hi> hath a kind of rude Whistle; and if young taken out of the Nest, is very apt to learn.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Robin-red-breast</hi> is a most incomparable Bird for the Whistle, and to Speak also. A <hi>Robin</hi> is a hot-mettled Bird, and therefore he must not be in the hearing of another; wherefore if you breed two, let them be separated into two several Rooms, that they may not hear, and so consequently spoil each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Canary-bird</hi> will learn to Whistle any thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, if taken young out of the Nest, otherwise not; for being a very hot-mettled Bird, he will run upon his own Song do what you can.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Linnet</hi> will learn any Tune almost, if not too
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100171:182"/>
long, and too full of variety. Learn him one Tune first, then another, keeping him dark and still, out of the noise of other Birds.</p>
                        <p>Take this for a general Rule for all Birds, That the younger they be, the better they will prove, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your expectation for all your trouble and pains in bringing up and keeping them.</p>

                     <head>OF FISHING. The Introduction.</head>
                     <p>ANGLING is an excellent Art, which as it pleads great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, so the knowledge thereof is with much difficulty to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: and indeed it bears some similitude to Poetry in this, that as it is said, <hi>Poeta nascitur, non fit,</hi> so ought the <hi>Piscator</hi> or Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-man to have a natural inclination unto the Art of Angling, or his knowledge therein will be always dull and imperfect; not but that it may be much heightned by practice and experience.</p>
                     <p>Now he that intends to be his Crafts-master in this harmless Pastime or Recreation, must not onely diligently search and enquire into the mysteries and depths of this Art, but must also be furnished, as aforesaid, with a natural propensity thereunto, attended with observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Patience: And having gotten by observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionand practice a competent knowledge, or having
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100171:188"/>
conquer'd the difficulties of Angling, it will then not onely prove pleasant, but profitable, and be like Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, a Reward to it self.</p>
                     <p>Now that I may farther commend this ingenious profession, be pleased to take notice of the Antiquity thereof; some saying it is as ancient as <hi>Deucalion's</hi> Flood. Some attribute it to the invention of one <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> the first Author of vertuous Recreations. Others say that <hi>Seth</hi> left the knowledge of Angling to his posterity ingraven on brazen Pillars with the first Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the Mathematicks, and other useful Arts; by which means they were preserved from perishing in the universal Deluge</p>
                     <p>Divers are the opinions of men concerning the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of this Art: let it suffice, that certainly it is older than Christ's Incarnation; for both <hi>Job</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> make mention of Fish-hooks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently there must be Anglers then in those days</p>
                     <p>The next thing that offers it self in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Art, is the benefit of Contemplation, which is acquired hereby; which is a thing (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of some learned Cloister'd men) to be preferred before Action, because say they) it makes us mortals the nearer to come to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by way of imitation; for he is all Contemplation of his own infinite Power Goodness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But waving this, I cannot let slip the expression of an ingenious Forreiner, who said, <hi>That Rivers and the Inhabitants of the watry Element were made for wise men to contemplate, and fools to pass by without conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Modesty will not permit me to rank my self in the number of the first; and I shall endeavour to clear my self from the scandal of the last, by giving you a short account of Rivers and their watry Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
                     <p>I shall first discourse of Rivers: one whereof I have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100171:188"/>
read of, scituate in <hi>Epirus,</hi> which hath a strange double and contrar property; the one is, that it will extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish any Torch that is lighted: and the other is, to light a Torch never lighted before.</p>
                     <p>The River <hi>Silarus</hi> in a few hours will (as report saith) convert a Rod into Stone. And I my self know a Lough in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that in some years will convert Wood into Stone, of which are made the best Hones. <hi>Cambden</hi> makes mention of a Well near <hi>Kerby</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> that ebbs and flows several times every day.</p>
                     <p>The same Author makes mention of the River <hi>Mole</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> which, running several miles under ground, being opposed by Hills, at last breaks out again so far off, that the Inhabitants thereabout boast (as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the River <hi>Ama</hi>) that they feed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Flocks of Sheep on a green Bridge. There is such another green Bridge in <hi>Wales,</hi> the River running a great way under ground, and there di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emboguing it self into the Sea. Some thereabout report, that they have put a living Goose into the Hole where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falls, and she hath swum out at the other end; but with no Feathers on her back.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas May</hi> in his History of <hi>The Reign of King Henry the Second,</hi> relates two strange things from <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldus Cambrensis,</hi> of certain Wells in <hi>Ireland.</hi> His Words are these:</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>A Well there is in <hi>Munster</hi> to be seen,</l>
                        <l>Within whose Waters whosoe're hath been</l>
                        <l>Once drench'd, his Hair streight takes an hoary dye.</l>
                        <l>Another Fountain of quite contrary</l>
                        <l>Effect to that in <hi>Ulster</hi> Springs; for there</l>
                        <l>Those that have washed once, how old soe're,</l>

                     <p>Another thing, though against Nature, yet for the strangeness of it I cannot choose but relate, and that is of a certain River near <hi>Harwood</hi> in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> which in the year of our Lord 1399, (a little before the Civil Wars between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> burst forth) of a sudden stood still, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it felf asunder, so that men might pass three miles together on foot down the midst of the Channel, leaving the Waters like a Wall behind them. Speed in his Descript. <hi>Bedford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall conclude with two of the strangest Rivers that ever were heard of. The first is a River called <hi>Eleusina,</hi> which is so merrily disposed, (if you will believe a man of no less Authority than <hi>Aristotle)</hi> that it will dance to a Fiddle, bubling at the noise of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, and will grow very muddy; but as soon as the Musick ceaseth, it ceaseth its motion, returning to its former calmness and clearness. The other is as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and (if you will believe <hi>Josephus</hi> that learned <hi>Jew)</hi> it is a River in <hi>Judaea,</hi> which runs very swisth all the six days of the Week, but resteth on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, which is the Jewish Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>And now a word or two concerning Fish: Plin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saith, That Nature's great and wonderful powers more demonstrated in the Sea than on the Land: and this may appear by those numerous and various Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which inhabit in and about that Element; which will appear more at large, if you will read their Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry written either by <hi>Rondeletius, Gesner, Johnstonus,</hi> or <hi>Aldrovandus.</hi> The number and the various shapes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> these Fishes are not more strange, than their different Natures, Inclinations and Actions. Give me leave to speak a little hereof.</p>
                     <p>There is a Fish called the <hi>Cuttle-fish,</hi> which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

small Fish to nibble at it, and by that means draws them near her by little and little, till coming within her reach, she leaps upon them and devours them: hence she is called the <hi>Sea-Angler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hermit</hi> is a Fish that when she grows old will seek out a dead Fish's shell, fit for her purpose, and there dwell secluded from all company, studying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than how to defend her self against the injuries of Wind and Weather.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sargus</hi> is a Fish so lascivious, (as <hi>Du-Bartas</hi> expresseth it rarely well) that when he cannot find change of Mates enough in the Sea, he will get ashore and Cuckold a Goat.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Goes courting She-Goats on the grassy Shore,</l>

                     <p>Whereas it is reported that the <hi>Mullet</hi> is so chast, that when she is deprived of her Mate, she will follow him to the shore and dye.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Torpedo,</hi> or <hi>Cramp-fish,</hi> is a Fish of so baneful and poysonous a nature, that all other Fish that come within her reach are immediately stupified and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion, so that they easily become her prey; nay, she will so suddenly convey her Poyson up the Rod and Line of the Angler, when she feels her self entangled, that his Hands and Arms immediately losing their strength, become nummed and senseless.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scolopendra</hi> hath as rare and strange a way of defending her self from the Anglers subtilty, as any Fish whatever, if we may credit the relation of <hi>Du-Bartas,</hi> whose words are these:</p>

                        <l>She hath as rare a Trick to rid her from it;</l>
                        <l>For instantly she all her Guts will vomit;</l>
                        <l>And having clear'd them from the danger, then</l>
                        <l>She fair and softly sups them in again,</l>
                        <l>So that not one of them within her Womb</l>
                        <l>Changeth his Office or his wonted room.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>The <hi>Remora</hi> is a Fish of so strange and secret a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty (and for that reason is often used for a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor) that as the same <hi>Du-Bartas</hi> saith,</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Let all the Winds in one Wind gather them,</l>

                        <l>Each lively handled by five lusty Rowers;</l>
                        <l>The <hi>Remora</hi> fixing her feeble Horn</l>
                        <l>Into the Tempest-beaten Vessels Stern,</l>
                        <l>Stays her Stone-still.</l>

                     <p>In the year of our Lord 1180, near <hi>Orford</hi> in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> there was a Fish taken in the perfect shape of a Man; he was kept by <hi>Bartholomew de Glanvile</hi> in the Castle of <hi>Orford</hi> above half a year; but at length, not being carefully looked to, he stole to the Sea, and was never seen after. He never spake, but would eat any Meat that was given him, especially raw Fish, when he had squeezed out the juice: He was often had to Church, but never shewed any sign of Adoration.</p>
                     <p>Let what is already spoken of Fish suffice, since it will not onely be impertinent to enlarge farther, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100171:190"/>
impossible here to give an account of the natures of all Fish: I shall therefore refer you to such Authors who have made it their business to write large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.</p>
                     <p>Before I put an end to this Introduction, permit me to insert something in the praise of <hi>Fishermen</hi> and <hi>Fishing.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>A short Encomium, or somewhat in Praise of <hi>Fisher-men</hi> and <hi>Fishing.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is very remarkable, that amongst the Twelve Holy Apostles there were four of them Fisher-men, whom our Saviour elected and inspired to preach the Gospel. And the reason that some give for this choice is, that he knew and found the hearts of such men naturally more fitted for Contemplation and quietness, having Spirits mild, sweet, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>Besides, our Saviour seems to have a more than common respect for their Ocupation, for two reasons. First, He never reproved these for their profession, as he did others, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scribes and Money-changers. Next, He dignified these poor Fisher-men with the priority of Nomination in the Catalogue of his Twelve Apostles. Nay, that which is more observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is this, that our Saviour took only three of these Fisher-men with him when he ascended the Mount to bear him company at his Transfiguration.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the lawfulness of Fishing, I think none can speak against it, since our Saviour himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded St. <hi>Peter</hi> to fish to pay <hi>Caesar</hi> his Tribute.</p>
                     <p>And as the Ancients have highly applauded and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100171:191"/>
of this ingenious Exercise, several of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's of old, in the height of their glory, having exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised themselves herein: so several of our eminent late Divines have done the like; as Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Perkins,</hi> Dr. <hi>Nowel</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Pauls London,</hi> and the incomparable Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> Provost of <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge, who was a great lover of Angling, and would frequently say thereof, that it was after his Study a Rest to his mind, a chearer to his Spirits, a diverter of sadness, a Calmer of unquiet thoughts, a Moderator of Passions, a procurer of Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and that it begot habits of Peace and Patience in those that profess and practice it. And thus I conclude the praise of <hi>Angling,</hi> though much more might be spoke thereof.</p>

                     <head>How to Improve Fish-ponds, and the Fish therein contained.</head>
                     <p>BEfore I shall lay down such Observations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, which with much pains and cost I have collected, to render a Fisher-man compleat in that delightful Exercise of taking Fish: I shall give an account of Ponds, and how they may in the best manner be improved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Imprimis.</hi> Consider the scituation of your Pond, and the nature of those Currents which run into it. In the next place, observe whether it be a Breeder, or not; if it be a Breeder, Experience will instruct you never to expect any large <hi>Carps</hi> from such Ponds, for the greatness of the number of the Spawn will over stock the Pond; therefore for large <hi>Carps</hi> a Store-pond is ever accounted best.</p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100171:191"/>
                     <p>Now to make a Breeding-pond become a Store-pond, when you cannot make a Store-pond become a Breeding-pond, thus you must do. When you sue your Pond, consider what quantity of <hi>Carps</hi> it will maintain; then put in all Milters, or all Spawners, by which means in a little time you will have Carps that are both large and fat beyond your expectation. By puting in but one Sex of them, there is an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of encreasing of them; but of the <hi>Roach</hi> it will notwithstanding multiply abundantly: Therefore it is needful, and altogether necessary for such who keep Breeding-ponds, to sue them once in three years, for fear of the encrease of <hi>Roaches,</hi> though none were ever put in, which may seem very strange, if the truth thereof could not be made manifest; as thus: there are several Ponds frequented by Wild-ducks, which usually come at nights to feed with the Tame ones there abiding: Now those Wild-ducks bring these <hi>Roaches</hi> with them, for their feeding amongst weeds in Rivers.</p>
                     <p>Besides the Spawn of <hi>Roaches</hi> will hang about their Feet and Feathers, which is washed off by the water of those Ponds they are accustomed to haunt; by which means in a few years they become so numerous though you your self did not put one into the Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pond; for which cause you sind your <hi>Carps</hi> so lean, and almost hunger starved.</p>
                     <p>By the way, give me leave to insert this true story. A Gentleman not far from the City of <hi>London,</hi> had a large pond of about four Acres of ground; a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman standing by at the suing thereof, and seeing not only a great quantity of Fish, but the best grown that ever he saw, he advised him to put in two or three hundred of stores of <hi>Carp,</hi> about three or four years growth, out of a pond that was over stocked, and to put Sixty of those he had taken out; which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100171:192"/>
accordingly he saw done, fancying to see stately <hi>Carps</hi> at the next suing.</p>
                     <p>After the expiration of four years, this Gentleman was advised to sue his Pond, to see what Monsters four years addition to their growth would produce; for those sixty <hi>Carps</hi> were from Eye to Fork from fifteen Inches to eighteen Inches when he put them in: now having sued his Pond, he found almost the whole number of his <hi>Carps;</hi> but they were in such a lean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he did not know them; for they were Monsters in Nature their heads being bigger than their whole bodies, and almost as heavy and this happened it seems by his own foll, by putting in but twenty <hi>Roaches;</hi> and when the Pond was sued there were bushels of small <hi>Roaches,</hi> and these <hi>Roaches</hi> eat up all the sweet feed from the <hi>Carps;</hi> for <hi>Roaches</hi> are like sheep to great Cattle, which eat up and devour all the sweet feed, and what affords the greatest nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Gentleman was very much frustrated of his expectation; and the Fish-monger which came from <hi>London</hi> to buy a penny-worth as soon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Monsters, he mounted his Horse, and rid as if the Devil drove him, not so much as bidding the Gentleman farewel. Here is to be noted, that Ponds which will not breed one <hi>Carp; Roaches</hi> in one year will multiply by thousands; therefore you must be careful every year to view your Pond, and observe if any such fry appears, lest when you come to sue your Pond, you be deceived in your expectation.</p>

                     <head>How to make <hi>Carps</hi> grow to an extraordinary bigness in a Pond.</head>
                     <p>PErceiving about the month of <hi>April</hi> that your pond begins to grow low in Water, then with an Iron-Rake,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100171:192"/>
rake all the sides of your pond where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is fallen away; then sow some Hay-seeds, and rake it well; by this means at the later end of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer there will be a great growth of Grass; which when winter comes, and the pond being raised by Rain to the Top, will overflow all that Grass; and then the <hi>Carps</hi> having water to carry them to the feed, will fill themselves, and in a short time become as fat as Hogs that are kept up for that purpose: Do this every Summer till you sue your Pond, and you will find no River-<hi>Carp</hi> to surpass them either in fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or sweetness.</p>

                     <head>General Observations to be understood by all such who desire to attain to the compleat and perfect Art of <hi>Angling.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BY no means fish in light and dazling Apparel but let your Cloathing be of a dark dusky co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>Wheresoever you use to angle (for the Angler hath his peculiar haunt) cast in once in four or five days Corn boiled soft; if for <hi>Carp</hi> and <hi>Tench,</hi> oftner: also you may cast in Garbage, Livers of Beasts, Worms chopt in pieces, or Grains steeped in Blood and dried. This will attract the Fish unto the place: and to keep them together as you fish, throw in half a handful of Grains of ground Malt. This must be done in still water; but in a Stream you must cast your Grains above your Hook, and not about it; sor as they float from your Hook, so will they draw the Fish after them.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100171:193"/>
                     <p>If you will bait a Stream, get some Tin-boxes made full of holes no bigger than just fit for a Worm to creep through; then fill these Boxes with them, and having fastned a Plummet to sink them, cast them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stream with a string fastned thereto, that you may draw them forth when you please, by the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the holes asoresaid, the Worms can crawl out but very leasurely, and as they crawl the Fish will resort about them.</p>
                     <p>If you would bait for <hi>Salmon, Trout, Umber</hi> and the like, in a Stream, then take some blood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with incorporate fine Clay, Barley, and Malt ground adding thereto some Water; make all in a Paste with Gum of lvy; then form it into Cakes, and cast them into the stream. Some will knead or stick Worms therein fast by the head. If you find your bait take no effect in the attracting of the Fish, you may then conclude some <hi>Pike</hi> or <hi>Pearch</hi> lurketh thereabout to seize his Prey, for fear of which the Fish dare not venture thereabout: you must therefore remove these obstructions of your sport, by taking your Trowl; and let your Bait be either Brandlings or Lob-worms; or you may use Gentles, or Minows, which they will greedily snap at.</p>
                     <p>Keep your Rod neither to dry nor to moist, lest the one make it brittle, and the other rotten. If it be very soultry dry Weather, wet your Rod a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Angle: and having struck a good Fish, keep your Rod bent, and that will hinder him from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of the Line, by which means he will either break his hold or the Hook.</p>
                     <p>If you would know what Bait the Fish loves best at the time of your fishing, having taken one, slit his Gill, and take out his Stomach, and open it without bruising, and there you will find what he last fed on and had a fancy to; by which means you may bait your Hook accordingly.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100171:193"/>
                     <p>When you fish, shelter your self under some Bush or Tree, or stand so far from the brink of the River that you can only discern your Float: for Fish are timorous, and are affrighted at the least sight or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The best way of Angling with the Fly is down the River, and not up, as you will find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                     <p>You never need make above half a dozen trials in one place, either with Fly or Ground-bait, when you angle for <hi>Trout;</hi> for by that time he will either offer to take, or refuse the Bait, and not stir at all.</p>
                     <p>If you will have Fish bite eagerly and freely, and without suspition, you must present them with such Baits as naturally they are inclined to, annd in such manner ar they are accustomed to receive them.</p>
                     <p>If you use Pastes for Baits, you must add Flax or Wool, mix a little Butter therewith and that will preserve the Paste srom washing off your Hook.</p>
                     <p>The Eyes of such Fishes as you kill, are most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Baits on the Hook for almost any sort of Fish.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, make not this or any other Recreation your dayly practice, lest your immoderate Exercise therein bring a Plague upon you rather than a pleasure.</p>

                     <head>What provision is to be made for <hi>Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Tools.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE time of providing Stocks is in the Winter-Solstice, when the Trees have shed their Leaves, and the Sap is in the Roots: For after <hi>January</hi> it ascends again into the Trunk and Branches, at which time it is improper to gather Stocks or Tops.</p>
                     <p>Let your Stocks be taper-grown, and your Tops the best Rush-ground-shoots you can get, not knotty, but proportionable aud slender; otherwise they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cast nor strike well, and by reason of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliableness your Line will be much endanger'd.</p>
                     <p>Having gathered your Stocks and Tops all in one sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100171:194"/>
and as straight as you can, bathe them, saving the Tops, over a gentle fire, and use them not till fully seasoned, till about a year and four months: they are better if kept two years.</p>
                     <p>Now to preserve these Stocks or Tops from rotting, or worm-eating, rub them over thrice a year with Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let or Linseed-oyl; sweet Butter will serve, if never salted; and with any of these you must chafe well your Rods: if bored, pour in either of the Oyls, and let them bathe therein twenty sour hours, then pour it out again; and this will preserve your I ops and Stocks from injury</p>
                     <p>How to joyn the Stock or Top together, or how to make all sorts of Rods for Fly, Ground, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, with what lengths are best for several sorts of Fishing, I need not here relate; since without putting your self to the trouble, you may purchase them of such as sell them at no dear rates.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>How to make a Line after the best manner.</head>
                     <p>LET your Hair be round, and twist it even, for that strengthens the Line; and let your Hair, as near as you can, be of an equal bigness: then lay them in Water for a quarter of an hour, bv which means you will find which of the Hairs do shrink; than twist them over again.</p>
                     <p>Some intermingle Silk in the twisting, but I cannot approve of it; but a Line of all Silk is not amiss; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Line made of the smallest Lute-string is very good, but that it will soon rot by the Water.</p>
                     <p>The best colour for Lines is the sorrel, white, and grey; the two last for clear waters, and the grey for muddy Rivers: neither is the pale wacry green to be contemned, which colour you may make after this manner.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100171:195"/>
                     <p>Take a pint of strong Ale, half a pound of Soot, a small quantity of the juice of Walnut-leaves, with the like quantity of Alum; put these into a Pipkin, and boil them together about half an hour: Having so done, take it off the fire, and when it is cold put in your Hair. Or thus:</p>
                     <p>Take a pottle of Alum-water, somewhat more than a handful of Marigold-flowers, boil them till a yellow scum arise; then take half a pound of green Copperas, with as much Verdegreece, and beat them together to a fine powder: put these with the Hair into the Alum-Water, and let it lie ten hours or more; then take the Hair out, and let it dry.</p>
                     <p>In the making your Line leave a <hi>Bought</hi> at both ends, the one to put it to and take it srom the Rod, the other to hang your lowest link upon to which your Hook is fastned; and so you may change your Hook as often as you please.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of the <hi>Hook, Flote,</hi> and other things worth the Observation.</head>
                     <p>YOur Hook ought to be long in the shank, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what round in its circumference, the point stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding even and straight; and let the bending be in the shank.</p>
                     <p>Use strong, but small Silk, in the setting on of your Hook, laying the Hair on the inside of your Hook: for if it be on the outside, the Silk will fret and cut it a sunder.</p>
                     <p>As for the Flotes, there are divers way of making them: Some use your Muscovy-Duck-quills, which are the best for still Waters; but for strong streams take good sound Cork without flaws or holes, and bore it through with a hot Iron; then put into it a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100171:195"/>
Quill of a fit proportion; then pare your Cork into a Pyramidal form of what bigness you think fit; after this grind it smooth.</p>
                     <p>To plum your Ground, you must carry with you a Musquet-bullet with a hole made through it, or any other sort of Plummet, tying this to a strong twist, hang it on your Hook, and so you will find the depth of the Water.</p>
                     <p>And that you may not incommode your Tackle, it will be very requisite to make several partitions in pieces of Parchment sowed together, by which each Utensil may have a place by it self.</p>
                     <p>In any wise forget not to carry a little Whetstone with you to sharpen your Hooks if you find them blunt and dull.</p>
                     <p>I need not advise you how to carry your BOB and PALMER, or put you in mind of having several Boxes of divers sizes for your Hooks, Corks, Silk, Thread, Lead, Flies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or admonish you not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your Linnen and Wollen Bags for all sorts os Baits; but let me forwarn you not to have a PAUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER that is heavy, for it can never be light enough: those which are made of Osiers I think are the best.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, forget not carry with you a small Pole with a Loop at the end thereof, to which you may fasten a small Net to land great Fish withal.</p>
                     <p>There is another way much better, and that is by the Landing-hook, which hath a Screw at the end of it to screw it into the Socket of a Pole: to which Socket may be fitted also two other Hooks, the one to pull out Wood, and the other sharp to our away Weeds.</p>

                     <head>Of <hi>Flies</hi> Natural and Artificial, and how to use them.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>NAtural Flies</hi> are innumerable, there being as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds as there are different sorts of Fruits: to avoid prolixity, I shall onely name some of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dun-fly,</hi> the <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>May-fly,</hi> the <hi>Red Fly,</hi> the <hi>Moor-fly,</hi> the <hi>Tawny-fly,</hi> the <hi>Shel-fly,</hi> the <hi>Cloudy</hi> or <hi>Blackish-fly,</hi> the <hi>Flag-fly,</hi> the <hi>Vine-fly;</hi> also <hi>Caterpillers, Canker-flies,</hi> and <hi>Bear-flies,</hi> with Thousands more which frequent Meadows and Rivers, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of all, but particularly the recreation of Anglers.</p>
                     <p>These come in sooner or later, according to the season of the year, that is, sooner, or later according to the forwardness or backwardness of the Spring; for Flies being bred of Putrefaction, commence their being according as the Heat doth further their seminal vertue unto animation</p>
                     <p>I cannot prescribe you Rules to know when each Fly cometh in, and is most grateful to every sort of Fish; and therefore I shall leave the knowledge hereof to your own observation.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, there are several sorts of Flies according to the several natures of divers Soils and Rivers, or diversity of Plants; yet some there are common to all, although but few.</p>
                     <p>All Flies are very good in their seasons for such Fish as rise at the Fly; but some more peculiarly good, as being better beloved by some sort of fish.</p>
                     <p>Fish generally rise at these Flies most eagerly when most sorts of Flies resort to the Water-side, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner in clusters on Trees and Bushes, delighting themselves to skip thence and play upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100171:196"/>
the water; and then do the fish shew their craft in catching them.</p>
                     <p>To the intent you may the better know what kind of Fly the Fish then most covet, observe thus to do; coming in the Morning to the River-side, beat the Bushes with your Rod, and take up what variety you may of all sorts of Flies, and try them all; by which means you will quickly know which are in greatest estimation among them. Not but that they will change their Fly sometimes, but then it is when they have glutted themselves there with for five or six days together, which is commonly upon the going out of that Fly: for Fish never covet that Fly more than when there is greatest plenty, contemning them at their first coming in.</p>
                     <p>There are two ways to fish with these natural Flies; either on the surface of the water, or a little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it. Now when you angle for <hi>Chevin, Roach,</hi> or <hi>Dace</hi> with the natural Fly, move it not swiftly when you see the Fish make at it, but rather let it glide spontaneously towards it with the Stream: If it be in a still and slow water, draw the Fly slowly sideways by him, that will make him eager in pursuit of it; whereas if you should move it swiftly, they will not follow it, being a lazy fish and slow of motion. These fish delight to shew themselves in a Sun-shiny-day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most on the very surface of the Water, by which means you may pick and choose.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Artificial Fly</hi> is seldome used but in blustering weather, when by the Winds the Waters are so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that the Natural Fly cannot be seen, nor rest upon them.</p>
                     <p>There are (according to the opinion of Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a very ingenious man, and an excellent Angler) twelve sorts of Artificial Flies to angle with on the top of the Water, of which these are the principal.</p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100171:197"/>
                     <p>The first is (to use his own words) the <hi>Dun-fly,</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> made of dun Wool, and the Feathers of a Partridge's Wing.</p>
                     <p>The second is a <hi>Dun-fly</hi> too, and made of black Wool, and the Feathers of a black Drake; the Body made of the first, and the Wings of the latter.</p>
                     <p>The third is the <hi>Stone-fly,</hi> in <hi>April;</hi> the Body is made of black Wool made yellow under the Wings and Tail.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is the <hi>Ruddy-fly,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> the Body being made of red Wool, and bound about with black Silk, with the Feathers of a red Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, which hang dangling on his sides next his Tail.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is the <hi>Yellow</hi> or <hi>Greenish Fly,</hi> in <hi>June;</hi> the Body is made of black Wool, with a yellow List on either side, and the Wings taken off the Wings of a Buzzard, bound with black braked Hemp.</p>
                     <p>The sixth is the <hi>Moorish-fly;</hi> the Body made of dus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Wool, and the Wings made of the blackish Mail of the Drake.</p>
                     <p>The seventh is the <hi>Tawny-fly,</hi> good until the middle of <hi>June;</hi> the Body made of tawny Wool, the Wings made contrary one against another, of the whitish Mail of the white Drake.</p>
                     <p>The eighth is the <hi>Wasp-fly,</hi> in <hi>July;</hi> the Body made of black Wool lapt about with yellow Silk, the Wings made of Drake-feathers.</p>
                     <p>The ninth is the <hi>Shel-fly,</hi> good in the middle of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> the Body made of greenish Wool lapt about wirh the Herle of a Peacock's Tail, and the Wings made of Buzzards Wings.</p>
                     <p>The tenth and last is the <hi>Drake-fly,</hi> good in <hi>August;</hi> the Body made of black Wool lapt about with black Silk, his Wings of the Mail of the black Drake with a black head.</p>
                     <p>And then having named two more, he concludes wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100171:197"/>
                        <hi>Thus have you a Jury of Flies, likely to betray and condemn all the</hi> Trouts <hi>in the River.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This in my opinion seems a tedious and difficult way. I should rather think it better to find the Fly proper for every season, and that which the Fish at that time most eagerly covet, and make one as like it as possibly you may, in colour, shape, and proportion; and for your better imitation lay the natural Fly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>
                     <p>There are several ways of making these artificial Flies, which I shall forbear here to relate, thinking it more proper to leave it to the ingenuity of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person, which will be very much help'd by seeing and observing the Artist's method in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
                     <p>The best Observations I can collect for artificial Fly-fishing, are these:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Observe to fish in a River somewhat disturbed by Rain, or in a cloudy day, when the Waters are moved by a gentle breez: the South-wind is best, the West indifferent, but the East is stark naught. But as to this I give not much credit; for let the Sky be cloudy, and the Season not too cold, I'le bid defiance to any Wind that blows not too hard. If it blow high, yet not so high but that you may conveniently guide your Tackle, they will rise in plain Deeps, where you shall kill the best Fish: but if the Wind be small, then is the best angling in swift Screams; and be sure to keep your Fly in continual motion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Keep as far from the Water-side as you can, whether you fish with a Fly or Worm; and fish down rhe Stream, having the Sun on your back, not suffering your Line to touch the Water but your Fly onely. Here note, that the light Fly makes most sport in a dark night, and the darkest or least Fly in a clear dry.</p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100171:198"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In clear Rivers ever Angle with a small Fly with slender Wings; but in such as are muddied by Rain, use a Fly that is larger bodied than ordinary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When the water beginneth to clear after Rain, and becomes brownish, then use a Red or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range Fly; if the day be clear, a light-coloured Fly, and a dark Fly for dark Waters; if the Water be of a wheyish complexion, then use a black or brown Fly. I will not say these Directions or Rules are without exceptions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let your Line for Fly-fishing be twice as long as your Rod, unless the River be cumbred with Wood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> For every sort of Fly, have several of the same differing in colour, to sute with the different complexions of several waters and weathers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> You must have a nimble eye, and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive hand to strike presently with the rising of the fish, or else he will be apt to spew out the Hook, finding his mistake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Let your Fly fall first into the Water; for if your Line fall first, it scares the fish, and therefore you must draw again and cast.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> When you angle in slow Rivers or still places with your Artificial Fly, cast it over cross the River, and let it sink a little in the water, and draw it gently back again, so as you raise no Circles, nor break the Water; and let the Fly float gently with the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and hereby you will find excellent sport.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> Take notice that your Salmon-flies must be made with their Wings standing one behind the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether two or four, He delights in the finest gawdiest colours you can choose, in the Wings chiefly, which must be long, and so must the Tail.</p>

                     <head>Of Ground Angling.</head>
                     <p>IF you fish under the Water for a <hi>Trout,</hi> it must be without a Float, onely with a Plumb of Lead, or a Bullet, which is better, because it will fowl on the ground. And this way of fishing is very good in cold weather, when the Fish swim very low: you must place this Bullet about nine Inches from the baited Hook; your Top must be very gentle, that the Fish may more easily run away with the Bait, and not be scared with the stifness of the Rod. You must not strike as soon as you feel the Fish bite, but slack your Line a little, that he may the better swallow the Bait and Hook. When you strike do it gently, for the least matter does it.</p>
                     <p>Let your Tackle be fine and slender, for that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than your big and strong Lines, which serve onely to fright the Fish.</p>
                     <p>You will find it a better way of Angling to do it without Float or Lead, onely making use of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-worm, drawing it up and down the Stream; by which you will take more <hi>Trouts</hi> than any other way, especially if it be in a clear day. The Morning and Evening are the chiefest seasons for the Ground-Line for <hi>Trout:</hi> but if the day prove Cloudy, or the Water muddy, you may Angle at Ground all the day.</p>

                        <hi>Of</hi> Night-Angling.</head>
                     <p>GReat Fish (especially <hi>Trouts</hi>) are like Bucks, wary and circumspect in their self-preservation, and know the seasons most fit for them to feed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger; and that is the Night, as they suppose, thinking then they may most securely range abroad.</p>
                     <p>In your Night-angling take two great Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms of an equal length, and place them on your Hook; then cast them a good distance, and draw them to you again upon the superficies of the Water, not suffering them to sink; to which end you must not use a Plummet. You may easily hear the Fish rise, and therefore give him some time to swallow your Bait, then strike him gently. If he will not take it at the top, sink your Bait by adding some Lead, and order your self as at Day-angling on the Ground.</p>
                     <p>I have frequently experienced it, that the best <hi>Trouts</hi> bite in the Night, rising most commonly in the still Deeps, but unusually in the Streams.</p>
                     <p>Instead of these Garden-worms you may use a black Snail, or a piece of Velvet in its likeness: this is a most excellent Night-bait for a <hi>Trout,</hi> and nothing like the black Snail for a <hi>Chub</hi> in the Morning early.</p>
                     <p>You may bait your Hook with a <hi>Minnow</hi> for a <hi>Trout</hi> thus: put your Hook through the point of his lower Chap, and draw it through; then put your Hook in at his Mouth, and bring the point to his Tail; then draw your Line straight, and it will bring him into a round compass: But be sure you so order his Mouth that the Water get not in.</p>

                     <head>What times are seasonable, and what unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to Angle in.</head>
                     <p>CAlm and clear weather is very good to angle in; but cool cloudy weather in Summer is best; but it must not be so boisterously windy as that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not guide your Tackle. The cooler the weather is in hottest Months, the better it is: and if a sudden vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent shour hath disturbed and muddied the River, then is your time to angle in the Stream at the ground with a red Worm.</p>
                     <p>Likewise a little before the Fish spawn is a very good time for Angling; for then their Bellies being full, they come into sandy Fords, and there rub their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to loosen them, at which time they will bite very freely.</p>
                     <p>If you intend to fish for <hi>Carp</hi> and <hi>Tench,</hi> you must commence your sport early in the Morning, fishing from Sun-rising till eight of the Clock, and from four in the Afternoon till Night; and in hot Months till it be very late.</p>
                     <p>In the heat of Summer <hi>Carps</hi> will shew themselves on the very Rim of the water; at which time, if you fish with a Lob-worm as you do with a Fly natural, you will have excellent sport, especially if it be among Reeds.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>March, April, September,</hi> and all the Winter, (in which season Fish swim deep very near the Ground) I say, in those Months it is best fishing in a clear serene warm day, for then they bite fastest: But all the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time Mornings, Evenings, and cool cloudy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the best times for Angling.</p>
                     <p>Here note, that by experience you will find that Fish rise best at the Fly after a shour of Rain that have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100171:200"/>
onely beaten the Gnats and Flies into the River with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out muddying them. The proper Moneths and times of the day for the Fly, are <hi>March, April, May,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>June;</hi> in which Months let your times be in the Morning about nine, and between three and four in the Afternoon. A warm Evening is very seasonable, if the Gnats play much.</p>
                     <p>After a clear Moon shiny-night, if the day succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding prove cloudy, it is a very good time for Angling; for, having abstained from food all the night, (for they will not stir for fear in bright nights) the next day they become hungry and eager, and the gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the day makes them bite boldly.</p>
                     <p>At the opening of Sluces or Mill-dams go along with the course of the water, and you will find <hi>Trouts</hi> and other fish will then come out to seek for what food the water brings down with it.</p>
                     <p>Having shewn you what seasons are most proper and profitable to Angle in, I will demonstrate to you such as are not.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>First,</hi> In the extremity of Heat, when the Earth is parched with Drought, there is little sport to be obtained, especially in muddy or clear shallow Rivers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Winter or Spring-time, when there happeneth any hoary Frost, then will not the fish bite kindly all that day, unless it be in the Evening, and if that prove serene and pleasant: but it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to fish at any time when the Wind bloweth so high that you cannot manage your Tools to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sheep-shearing time is an an Enemy to the Angler, for then the Fish glut themselves with what is washt off the Sheep, and will scarcely bite till that season be over. Likewise sharp East and North nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-winds do very much prejudice the Anglers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation: neither is it good to fish immediately after
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100171:200"/>
Spawning-time; for at that time their appetite is much abated.</p>
                     <p>It is a very strange thing to consider the natural instinct in Fish in foreknowing the approach of a showr of Rain; for I have tried, that upon the rise of a Gloud that threatned a sudden Showr, they would not bite; from which observation I have often sav'd my self from being wet to the Skin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> If the preceding night prove dark and cloudy, the succeeding day will prove ineffectual for fishing, unless for small fish; for at such times the great ones prey abroad for the lesser, who, by instinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger, hide themselves till the Morning; and having fasted all night become then very hungry, whilst the great ones having gorg'd themselves lie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconded all the day long.</p>
                     <p>The next thing we shall insist on, is the way of taking several sorts of fish (as they are here alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically set down) with several proper Baits according to the best of experiences.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of the <hi>BARBEL.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Barbel</hi> is so called by reason of the Barb which is under his Nose or Chaps. He is a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-mouth'd-fish, that is, such a one as will not break his hold when hook d; but will frequently break, if big, both Rod and Line.</p>
                     <p>They swim together in great Shoals, and are at worst in <hi>April,</hi> though not very good at any time.</p>
                     <p>The places where he loves most to resort, are where Weeds grow, or in a gravelly rising ground, wherein he will dig and root like a Hog with his Nose: not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100171:201"/>
but that he frequents the strongest swifts of water sometimes, as deep Bridges or Wears, where he will so settle himself among the Piles and hollow places, or amongst Moss or Weeds, that let the Water be never so swift, he will remain immoveable. This is his custome in the Summer-time; after which times he retires into deep waters and there helps the Female to dig a hole in the Sand for her to hide her Spawn from being devoured by other Fish.</p>
                     <p>This Fish is of a delicate Cast and handsome shape, with small Scales placed after a most curious manner; and as his shape is curious so is his palate, for he will not eat any thing but what is clean; and therefore if you intend to make any sport with him your Bait must be very well scowred. The best for him is a Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, at which he will bite boldly, if you bait your ground the night before with big worms cut in pieces. For him you can never bait the Ground too much, nor can you fish for him too early or too late.</p>
                     <p>Gentles also are a very good Bait for him, if green; and so is Cheese made tough by keeping it in a wet Linnen Bag a day or two: This Cheese steeped in clarified Honey, and the Ground where you intend to fish baited therewith, will give you an opportunity to catch store enough of <hi>Barbels,</hi> if there be any thereabout. You may do well to bait your Hook with Cheese that is sost, and Sheeps-tallow wrought into a Paste: but there is no bait like the well-scowred Lob-worm, or Cheese steeped in Honey an hour or two.</p>
                     <p>When you fish for this <hi>Barbel,</hi> let your Rod and Line be both loug and strong; on your Line let there be a running Plummet, that is a Bullet with a hole throw the middle, let a knot or little bit of Lead be placed a Foot or more above your Hook, to keep your Bullet from falling down on it: so your Worm
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100171:201"/>
lay at the bottom where they always bite, and when he takes your bait the Plummet will lye and not check the fish, and you may know by the bending of the top of your Rod when he bites, and likewise feel him with your hand make a strong snatch, then strike and you rarely fail, if you play him well and tire him; for as he is very subtile, so is he extraordinary strong and dogged to be dealt withal, and will so struggle, that if you manage him not dextrously, he will break your Line.</p>
                     <p>His best time of biting is about nine of the Clock, and the chiefest time of fishing for him is at the latter end of <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi>

                        <hi>Of the</hi> BREAM.</head>
                     <p>THere are two sorts of <hi>Breams,</hi> the one a fresh and the other a salt water-Fish, yet neither differ much in shape, nature, or taste.</p>
                     <p>I shall onely speak of the fresh-water <hi>Bream,</hi> which at full growth is a large and stately Fish, and breeds either in Ponds or Rivers; but chiefly delights in the former, which if he likes, he will not onely grow exceeding fat, but will fill the Pond with his issue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the starving of the other Fish.</p>
                     <p>As for his shape, it is very broad, and thick scaled very excellently, with a forked Tail; his Eyes are large, but he hath a very little sucking Mouth, dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to his Body.</p>
                     <p>The flesh of this Fish is accounted more pleasant than wholesome by some: but as for my part, I am of the judgement of the <hi>French,</hi> who have a great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for it; and if you will but taste his Belly or Head, you will say it is most excellent food.</p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100171:202"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Bream</hi> spawneth in <hi>June,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and is easily taken; for after one or two gentle turns he will fall upon his side, and so you may draw him to Land with ease. The best time of Angling for him, is from St. <hi>James-tide</hi> till <hi>Bartholomew-tide;</hi> for having had all the Summers food, they are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fat.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bream</hi> is a great lover of red Worms, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as are to be found at the root of a great Dock, and lie wrapt up in a round clue; also he loves Paste, Flag-worms, Wasps, green Flies, Butter-flies, and a Grass-hopper with his Legs cut off.</p>
                     <p>The way of taking <hi>Breams</hi> is thus: First bait the ground (where you know they resort) with a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of sweet-ground Barley-malt, boyled but a little while, and strained when it is cold: go with it to the place about nine a Clock at night, then take your Malt, and squeezing it between your Hands, throw it into the River, and it will sink: If the stream run hard, cast in your squeezed Balls a little above the place you intend to angle in. Having thus baited your ground, in the Morning bait your Hook with the greatest red Worm you can get; you may find them in Gardens or Chalky Commons after a showre of Rain; of which you must store your self beforehand, keeping them a Month at least in dry Moss, changing the Moss every three daies. Having baited your hook so that the worm may crawl to and fro, for the better inticing of the Fish to bite without suspition, observe where your fish play most and stay longest, which commonly is in the broadest, deepest and stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest part of the River generally in deep and still back Waters: then plumb your ground, and fish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half an Inch of it; for although you shall see some <hi>Breams</hi> play on the top of the Water, yet these are but the Sentinels for them beneath.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100171:202"/>
                     <p>You may have three or four Rods out at a time stuck in the Bank-side, and let them be long, the Floats Swan or Goose-quills, which must be sunk with Lead, the tops bearing above water about half an Inch. Let your Rods be cast in one above the other about a yard and a half distant, and then withdraw your self from the Bank so far that you can perceive nothing but the top of the Float; and when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it sink, then creep to the Water-side, and give it as much Line as you can: if it be a <hi>Carp</hi> or <hi>bream,</hi> they will run to the other side; then strike gently, and hold your Rod at a bent a little while, but do not pull, for then you spoil all; but you must first tire them before you can land them, being very shie. Of the two, the <hi>Carp</hi> is the worst, being more brisk and strong.</p>
                     <p>Here take notice by the way, if <hi>Pike</hi> or <hi>Pearch</hi> be thereabout, it will be but a folly to think of killing <hi>Carp</hi> or <hi>Bream;</hi> and therefore you must remove those obstacles, by fishing them out first. And to the intent you may know whether there be those Fish of Prey thereabout, take a small <hi>Bleak</hi> or <hi>Gudgeon,</hi> and bait it, setting it alive among your Rods, two foot deep from your Float, with a little red Worm at the point of your Hook: if a Pike be there, he will certainly snap at it.</p>

                     <head>Of the <hi>BLEAK.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Bleak</hi> is an eager fish, and is caught with all sorts of Worms bred on Trees or Plants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with Flies, Paste, Sheeps-bloud, <hi>&amp;c</hi> You may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for them with half a score Hooks at once, if you can fasten them all on. Also in an Evening the <hi>Bleak</hi> will take the natural or artificial Fly.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100171:203"/>
                     <p>If it be a warm clear day, there is no Bait so good for the <hi>Bleak</hi> as a small Fly at the top of the water, which they will take at any time of the day, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the evening: there is no fish that yields better sport for a young Angler than this, for they are so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that they will leap out of the water at the Bait.</p>
                     <p>If the day be cold and cloudy, Gentles or Cadice are best about two foot under water.</p>
                     <p>This same <hi>Bleak</hi> by some is called a Fresh-water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprat, or River-swallow, by reason of his continual motion.</p>
                     <p>Some would have him called <hi>Bleak</hi> from the whitish colour, and that is onely under his Belly, for his Back is of a pleasant Sea-green.</p>
                     <p>There is another way of taking <hi>Bleaks,</hi> by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them in a Boat or on a Bank-side in swift Water in a Summers evening, with a Hazel-top about five or six foot long, and a Line twice the length of the Rod; but the best way is with a Drabble that is tie eight or ten small Hooks along a Line two Inches above one another the biggest Hook the lowermost, by which you may sometimes take a better Fish, and bait them with Gentles, Flies, or small red Worms, by which means you may take half a dozen or more at one time.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Bull-head</hi> is a Fish which hath a broad Head and wide Mouth, with two broad Fins near his Eyes, and two Fins under his Belly: instead of his Teeth his rough Lips assist him in nibbing at the bait. He hath Fins also on his Back, and one below the Vent; and his Tail is round, his Body being all over
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100171:203"/>
covered with whitish, blackish, and brownish spots.</p>
                     <p>They begin to spawn about <hi>April,</hi> and are full of Spawn all the Summer-season. The <hi>Bull-head's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon habitation is in Holes, or among Stones in clear Water in Summer; but in the Winter he takes up his quarters with the <hi>Eel</hi> in the Mud: So doth the <hi>Loach</hi> and <hi>Minnow;</hi> or we cannot guess otherwise where their Winter-abode should be.</p>
                     <p>He is easily taken in the Summer, for he is lazie and simple. You may see him in hot weather lie Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himself on a flat Stone or gravelly Ground, at which time you may put your Hook (which must be baited with a small Worm) very near the Mouth, at which he seldom refuseth to bite, so that the veriest bungling Angler may take him.</p>
                     <p>He is an excellent fish for tast, but of so ill a shape, that many women care not for dressing him, he so much resembles a Toad.</p>

                     <p>As for his food, he loveth all sorts of Worms and Flies, also Cheese, Grain, black Worms, slitting their Bellies that the white may appear: he loveth to have his Bait large, and variety of Baits at one Hook. He delights very much in the Pith that grows in the bone of an Ox-back, os which you must be careful in taking off the tough outward Skin, without breaking the tender inward Skin</p>
                     <p>Early in the Morning angle for your <hi>Chevin</hi> with Snails; but choose some other Bait for him in the

                     <p>I Could never read nor hear that the <hi>Char</hi> was taken any where but in a Mere in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> called <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander-mere,</hi> the largest, according to report, that is in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> being ten miles in length, and as smooth as a Bowling-green at the bottom.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Char</hi> is spotted like a <hi>Trout,</hi> and its dimension seldome exceeds seventeen Inches or a foot and half. This Fish is delicate food, having scarce a Bone but what is on the Back. Now since the place is so remote from <hi>London</hi> where these <hi>Chars</hi> are taken, I shall for bear to trouble our City-Angler with Rules and Directions how to angle for him, and pass to such Fish as are frequently found in every River here near adjacent.</p>

                     <p>THis Fish hath several appellations; for he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Chub,</hi> a <hi>Chavender</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> by some a <hi>Villian,</hi> by others a <hi>Cheven.</hi> As for my part, call him what you please, I like him not for these reasons: first, he is full of small forked Bones dispersed every where throughout his Body; next, he eats very waterish; and lastly, this Fish is unfirm, and (in my opinion) in a manner tasteless.</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100171:204"/>
                     <p>Of all fish he is the best to enter a young Angler, for he is very easily taken: however give me leave to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe you some more Rules than what I have already shewn in the Angling for the <hi>Cheven,</hi> which is the same with the <hi>Chub</hi> or <hi>Chavender</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You must find out some hole, where you shall have twenty or more of them together in a hot day floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting almost on the very surface of the water: let your Rod be long and strong, and your Line not above a yard or two long, very strong, and an indifferent large Hook; then bait your Hook with a Grashopper, bob your Grashopper up and down one the top of the water, and if there be any Chub near he will rise; but so abscond your self that you may not be seen, for he is a very fearful fish, and therefore the least shadow will make him sink to the bottom of the water, yet he will rise again suddainly; this is called Bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Having baited your Hook drop it gently some two foot before that <hi>Chub</hi> you have elected by your eye to be the best and fairest, and he will instantly bite greedily thereat, and be held so fast by reason of his Leather-mouth, that he can seldom break his hold: and therefore you may do well to give him play e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and so tire him; otherwise you may endanger your Line.</p>
                     <p>If you cannot find a Grashopper, then bait your Hook with any kind of Fly or Worm, as I said before, as Dors, Beetles, Bobs, Cod or Case-worms.</p>
                     <p>When you fish for the <hi>Chub</hi> with a Fly, Grashopper, or Beetle, it must be at the top of the water; if with other baits, underneath.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> angle for your <hi>Chub</hi> with Worms; in <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> with Flies, Snails, or Cherries. Where note he will rarely refuse a Gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper on the top of a swift Stream, nor at the bottom
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100171:205"/>
the young Humble-bee. In <hi>August, September,</hi> &amp;c. make use of a Paste made of Parmisan, or <hi>Holland</hi> cheese pounded with Saffron in a Mortar, adding thereunto a little Butter. Others make a Paste of Cheese and Turpentine for the Winter-season, at which time the <hi>Chub</hi> is in his prime; for then his forked Bones are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lost, or converted into a Gristle; and he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent meat baked.</p>
                     <p>In hot weather angle for him in the middle of the water, or near the top thereof; but in cold weather fish for him near the bottom.</p>
                     <p>To finish all other discourse of this <hi>Chub, Cheven,</hi> or <hi>Chavender,</hi> I shall only say that his Spawn is excellent; and if he be large, the Head, when the Throat is well washt, is the best part of the Fish.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is confess'd by all, that the <hi>Carp</hi> is the Queen of all Fresh-water-fish, being not only a good, but subtile fish and living longest of all fish (excepting the <hi>Ecl</hi>) out of his proper Element. Those that die soonest are <hi>Herrings,</hi> for salt-water; and for fresh-water, <hi>Trouts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Carps</hi> are observed to breed several Months in one year; and for this reason you shall hardly ever take either Male or Female without Melt or Spawn. They breed ever more naturally in Ponds than in running water: in the latter very seldom or never; and where they breed, they breed innumerably.</p>
                     <p>He that intends to Angle for a <hi>Carp,</hi> must arm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a world of Patience, by reason of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary subtlety and policy of that Fish: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies choose to lie in the deepest places either of Ponds or Rivers where is but a small running Stream. Next, you are to observe that the <hi>Carp</hi> will seldom
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100171:205"/>
bite in cold weather; and in hot weather you cannot be too early or too late at your sport: and if he bite, you need not fear his hold, for he is one of those leather-mouth'd-fish, who have their Teeth in their Throat.</p>
                     <p>When you angle for the <hi>Carp,</hi> your Rod and Line must be strong; and because he is so very wary, it is good to intice him by baiting the Ground with course Paste: In <hi>March</hi> he seldom resuseth the red Worm, the Cadice in <hi>June,</hi> nor the Grashopper in <hi>July, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> and <hi>September.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carp</hi> takes delight in Worms or sweet Pastes, of which there are great variety: the best are made up of Honey and Sugar, and ought to be thrown into your Water some hours before you intend to angle; or if you throw in your Paste made into small Pellets two or three days before, it will not be the worse, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if you throw in also Chickens-guts, Garbage, or Bloud incorporated with Bran or Cow-dung.</p>
                     <p>You may make your Paste in this manner: Take a convenient quantity of Bean-flour, or any other Flour, and mingle it with the flesh of a Cat cut small; make up this Composition with Honey, and then beat them all together in a Mortar so long, till they are so tough as to hang upon a Hook without washing off. For the better effecting thereof, mingle therewith some whitish Wool; and if you would keep it all the year, add thereunto some Virgins-wax and clarified Honey.</p>
                     <p>If you fish with Gentles, anoint them with Honey and put them on your hook with a piece of Scarlet dipt in the like. This is the most approved way to deceive and captivate the subtile <hi>Carp.</hi> Honey and crums of White-bread mixt together is a very good Paste for a <hi>Carp.</hi>

                     <p>THE <hi>Dace, Dare</hi> and <hi>Roach,</hi> are much of a kind, both in manner of feeding, cunning, goodness and commonly in size</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dace</hi> or <hi>Dare</hi> will bite at any Fly, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the Stone-cadice fly or May fly, the latter end of <hi>April</hi> and the begining or most part of <hi>May</hi> is a most excellent bait, floating on the top of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which you may gather great quantities of from the Reeds and Sedge by the water side, or from Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne bushes which grow near the bank of a shallow Gravel-stream, on which they very much delight to hang: also at Ant-flies, of which the blackish is the best, which are found in Mole-hills about the Months of <hi>June, July, August</hi> and <hi>September.</hi> The way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving them for your use is, to put them alive into a Glass-bottle, having first laid therein some of the moist Earth from whence you gatherd them, with some of the Roots of the Grass of the said Hillock: having laid your Ant-flies in gently without prem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing their Wings, lay a clod of Earth over it: thus you may keep them a Month, if you bruise them not. If you would keep them longer, put them into a large Rundlet, having first wash'd the inside with water and Honey: having thus kept them three Months, they are an incomparable Bait in any Stream and clear Water, either for <hi>Dace, Dare</hi> or <hi>Roach,</hi> and are good also for a <hi>Chavender,</hi> fishing within a handful from the bottom.</p>
                     <p>The best time for making use of the Ant-flie, is when they swarm, and that is generally about the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> and begining of <hi>August:</hi> they will cover a Tree or Bush with their multitude, and then if you
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100171:206"/>
make use of them, you may load your self with <hi>Roach</hi> or <hi>Dace</hi> in a small time.</p>
                     <p>In a warm day he rarely refuseth a fly at the top of the water: but remember that when you fish under water for him, it is best to be within an handful or something more of the ground.</p>
                     <p>If you would fish for <hi>Dace</hi> or <hi>Dare</hi> in winter, then about <hi>Alhallontide,</hi> where ever you see Heath or Sandy grounds ploughing up, follow the Plough, and you will find a white worm with a red head, as big as the top of a mans little finger. You may know where most of them are, by the number of Crows and Rooks which sit on the plowed land. The worm is very soft and is by some termed a Grub, which is nothing but the Spawn of a Beetle. Gather what quantity you think fit, and put them into a Vessel with some of the Earth from whence they were taken, and you may keep them all the Winter.</p>
                     <p>Lastly the young brood of Wasps and Bees having their heads dipt in Blood, are an excellent bait for <hi>Dace</hi> or <hi>Dare.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>I Shall not trouble you with variety of discourses concerning the being of an <hi>Eel,</hi> whether they breed by some Generation, or Corruption as Worms or by certain Glutinous dew drops, which falling in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> on the Banks of some Ponds or Rivers; are by the heat of the Sun turned into <hi>Eels:</hi> and these are by some called <hi>Yelvers,</hi> of which I have seen Cakes made, and have eaten thereof when fried, with much satisfaction. I say waving away all Discourses of this nature, I shall onely tell you that some have differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Eels</hi> into four sorts chiefly: namely, the Silver-Eel,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100171:207"/>
a Greenish <hi>Eel,</hi> (which is called a <hi>Creg;</hi>) a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish <hi>Eel,</hi> with a broad flat head; and lastly an <hi>Eel</hi> with reddish Fins.</p>
                     <p>I shall onely speak of the first, which is the Silver <hi>Eel.</hi> This <hi>Eel</hi> is generally believed to have its being from Generation, but not by spawning, but the young coming from the Female alive, and no bigger than a small Needle.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Eel</hi> may be caught with several sorts of Baits but principally with powder'd Beef. A Garden-worm or Lob, or a <hi>Minnow,</hi> or Hen's-gut, or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage of Fish, is a very good bait: but some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a <hi>Pride,</hi> which others call a <hi>Lamprey,</hi> beyond any yet named.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Eels</hi> abscond themselves in Winter, taking up their constant residence in the Mud, without stirring out for six Moneths; so in the Summer they take no delight to be abroad in the day, and therefore the most proper time to take them is in the night, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those Baits aforesaid, fastning your Line to the Bank-side with your Laying-hooks in the water. Or you may throw in a Line with good store of Hooks baited, and plumb'd with a Float to discover where the Line lieth, that in the Morning you may take it up with your Drag-hook.</p>
                     <p>There is another way of taking <hi>Eels,</hi> and that is by <hi>Sniggling.</hi> This Sniggling is nothing else but taking in the day-time a strong Line and Hook bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Lob or Garden-worm, and marking such Holes and places where the <hi>Eels</hi> use to abscond themselves in the day-time near Wears, Mills, or Flood-gates, and gently by the help of a Stick putting your bait into such holes where you imagine <hi>Eels</hi> are: and if there be any, you shall be sure to have a bite; but then have a care you pull not too hard, lest you spoil all. Here note, that the Top of your Stick must
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100171:207"/>
be cleft, wherein you must put a strong Hook, but of a narrow compass; which Stick must guide the Bait into the Hole where the <hi>Eel</hi> is, by which means, if your Tackling hold, you may get as large <hi>Eels</hi> as any are in the River, Mill-pond, or Flood-gate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as this way of fishing is called <hi>Sniggling,</hi> so it is called <hi>Broggling</hi> for <hi>Eels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bobbing</hi> fot Eels is done after another manner: that is, Take very large Lobs, scowr them well, and with a Needle run some strong-twisted Silk through them from end to end; take so many as that you may wrap them about a board a dozen times at least, then tie them fast with the two ends of the Silk, that they may hang in so many Hanks; then fasten all to a strong Cord, and about a handful and a half above the Worms fasten a Plumb of three quarters of a pound in weight, and fasten your Cord to a strong Pole: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so done, fish in muddy Water, and you will feel the <hi>Eels</hi> tug lustily at them. When you think they have swallowed them as far as they can, gently draw up your Line, till you have brought your <hi>Eels</hi> to the top of the water, and then bring them ashore as fast as you can. The Gentleman (and an experienced Angler) from whom I received this Instruction, told me, he hath taken six or seven large <hi>Eels</hi> at a time this very way.</p>
                     <p>There is another way also for taking of <hi>Eels</hi> (though it be somewhat laborious, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is best to be made use of in cold weather) and that is by an Instrument called an <hi>Eel-spear:</hi> it is made for the most part with three Forks or Teeth, jagged on the sides; but those are better that have four. This you are to strike into the Mud at the bottom of the River; and if you chance to light where they lie, you need not fear taking them if your Instrument be good.</p>

                     <p>WHen you angle for the <hi>Grailing,</hi> you must head your Hook upon the Shank with a very slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der narrow plate of Lead, and let it be slenderest at the bent of the Hook, that the Bait which must be a large Grashoper, may with more facility come over it: At the point let there be a Cad bait, and keep the bait in continual Motion; and forget not to pull off the Grashopper's Wings which are uppermost.</p>
                     <p>In the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Bait for the <hi>Grailing,</hi> which is called a <hi>Tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail:</hi> This worm is of a pale Flesh-colour, with a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tag on his Tail, somewhat less then half an Inch long; which is to be found in Marled Grounds and Meadows in fair weather, but not to be seen in cold weather, or after a showre of Rain.</p>

                     <p>He spawns three or four times in the Summer sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. His feeding is much like the <hi>Barbel's,</hi> in sharp Streams and on Gravel, slighting all manner of Flies. He is easily taken with a small red Worm, fishing near the ground.</p>
                     <p>This Fish is Leather-mouthed, and will not easily be lost off the Hook when struck. You may fish for him with Float, your Hook being on the ground; or by hand with a running line on the ground, without either Cork or Float.</p>
                     <p>Wasps, Gentles, and Cad-baits are good baits for the <hi>Gudgeon,</hi> but the small Red worm the best; you may fish for them with two or three hooks at once and find very pleasant sport where they rise any thing large. When you Angle for them, stir up the Sand or Gravel with a long Pole, which will make them gather to that place, and bite faster and with more eagerness.</p>

He is small and slender, seldom exceeding three Inches in length: he is bearded like a <hi>Barbel,</hi> having two Fins at his sides, four at his Belly, and onely one at his Tail and is freckled with many black or brown spots.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Loach</hi> is commonly full of Spawn, which is, with the flesh, a very grateful food to weak Stomacks affording great Nourishment. He is to be taken with a very small Worm neer the ground, for he delights to be neer the Gravel, and therefore is seldom seen on the top of the water.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Minnow</hi> is a fish without Scales, and one of the least of the watry Inhabitants; but for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of meat he may (in my opinion) be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to any fish of greatest value and largest size; and little things should not be despised. The Spawners are usually full of Spawn all the Summer long, for they breed often, as it is but necessary, being both Prey and Baits to other fish. They come into the Rivers generally about <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> and there continue till the cold weather drive them into their Winter quarters again.</p>
                     <p>Of colour this fish is greenish, or wavy sky-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; his Belly is very white, but his Back is blackish. This Fish will bite sharply at a small Worm; and if you will trouble your self to catch enough of them you may make an excellent Tansie of them, cutting off their Heads and Tails, and frying them in Eggs, saucing them with Butter, Sugar and Verjuice.</p>
                     <p>Anglers use to find him oftner then they would: Deep places he seldom frequents. It is a Fish no way curious of his feeding, for any Bait pleaseth him if he can but swallow it, he will strain hard for what he cannot gorge. The chiefest food he loveth is a small red Worm, Wasps, or Cad-baits.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Pike</hi> is a very long-liv'd creature, and if we may credit Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> or <hi>Gesner</hi> that famous Brutologist, he outlives all other Fish; which is pitty, he being as absolute a Tyrant of the Fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters, as the <hi>Salmon</hi> is, the King thereof.</p>
                     <p>The larger the <hi>Pike,</hi> the courser the food, the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler being ever best; contrary to the nature of <hi>Eels,</hi> which improve their goodness by their bulk and age.</p>
                     <p>He is a melancholick Fish, because he never swims in Shoals, but rests himself alone; and he is as bold as any fish whatever, if we may believe Report, which informs us a <hi>Pike</hi> hath been known to fight with an Otter for a <hi>Carp</hi> he had taken, and was carrying out of the Water. Another bit a Mule by the Lip as he was drinking, and stuck thereunto so fast, that by that means the Owner of the Mule took him. Another bit a Maid by the Foot as she was washing. He will frequently devour his own kind unnaturally; from whence I suppose he may obtain the name of a <hi>Fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water-wolf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100171:210"/>
                     <p>As the <hi>Pike</hi> is in nature like the Hawk, a Bird of Prey, so he is like her in generation, neither of them breeding but once a year: and when the <hi>Pike</hi> spawns it is between <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March.</hi> The best <hi>Pikes</hi> are found in Rivers, the worst in Meres or Ponds.</p>
                     <p>His common Food is either Pickerel weed, Frogs, or what fish he can procure. This Pickerel-weed some say, both feeds and breeds them.</p>
                     <p>There are two ways of fishing for the <hi>Pike;</hi> first by the Ledger, secondly by the Walking-bait.</p>
                     <p>The Ledger-bait is fix'd in one certain place, whilst the Angler may be absent; and this must be a living Bait, either Fish or Frog. Of Fish the best are a <hi>Dace, Roach,</hi> or <hi>Pearch:</hi> for Frogs, the yellowest are the best. How to keep them alive on your Hook, your own ingenuity will inform you.</p>
                     <p>When you intend to use the Ledger-bait, if it be a Fish, stick your Hook through his upper Lip; and then fastning it to a strong Line at least twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yards in length, tie the other end of the Line ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to some Stake in the ground, or to some bough of a Tree near the <hi>Pike's</hi> usual haunt or where you think 'tis like he may come. Then winde your Line on a sorked stick, (big enough to keep the bait from draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it under water) all except about half yard or somewhat more; and your stick having a small celft at the end, fasten your Line therein; but so, that when the <hi>Pike</hi> comes, he may easily draw it forth, and have Line enough to go to his hold and pouch.</p>
                     <p>If your Bait be a Frog, put the Arming-wyre in at his Mouth, and out at his Gills; and then with a fine Needle and Silk sow the upper part of his Leg with one stitch onely to your Arming-wyre, or tie his Leg above the upper joynt to the Wyre; but as gently as you can, lest you hurt him.</p>
                     <p>I have seen excellent sport with living baits tied
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100171:211"/>
about the Bodies of two or three couple of Ducks, driven over a place where store of <hi>Pikes</hi> have frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I have observed the <hi>Pike</hi> to strike so violently at the living Bait, that being hung he hath drawn the Duck clear under water. The like may be done with such baits tied to bladders, suffering them to float down the River, whilst you mind your sport walking on its Banks.</p>
                     <p>The next way of Angling for a <hi>Pike</hi> is with a <hi>Trowl</hi> with a Winch to wind it up withal. As this Fish is very strong, so must your Tackle; and your Rod must not be very slender at top, where must be placed a Ring for your Line to run through. Your Line must be Silk two yards and a quarter next the Hook, which mast be double, and strongly armed with a Wyre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seven Inches: the rest of your Line may be strong Shoemakers-thread. Upon the shank of the Hook fasten some smooth Lead; and having placed your Hook in the Mouth of a <hi>Minnow, Dace,</hi> or <hi>Roach;</hi> with your Lead sink your Bait with his head downward. Having so done, cast your Bait up and down: if you feel him at the hook, give him length enough to run away with the Bait and pouch it; which when you think he hath done, strike him with a smart jerk, and so continue your sport with him as long as you shall think fit. Take like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise this next Direction from a friend that speaks not much different.</p>
                     <p>When you intend to Trowl, you may make choice either of <hi>Roach, Dace, Bleak,</hi> or <hi>Gudgeon</hi> to bait withal, (but for my own part I always prefer the <hi>Guogeon</hi>) which you must do thus: put your Arming-wyre in at the Mouth, and thrusting it along by the Back bring it out again at the Tail, and there fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slen it with a Thread Having your Reel in your hand, and your Line fastned to your hook through a Ring at
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100171:211"/>
the top of your Rod, cast your bait into some likely place, and move it up and down in the water as you walk gently by the River-side: when you have a bite (which you may easily feel, for he will give a good tug) be sure to give him Line enough. You may let him lie almost a quarter of an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you strike; and then have a care you do it not too fiercely, lest you endanger your Tackle, and lose the Fish to boot.</p>
                     <p>If you fish at Snap, you must give him leave to run a little, then strike, striking the contrary way to which he runneth. For this way of Angling, a Spring hook is best; and your Tackle must be much stronger than that for the Trowl, because you must strike with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force.</p>
                     <p>Here note, that a large Bait more invites the <hi>Pike</hi> to bite, but the lesser takes him more infallibly, either at Snap or Trowl.</p>
                     <p>If you fish with a dead bait for a <hi>Pike,</hi> this is a most excellent bait: Take a <hi>Minnow,</hi> Frog that is yellow, <hi>Dace,</hi> or <hi>Roach,</hi> and having dissolved Gum of Ivy in Oil of Spike, anoint your baith therewith, and cast it where <hi>Pikes</hi> frequent. Having lain a little while at bottom, draw it to the top, and so up the Stream, and you will quickly perceive a <hi>Pike</hi> follow it with much eagerness.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Pike</hi> will bite at all baits, excepting the Fly, and bites best about three in the afternoon in clear water with a gentle gale, from the middle of Summer to the latter end of Autumm; he then bites best in still places or a gentle Stream: but in Winter he bites all the day long. In the latter end, and beginning of the Spring, he bites most eagerly early in the morning, and late in the evening</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Pearch</hi> is a fish that is hook-backt, somewhat bow'd like a Hog, and armed with stiff Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and his sides with dry thick Scales. He is a bold biter, which appears by his daring to adventure on one of his own kind with more courage than the <hi>Pike</hi> by much.</p>
                     <p>Some say there are two sorts of <hi>Pearches,</hi> the one salt-water, and the other fresh: the first hath but one Fin on his Back, the latter two, which is more than most Fishes have.</p>
                     <p>He spawns but once a year, and that is in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> and seldome grows longer than two foot. His best time of biting is when the Spring is far spent, at which time you may take at one standing all that are in one hole, be they never so many.</p>
                     <p>His Baits are a <hi>Minnow,</hi> or little Frog; but a Worm called a <hi>Brandling</hi> is best, if well scoured. When he bites give him time enough, and that can hardly be too much.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pearch</hi> biteth well all the day long in cool cloudy weather; but chiefly from eight in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till ten, and from three till almost six.</p>
                     <p>You may angle for him with Lob-worms well scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Bobs, Oak-worms, Gentles, Colewort-worms, <hi>Minnows,</hi> Dors, Wasps, and Cad-baits.</p>
                     <p>He will not bite at all the seasons of the year, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Winter, for then he is very abstemious; yet if it be warm he will bite then in the midst of the day; for in Winter all fish bite best about the heat of the day.</p>
                     <p>If you rove for a <hi>Pearch</hi> with a <hi>Minnow,</hi> (which of all baits yields the most delightful recreation to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100171:212"/>
Angler) it must be alive, sticking your Hook through his upper Lip or back Fin, and letting him swim about mid-water, or somewhat lower; for which purpose you must have an indifferent large Cork with a Quill on your Line.</p>
                     <p>I always make use of a good strong Silk-Line, and a good Hook arm'd with Wyre, so that if a <hi>Pike</hi> do come I may be provided for him, and have by this means taken several. I use also to carry a Tin-pot of about two quarts or three pints, in which to keep my <hi>Minnows</hi> or <hi>Gudgeons</hi> alive: the Lid of the Pot is full of little holes, so that I can give them fresh Water without opening it; which ought to be about every quarter of an hour, lest they die.</p>
                     <p>If you take a small Casting-net with you, you may at a cast or two take baits enough to serve you all day without farther trouble.</p>
                     <p>When you fish with a Frog, you must fasten the Hook through the skin of his Leg towards the upper part thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pearch</hi> is none of the Leather-mouth'd sort of fishes; and therefore when he bites give him time enough to pouch his bait, lest when you think all sure, his hold break out, and you lose your fish and your patience too.</p>
                     <p>The best place to fish for <hi>Pearches</hi> is in the turning of the Water, or Edwing in a good Gravel Scoure, where you will not fail of them, and Ruffs before spoke of.</p>
                     <p>He that will take a <hi>Pearch</hi> must first take notice that this fish feeds well, and bites freely. Let the Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler over-night bait his ground with Lob-worms chopt in pieces; and in the morning let him come to the place, where he must first plumb his ground, then gage his Line and bait his hook with a red knotted worm, or a <hi>Minnow,</hi> which is better in my opinion: the hook
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100171:213"/>
must be put in at the back of the <hi>Minnow</hi> betwixt the fish and the skin, that the <hi>Minnow</hi> may swim up and down alive, being buoyed up with a Cork or Quill, that the <hi>Minnow</hi> may have liberty to swim a foot off the ground. Let these directions be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and followed, and the Angler need not fear the frustration of his expectations.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Roach</hi> is a very silly fish, being every whit as simple as the <hi>Carp</hi> is crafty. They are more to be esteemed which are found in Rivers than in Ponds, although those that breed in the latter are of a much larger size; yet the <hi>Thames</hi> below Bridge abounds with very large fat <hi>Roach,</hi> such as I may confidently affirm exceed in magnitude all others either in Ponds or Rivers.</p>

                     <p>In <hi>April</hi> the Cads or Worms are proper Baits to angle for <hi>Roaches;</hi> in Summer fish for them with small white Snails or Flies: but note, they must be under water, for he will not bite at the top. Or, take a <hi>May-fly,</hi> and with a Plumb sink it where you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>Roaches</hi> lie, whether in deep water, or near the Posts and Piles either or Bridge or Wear having so done, do not hastily, but gently pull your Fly up, and you will see the <hi>Roach</hi> (if any there) pu sue and take it near the rim of the water lest by flight it should escape.</p>
                     <p>In Autumn you may fish for them with Paste onely made of the crums of sine White-bread, moulded with a little water and the labour of your hands into a tough Paste, colour'd not very deep with Red-Lead, with which you may mix a little sine Cotten or Lint, and a little Butter; these last will make it hold on and not wash off your Hook. With which you must fish with much circumspection, or you lose your bait. In like manner in Winter you may angle for <hi>Roach</hi> with Paste; but Gentles are then the better bait.</p>
                     <p>Take these next Observations experimentally tried by some of us, <hi>viz.</hi> There is another excellent bait either so: Winter or Summer, and that is this: Take an handful of well dried Malt, and put it into a Dish of Water, and then having grubbed and washed it betwixt our hands till it be clean and free from Husks, put that water from it, and having put it into a little fresh water, set it over a gentle Fire, and let it boil till it be pretty fest; then pour the Water from it, and with a sharp Knife, turning the sprout-end of the Corn upward, take off the back-part of the Husk with the point of your Knife, leaving a kind of inward
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100171:214"/>
Husk on the Corn, or else you spoil all: then cut off a little of the sprout-end, that the white may appear, and also a very little of the other end for the Hook to enter. When you make use of this bait, cast now and then a little of it into the water; and then, if your Hook be small and good, you will find it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent bait either for <hi>Roach</hi> or <hi>Dace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another good bait is the young brood of Wasps or Bees, if you dip their Heads in Blood. So is the thick blood of a Sheep being half dried on a Trencher, and then cut into such small pieces as will best fit your Hook: a little Salt will keep it from turning black, and make it the better.</p>
                     <p>Or you may take a handful or two of the largest and best Wheat you can get, boil it in a little Milk till it be soft, then fry it gently with Honey and a little beaten Saffron dissolved in Milk.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Roach</hi> spawns about the middle of <hi>May;</hi> and the general baits by which he is caught are these: small white Snails, Bobs, Cad-baits, Sheeps blood, all sorts of Worms, Gnats, Wasps, Paste, and Cherries.</p>
                     <p>The way of fishing for <hi>Roach</hi> at London-Bridge is after this manner: In the Moneths of <hi>June,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> there is great resort of those Fish to that place, where those that make a trade of it take a strong Cord, at the end whereof is fastned a three-pound weight; a foot above the Lead they fasten a Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread of twelve foot long to the Cord, and unto the Packthread at convenient distances they add a dozen strong Links of Hair with Roach-Hooks at them, bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a white Snail of Perriwinkle; then holding the Cord in their Hands, the biting of the Fish draweth the Packthread, and the Packthread the Cord, which admonisheth them them what to do: whereby some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they draw up half a dozen, sometimes less, but commonly two or three at one draught.</p>

That you may attain thereunto, note, that you must put your Hook into the Mouth of any the aforesaid Baits, and out at his Tail tying him fast with white thread a little above it, in such manner that he may turn: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this sow up his mouth, and your design is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.

If they are so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed that they cannot find their way to the Sea, they become sick, lean, and pine away, and die in two years. If they spawn in the mean time, from thence proceeds a small <hi>Salmon</hi> called a <hi>Skegger,</hi> which will never grow great. It is the Sea that makes them grow big; but it is the fresh Rivers that makes them grow fat; and so much the farther they are from the Sea up in the River, the fatter they grow, and the better their food.</p>
                     <p>From a <hi>Samlet</hi> (which is but little bigger than a <hi>Minnow</hi>) he grows to be a <hi>Salmon</hi> in as short time as a Goslin will grow to be a Goose.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Salmon</hi> biteth best at three of the clock in the Afternoon, in the Moneths of <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> if the water be clear, and some little breeze of Wind stirring, especially if the Wind bloweth against the Stream, and near the Sea.</p>
                     <p>Where note, that he hath not his constant resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, like a <hi>Trout,</hi> but removes often, coveting to be as near the Spring-head as he may, swimming generally in the deepest and broadest parts of the River near the ground; and he is caught like a <hi>Trout,</hi> with Worm, Fly, or <hi>Minnow.</hi> The Garden-worm is an Excellent bait for the <hi>Salmon,</hi> if it be well scoured, and kept in Moss about twenty days, after which time those Worms will be very clear, tough and lively.</p>
                     <p>There is a way of fishing for <hi>Salmon</hi> with a Ring of Wyre on the top of the Rod, through which the Line may run to what length is thought convenient, having a Wheel also near the hand.</p>
                     <p>I have been told that there is no bait more attractive of and eagerly pursued by the <hi>Salmon</hi> and most other fish, than Lob-worms scented with the Oil of Ivy-ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100171:215"/>
or the Oil of Polypodie of the Oak mixt with Turpentine; nay, <hi>Assa Foetida</hi> they say is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly good.</p>
                     <p>The Artificial Fly is a good bait for a <hi>Salmon;</hi> but you must then use a Trowl as for the <hi>Pike,</hi> he being a strong fish. As the <hi>Salmon</hi> is a large fish, to must your Flies be larger than for any other, with Wings and Tails very long.</p>
                     <p>You shall observe, when you strike him, that he will plunge and bounce, but doth not usually endeavour to run to the length of the Line, as the <hi>Trout</hi> will do; and therefore there is less danger of breaking your Line.</p>
                     <p>If you will angle for <hi>Salmon</hi> at ground, then take three or four Garden-worms well scoured, and put them on your Hook at once, and fish with them in the same manner as you do for <hi>Trouts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be sure to give the <hi>Salmon</hi> (as well as all other fish) time to go gorge the Bait, and be not over-hasty, unless your bait be so tender it will not endure nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at. Much more may be said of Salmon-fishing, which I shall pass by, leaving the rest to your own practice and observation.</p>

                     <head>Of the <hi>TENCH.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Shall now discover an approved way how to take <hi>Tench</hi> and <hi>Carp</hi> in a muddy Pond: but know, I do not make publick this following Secret, to teach Knaves how to rob Gentlemens Ponds, but that the proper Owners may be able upon cases of necessity to supply themselves with Fish, without being put to so much trouble and charge as to sue their Ponds. But to the purpose. In the first place you must provide your self with a very good large Casting-net, well
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100171:216"/>
leaded; let not the Meshes from the Crown to a full yard and a half be too small; for then if the Pond be any thing of a depth, the fish will strike away before the Net comes to the ground: the whole Net ought to have a large Mesh, well leaded, and deep Tuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
                     <p>The second thing to be done is, to make the place clean from Stakes and Bushes, and try with the Net before you intend for the sport: if your Net happen to hang, then all your pains will prove ineffectual; therefore you must be sure before you cast in your Net that you clear and cleanse the place very well twice or thrice with a Rake. Then take a quarter of a peck of Wheat, baking it well in an Oven, putting in near three quarts of Water; when it is well baked, take five pints of Blood, and incorporate the Wheat and Blood together, adding thereto as much Bran as is sufficient to make a Paste thereof: and that it may the better hold together, put some (lay to it; after this, knead it well together with a quart of Lob worms chopt in pieces, and worked into Paste as aforesaid: then roll it into balls as big as a Goose-egg, and throw it into the Pond within the circumference of your Casting-net; and between whiles throw in some Grains; and when you think the fish have found out the Baiting-place, then come in the close of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (having baited very early in the Morning) and cast your Net over the baited-place: then take a long pole with a large Fork made for the purpose, and stir all about the Net; for the <hi>Carps</hi> and <hi>Tench</hi> are struck up beyond their Eyes in Mud, and stand exactly upon their Heads: let the Net lie near an half hour, still stirring with your Pole, if the place be not too deep: when you have covered the Fish, you may go into the Pond, and take them out with your hands; but if the water be deep, when you find the <hi>Carps</hi> begin to stir,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100171:216"/>
(for they cannot stand long on their heads in the Mud) then lift up the Crown of your Net bolt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with a long Staff, that so the fish may play into the Tuck of the Net.</p>
                     <p>Here note, that should you draw up your Net sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after you have cast it in, it is an hundred pound to a penny whether you should take one <hi>Carp</hi> or <hi>Tench;</hi> but letting the Net lie, the Mud will choak them if they remove not out of it.</p>
                     <p>Now here I cannot omit a very pleasant story in my opinion: A Gentleman having special <hi>Carps</hi> in his pond, but not knowing how to take one of them, unless it were by chance with Hook and Line; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him that we might taste of his <hi>Carps,</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly told him, a brace of them would serve our turns: He answered, I might freely have them, if I knew how to catch them. Hereupon I prepared some ingredients, and having baited a convenient place very early in the Morning, at the dusk of the Evening we came with a Casting-net, and at the first throw co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a great quantity of fish, as hereafter will appear; but not one seem'd to stir a jot under the Net, being all struck into the Mud. Hereupon the Gentleman fell a laughing heartily, saying, <hi>Sir, If I had no other provision to trust to but what fish you shall catch this night, I believe I shall go supperless to Bed.</hi> Hearing him say so, I desired that he would have a little patience, for the fish were asleep, and I was as yet loath to disturb them; but half an hour hence, if he would stay so long, I should make bold to awake them with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: So the Gentleman having smoaked a pipe of Tobacco a <hi>Carp</hi> began to play in the Net; and after this in a very little time a great many more began to dance and skip: whereupon I lifted up the Crown, that they might play in the Tuck; and when I thought they were all got out of the Mud I began to draw,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100171:217"/>
and at one draught drew up in the Net Seventy odd <hi>Carps,</hi> great and small, to the admiration and great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Owner and the rest of the company, having in all their life-time not seen the like before.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tench</hi> hath but small Scales, (and they smooth) yet very large Fins, with a red Circle about his Eyes, and a little Barb hanging at each corner of his Mouth.</p>
                     <p>The Slime of a <hi>Tench</hi> is very medicinal to woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Fishes; and therefore he is commonly called the <hi>Fishes Physitian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pike</hi> is so sensible of his vertue, that he will not injure the <hi>Tench,</hi> though he will seize on any other fish of his size that comes in his way: And when the <hi>Pike</hi> is sick or hurt, he applies himself to the <hi>Tench,</hi> and finds cure by rubbing himself against him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tench</hi> hath a greater love for Ponds than clear Rivers, and delights himself amongst Weeds, and loves to feed in very foul Water; and yet his food is nourishing and pleasant.</p>
                     <p>The time of Angling for him is early and late, both morning and evening, in the moneths of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> or all night in the still parts of the River.</p>
                     <p>He is a great lover of large red Worms, and will bite most eagerly at them, if you first dip them in Tar. The <hi>Tench</hi> loves also all sorts of Paste made up with strong-sented Oyls, or with Tar, or a Paste made of brown Bread and Honey. He will bite also at a Cad-worm, a Lob worm, a Flag-worm, green Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Cad-bait, Marsh-worm, or soft boyled Bread-grain.</p>

                        <hi>Of the</hi> TROUT.</head>
                     <p>IT is observed that the <hi>Trout</hi> comes in and goes out of season with the Stag and Buck, and Spawns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November:</hi> which is the more to be wondred at, because most other fish Spawn in warm weather, when the Sun by his heat hath adapted the Earth and Water making them fit for generation.</p>
                     <p>All the Winter, the <hi>Trout</hi> is Sick, Lean and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and you shall frequently then find him Louzy. These Trout-lice are a small Worm with a big Head sticking close to his sides, and sucking moisture from him that gave them being: and he is not freed from them till the Spring or the begining of Summer, at which time his strength increaseth; and then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth the still deep waters, and betakes himself to gravelly ground, against which he never leaves rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till he hath cleansed himself of his Louziness; and then he delights to be in the sharp Streams and such as are swift, where he will lie in wait for <hi>Minnows</hi> and <hi>May-flies;</hi> at the latter end of which month he is in his prime, being better and fatter in that Month, especially at the latter end thereof, than in any other throughout the whole year.</p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:100171:218"/>
                     <p>There are several sorts of <hi>Trouts</hi> highly prizable; as the <hi>Fordidge-Trout,</hi> the <hi>Amerly-Trout,</hi> the <hi>Bull-Trout</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with many more which I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to mention, but only tell you what is generally observed; and that is, that the red and yellow <hi>Trouts</hi> are the best, and as'to the Sex, the Female is the best, having a less head and a deeper body then the Male. By their Hog-back you shall know that they are in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with the like note for all other fish.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Trout</hi> is usually caught with a Worm, Minnow or Fly natural or artificial. There are several sorts of Worms which are baits for the Angler; the Earth-worm, the Dug-worm, the Maggot or Gentle; but for the <hi>Trout,</hi> the Lob-worm and Brandling are the best, or Squirril-tail, having a red head, streakt down the back, and a broad Tail. The Brandling is found commonly in an old Dung-hill, Cow-dung, Hogs-dung, or Tanners-bark. Here note, that whatever Worms you fish withal are the better for keeping; which must be in an Earthen pot with Moss, which you must change often in Summer, that is, once in three or four daies, and in twice as long time in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>When you fish for a <hi>Trout</hi> by hand on the ground, take a Lob-worm and clap your Hook into him a little above the middle, and out again a little below the same; then draw your Worm above the arming of your Hook, making your first entrance at the Tail end, that the point of the Hook may come out at the Head-end.</p>
                     <p>When you fish with a <hi>Minnow,</hi> take the whitest and middle-sized, for those are the best, and place him so on your Hook, that he may turn round when he is drawn against the Stream.</p>
                     <p>The best Instructions (for putting the <hi>Minnow</hi> on the Hook) which I can lay down are these: Put your
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100171:218"/>
Hook in at his Mouth and out at his Gill, drawing it through about three Inches; then put the Hook again into his Mouth, and let the point and beard come out at his Tail; then the Hook and his Tail you must tie about with a fine white Thread, and let the body of the <hi>Minnow</hi> be almost straight on the Hook: then try against the Stream whether it will turn; where note, it cannot turn too fast. If you want a <hi>Minnow,</hi> a small <hi>Loach</hi> or <hi>Sticklebag</hi> will serve the turn: if none of these can be gotten, you may in their season have an Artificial one made of Cloath by one that is living, which I have found to be every whit as good a Bait as what are natural.</p>
                     <p>If you fish with a Natural or Artificial Fly, then follow such directions as I have already prescribed in a foregoing Chapter, which particularly discourses of Flies Natural and Artificial.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is the opinion some, that the <hi>Umber</hi> and <hi>Grai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> differ onely in Names, and are of a Trout-kind, but seldom grow to the bigness of a <hi>Trout,</hi> I having never seen nor heard any exceed the length of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Inches.</p>
                     <p>He frequents such Rivers as the <hi>Trouts</hi> do, and is taken with the same Baits, especially the Fly; and; being a simple Fish, is more bold than the <hi>Trout</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>In the Winter he absconds himself, but after <hi>April</hi> he appears abroad, and is very gamesome and pleasant. He is very tender-mouth'd, and therefore quickly lost after he is struck. For what more may be said, I refer you to the Chapter of the <hi>Grailing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:100171:219"/>
                     <p>THus have I given you an Alphabetical and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary account of the Nature of Fish, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways to take them, according to ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern experience: I shall onely give you more a short discovery of their Haunts; and so I shall conclude this Treatise.</p>
                     <p>Next to the Art of taking Fish, the knowledge of their Haunts and proper places to find them in accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their kinds is rightly to be considered: for not knowing what Rivers or what parts of them are fittest for your Baits, or what Baits best sute with each River and the fish therein contained, you onely angle at adventure, and, instead of reaping satisfaction, you onely lose your pains and your labour.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore in the first place you are to understand, that fishes change places with the season. Some in the Summer keep always near the top or rim of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; others are continually at the bottom. For the first, you may angle with a Float or Fly; the latter are to be found at the Arches of Bridges, Mill-ponds, Wears, Flood-gates, &amp;c. In Winter all fish in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fly into deep Waters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Barbel, Roach, Dace,</hi> and <hi>Ruff</hi> delight in sandy gravelly ground. The deepest part of the River and the Shadows of Trees are equally grateful.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bream, Pike,</hi> and <hi>Chub</hi> choose a Clay and Ouzie ground. The <hi>Bream</hi> delights most in the midst of a River whose Stream is not too rapid, but gently gliding: the <hi>Pike</hi> is for still Waters full of Fry; and that he may the better and securer seize his Prey, he frequently absconds himself amongst Water-docks, under Bushes or Bull-rushes.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100171:219"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Carp, Tench,</hi> and <hi>Eel</hi> frequent still Waters, and what are foul and muddy. <hi>Eels</hi> lie lurking under Roots or Stones: The <hi>Carp</hi> is for the deepest place of the Water; and where there are green Weeds the <hi>Carp</hi> and <hi>Tench</hi> delight most of all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pearch</hi> delight in gentle Streams not too deep, yet they must not be shallow; and a hollow Bank is their chiefest refuge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gudgeons</hi> love sandy ground in gentle Streams, they affect small Rivers above the large, or small Brooks, and bite best in the Spring till they Spawn.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Salmon</hi> delights most in Rivers which ebb and flow, are large, and have a swift current, in such Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are the greatest plenty. If the Rivers are rocky or weedy, so much the better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Shad, Thwait, Plaice,</hi> and <hi>Flounder</hi> have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test love for salt or brackish Waters which ebb and flow.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Umber</hi> affects Marly Clay grounds, clear and swift Streams; but they must then be far from the Sea, for they seldom come near it.</p>
                     <p>There are many more Rules to be observed, which generally hold good, but I will not conclude them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, since I have found some of them (well credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) very false; wherefore let every man's expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience be his guide in the knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Rivers, and the Fish their Inhabitants. And therefore it will be very requisite for him that would be compleat in the Art of Angling, diligently to observe whatever River or water he fisheth in, whether it be

muddy, slimy stony, gravelly, swift, or of a slow motion. And as he must have a competent knowledge in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Ponds, or all fishable waters he is acquainted with; so must he know the nature of each Filh, and what Baits are most proper for every kind, or he shall never attain to the reputation of a good experienced ANGLER.</p>

                     <p>NOne certainly is so ignorant to address him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the River for Recreation, but he will be mindful to carry necessary Tackle with him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compleatly furnished therewith let him in the first place consult Sun, Wind, Moon, Stars, and change of Air; for without observing Times and Seasons, his Tackle, though never so good, will prove ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore observe, if the Sun be obscured with Clouds, and his Face hidden from your Eyes, then set forth your Ground-baits, and use your brightest Flies. If the Sun shine out gloriously, then use the darkest of your Flies. Here note,</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen, I write to you that have more than common experience in the Art of Angling, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope you will not expect that I should here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you how to prosecute the little recreation of the <hi>Thames,</hi> how to catch <hi>Bleak, Dace,</hi> &amp;c. since there is hardly any young beginner that is ignorant thereof: Whereof omitting such trifling discourse, I shall fall upon that which is somewhat more material, and first, how to take <hi>Eels.</hi> When the Angler stays a night or two, let him take five or six Lines (or what number he thinks fit) each of them about sixteen yards long, and at every two yards long make a Noose to hang on a hook armed either to double Thread, or Silk-twist, for it is better then Wyre. His Hooks must be baited with <hi>Millers-thumbs, Loaches, Minnows</hi> or <hi>Gudgeons:</hi> to every Noose there must be a Line baited, and all the Lines mustly cross the River in the deepest place, either with Stones or pegged lying in the bottom, you must watch all night, or rise as soon as ever it is break of day (or else you will lose divers that were hung) and draw up the Lines, on each of which I have known two or three <hi>Eels</hi> or <hi>Grigs.</hi>

                     <p>Every one that delights in Fly-fishing ought to learn the way of making two sorts of Artificial Flies, the Palmer ribbed with Silver or Gold, and the <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly,</hi> both which are the ground of all Flies.</p>
                     <p>In the making of the Palmer-Fly he must arm his Line on the inside of the Hook; then with a pair of Sizers let him cut so much of the brown of a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards Feathers as he shall think sufficient to make the Wings; then let him lay the outermost part of the Feather next the Hook, and the point of the Feather
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100171:222"/>
towards the Shank of the Hook; let him whip it three or four times about the Hook with the same Silk he armed the Hook; then make his Silk fast: then let him take the Hackle of the neck of a Cock or Capon (but a Plovers Top is best) and let him take off the one side of the Feather; and then he must take the Hackle-silk, or Gold or Silver thread; and let him make all these fast at the bent of the Hook, working them up to the Wings; every bout shifting his Fingers, and making a stop, then the Gold will fall right, and let him make fast: then work up the Hackle to the same place, and make it fast: after this let him take the Hook betwixt his Finger and Thumb in the left hand with Needle or Pin, and part the Wings in twain; then with the Arming-silk (having fastned all hitherto) let him whip it about as it falleth cross between the Wings, and with his Thumb he must turn the point of the Feather towards the bent of the Hook: then let him work it three or four times about the shank, so fasten it, and view the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for other Flies.</p>
                     <p>If he make the grounds of Hogs-wool, sandy, black, or white, or Bears-wool, or of a red Bullock two years old, he must work these grounds on a waxed Silk, and must arm and set on the Wings as aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>The body of the May-fly must be wrought with some of these grounds, which will be admirably well when ribbed with black Hair. The <hi>Oak-fly</hi> he must make with Orange-Tawny and black, for the body; and the brown of the Mallards Feather for the Wings.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be observed, is the Floating for Scale-fish in Pond, or River: First, take notice that the Feed brings the Fish together, as the Sheep to the Pen; and there is no better in all Angling for Feed, than Bloud and Grains; though Paste is good yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to these.</p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:100171:223"/>
                     <p>Next, let him observe to plumb his ground, Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with fine Tackle, as single hair for half the Line next the Hook, round and small plumbed according to his Float. There is a small red worm with a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tip on his Tail, which is an excellent bait for this sort of Fish or any other. Other special baits are these: Brandlings, Gentles, Paste or Cadice (otherwise call'd Cock-bait.) They lie in Gravelly husk under the stones in the River.</p>
                     <p>There is a way of Trowling for <hi>Pike</hi> with an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle rod of Twelve foot long, with a Ring of Wyre on the top of the Rod for the Line to run through: within two foot of the bottom of the Rod, there is a hole made to put in a Wind to turn with a Barrel, to gather sip the Line and loose it at pleasure: This is the best manner of Trowling.</p>
                     <p>There is another way to take more <hi>Pikes</hi> either in Meere, Pond, or River, than any Trowler with his Rod can do, which is done after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take a forked stick with a Line of Twelve yards long wound upon it; at the upper end leave about a yard, either to tie a bunch of Flags, or a Bladder to buoy up the Fish, and to carry it from the ground. The Bait must be a live fish, either <hi>Dace, Gudgeon, Roach,</hi> or small <hi>Trout:</hi> The forked stick must have a slit in the one side of the Fork to put in the Line, that he may set his live fish to swim at a gage, that when a <hi>Pike</hi> taketh the Bait, he may have the full liberty of the line for his feed. He may turn these loose either in Pond or River, in the Pond with the Wind all day long, the more the better: at night let him set some small weight that he may stay the Buoy till the Fish taketh it.</p>
                     <p>For the River he must turn all loose with the Stream; the Hooks must be double, the Shanks must be somewhat shorter then ordinary; for the shorter
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100171:223"/>
the Hook is off the Shank, without doubt it will less hurt the fish: and it must be armed with small Wyre well softned; but certainly a hook armed with twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Silk is better.</p>
                     <p>If you arm your hook with Wyre, the Needle must be made with an Eye; then must he take one of those living Baits, and with one of his Needles enter within a Straws breadth of the Gill of the Fish, so pull the Needle betwixt the Skin and the Fish, then pull the Needle out at the hindmost Fin, and draw the Arming thorough the Fish, until the Hook come to lie close to the Fishes Body having so done, let him put off in Meere or pond with the Wind; in the River with the Stream: the more that he pulls off in Meere or Pond, he is the likelier to have the greater Pastime.</p>
                     <p>There is a time when <hi>Pikes</hi> go a Frogging in Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and in the River to Sun them, as in <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> at these times you shall hardly miss one in twenty; and thus must the Angler deal with them. Let him take a Line of Seven or Eight foot, and let him arm a large Hook of the largest size that is made, and arm it to his Line; let him lead the shank of his Hook neatly, of such a weight that he may guide the Hook at his pleasure. He may strike the Pike that he sees with the bare Hook where he pleases. This Line and Hook doth far exceed Snaring.</p>
                     <p>In the taking of a <hi>Carp</hi> either in Pond or River, if the Angler intends to add Profit to his Pleasure, he must take a Peck of Ale-Grains and a good quantity of any Blood, and mix the Grains together, with which let him bait the Ground wherein he intends to Angle. This feed will wonderfully attract the Scale-fish, as <hi>Carp, Tench, Roach, Dace,</hi> and <hi>Bream.</hi> In the Morning early let him prosecute his pastime, plumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ground, and Angling for a <hi>Carp</hi> with a strong Line: the bait must be either paste, or a knotted red
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100171:224"/>
Worm; by this means he shall find sport enough.</p>
                     <p>In the Taking of a <hi>Trout</hi> with Ground-baits thus must the Angler do: In the first place he must have a neat taper Rod, light before, with a tender Hazle top. He may Angle with a single hair of five lengths, one tied to the other for the bottom of the Line, and a Line of three hair'd links for the upper part; and so if he have room enough he may take the largest <hi>Trout</hi> that swims in the River. He that angles with a line made of three hair'd links at the bottom, and more at the top, may take <hi>Trouts;</hi> but he that Angles with one Hair, shall take five Trouts to the others one: For this Fish is very quick sighted; therefore the Angler both day &amp; Night must keep out of sight. He must Angle with the point of his Rod down the Stream.</p>
                     <p>He must begin to Angle in <hi>March</hi> with the Ground-baits all day long: but if it prove clear and bright, he must take the Morning and Evening, or else his labour will be in vain.</p>
                     <p>He that Angles with Ground-baits, must fit his Tackle to his Rod, and begin at the upper end of the Stream, carrying his Line with an upright hand, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plummet running on the ground some ten Inches from the Hook, plumbing his Line according to the swiftness of the Stream that he Angles in, for one Plummet will not serve for all Streams.</p>
                     <p>For his Bait let him take the red knotted Worm, which is very good where Brandlings are not to be had. The <hi>Minnow</hi> (or as some call it a <hi>Penk</hi>) is a singular Bait for a <hi>Trout;</hi> for he will come as boldly at it as a Mastiff-dog at a Bear. It will be advantageous to him in his angling to use a Line made of three Silks and three Hairs twisted for the upper most part of the Line, and two Silks and two Hairs twisted for the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom next the Hook, with a Swivel nigh to the middle
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100171:224"/>
of his Line, with an indifferent large hook. Let him bait his hook with a <hi>Minnow,</hi> putting the hook through the lowermost part of his mouth, so draw the Hook through; then put the hook in at the mouth again, and let the point of the hook come out at the hindmost Fin; then let him draw his Line, and the <hi>Minnows</hi> mouth will close, that no Water will get into his Belly. As I said before, he must angle with the point of his Rod down the Stream, drawing the <hi>Minnow</hi> up the Stream by little and little nigh the top of the Water: the <hi>Trout</hi> seeing the bait will come most fiercely at it; but the Angler must not then presently strike: this is a true way without Lead; for many times they will come to the Lead, and forsake the <hi>Minnow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next direction is how to angle with a Fly for a <hi>Trout.</hi> In the first place let the Angler fit himself with a Hazle of one piece or two set conveniently together, light and pliable. The lower part of his Line next the Fly must be of three or four hair'd Links; but if he can attain (as aforesaid) to angle with a single Hair, he shall meet with more profit and pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Before he begin to angle, having the wind on his back, let him try how far he can cast his Line, or at what length his Fly, and let him be careful that the Fly fall first on the Water; for if any of the Line light upon the Water, he had better to have stood still than to have thrown at all. He must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cast down the Stream, with the Wind behind and the Sun before him; it is a great advantage to have either Sun or Moon before him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>March</hi> is the moneth for him to begin to angle with the Fly; but if the Weather prove windy or clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there are several sorts of Palmers that are good at that time: The first is a black Palmer ribbed with Silver: The second a black Palmer with an Orange-tawny Body: Thirdly, a Palmer whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100171:225"/>
is all black: Lastly, there is a red Palmer ribbed with Gold, and a red Hackle mixed with Orange Cruel. These Flies serve all the year long Morning and Evening, whether Windy or Cloudy Weather. But if the Air prove serene, he may then imitate the Hawthorn-fly, which is all black and very small, and the smaller the better.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>May</hi> let him take the May-fly and imitate that, which is made several ways: Some make them with a shammy Body; 'tis best with black Hair: Others make them with sandy Hogs-wool, ribbed with black Silk, and winged with a <hi>Mallards</hi> Feather several ways, according to the humour of the Angler. Another called the Oak-fly, is made of Orange co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Cruel, and black, with a brown Wing. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is another Fly, the Body whereof is made of the strain of a Peacock's Feather, which is very good in a bright day. These several sorts of Flies will serve the whole year, observing the times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                     <p>Here note, that the lightest Flies are for cloudy and dark Weather, the darkest for bright and light, and the rest for indifferent seasons, for which his own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Discretion, and Experience must guide him. Of late days the Hogs-wool of several colours, the Wool of a red Heifer and Bears-wool are made use of, which make good grounds, and excellent pastime.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Natural-fly</hi> is a sure way of Angling to Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Anglers Recreation. Now how to find them take notice that the <hi>May-fly</hi> is to be found play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the River side, especially against the Rain.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Oak-fly</hi> is to be found on the But of an Oak, or an Ash, from the beginning of <hi>May</hi> to the end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust:</hi> It is a browntsh Fly, and stands always with his head towards the Root of the Tree, very easy to be found.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:100171:225"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Black-flly</hi> is to be found on every Hawthorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush, after the Buds are come forth.</p>
                     <p>Now with these Flies he must use such a Rod as to angle with the ground bait: the Line must not be so long as the Rod.</p>
                     <p>Let the Angler withdraw his Flie as he shall find it most couvenient and advantageous in his Angling. When he comes to deep Water (whose motion is but slow) let him make his Line about two yards long, and dop his Fly behind a Bush, and he shall find incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable sport.</p>
                     <p>The way to make the best Paste, is to take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quantity of fresh Butter, as much Sheeps-suet that is fresh, a sufficient quantity of the strongest Cheese can be gotten, with the pith of an old stale white Loaf: Let all these be beaten in a Mortar till they come to a perfect paste; and when the Angler in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to spend some time in Angling, let him put here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the quantity of a green Pea upon his Hook, and let him observe what pleasant effects it will produce.</p>

                  <head>The HUNTER. <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Hunting-Horses in general, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and the necessity and benefit of the Art of Keeping.</head>
                  <p>I Shall omit to speak in praise of <hi>Hunting</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, since I would avoid (as much as might be) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, and that it is already done at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>foregoing Book,</hi> with more <hi>Address</hi> than I am <hi>Master</hi> of. But since that <hi>Author</hi> hath spoken nothing of the <hi>Hunting-Horse,</hi> which is a principal <hi>Instrument</hi> of that Excellent <hi>Recreation,</hi> I desire leave to speak a <hi>word</hi> in his Behalf. In Behalf, I say, of this noble Creature, to whom all that are Followers of Hunting are oblig'd: since it is by his <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> that we gratifie at ease our Eyes and Ears with all the Pleasures that <hi>Hunting</hi> affords; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whose Assistance, a great part of us could enjoy it a little more than in Imagination.</p>
                  <p>But tis not to us only, that are <hi>Huntsmen,</hi> but to all <hi>Mankind,</hi> that the <hi>Hunter</hi> is (or may be) service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Has our <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Country</hi> occasion for our Service in the Field: on what <hi>Horse</hi> can we venture our Lives more securely, than on the <hi>Hunter?</hi> His <hi>Readiness to obey the Hand and Heel,</hi> equals him to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100171:235"/>
                     <hi>Mannag'd Horse.</hi> His being us'd to <hi>gallop on all sorts of Grounds,</hi> as well steep places as deep Earths, has so <hi>steel'd his Couragc,</hi> that he declines no <hi>Military service</hi> you can put him on. Are there <hi>Ambuscado's</hi> to be laid, <hi>Discoveries</hi> to be made, speedy and long <hi>Marches</hi> to be perform'd; or any other <hi>Service,</hi> wherein <hi>Strength of Body, Purity of Wind,</hi> or <hi>Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> are requir'd? The <hi>General</hi> may in any of these cases rely on the <hi>Hunter,</hi> with as much Confidence, as on the <hi>Horse</hi> that is <hi>dress'd in the Mannage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In times of <hi>Peace</hi> he is equally Useful, not only for <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but also for <hi>Necessity,</hi> and <hi>Profit.</hi> How diverting to the Eyes, is a <hi>Beautiful Horse</hi> after a <hi>Pack of Dogs?</hi> and with how much ease to our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and delight to our Minds, are we <hi>carried up to them;</hi> with so much <hi>Vigour</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> to be discern'd in his <hi>Countenance,</hi> as if he emulated the <hi>Hounds</hi> in their Speed, and was desirous to excell them, in his Obedience to their common Lord.</p>
                  <p>How <hi>Necessary</hi> is the Hunter beyond all other <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> if his <hi>Masters</hi> urgent <hi>Affairs</hi> (where either <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Fortune</hi> are in hazard,) exact the performance of a <hi>long Journey</hi> in a <hi>short</hi> Time. If his <hi>Master,</hi> in hopes of Advantage, has <hi>match'd</hi> him against any other <hi>Horse;</hi> how ready and willing is he, to persorm the <hi>Utmost</hi> that <hi>Nature</hi> is capable of, or his <hi>Master</hi> can reasonably expect from Him? and having <hi>Art</hi> joyn'd to his <hi>natural Abilities,</hi> will not only excell all other <hi>Horses,</hi> but accomplish things beyond his <hi>Masters Hopes,</hi> or <hi>Expectations;</hi> for without its Assistance in <hi>Dieting</hi> and <hi>Exercise,</hi> no <hi>Horse</hi> can <hi>follow the Hounds,</hi> or indeed undergo any other extreme Labour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazarding the <hi>melting his Grease,</hi> the <hi>breaking of his Wind,</hi> or <hi>foundring</hi> him either in <hi>Feet,</hi> or <hi>Body:</hi> all which are consequences of immoderate Labour, and Ignorance in this Art.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100171:235"/>
                  <p>That I may therefore give you some Light into its Mysteries, I shall first direct you how to breed such <hi>Horses</hi> that may be for <hi>Training;</hi> or else instruct you, how otherwise to procure them. Secondly, how to know by <hi>Shapes, Marks,</hi> and other Tokens, what <hi>Horse</hi> may be most convenient for your purpose. Thirdly, how to <hi>diet</hi> him so, that he may perform all things within his Power, without Danger. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what manner of <hi>Exercise</hi> is most conducive to this Design: and on these Heads I intend to inlarge in my following <hi>Discourse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I enter upon my <hi>Subject</hi> propos'd, I think it necessary to answer <hi>Four Objections,</hi> that may be made against this <hi>Art of Dieting and Training Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> that I may remove all prejudice from the minds of those, who think they may have Reason to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it; and that I may vindicate (with Truth) this <hi>Art,</hi> and clear it from all Aspersions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first Objection</hi> I shall mention, is made by <hi>de Grey</hi> in his Epistle to the Reader, (<hi>Edit. 4th.</hi>) where under the <hi>Umbrage</hi> of his Love to <hi>Horses</hi> and in pity of the Hardships they undergo in <hi>Hunting,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly inveighs against it, as the <hi>Sourse</hi> of all their Miseries. But that I may not be tax'd of <hi>Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by my <hi>Reader,</hi> and for his satisfaction I shall set down his Words, which are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If the Nobility and Gentry of this our Isle of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> did truly know how honourable, and how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Horsemanship were, and how much they are esteem'd and admir'd, who are the true Professors thereof, they would labour more than they now do, to breed and to have good Horses; but it much troubleth me to see, how little Esteem Gentlemen have thereof. Some Horses they have, though not for Mannage, yet for Hunting: but what manner of Hunting? Fox-hunting forsooth, or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, which be as fleet as petty Grey-hounds, wherewith
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100171:236"/>
they do so much over-strain the strength of these poor Horses, (forcing them over deep Fallows, tough Clays, and wet and rough Sands,) that albeit those Horses be strong and able, yet are they so toil'd out therewith, as that when they come home at night they would pity the Heart of him that loveth an Horse to see them so bemired, blooded, spurred, lamentably spent, and tyred out; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if such Horses had been ridden to the Great-Saddle and Cannon, they would infinitely have delighted all men that should have beheld them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer, that for my own part I am not very fond of <hi>Fox hunting;</hi> but I can see no <hi>Reason</hi> why <hi>Persons of Honour</hi> should not <hi>gratifie</hi> their <hi>Fancies</hi> with this <hi>Recreation,</hi> since <hi>from the beginning</hi> Horses were made for the service of <hi>Man;</hi> and doubtless for their <hi>Recreation,</hi> as well as more necessary Uses. And I am very confident, that if Horses be <hi>train'd, dieted,</hi> and <hi>ridden</hi> according to <hi>Art,</hi> there will be left no ground for this <hi>Objection.</hi> For by <hi>good Feeding</hi> Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would be prevented; and by <hi>Airing,</hi> and <hi>due Exercise,</hi> the Horses <hi>Wind</hi> would be so improv'd, that no moderate Labour would hurt him; nay, though a Horse by <hi>immoderate Riding,</hi> were reduc'd to such <hi>Tragical Exigencies,</hi> as <hi>De Grey</hi> mentions, yet by the Assistance of <hi>Art Nature</hi> may be in <hi>Twenty four hours space</hi> so reliev'd, that all those dangerous <hi>Symptoms shall be remov'd,</hi> and all the <hi>Natural Faculties</hi> act as formerly.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the last part of his <hi>Argument,</hi> I appeal to all the greatest <hi>Masters of Academies</hi> here, or in <hi>Foreign Parts;</hi> whether in the <hi>Mannage,</hi> the <hi>Spurs</hi> are not as much us'd, (not to say more,) as in <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Newcastle</hi> in his <hi>Methode Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle</hi> in 80. p. 85. says, <hi>il n'y a point d' Exercise si vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pour les Chevaux que celuy de Manege;</hi> that is, There is no <hi>Exercise</hi> so <hi>violent</hi> for <hi>Horses</hi> as the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage;</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100171:236"/>
so that you see <hi>Hunting</hi> is not the only <hi>violent</hi> Exercise: and <hi>Salomon de la Brove</hi> goes further in his <hi>Cavalarise Frangoise,</hi> telling us, that <hi>Mannag'd Horses</hi> should sometimes be us'd to the <hi>Chase,</hi> since <hi>hunting</hi> assists his <hi>wind,</hi> and brings him to a <hi>civil Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> with other Horses: inferring from hence, that <hi>hunting</hi> procures to an Horse <hi>two</hi> Benefits, viz. <hi>Speed</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and reforms in him <hi>two</hi> Vices, <hi>Salvageness</hi> and <hi>Restiveness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are others, that though they may approve of keeping their Horses <hi>clean,</hi> yet are not reconcil'd to <hi>hunting;</hi> but being either Admirers of <hi>Coursing,</hi> or else keeping Horses only for the benefit of their <hi>health,</hi> and the taking the <hi>Air;</hi> will not be perswaded, but that they can bring their Horses to the same <hi>Perfection</hi> without <hi>hunting,</hi> as with it.</p>
                  <p>To answer the first of these, I mean <hi>Coursers;</hi> I affirm, 'tis impossible to attain the end of this <hi>Art</hi> by that Means: for being oblig'd in search of their Game to toil their Horses all day, over <hi>deep Fallows,</hi> in a foot-pace only, they are likelier to bring their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to <hi>Weariness</hi> than <hi>Perfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the same <hi>Answer</hi> may serve the <hi>Others</hi> likewise: for <hi>Riding</hi> a Horse up and down the <hi>Field</hi> after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, brings a <hi>Weariness</hi> and <hi>Dislike</hi> to an Horse in his <hi>Exercise,</hi> through his Ignorance of the Time, when his Labour shall cease; whether, or to what End he is so labour'd. Whereas on the contrary, an Horse naturally takes delight in <hi>following the Dogs,</hi> and seems pleas'd with their <hi>Musick,</hi> as is evident by his <hi>pricking up his Eaers,</hi> gazing on them, and preffing to <hi>gallop</hi> towards them, when ever he hears them in <hi>full-cry,</hi> (though at a distance.) Nay further, I have been <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Stonehorse,</hi> that so entirely lov'd the <hi>Hounds,</hi> that when at any time (through eagerness of Sport, and desire to save the <hi>Hare</hi> from being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100171:237"/>
eaten) I have rid in amongst the Dogs, he would so carefully avoid treading on them, that he has more than once hazarded my Limbs (by making a <hi>false step</hi>) to save <hi>theirs.</hi> From hence I infer, that doubtless Horses extreamly <hi>delight in hunting,</hi> and consequently, that it is a fit <hi>Exercise</hi> for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others Object, That what soever <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> there may be in <hi>Hunting,</hi> they had rather deny themselves that satisfaction than hazard the <hi>Laming their Horses,</hi> which, (as they are told few, or no <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> escape.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Hunters</hi> are sometimes <hi>Lame,</hi> I do not deny: but cannot allow, that it proceeds alwaies from this <hi>Exercise.</hi> For 'tis the <hi>Indiscretion of the Riders,</hi> in <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verstraining their Horses at Leaps;</hi> and by that meanes, sometimes <hi>clapping them on the back-sinews, catching in their shoos,</hi> and such like, and not the <hi>Sport,</hi> that is the cause of <hi>Lameness.</hi> But on the contrary, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to shew any man <hi>Twenty</hi> other Horses lame (which never knew what belong'd to <hi>Hunting</hi>) for <hi>One Hunter.</hi> There are several other <hi>Reasons</hi> besides <hi>Hunting</hi> to be given for <hi>Lameness;</hi> as for Instance. <hi>Much Travel</hi> though but moderate, if care be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) will produce <hi>Wind-galls,</hi> and <hi>Splints,</hi> which are the fore-runners of <hi>Lameness.</hi> Want of Exercise will <hi>straiten the Hoofs,</hi> and <hi>dry up the sinews;</hi> and too much negligence in <hi>Travail</hi> occasions <hi>Surbating, Foundring,</hi> and <hi>Gravailing.</hi> Horses on the Road oftentimes <hi>stumble,</hi> and now and then <hi>fall,</hi> and so become <hi>Lame.</hi> Nav, a <hi>Slip,</hi> or an <hi>Over-reach</hi> are as incident to the <hi>Pad,</hi> as to the <hi>Hunter.</hi> And to conclude, the <hi>Horse that is Dressd,</hi> is more liable to a <hi>Strain in the Back, and Fillets,</hi> than the <hi>Hunter;</hi> by meanes of his <hi>short-turns:</hi> so that you may perceive that <hi>Lameness</hi> is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical,</hi> and therefore no more to be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Hunting-Horses,</hi> than the rest of that Species.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100171:237"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some again are. Enemies to this <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Dyeting Horses in particular:</hi> affirming, that such <hi>exact Diet</hi> makes them tender, sickly, and takes them off their Stomach: and that the <hi>Charges</hi> are not only great, but likewise unnecessary.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>First part</hi> of this <hi>Obiection,</hi> I answer, that an Horse is so far from being made tender, or losing his Appetite, by such extream and several Feedings, if he have proportionate Exercise, that it rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures him to hardship. For much Labour (if not too violent) either in <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Beast,</hi> instead of weakning the <hi>Ssomack,</hi> and causing <hi>Sickness,</hi> does rather advance the <hi>Appetite</hi> and preserve his <hi>Health;</hi> and it may be observed, that it doth oftner heighten than decay the Stomack. In like manner moderate Airings pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify his Wind, and both together render him Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and fit for Service.</p>
                  <p>As to the several sorts of <hi>Food,</hi> we shall prove in the sequel, that every part of it is both nourishing, and natural to all Horses Constitutions; so that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, tis not only allowable, but necessary: And to prove this, needs no more; than to ride an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Horse drawn clean,</hi> a days <hi>Hunting,</hi> or three <hi>Heats,</hi> and a <hi>Course,</hi> against the best of those Horses, which are kept by such <hi>Persons</hi> who think that half a Peck a Day, and fetching his water at the next Spring is <hi>Horsemanship</hi> sufficient; and they will find by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Exercise, the <hi>Ordinary Horse</hi> will become long winded, and <hi>stick at Mark:</hi> when the other that is <hi>Foul-fed,</hi> and fat, will soon give out, for want of Wind; or otherwise if he be hardy will dy under the <hi>Spur;</hi> whereas if the untrained <hi>Horse</hi> had been rightly ordered he would have worsted Twenty such <hi>Horses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to the <hi>Charges of Keeping, Fifty Shillings a Year</hi> disburs'd for <hi>Bread,</hi> besides <hi>Hay, Straw, Corn</hi>

and <hi>Physick,</hi> (which all <hi>Horses of Value</hi> must be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is all that will be requisite, to keep an Horse in as good State for Ordinary Hunting, as any Horse whatsoever. Lastly by being Skilful in the <hi>Art of Keeping,</hi> this Advantage will insue; that no Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per relating either to the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> can conceal themselves from his keepers knowledge, whose Skill will inform him, how to put a stop to them, before they have made any considerable <hi>Advances</hi> to the Horses Prejudice. And he that grudges so small an Expence on so noble and useful a Creature as an Horse is, deserves never to come on the back of one.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Breeding, the Choice of a <hi>Stallion,</hi> and <hi>Mares,</hi> with some general Remarks on Marks and Colours.</head>
                  <p>SInce Creation and Generation preceeded the <hi>Art of Riding,</hi> and that the first thing which is of Course to be treated of, is the Choice of an Horse fit for this exercise of Hunting, I shall speak somthing cursorily of the Art of <hi>Breeding,</hi> before I treat of the <hi>Hunter</hi> ready for service. To them therefore that have grounds convenient for <hi>Breed,</hi> I shall direct this part of my discourse: and lay them down some few Rules that may be serviceable to them, though I shall be as brief as possible, and refer them to <hi>Markham, de Grey, Morgan, Almond,</hi> and <hi>Farring Compleated,</hi> (which is collected from the forementioned Authors
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100171:238"/>
                     <hi>Markham</hi> and <hi>de Grey</hi>) all which have treated of the Art of <hi>Breeding</hi> more at large.</p>
                  <p>First therefore I wonld advise you to buy either an <hi>Arabian Horse</hi> (if you can procure him,) a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Barb,</hi> for your <hi>Stallion,</hi> that is well <hi>shap'd,</hi> of a good <hi>Colour</hi> to beautify your <hi>Race,</hi> and well <hi>mark'd,</hi> to agree with most mens Opinions; though otherwise they are not so significative as Mr. <hi>Blunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> and his <hi>Italian</hi> Author <hi>Frederigo Grissone,</hi> would have us believe.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the <hi>Arabian;</hi> Merchants, and other Gentlemen that have travell'd those parts, report, that the right <hi>Arabians</hi> are valu'd at an incredible, as well as an intolerable Rate; being priz'd at <hi>Five hundred,</hi> others say at <hi>one, two,</hi> and <hi>three thousand Pounds</hi> an Horse; that the <hi>Arabs</hi> are as careful of keeping the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of their Horses, as <hi>Princes</hi> in keeping their <hi>Pedigrees;</hi> that they keep them with <hi>Medals;</hi> and that each Son's Portion is usually <hi>two Suits of Arms, two Cymeters,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> of these Horses. The <hi>Arabs</hi> boast, that they will ride <hi>fourscore miles</hi> a day, without <hi>drawing Bitt:</hi> which has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by several of our <hi>English</hi> Horses. But much more was atchiev'd by an High way-man's Horse; who having taken a <hi>Booty,</hi> on the <hi>same</hi> day rode him from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> being <hi>One hundred and Fifty Miles.</hi> Notwithstanding their great value, and the difficulty in bringing them from <hi>Scanderoon</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Sea; yet by the care, and at the charge of some <hi>Breeders</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> Horse is no stranger to those parts; where Persons who have the curiosity, may (as I presume) at this Day see some of the <hi>Race,</hi> if not a true <hi>Arabian Stallion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse (according to the <hi>Duke of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi>) is the <hi>Noblest</hi> Horse in the world, and the most <hi>Beautiful</hi> that can be; no Horse is so curiously shap'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100171:239"/>
all over from <hi>Head</hi> to <hi>Croup,</hi> and he is absolutely the <hi>best Stallion</hi> in the world, whether you design your <hi>Breed</hi> for the <hi>Mannage,</hi> the <hi>War,</hi> the <hi>Pad, Hunting,</hi> or for <hi>Running</hi> Horses. But as he is excellent, so he wants not for price, <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four hundred Pistols</hi> being a common Rate for a <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse. Several have been sold for <hi>Seven hundred, Eight hundred,</hi> and a <hi>Thousand Pistols</hi> a piece; and <hi>One</hi> particular Horse, called <hi>el Bravo,</hi> that was sent to the Arch-Duke <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,</hi> was held worth as much as a Mannour of a <hi>Thousand Crowns</hi> a year. The best <hi>Spanish</hi> Horses are bred in <hi>Andalouzia,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Cordova,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> has many <hi>Studds</hi> of <hi>Mares,</hi> and so have several of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nobility and Gentry. Now besides the great <hi>price</hi> at first, the <hi>Charges</hi> of the <hi>Journey</hi> from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>England</hi> will be very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for first, he must travel from <hi>Andalouzia</hi> to <hi>Bilbo,</hi> or St <hi>Sebastien,</hi> the neerest Ports to <hi>England,</hi> and is at least <hi>Four hundred Miles:</hi> and in that hot Country you cannot with safety <hi>travel</hi> your Horse above <hi>twenty</hi> Miles a day, then there is the Expence of your <hi>Groom</hi> and <hi>Farrier,</hi> besides the casualty of <hi>Lameness, Sickness,</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> so that though he do prove an <hi>Extraordinary good</hi> Horse, by that time he arrives at your own home he will likewise be an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary dear</hi> one.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turk</hi> is little inferior to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse in Beauty, but somewhat odd-shap'd, his <hi>head</hi> being somewhat like that of a <hi>Camel:</hi> He hath excellent <hi>Eyes,</hi> a thin Neck <hi>excellently risen,</hi> and somewhat large of body: his <hi>Croup</hi> is like that of a <hi>Mule;</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> not so <hi>underlimb'd</hi> as those of the <hi>Barb,</hi> but very <hi>sinewy,</hi> good <hi>Pasterns,</hi> and good <hi>Hoofs:</hi> They never <hi>amble,</hi> but <hi>trot</hi> very well: and are accounted at this present better <hi>Stallions</hi> for <hi>Gallopers</hi> than <hi>Barbs,</hi> as when I come to speak of them) I shall shew.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100171:239"/>
                  <p>Some <hi>Merchants</hi> affirm, that there cannot be a more noble and divertive sight to a <hi>Lover</hi> of Horses, than to walk into the Pastures near <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Soyling-time,</hi> where he may see many <hi>hundred</hi> gallant Horses <hi>tethred,</hi> and every Horse has his <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant</hi> or <hi>Keeper,</hi> with his little <hi>Tent</hi> (plac'd near him) to lie in, that he may look to him, and take care to <hi>shift</hi> him to fresh <hi>Grass,</hi> as occasion requires.</p>
                  <p>The Price of a Turk is commonly <hi>One hundred</hi> or <hi>One hundred</hi> and <hi>Fifty Pounds</hi> a Horse, and when bought tis difficult to get a <hi>Pass;</hi> the <hi>Grand Segnior</hi> being so very strict, that He seldom (but upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary oecasions) permits any of his Horses to be <hi>exported</hi> his Dominions. But if (when obtain'd) you travel by <hi>Land,</hi> without a <hi>Turk</hi> or two for your <hi>Convoy,</hi> you will be sure to have them seiz'd on by the way. Then, as in the former, so here, you will find the same difficulties of a <hi>long Journey,</hi> (for you must come through <hi>Germany,</hi> which is a long way,) aud the same charges attending it, I mean your <hi>Groom</hi> and <hi>Farrier,</hi> who must be careful that they entrust no Persons whatsoever with the care of him, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, especially in <hi>shooing</hi> of him: For tis the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice beyond Sea, (as well as here) where they discover a <hi>fine</hi> Horse, to hire a <hi>Farrier</hi> to <hi>prick</hi> him, that they may buy him for a <hi>Stallion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But some People chuse to buy Horses at <hi>Smyrna</hi> in <hi>Anatolia,</hi> and from <hi>thence,</hi> as likewise srom <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> transport them to <hi>England</hi> by Sea; which, if the Wind serve <hi>right,</hi> arrive in <hi>England</hi> in a <hi>month,</hi> though generally the <hi>Merchants</hi> make their Voyages little less than a <hi>Quarter of a year.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Barb</hi> is little inferior to any of the former in <hi>beauty,</hi> only he is accounted by our <hi>Modern Breeders</hi> too <hi>slender</hi> and <hi>Lady-like</hi> to <hi>breed</hi> on: and therefore in the North, at this instant, they prefer the <hi>Spanish</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100171:240"/>
Horse and <hi>Turk</hi> before him. He is so lazy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent in his <hi>walk,</hi> that he will <hi>stumble</hi> on <hi>Carpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground.</hi> His <hi>Trot</hi> is like that of a <hi>Cow,</hi> his <hi>Gallop</hi> low, and with much ease to himself. But he is for the most part <hi>sinewy,</hi> and <hi>nervous,</hi> excellently <hi>winded,</hi> and good for a <hi>Course,</hi> is he be not <hi>over-weighted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mountain-Barbs</hi> are accounted tbe best, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the strongest and largest. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Allarbes,</hi> who value them as much them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as they are priz'd by any other Nations, and therefore they will not part with them to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons except to the <hi>Prince of the Band</hi> to which they belong; who can at any time, at his pleasure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them for his own use. But for the other more ordinary sort, they are to be met with pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in the hands of several of our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> or if you send into <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> they may be there bought for <hi>forty</hi> or <hi>fifty Pistols</hi> a Horse. Or if you will send into <hi>Barbary,</hi> you may have one for <hi>Thirty Pounds,</hi> or thereabouts. But here too the <hi>charges</hi> and <hi>journey</hi> will be great; for though from <hi>Tunis</hi> to <hi>Marselles</hi> in <hi>France</hi> be no great Voyage, yet from <hi>Marselles</hi> to <hi>Callais</hi> by Land measures the length of all <hi>Franee,</hi> and from thence they are shipt for <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing of course to be treated of, is the choice of your <hi>Mares,</hi> and the fittest <hi>Mare</hi> to breed out of, according to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Newcastle's</hi> opinion, is one that has been bred of an <hi>English Mare,</hi> and a <hi>Stallion</hi> of either of these Races; but if such a Mare be not to be got, then make choice of a <hi>right bred English Mare by Sire</hi> and <hi>Dam,</hi> that is <hi>well fore-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, well underlaid,</hi> and strong put together in general; and in particular, see that she have a <hi>lean Head, wide Nostrils, open Chaul, a big Weasand,</hi> and the <hi>Windpipe straight</hi> and <hi>loose,</hi> and chuse her about <hi>five</hi> or <hi>six</hi> year
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100171:240"/>
old, and be sure that the Stallion be not too old.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Food</hi> of the <hi>Stallion,</hi> I would have you keep him as <hi>high</hi> as possible for <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> months before the time of <hi>Covering,</hi> with <hi>old clean Oats,</hi> and <hi>split Beans,</hi> well <hi>hull'd;</hi> to which you may add, if you please, <hi>Bread,</hi> (such as in this Book shall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after directed) and now and then, for variety, you may give him an <hi>handful</hi> of clean <hi>Wheat,</hi> or <hi>Oats</hi> washt in strong Ale; but as for <hi>Bay-salt,</hi> and <hi>Anniseeds,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> in his <hi>Perfection of Horsemanship,</hi> advises should be scatter'd amongst his Provender, I hold them superfluous whilst the Horse is in health, but be sure let him have plenty of good <hi>old sweet Hay,</hi> well cleansed from Dust, and good Wheat-straw to lie on; and let him be watred twice every day at some fair running Spring, or else a clear standing Pond-water (where the other is not to be had) near some <hi>Meadow</hi> or level piece of Ground, where you may gallop him after he hath drunk. When you have brought him to the water, do not suffer him to drink his Fill at the first, but after he has taken his first draught, gallop and scope him up and down a little to warm it, and then bring him to the water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and let him drink what he please, and after that gallop him as you did before, never leaving the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter till you find he will drink no more. By this means you will prevent raw Crudities, which the Coldness of the Water would produce to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stomach, if you had permitted him to drink his fill at first; whereas you allowing him his fill (though by degrees) at last, you keep his Body from drying too fast. And this I take to be much better for your Horses than (according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited <hi>Morgan</hi>) to incourage his <hi>Water</hi> with <hi>Whitewine,</hi> to qualifie the cold quality thereof: for <hi>Nature</hi> it self is the best <hi>Directress</hi> for the expulsion of her <hi>Enemies.</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100171:241"/>
especially in Brutes, where usually she can command the <hi>Appetite:</hi> and therefore I esteem his own <hi>natural heat,</hi> for <hi>warming his water,</hi> to be better than that which proceeds from any other. Now as to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan's</hi> Direction of <hi>Sweating</hi> him every day early in the <hi>Morning,</hi> which he says <q>will not only perfect dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion; and exhaust the moisture from his Seed, but also strengthen and cleanse his Blood and Body from all raw and imperfect humors</q>; I am of opinion twill both dry up the <hi>radical Moisture</hi> too fast, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise instead of heightning his Pride and Lust, (which he alledges,) weaken him too much. Other <hi>Rules</hi> might be given as to the ordering of them after <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the <hi>Hours</hi> of <hi>Feeding,</hi> with the <hi>quantity</hi> &amp;c. but these will be fitter to be handled in another place, and therefore no more of them here.</p>
                  <p>Now when your <hi>Stallion</hi> is in Lust, and the <hi>Time</hi> for <hi>Covering</hi> is come, which is best to be in <hi>May,</hi> that the Foles may fall in <hi>April</hi> following, otherwise they will have little or no <hi>Grass,</hi> if they should be <hi>put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> (according to <hi>Markham's</hi> opinion) in the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> of <hi>March</hi> tho he holds that <hi>one Fole falling in March</hi> is worth <hi>two falling in May,</hi> 
                     <q>because (saith he) he possesseth, as it were, two Winters in a year, and is thereby so hardened, that nothing can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most after impair him.</q> The time I say being come to put your <hi>Stallion</hi> and <hi>Mares</hi> together, pull off his <hi>hinder Shoes,</hi> and lead him to the place where the <hi>Stud</hi> of <hi>Mares</hi> are, which you intend for <hi>covering,</hi> which place ought to be <hi>close</hi> well <hi>fenc'd,</hi> and in it a little <hi>Hutt</hi> for a <hi>Man</hi> to lie in, and a larger <hi>Shed</hi> with a <hi>Manger</hi> to feed your <hi>Stallion</hi> with <hi>Breud</hi> and <hi>Corn,</hi> during his Abode with the <hi>Mares,</hi> and to <hi>shelter</hi> him in the <hi>heat of the Day</hi> and in <hi>Rainy weather,</hi> and this Close ought to be of sufficient <hi>langeness</hi> to keep your Mares well for two <hi>months.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100171:241"/>
                  <p>Before you pull of his <hi>Bridle,</hi> let him <hi>cover</hi> a Mare or two <hi>in hand,</hi> then turn him loose amongst them, and put all your Mares to him, as well those which are with <hi>Foale,</hi> as those which are not, for there is no danger in it; and by that <hi>means</hi> they will all be serv'd in their <hi>height of Lust,</hi> and according to the <hi>intention of Nature.</hi> When your <hi>Stallion</hi> has <hi>cover'd</hi> them once, he tries them all over again, and those which will admit him he <hi>serves;</hi> and when his business is finish'd, he <hi>beats the Pale,</hi> and attempts to be at <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;</hi> which when your Man finds, (who is Night and Day to observe them, and to take care that no other Mares are <hi>put</hi> to your Horse, and to give you an Account, <hi>which take the horse,</hi> and <hi>which not,</hi> &amp;c.) let him be <hi>taken up,</hi> and let him be well <hi>kept</hi> as before; only you may at the first give him a good <hi>Mash</hi> or two, to help to <hi>restore Nature,</hi> for you will find him nothing but <hi>Skin and Bones,</hi> and his <hi>Mane</hi> and <hi>Tail</hi> will <hi>rot off.</hi> Be sure give him never above <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Twelve Mares</hi> in a <hi>Season,</hi> at most; otherwise you will scarce recover him against the next Years <hi>Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When your <hi>Stallion</hi> is past this use, then buy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but be sure never make use of a <hi>Horse</hi> of your own Breed, for by so doing the <hi>Best Kind</hi> would in time <hi>degenerate:</hi> but you cannot do better (the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Newcastle</hi> says) than to let your <hi>own Mares</hi> be cover'd by their <hi>Sire,</hi> for (according to his own words and opinion) <hi>there is no Incest in Horses:</hi> and by this means they are nearer <hi>one degree</hi> to the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Fountain,</hi> from which they are deriv'd, since a <hi>fine</hi> Horse <hi>got</hi> them, and the <hi>same fine</hi> Horse <hi>covers</hi> them again.</p>
                  <p>Now though the <hi>Duke of Newcastle</hi> affirms this to be the true way for <hi>covering</hi> Mares, alledging that <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>wiser</hi> than <hi>Art</hi> in the <hi>Act of Generation,</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100171:242"/>
that by this way, of a <hi>dozen</hi> Mares he dare affirm that <hi>two</hi> shall not <hi>fail:</hi> yet it may not correspond with the <hi>Interest</hi> of some <hi>private Gentlemen</hi> who turn <hi>Breeders</hi> for <hi>Profit</hi> as well as <hi>Pleasure;</hi> for a good <hi>Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> bearing such an extraordinary rate, and they having but <hi>One,</hi> have reason to be cautions, to avoid as much as can be all <hi>hazardous</hi> Experiments; which (with submission to the <hi>Duke's</hi> Judgment) this in some cases may prove. For first, there have been Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of great spirit, that have <hi>kill'd</hi> themselves through <hi>excess</hi> of <hi>Lust,</hi> being left to range at their <hi>liberty;</hi> and those that have been confin'd to an <hi>Enclosure,</hi> &amp; a select number of Mares, have yet in one <hi>Weeks</hi> space so weaken'd <hi>Nature,</hi> that not above <hi>half</hi> the Mares have <hi>held.</hi> Secondly, some Mares are of so <hi>hot</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Nature,</hi> and their <hi>Lust</hi> so <hi>violent,</hi> that if they are permitted to run long with the Horse, after they have conceived, will (if they be <hi>high in flesh</hi> and lusty) desire the Horse again, which generally hazards the Loss of the <hi>Embrio</hi> they go with.</p>
                  <p>To prevent therefore these <hi>Inconveniences,</hi> I shall lay you down an other <hi>Method</hi> (as briefly as may be,) which is called <hi>covering in hand,</hi> as the former is generally term'd <hi>out of hand,</hi> and the way is this: <hi>viz.</hi> when you have brought both your Horse and Mare to as proper condition for Breed by <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>good feeding,</hi> then set some ordinary <hi>Ston'd-Nag</hi> by her for a day or two to <hi>wooe</hi> her, and by that means she will be so prone to <hi>Lust,</hi> that she will readily receive your <hi>Stallion;</hi> which you should <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to her either <hi>early</hi> in a <hi>Morning,</hi> or <hi>late</hi> in an <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> for a day or two together, and let him <hi>cover her in hand</hi> once, or twice if you please, at each time, observing always to give the Horse the <hi>advantage of Ground,</hi> and that you have some one ready with a <hi>Pucket</hi> of <hi>cold water</hi> to throw on the Mare's <hi>Shape,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100171:242"/>
immediately on the <hi>dismounting</hi> of the Horse, which will make her <hi>retain</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> received the better, especially if you get on her <hi>back,</hi> and <hi>trot</hi> her about a quarter of an Hours space, but in any case have a care of <hi>heating,</hi> or <hi>straining</hi> her: and it will not be amiss, if after every such act you let them <hi>fast two Hours,</hi> and then give each of them a warm <hi>Mash;</hi> and tis odds but this way your Mares may be as well <hi>serv'd</hi> as the other, and yet your <hi>Stallion</hi> will last you much longer.</p>
                  <p>I shall say no more as to the <hi>keeping</hi> the Mares du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their being with <hi>Foale,</hi> nor of their <hi>foaling;</hi> only this, that if you take care to <hi>house</hi> them all the <hi>Winter,</hi> and to keep them well, their <hi>Colts</hi> will prove the better. When they are <hi>foaled,</hi> let them <hi>run</hi> with their <hi>Dams</hi> till <hi>Martin-mass,</hi> then <hi>wean</hi> them, and keep them in a convenient <hi>House,</hi> with a low <hi>Rack</hi> and <hi>Manger</hi> on purpose; <hi>litter</hi> them well, and <hi>feed</hi> them with good <hi>Hay,</hi> and <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Wheat-bran</hi> mix'd, which will make them <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>belly</hi> well. The first year you may put them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but afterwards they must be separated, the <hi>Stone-Colts</hi> from the <hi>Fillies;</hi> and if you have choice of Houses, you may put <hi>Yearings</hi> together, <hi>Two years old</hi> together, and so <hi>Three years old</hi> together, for their better satisfaction and agreement; as <hi>little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> best agree together.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>warm</hi> fair Day you may grant them liberty to <hi>run</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> in some <hi>enclosed</hi> Court or Back-side, but be sure to take care to <hi>put them up</hi> again <hi>carefully,</hi> that they be not <hi>hurt.</hi> When <hi>Summer</hi> is come, and there is plenty of <hi>Grass,</hi> put them out in some <hi>dry Ground,</hi> that hath convenient <hi>watring,</hi> and so let them <hi>run</hi> till <hi>Martinmass</hi> again: then <hi>house</hi> them as before, and order them in all points as <hi>older</hi> Horses, till they are full <hi>Five years old,</hi> then take them up <hi>for good and all,</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100171:243"/>
and let your Groom <hi>back</hi> them if he have <hi>skill,</hi> or else some <hi>skilful Rider.</hi> You may if you please just <hi>break</hi> your <hi>Fillies</hi> at <hi>Two years and half old,</hi> and let them be <hi>cover'd</hi> at <hi>Three;</hi> and by that means they will be so tame and gentle, as not to injure themselves or their <hi>Foals.</hi> But in case of <hi>sickness,</hi> or any accidental cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as <hi>Lameness,</hi> &amp;c. you must then commit them to the <hi>Farrier's</hi> Care.</p>
                  <p>The reason why I propose the <hi>Housing</hi> of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Winter, with <hi>dry</hi> Feeding and Lodging, is, that they may be the <hi>liker</hi> their <hi>Sire</hi> in <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Shape.</hi> For the <hi>primary</hi> Cause of the <hi>sineness</hi> of Shape and Beauty in Horses is <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>dry</hi> Feeding. And this is prov'd from the several <hi>Races</hi> we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse, <hi>Barb,</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Horse, all which Countreys are under an <hi>Hot</hi> Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and by consequence afford <hi>little Grass:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our more <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> Countries we are to assist <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Art,</hi> and to supply the want of <hi>Heat</hi> by <hi>warm</hi> Housing, and <hi>dry</hi> Feeding. This is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made evident by <hi>Example.</hi> For take <hi>two Colts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by the <hi>same Sire,</hi> on Mares of <hi>equal</hi> Beauty, and <hi>house</hi> the one every Winter, and feed him as directed, and expose the <hi>Other,</hi> till they are <hi>Four years old,</hi> and fit to be back'd; and you shall find the <hi>former</hi> like his <hi>Sire</hi> in all respects, and the <hi>other</hi> fitter for the <hi>Cart</hi> than <hi>Hunting,</hi> as being a <hi>dull, heavy, flabby, scarce animated</hi> Clod; and all this proceeds from the <hi>Humidity</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> From hence you may infer, that 'tis not only <hi>Generation,</hi> but, as I may term it, <hi>Education,</hi> that makes a <hi>compleat</hi> Horse; and such <hi>yours</hi> will be, if you order them according to the former <hi>Directions;</hi> for you may with ease <hi>break</hi> the <hi>Colt</hi> that is by such good management made gentle, and <hi>half-back'd</hi> to your hand.</p>
                  <p>But I have dwelt longer on this <hi>Subject</hi> than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, my business being chiefly to inform the <hi>Groom</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100171:243"/>
(not the <hi>Master</hi>) what belong'd to his Office; and therefore I will wander no further from my purpose, but leave it to the <hi>Rider</hi> to follow his own <hi>Method</hi> in rendring <hi>Colts</hi> fit for his <hi>Masters</hi> Service: whilst I give some few Directions to those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who will not bestow either trouble or charges on <hi>Breeding,</hi> or have the <hi>Will</hi> but not the <hi>Convenience</hi> to do it, how to elect an <hi>Horse</hi> fit for this <hi>Exercise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The way for a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to <hi>furnish</hi> himfelf with an <hi>Horse,</hi> that may be worth <hi>training</hi> for <hi>Hunting,</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enquire out some <hi>noted Breeder</hi> (of which there are many in the <hi>North,</hi>) or else to go to some famous <hi>Fair,</hi> as <hi>Malton</hi> and <hi>Rippon</hi> Fairs in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> the former held on the 23. day of <hi>September</hi> yearly, and the latter on <hi>May day:</hi> Or to <hi>Richmonds</hi> in the same <hi>Shire,</hi> (which, as I am inform'd, does now of late years <hi>exceed</hi> both the fore-mention'd, being <hi>scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> in the middle of the most <hi>celebrated</hi> part of the <hi>breeding Country;</hi>) its Fairs are held in <hi>Easter week,</hi> and at <hi>Rood tyde. Northampton</hi> has several <hi>Fairs</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> likewise, as on the 23. day of <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>September, 17th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> with several others. There are several other <hi>Fairs,</hi> as <hi>Lenton-Fair</hi> in <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamshire, Pankridg-Fair</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> &amp;c. which for brevities sake I omit. At any of these places he may make choice of a <hi>Horse,</hi> which as near as can be ought to have these following <hi>Shapes:</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Head</hi> ought to be lean, large, and long; his <hi>Chaul</hi> thin, and open; his <hi>Ears</hi> small, and pricked, or if they be somewhat long, provided they stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right like those of a <hi>Fox,</hi> it is usually a sign of Mettle and Toughness His <hi>Forehead</hi> long and broad, not flat, and as we term it <hi>Mare-fac'd,</hi> but rising in the midst like that of a <hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Feather</hi> being plac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Top of his <hi>Eye,</hi> the contrary being thought by some to betoken <hi>blindness.</hi> His <hi>Eyes</hi> full, large,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100171:244"/>
and bright; his <hi>Nostrils</hi> wide, and red within, for an <hi>open Nostril</hi> betokens a <hi>good Wind;</hi> his <hi>Mouth</hi> large, deep in the <hi>Wykes,</hi> and hairy; His <hi>Thropple, Weasand,</hi> or <hi>Windpipe,</hi> big, loose, and streight when he is rein'd in by the <hi>Bridle;</hi> for if, when he bridles, it bends in like a <hi>Bow,</hi> (which is called <hi>Cock-throppled</hi>) it very much hinders the free passage of his Wind His <hi>Head</hi> must be so set on to his <hi>Neck,</hi> that there must be a space felt between his <hi>Neck</hi> and his <hi>Chaul;</hi> for to be <hi>Bull-neck'd</hi> is uncomely to sight, and prejudicial to the Horses <hi>wind,</hi> as aforesaid. His <hi>Crest</hi> should be firm, thin, and well risen; his <hi>Neck</hi> long, and straight, yet not loose, and pliant, which the <hi>Northern-men</hi> term <hi>Withy-cragg'd;</hi> his <hi>Breast</hi> strong, and broad; his <hi>Chest</hi> deep, his <hi>Chine</hi> short, his <hi>Body</hi> large, and close shut up to the <hi>

His <hi>Legs</hi> clean, flat, and streight, His <hi>Joynts</hi> short, well knit, and upright, especially betwixt the <hi>Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns</hi> and the <hi>Hoof,</hi> having but little Hair on his <hi>Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks.</hi> His <hi>Hoofs</hi> black, strong, and hollow, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long and narrow, than big and flat. And lastly, his <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Tail</hi> should be long, and thin rather than thick, which is counted by some a <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>Dulness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to his <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Marks,</hi> I rather incline to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them grateful to the <hi>Eye,</hi> than any infallible <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes</hi> of Goodness; for as the <hi>Goodness</hi> or <hi>Badness</hi> of a Man does not consist in his <hi>Complexion,</hi> but in his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Vertues,</hi> so neither do <hi>Colour</hi> or <hi>Marks</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrate the <hi>Goodness</hi> or <hi>Badness</hi> of an Horse, because his <hi>Qualifications</hi> proceed from his inward <hi>Disposition.</hi>But yet I wholly dissent from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100171:244"/>
of Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> p. 31; who holds,  <q>That <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Marks</hi> are no more assurance of a <hi>good Horse;</hi> than the having a <hi>Feather</hi> in a Mans <hi>Hat</hi> does prove him a <hi>good Man</hi> or a <hi>bad;</hi>
                     </q>  inferring that <hi>inherent Colours</hi> are of no greater <hi>Eminency</hi> or <hi>Value,</hi> than those <hi>external</hi> ones are which may be taken or laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side at a man's own will and pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Now I say, that altho <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Colour</hi> do not absolutely give testimony unto us of a <hi>Horses goodness,</hi> yet <hi>they</hi> as well as his <hi>shape</hi> do intimate to us in some part his <hi>Disposition</hi> and <hi>Qualities.</hi> For <hi>Nature,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defective, frames every part of the same matter whereof the whole is formed, and therefore the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> being formed of the copulative Seed of its <hi>Sire</hi> and <hi>Dam,</hi> does from them derive as well the <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental</hi> as the more <hi>essential</hi> Qualities of its tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and composition. And for this Reason <hi>Hair</hi> it self may osten times receive the variation of its <hi>Colour</hi> from the different temperature of the Subject out of which it is produced. And to confirm this, I dare pass my word, that wherever you shall meet with an <hi>Horse</hi> that hath no <hi>White</hi> about him, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in his <hi>Fore-head,</hi> though he be otherwise of the best reputed Colours, as <hi>Bay, Black, Sorrel &amp;c.</hi> That Horse I dare affirm to be of a <hi>dogged</hi> and <hi>sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len disposition;</hi> especially if he have a small <hi>pink Eye,</hi> and a <hi>narrow Face,</hi> with a <hi>Nose</hi> bending like a <hi>Hawks Bill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet I am not positive, that Horses even of the most <hi>celebrated</hi> Colours, and Marks answerable, do always prove the <hi>best;</hi> because I have seen those Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses worsted by Others, whose <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Colour</hi> have been esteemed the <hi>worst;</hi> as <hi>bright Sorrel,</hi> and <hi>Mouse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black</hi> with <hi>bald Faces,</hi> and all the Leggs <hi>white</hi> above the knee. But I rather attribute the Cause thereof to the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Rider,</hi> that had the <hi>training</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100171:245"/>
of those best marked Horses, than to any defect in <hi>Nature;</hi> for <hi>Nature</hi> is no Counterfeit, as <hi>Art</hi> often is, to make a thing shew to the Eye, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what it is in reality. And therefore as I would not have men put too great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Colours;</hi> so I would not have them esteemed of so lightly, as the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Mr. <hi>Morgans</hi> would make them; for it is a constant and inseparable quality for Horses to produce <hi>Hair,</hi> which is given them by Nature as a Tegument and Defence against the Cold: and if it be <hi>shaved off, gall'd,</hi> or any waies else removed or taken away, yet it will grow again; but a <hi>Feather</hi> may be put to, or taken from a Mans Hat at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Therefore since <hi>Colour</hi> seemeth to set forth the Beauty of an Horse, you may for Ornament sake and to please your Eye, make choice of an Horse that is either a <hi>Brown-Bay, Dapple-Bay, Black, Sad-Chessnut</hi> with <hi>Flaxen</hi> Main and Tail, so that they have either a <hi>White Star, Blaze,</hi> or <hi>Snip,</hi> with a <hi>White Foot; Dapple-Grey,</hi> or <hi>White Lyard</hi> with <hi>Black Muzzle, Eye,</hi> and <hi>Ear.</hi> Any of these are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by most men to give a <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>shape;</hi> tho in themselves they are no <hi>perfect</hi> signs of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>But for his <hi>internal</hi> Endowments, they are more material, and therefore take care that he by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be of a <hi>Gentle</hi> Disposition, to his Keeper <hi>tractable</hi> and <hi>docile</hi> free from those <hi>ill</hi> Qualities of Biting, Striking, Restiffness, Lying down in the Water, Starting, Running away with his Rider, Plunging, Leaping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not but that <hi>most,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> these <hi>ill</hi> habits may be rectified by Art; For Experience has shewn us, that <hi>Horses</hi> which have not been of such a perfect <hi>Natural</hi> Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100171:245"/>
as might be desired, have yet been tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by <hi>Art,</hi> and have not only been reclaimed from their vicious Habits, but have been likewise brought to great performance in <hi>Heats,</hi> as well as <hi>Hunting,</hi> as I could Instance in several if it were necessary.</p>
                  <p>And therefore since <hi>Art</hi> was invented to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Nature;</hi> if (notwithstanding your care) you have met with a <hi>Horse</hi> subject to any of these ill Qualities aforesaid, you must search into the causes of it, which <hi>Art</hi> will help you to discover and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move: and then <hi>the Cause being taken away, the Effect will cease.</hi> So that probably, contrary to most peoples Opinions a <hi>Vicious Horse,</hi> by good management and Government may be brought to <hi>excell</hi> an <hi>Horse</hi> that has a better Reputation and Fame in the judgment of the generality of Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the <hi>Age</hi> a <hi>Hunter</hi> should be of before he be put to Hunting; of the Stable, and Groom, and of the Horse's first taking up from Grass, in order to his further Dieting.</head>
                  <p>HAving gotten a <hi>Horse</hi> answerable either to the former Descriptions, or your own Satisfaction at least, I am to suppose that by a skilful <hi>Rider</hi> he is already grounded in the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> by being taught such Obedience, as that he will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily answer to the Horseman's <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Corrections</hi> both of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> the <hi>Hand,</hi> the <hi>Voice,</hi> the <hi>calf</hi> of the <hi>Leg,</hi> and the <hi>Spur;</hi> that he can tell how to take his way forward, and hath gained a true temper of Mouth, and a right placing of his Head, and that he hath learn'd to <hi>stop</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> readily; for without these things are perfectly taught, and as it were laid for a Foundation, he can never proceed effectually.</p>
                  <p>I had thoughts of enlarging upon this particular <hi>Subject,</hi> but I find my <hi>Discourse</hi> is like to swell beyond its bounds, so that I am forced to omit it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall refer you to the Directions and Prudence of your <hi>Rider,</hi> and only tell you that tis convenient, your <hi>Horse</hi> should be <hi>Five years</hi> old, and well <hi>way'd</hi> before you begin to <hi>Hunt</hi> him. For though it be a general Custom amongst noted Horsemen to train
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100171:246"/>
their Horses up to Hunting at <hi>Four years</hi> old, and some sooner, yet at that Age his Joynts not being full knit, nor he come to his best strength and courage, he is disabled from performing any matter of speed and toughness: and indeed being put to sore Labour and Toil so young, he runs a very great hazard of <hi>strains,</hi> and the putting out of <hi>Splents, Spavins, Curbs</hi> and <hi>Windgalls,</hi> besides the daunting of his Spirit, and abating his natural Courage, insomuch that he will become melancholly, stiff, and rheumatick, and have all the distempers of <hi>old Age,</hi> when it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he should be in his <hi>Prime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Horse</hi> then being <hi>full Five,</hi> you may if you please put him to grass from the middle of <hi>May</hi> till <hi>Bartholmew-tide,</hi> or at least from the middle of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> till that time; for then the <hi>Season</hi> being so <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hot,</hi> it will not be convenient to work him: where whilst he is sporting himself at liberty in his <hi>Pasture,</hi> we will if you please take care to provide a good <hi>Stable</hi> for his Reception at his <hi>taking up,</hi> and a good <hi>Groom</hi> to look after him; both which are more essentially necessary to the <hi>Hunter</hi> than to other Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which require not that exact care in <hi>keeping.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First then as to the <hi>Stable,</hi> I could wish every Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would be careful to scituate it in a good Air, and upon hard dry and firm ground, that in the Winter the Horse may go and come clean <hi>in and out:</hi> and if possible let it be seated on an Ascent, that the Urine, Foul Water, or any Wet, may be convey'd away by <hi>Trenches,</hi> or <hi>Sinks</hi> cut out for that purpose. Be sure to suffer no Hen-houses, Hog-styes, or Houses of Easment, or any other filthy Smells to be near it; for Hen-dung, or Feathers swallow'd, oftentimes prove <hi>mortal,</hi> and the ill Air of a Jakes as often is the cause of <hi>Blindness:</hi> likewise the very smell of Swine will frequently breed the <hi>Farcy,</hi> and no Animal what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100171:247"/>
more delights in <hi>cleanliness,</hi> or is more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>unwholesome savours</hi> than the Horse.</p>
                  <p>Let vour Stable be built of <hi>Brick,</hi> rather than <hi>Stone,</hi> since the latter is subject to <hi>sweating</hi> in wet weather: which Dampness and Moisture is the Original of <hi>Rheums,</hi> and <hi>Catarrhs.</hi> Let your <hi>Wall</hi> be of a good convenient thickness, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Eighteen or Twenty Inches thick, both for safety and warmth in <hi>Winter,</hi> and to keep the Sun from annoying him in <hi>Summer,</hi> which would hinder Concoction. You may (if you please) make <hi>Windows</hi> both on the East and North sides, that you may have the benefit of the Air during Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, from the <hi>North,</hi> and of the Morning Sun du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Winter from the <hi>East.</hi> And I would advise you to <hi>Glaze</hi> your Windows, and make them with <hi>Sashes,</hi> to let in Air at pleasure, and to keep out Poultry, for the reasons afore recited; and likewise to make close <hi>Wooden shutters,</hi> that during the middle time of the Day the Stable may be <hi>dark,</hi> which will cause him to take his <hi>Rest</hi> as well in the Day as the Night. Let your <hi>Floor,</hi> (I mean that part on which he is alwaies to stand, or lye down on, be made of <hi>Oaken Planks,</hi> and not <hi>pitch'd,</hi> for tis easier and warmer for the Horse to ly on <hi>Boards</hi> than <hi>Stones.</hi> be sure to lay them <hi>level;</hi> for if they are laid higher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore than behind (as they generally are in <hi>Inns</hi> and <hi>Horse-coursers Stables,</hi> that their Horses may appear to more advantage in Stature,) his <hi>hinder-leggs</hi> will <hi>swell,</hi> and he can never lye at ease, because his Hinder parts will be still <hi>slipping down.</hi> Lay your Planks <hi>cross-way,</hi> &amp; not at <hi>length;</hi> and underneath them sink a good <hi>Trench,</hi> which receiving the <hi>Urine</hi> thro holes bor'd on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the Planks, may convey it into some <hi>common receptacle.</hi> Let the <hi>ground</hi> behind him be raised <hi>even</hi> with the Planks, that he may continually
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100171:247"/>
stand on a <hi>Levell.</hi> Let the <hi>Floor</hi> behind him be pitcht with <hi>small Pebble:</hi> and be sure let that part of your Stable where the <hi>Rack</hi> stands be well <hi>Wainscoted.</hi> I would have two <hi>Rings</hi> placed at each side of his <hi>Stall,</hi> for his <hi>Halter</hi> to run through; which must have a light wooden <hi>Logger</hi> at the bottom of it, to poise it <hi>perpendicularly;</hi> but not so heavy as to <hi>tire</hi> the Horse, or to hinder him from eating. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a <hi>fix'd Manger,</hi> I would have you have a <hi>Locker,</hi> or <hi>Drawer,</hi> made in the Wainscote par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, for him to eat his Corn out of, which you may take in and out to cleanse at pleasure. And whereas some may object the <hi>narrowness</hi> of the Room, you may remedy that at your pleasure, by allowing it to be the <hi>larger:</hi> tho considering the small <hi>Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Provender, you are to put in at a time, (as you see hereafter) you need not make it <hi>very large.</hi> I would not advise you to make any <hi>Rack,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof (according to the <hi>Italian</hi> fashion) to give your Horse his Hay <hi>on the ground,</hi> upon the <hi>Litter;</hi> or else you may (if you please) nail some <hi>Boards</hi> in the form of a <hi>Trough,</hi> in which you may put his Hay, and the Boards will prevent him from trampling and spoiling it.</p>
                  <p>Some possibly may object, that this way of Feeding him, may <hi>spoil</hi> his <hi>Crest,</hi> and that the <hi>blowing</hi> upon his Hay will soon make it nauseous to his Palate. For the <hi>spoiling</hi> his <hi>Crest,</hi> it rather <hi>strengthens</hi> it, and makes it <hi>firm,</hi> whereas, on the contrary, to lift up his Head <hi>high</hi> to the Rack will make him <hi>withy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cragged:</hi> but the way forementioned, he will feed as he lyes, which will be for his <hi>ease</hi> and satisfaction. As to the <hi>quantity</hi> of his Hay, you are to give it him in such <hi>small Proportions,</hi> (tho the oftener) that it may be eaten before his <hi>Freath</hi> can in the least have tainted it. But the chief Reason why I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100171:248"/>
advise you to this way is this, because the receiving his Hay <hi>down</hi> upon the Ground, will help to <hi>cleanse</hi> his Head from any <hi>Rheum</hi> or <hi>Dose,</hi> which he may have gotten by negligence and over-exercise and induce him by <hi>sneezing</hi> to throw out all manner of <hi>watry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors</hi> that may annoy his Head. If your <hi>Stable</hi> will allow, you may build several Partitions of Boards, and at the Head towards the Manger let them be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to that height that one Horse may not <hi>molest</hi> or <hi>smell</hi> to another; and so divide the Whole into as many equal <hi>Stands</hi> or <hi>Staulls</hi> as it will admit of; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to each, Room enough to <hi>turn about</hi> in, and <hi>lie down</hi> at pleasure. You may make one of your Staulls <hi>close,</hi> which may serve for your Groom to lie in, in case of a <hi>Match, Sickness,</hi> &amp;c. and where he may <hi>burn Candle</hi> without the Horse's discerning of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Horses I would have a <hi>Range</hi> of <hi>Presses</hi> made with <hi>Peggs</hi> in them to hang up <hi>Saddles, Bridles, Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-cloaths,</hi> &amp;c. as likewise <hi>Shelves</hi> to place your <hi>Curry-combs, Brushes, Dusting-cloaths, Oyntments, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> or any other Necessaries upon.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may not <hi>cumber</hi> your Stable with <hi>Oat-Binns,</hi> I think it necessary to tell you, that the best way is to make use of the Invention of Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> of <hi>Tusmore</hi> in <hi>Oxford-shire.</hi> Which is done (according as it is described by the Ingenuous Dr. <hi>Plot,</hi> in his <hi>Natural History</hi> of <hi>Oxford-shire</hi>) <q>by letting the <hi>Oats</hi> down from a <hi>Loft</hi> above, out of a <hi>Vessel</hi> like the <hi>Hopper</hi> of a <hi>Mill,</hi> whence they fall into a square <hi>Pipe</hi> let into the wall, of about four Inches <hi>Diagonal,</hi> which comes down into a <hi>Cupboard</hi> also set into the wall, but with its end so near the <hi>bottom</hi> that there shall never be above a <hi>Gallon,</hi> or other desireable Quantity in the Cupboard at a time, which being taken away and given to the <hi>Horses,</hi> another <hi>Gallon</hi> presently succeeds; so that in the lower part of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100171:248"/>
Stable, where the Horses stand, there is not one Inch of room taken up for the whole provision of <hi>Oats;</hi> which Contrivance hath also this further Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, that by this <hi>Motion</hi> the <hi>Oats</hi> are kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly <hi>sweet,</hi> (the taking away one <hi>Gallon</hi> moving the whole <hi>Mass</hi> above,) which laid up any otherwise in  great quantities, grow frequently <hi>musty.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I would have you have two made, the one for the <hi>Oats,</hi> the other for your <hi>split Beans,</hi> and both let into your Range of <hi>Presses;</hi> the Partitions may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be made over head, to separate your <hi>Oats</hi> from your <hi>Beans.</hi> Or if you like not this way, you may convert it into an <hi>Hay-loft,</hi> or <hi>Chambers</hi> for your <hi>Grooms,</hi> which you fancy; but whatever you make choice of, let the <hi>Floor</hi> overhead be <hi>seil'd,</hi> that no <hi>Dust</hi> from above fall upon your <hi>Horses.</hi> But if you have the convenience of a <hi>Rick-yard,</hi> so that you keep your <hi>Hay</hi> abroad, it is the opinion of some knowing <hi>Horsemen,</hi> that to <hi>tuck</hi> it out of the <hi>Rick</hi> by little and little, as you have occasion to use it, makes it spend much better than it would otherwise do out of the <hi>Hay-Tallet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the rest of its Perquisites, a <hi>Dung. yard,</hi> a <hi>Pump,</hi> or a <hi>Conduit,</hi> are necessary; and if you can have that convenience, some <hi>Pond</hi> or <hi>running River</hi> near hand. But be sure, never let the Front of your <hi>Stable</hi> be without <hi>Litter,</hi> that by frequent practice your <hi>Horse</hi> may learn to empty his <hi>Bladder</hi> when he is come from <hi>Airing,</hi> which will be both <hi>healthful</hi> for your <hi>Horse,</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> for your <hi>Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus laid down a <hi>Modell</hi> for a <hi>Stable,</hi> my next business is to tell the <hi>Groom</hi> his Duty; I mean not those which <hi>generally</hi> appertain to all Servants, such as are <hi>Obedience, Fidelity, Patience, Diligence</hi> &amp;c. but those more <hi>essentially</hi> belonging to this Office. <hi>First</hi> then he must <hi>love</hi> his <hi>Horse</hi> in the next degree
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100171:249"/>
to his <hi>Master,</hi> and to endeavour by fair Usage to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a <hi>reciprocal</hi> Love from him again, and an exact <hi>Obedience,</hi> which if he know how to <hi>pay</hi> it to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> he will the better be able to <hi>teach</hi> it his <hi>Horse;</hi> and both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> are to be obtain'd by fair means, rather than by Passion and Outrage. For those who are so <hi>irrational themselves,</hi> as not to be able to command their own Passions, are not fit to undertake the reclaiming of an Horse, (who by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is an <hi>irrational</hi> Creature) from his.</p>
                  <p>He must then put in practice that <hi>Patience,</hi> which I would have him Master of, at all times, and by that and fair means he shall attain his End: For nothing is more <hi>tractable</hi> than an <hi>Horse,</hi> if you make use of <hi>Kindness</hi> to win him. Next, <hi>Neatness</hi> is requisite in a <hi>Groom,</hi> to keep his Stable <hi>clean swept</hi> and in <hi>order;</hi> his <hi>Saddles, Housing-cloaths, Stirrops, Leathers,</hi> and <hi>Girths,</hi> cleane, and above all his <hi>Horse</hi> clean <hi>dress'd</hi> and <hi>rubb'd. Diligence</hi> in the last place is requisite both in a daily practice of his Duty, and in observing any the <hi>smallest</hi> Alteration whether <hi>casual</hi> or <hi>accidental,</hi> either in his Countenance, as <hi>Symptoms</hi> of <hi>Sickness,</hi> or in his Limbs and Gate, as <hi>Lameness,</hi> or in his Appetite, as <hi>forsaking</hi> his <hi>Meat,</hi> and immediately upon any such <hi>Discovery</hi> to seek out for Remedy. <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the Groom's Duty in <hi>general,</hi> and which I shall treat of more at large as Occasion shall offer it self.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time since <hi>Bartholomew-tide</hi> is now come, and the pride and strength of the <hi>Grass</hi> nipp'd by the severe Frosts, and cold Dews which accompany this <hi>Season,</hi> so that the Nourishment thereof turneth into <hi>raw Crudities,</hi> and the Coldness of the <hi>Night</hi> (which is an Enemy to the Horse) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates as much Flesh and Lust as he getteth in the <hi>Day,</hi> we will now <hi>take him up</hi> from <hi>Grass</hi> whilst his <hi>Coat</hi> lies smooth and sleek.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100171:249"/>
                  <p>Having brought him home, let your Groom so that Night <hi>set him up</hi> in some secure and spacious House, where he may evacuate his Body, and so be brought to warmer keeping by <hi>Degrees;</hi> the next day <hi>stable</hi> him. But tho it be held as a general Rule amongst the generality of Grooms, not to <hi>cloath</hi> or; <hi>dress</hi> their Horses, till Two or Three days after their <hi>stabling,</hi> I can find no Reason but Custom to perswade one to it; But it being <hi>little conducive</hi> either to the <hi>advantage</hi> or <hi>prejudice</hi> of the Horse, I shall leave it to their own Fancies: But as to the giving of <hi>Wheat-straw,</hi> to take up his <hi>Belly,</hi> (a custom us'd by Grooms generally at the Horse's first Housing,) I am utterly averse from it. For the Nature of a Horse being <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> if he should feed on <hi>Straw,</hi> which is so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it would <hi>straighten</hi> his Guts, and cause an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation</hi> of the <hi>Liver,</hi> and by that means distemper the <hi>Blood;</hi> and besides it would make his Body so <hi>costive,</hi> that it would cause a <hi>Retention</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and make him <hi>dung</hi> with great pain and difficulty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>full Feeding</hi> would expell the Excrements, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>true Intention</hi> and Inclination of <hi>Nature.</hi> Therefore let moderate <hi>Airing,</hi> warm <hi>Cloathing,</hi> good <hi>old Hay,</hi> and <hi>old Corn,</hi> supply the place of <hi>Wheat-straw.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin then methodically, that your Groom may not be to seek in any part of his Duty, I shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, that his first business is, after he hath brought his Horse into the Stable, in the morning to <hi>water</hi> him, and then to rub over his Body with a <hi>hard Wisp</hi> a little moisten'd, and then with a <hi>woollen</hi> cloath, then to cleanse his <hi>Sheath</hi> with his <hi>wet</hi> hand from all the <hi>Dust</hi> it had contracted during his Running, and to wash his <hi>Yard</hi> either with <hi>White-wine,</hi> or <hi>Water.</hi> Then he may <hi>trim</hi> him according to the manner that other Horses are trimm'd, except the <hi>inside</hi> of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100171:250"/>
Ears, which (though some still continue that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion) ought not to be meddled with, for fear of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>catch cold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this is done, let him have him to the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,</hi> and there get a Sett of <hi>Shoos</hi> answerable to the shape of his <hi>Foot,</hi> and not to <hi>pare</hi> his Foot that it may fit his <hi>Shoo,</hi> as too many Farriers do, not only in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> but here likewise. Be sure let his Feet be well open'd betwixt the <hi>Quarters</hi> and the <hi>Thrush,</hi> to prevent <hi>Hoof-binding;</hi> and let them be open'd <hi>straight,</hi> and not <hi>side-ways,</hi> for by that means in two or three Shooings, his <hi>Heels</hi> (which are the strength of his <hi>Feet</hi>) will be cut quite away. Pare his Foot as <hi>hollow</hi> as you can, and then the Shoo will not <hi>press</hi> upon it. The Shoo must come <hi>near</hi> to the Heel, yet not be set so <hi>close</hi> as to <hi>bruise</hi> it; nor yet so <hi>open</hi> as to <hi>catch</hi> in his Shoos, if at any time he happen to <hi>over-reach,</hi> and so hazard the pulling them off, the breaking of his <hi>Hoof,</hi> or the bruising of his <hi>Heel.</hi> The <hi>Webbs</hi> of the Shoos must be neither too <hi>broad,</hi> nor too <hi>narrow,</hi> but of a <hi>middle size,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the breadth of an inch, with slop'd <hi>Spunges;</hi> and even with his Foot; for though it would be for the advantage of the <hi>Travelling</hi> Horse's Heel, to have the Shoo sit a little <hi>wider</hi> than the Hoof, on both sides, that the Shoo might bear his Weight, and not his Foot touch the ground; yet the <hi>Hunter</hi> being often forc'd to gallop on rotten spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Earth, to have them larger would hazard Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pulling off his Shoos, as hath been shown before.</p>
                  <p>There is an Old Proverb, <hi>Before behind, and Behind before;</hi> that is, in the Fore-feet the <hi>Veins</hi> lie <hi>behind,</hi> and in the Hinder-feet they lie <hi>before.</hi> Therefore let the Farrier take care that he prick
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100171:250"/>
him not, but leave a space at the <hi>Heel</hi> of the Fore-feet, and a space between the <hi>Nails</hi> at the <hi>Toe.</hi> When your Shoo is set on according to this Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you will find a great deal of his Hoof left to be <hi>cut off</hi> at his <hi>Toe.</hi> When that is cut off, and his Feet smooth'd with a Filé, you will find him to stand so <hi>firm,</hi> and his Feet will be so <hi>strong,</hi> that he will tread as boldly on <hi>Stones</hi> as on <hi>Carpet-ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By that time he is <hi>shod,</hi> I presume 'twill be time to <hi>water</hi> him, therefore rake him to the <hi>River,</hi> and let him, after he has drank, <hi>stand</hi> some time in the <hi>Water,</hi> which will close up the <hi>holes</hi> (according to the opinion of some Horsemen) which the driving of the Nails made. Then have him gently home, and having ty'd him up to the Rack, <hi>rub</hi> him all over <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Legs</hi> with dry Straw; then stop his Feet with <hi>Cow-dung,</hi> sift him a Quarter of a Peck of clean <hi>old Oats,</hi> and give them to him; then <hi>litter</hi> him, and leave him a sufficient Quantity of <hi>old Hay</hi> to serve him all <hi>Night,</hi> and so leave him till the next <hi>Morning.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> How to order the Hunter for the first Fortnight.</head>
                  <p>I presume by this your Horse will have evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all his <hi>Grass,</hi> and his <hi>Shoes</hi> will be so well <hi>setled</hi> to his Feet, that he may be fit to be <hi>rid abroad</hi> to Air without danger of surbating. Therefore 'tis now necessary that I begin in a more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to direct our <hi>unexperienc'd Groom</hi> how he ought to proceed to order his Horse according to Art.</p>
                  <p>First then you are to visit your Horse <hi>early</hi> in the <hi>Morning,</hi> to wit, by Five a Clock if in Summer, or Six, if in Winter, and having <hi>put up</hi> his <hi>Litter</hi> under his Stall, and <hi>made clean</hi> your <hi>Stable,</hi> you shall then feel his <hi>Ribs,</hi> his <hi>Chaule</hi> and his <hi>Flank,</hi> for those are the cheif signes by which you must learn to judge of the <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evil state</hi> of your Horses body, as I shall now shew you.</p>
                  <p>Lay your Hands on the lower part of his <hi>short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribs,</hi> near the <hi>Flank,</hi> and if you feel his <hi>Fat</hi> to be exceeding <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> and to <hi>yield</hi> as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your hand, than you may be confident it is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,</hi> and that the least violent Labour, or Travail will <hi>dissolve</hi> it: which being dissolv'd, e're it be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by good Dyet, if it be not then remov'd by <hi>scouring,</hi> the Fat or <hi>grease</hi> belonging to the outward parts of the Body will fall down into his <hi>Heels,</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100171:251"/>
so cause <hi>gowtiness</hi> and <hi>swelling.</hi> I need not trouble you with the <hi>outward</hi> signs of this Distemper, they are evident to the Eye: but tho every Groom can inform you when a Horse is said to have the <hi>grease</hi> fallen into his <hi>Heels,</hi> yet may be he cannot instruct you in the cause why <hi>Travail disperseth</hi> it for a time, and when the Horse is <hi>cold</hi> it <hi>returns</hi> with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than before. The reason therefore is this: The Grease which by indiscreet Exercise, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in keeping is <hi>melted</hi> and fallen into his Legs, <hi>standing still</hi> in the Stable <hi>cools</hi> and <hi>congeals,</hi> and so <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> it self with other ill Humours, which flow to the affected part, so that they stop the natural <hi>Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Blood, and cause <hi>inflamations,</hi> and <hi>swellings</hi> as aforesaid but <hi>Travail</hi> producing <hi>warmth</hi> in his Limbs <hi>thaws</hi> as it were the <hi>congeal'd</hi> Humours, and disperses them throughout the Body in general; till <hi>Rest</hi> gives them opportunity to unite and <hi>settle</hi> again. Now tho most Grooms are of opinion that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is not to be <hi>prevented</hi> by care or caution, that when it has once seaz'd a horse it remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable; yet they are mistaken in both, for by Art it may be prevented, and by Art cured: altho the cure is so difficult to be wrought, that a Groom cannot be too careful to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>nward</hi> Grease which is in his <hi>Stomack, Bag,</hi> and <hi>Guts,</hi> if when once' melted it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by Art, Medicine and good keeping, it <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies,</hi> and breeds those mortal Diseases, which ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably destroy the Horse, tho it be half a year or three quarters of a year after. And this is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the source of most <hi>Feavers, Surfeits, Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, &amp;c.</hi> and such other Distempers which carry off infinite numbers of horses, for want of the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers</hi> knowledge in the first Causes of the Distemper: which to prevent you shall follow the ensuing Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100171:252"/>
                  <p>After by feeling on his <hi>Ribs</hi> you have found his Fat <hi>soft</hi> and unsound; you shall feele his <hi>Chaule,</hi> and if you find any <hi>fleshy substance,</hi> or great round <hi>Kirnells</hi> or <hi>Knots,</hi> you may be assured that, as his <hi>outward</hi> Fat is unsound, so <hi>inwardly</hi> he is full of <hi>glut,</hi> and <hi>pursive,</hi> by means of gross and tough Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours cleaving to the hollow places of the <hi>Lungs</hi> stopping so his <hi>Windpipe</hi> that his Wind cannot find free passage, nor his Body be capable of much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Therefore the chief end and Intention of Art is by good sound Food to <hi>enseame</hi> and <hi>harden</hi> his Fat, and by moderate Exercise, warm cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gentle Phisick to <hi>cleanse</hi> away his <hi>inward Glut,</hi> that his Wind, and other parts being freed from all grossness, his courage and activity in any labour or service may appear to be more than redoubled.</p>
                  <p>The same Observations you must make from his <hi>Flank,</hi> which you will find alwaies to correspond, with the <hi>Ribs</hi> and <hi>Chaule,</hi> for till he is drawn clean it will feel <hi>thick</hi> to your <hi>gripe,</hi> but when he is <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seam'd,</hi> you will perceive nothing but two thin skins; and by these three Observations of the <hi>Ribs, Flank,</hi> and <hi>Chaps,</hi> you may, at any time pass an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different judgment of your Horses being in a <hi>good</hi> condition or a <hi>bad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you have made these <hi>Remarks,</hi> you shall sift your Horse a handful or two (and no more) of good old sound <hi>Oates,</hi> and give them to him, to preserve his <hi>Stomack</hi> from cold Humours that might oppress it by drinking <hi>fasting,</hi> and likewise to make him <hi>drink</hi> the better. When he hath eaten them, pull off his Coller, and <hi>rub</hi> his <hi>Head, Face, Ears,</hi> and <hi>Nape</hi> of the <hi>Neck</hi> with a clean Rubbing Cloth made of <hi>Hemp,</hi> for 'tis soveraign for the Head, and dissolveth all gross and filthy Humours. Then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100171:252"/>
take a small <hi>Snaffle,</hi> and wash it in fair water, and put it on his head, drawing the Reins through the Headstall, to prevent his slipping it over his head, and so tye him up to the Rack, and dress him thus;</p>
                  <p>First in your <hi>Right-hand</hi> take a <hi>Curry-Comb</hi> suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your Horses skin, (as if your horses <hi>coat</hi> be <hi>short</hi> and <hi>smooth,</hi> then must the Curry-Comb be <hi>blunt,</hi> but if <hi>long</hi> and <hi>rough,</hi> then must the Teeth be <hi>long</hi> and and <hi>sharp,</hi> standing with your Face <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite</hi> to the Horses, hold the Left cheek of the <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall</hi> in your <hi>Left-hand,</hi> and <hi>Curry</hi> him with a good <hi>hard</hi> hand from the Root of his <hi>Ears,</hi> all a long his <hi>Neck</hi> to his <hi>Shoulders:</hi> then go over all his <hi>Body</hi> with a more <hi>moderate</hi> hand, then Curry his <hi>Buttocks</hi> down to the hinder <hi>Cambrell</hi> with an <hi>hard</hi> hand again: then <hi>change</hi> your hand, and laying your Right Arm over his Back, joyn your right-side to his left, and so Curry him <hi>gently</hi> from the top of his <hi>Withers,</hi> to the lower part of his <hi>shoulder,</hi> ever now and then fetching your stroke over the left side of his <hi>breast,</hi> and so Curry him down to Knee, but no further: Then Curry him all under his <hi>Belly,</hi> near his <hi>Fore-bowels,</hi> and in a word all over very well, his <hi>Legs</hi> under the Knees and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels only <hi>excepted.</hi> And as you dress'd the <hi>left-side,</hi> so must you the <hi>right</hi> likewise.</p>
                  <p>Now by the way take notice, whether your Horse keeps <hi>a riggling up and down,</hi> biting the Rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staves, and now and then offering to <hi>snap</hi> at you, or lifting up his Leg to <hi>strike</hi> at you, when you are Currying him: if he do 'tis an apparent sign of his displeasure by reason of the <hi>sharpness</hi> of the Comb, and therefore you must file the Teeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more <hi>blunt:</hi> but if you perceive that he plays these, or such like Tricks through <hi>Wantonness</hi> and

the Pseasure he takes in the Friction, then you shall ever now and then correct him with your Whip gently for his Waggishness.</p>
                  <p>This Currying is only to raise the <hi>Dust,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after you have thus curried him, you must take either a <hi>Horse-tail</hi> (nail d to an Handle) or a clean <hi>dusting-Cloath</hi> of <hi>Cotten,</hi> and with it strike off the loose Dust rais'd by your Curry-comb Then dress him all over with the <hi>French-Brush,</hi> both Head, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Legs to the very Fet-locks, observing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to <hi>cleanse</hi> the Brush from the <hi>filth</hi> it gathers from the bottom of the Hair, by rubbing it on the curry-comb. Then dust him the second time. Then with your <hi>Hand</hi> wet in water rub his body all over, and as near as you can leave no <hi>loose hairs</hi> behind you; and with your <hi>wet hands</hi> pick and cleanse his <hi>Eys, Ears, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils, Sheath, Cods,</hi> and <hi>Tuel,</hi> and so rub him till he be as <hi>dry</hi> as at first. Then take an <hi>Hair-patch,</hi> and rub his Body all over, but especially his <hi>Fore-bowels</hi> under his <hi>Belly,</hi> his <hi>Flank,</hi> and between his hinder <hi>Thighs.</hi> Lastly, <hi>wipe</hi> him over with a fine white linnen Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>When you have thus drest him, take a large <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-cloath</hi> (made on purpose,) that may reach down to the <hi>Spurring-place,</hi> and lap it about his Body; then clap on his <hi>Saddle,</hi> and throw a <hi>cloth</hi> over him for fear of catching cold. Then take two <hi>Ropes</hi> of <hi>Straw</hi> twisted extream hard together, and with them rub and chafe his <hi>Legs</hi> from the Knees and Cambrels downwards to the Ground, picking his <hi>Fetlock-joynts</hi> with your hands from Dust, Filth, and Scabs. Then take another <hi>Hair-patch</hi> kept on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for his Legs, (for you must have two) and with it rub and dress his Legs also.</p>
                  <p>Now by the way let me give you this necessary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100171:253"/>
Caution, be sure whilst you are <hi>dressing</hi> your Horse let him not stand <hi>naked,</hi> his Body being expos'd to the penetration of the <hi>Air,</hi> whilst you are telling a <hi>Banbury-story</hi> to some Comrades, that accidentally come into the Stable, as I have seen some Grooms, that would stand <hi>lolling</hi> over their Horses, when they were <hi>uncloath'd,</hi> and trifle away their time by listning to some idle Discourse; but when you have <hi>stripp'd</hi> him fall to your Business <hi>roundly,</hi> without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission till you have sadled him, and thrown his Cloth over him.</p>
                  <p>And the reason why I advise you to throw a <hi>Cloth</hi> over him, whilst you are dressing his Legs is this; that although tis a general Rule amongst Grooms, that an Horse cannot take <hi>cold</hi> whilst he is <hi>dressing,</hi> yet is that Saying to be understood only of his <hi>Body,</hi> not of his <hi>Legs;</hi> for the rubbing of his Legs will not prevent catching cold in his Body</p>
                  <p>When this is done, you shall with an <hi>Iron Picker</hi> pick his Feet clean, (that the stopping of his Feet may not be a means of his taking up Stones in them,) <hi>comb</hi> down his <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Tail</hi> with a wet Main-comb, then spirt some <hi>Beer</hi> into his Mouth, and so <hi>draw</hi> him out of the Stable.</p>
                  <p>Being <hi>mounted,</hi> rake or walk him to some Running <hi>River,</hi> or fresh clear <hi>Spring,</hi> distant a Mile or two from your Stable, (which will refine his <hi>Mouth</hi> which he may have <hi>lost,</hi> during his Summers Running, and will likewise settle his Body upon his <hi>Rake,</hi>) and there let him drink about <hi>half</hi> his <hi>draught</hi> at first, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent raw Crudities arising in his Stomach. After he hath <hi>drunk</hi> bring him <hi>calmly out</hi> of the Water, and so ride him <hi>gently</hi> for a while; for nothing is more <hi>unbeseeming</hi> a Horseman, than to thrust his Horse into a <hi>swift Gallop,</hi> as soon as he comes out of the Water, for these three <hi>Causes.</hi> First, it is not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100171:254"/>
only <hi>hazards</hi> the <hi>breaking</hi> of his <hi>Wind,</hi> but also assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly <hi>endanges</hi> the <hi>incording,</hi> or <hi>bursting</hi> of him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it <hi>begets</hi> in him an ill <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>running away,</hi> as soon as he hath done drinking. Lastly, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight he hath of such <hi>violent Exercise,</hi> makes him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes <hi>refuse</hi> to <hi>quench</hi> his <hi>Thirst:</hi> and therefore (as I said) first <hi>walk</hi> him a little way, and then put him into a <hi>gentle Gallop</hi> for 5 or 6 score, then give him <hi>wind:</hi> and after he hath been <hi>rak'd</hi> a pretty space, then shew him the Water <hi>again,</hi> and let him <hi>drink</hi> what he <hi>pleases,</hi> and then <hi>gallop</hi> him <hi>again;</hi> and thus do till he will drink <hi>no more,</hi> but be sure to observe always that you <hi>gallop</hi> him not so much as either to <hi>chafe,</hi> or <hi>sweat</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>Now by the way <hi>observe,</hi> that in his <hi>galloping after water,</hi> (after the first weeks <hi>enseaming,</hi>) if sometimes you give him a <hi>watering Course sharply,</hi> of twelve or twenty score, (as you find your Horse,) it will <hi>quicken</hi> his <hi>spirits,</hi> and cause him to <hi>gallop</hi> more <hi>pleasantly,</hi> and teach him to <hi>mannage</hi> his <hi>Limbs</hi> more <hi>nimbly,</hi> and to <hi>stretch</hi> forth his <hi>Body largely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When your Horse hath done drinking, then <hi>rake</hi> him to the Top of the next <hi>Hill,</hi> (if there be any near your Watring-place,) for <hi>there</hi> in the morning the <hi>Air</hi> is <hi>purest,</hi> or else to some such place, as he may gain best advantage both of <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> and there air him a <hi>foot-pace</hi> an <hi>hour,</hi> or so long as you (in your discretion) shall think <hi>sufficient</hi> for the state of his Body, and then ride him <hi>home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the time of your Horses <hi>Airing,</hi> you will easily perceive several marks of your Horses <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and the pleasure which he takes in this <hi>Exercise.</hi> For he will <hi>gape, yawn,</hi> and as it were <hi>shrug</hi> his <hi>Body.</hi> If he offer to <hi>stand still,</hi> to <hi>dung,</hi> or <hi>stale,</hi> which his Airing will provoke, be sure <hi>give</hi> him <hi>leave,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to <hi>stare about, neigh,</hi> or <hi>listen</hi> after any <hi>noise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100171:254"/>
                  <p>Now <hi>Airing</hi> brings several <hi>Advantages</hi> to the Horse. <hi>First,</hi> it <hi>purifies</hi> the <hi>Blood,</hi> (if the Air be <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi>) it <hi>purges</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> from many <hi>gross</hi> and suffocating <hi>Humors,</hi> and so <hi>hardens</hi> and <hi>enseams</hi> the Horses <hi>Fat,</hi> that it is not near so liable to be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd</hi> by ordinary Exercise. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it teaches him how to let his <hi>Wind rake equally</hi> and <hi>keep time</hi> with the other <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>Motions</hi> of his Body. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it <hi>sharpens</hi> the <hi>Appetite,</hi> and provokes the <hi>Stomach,</hi> (which is of great advantage both to <hi>Hunters</hi> and <hi>Gallopers,</hi> who are apt to <hi>loose</hi> their <hi>Stomach</hi> through <hi>excess</hi> or <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Exercise</hi>): for the <hi>sharpness</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> will drive the Horses <hi>natural Heat</hi> from the <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> to the <hi>interior</hi> parts, which <hi>Heat</hi> by furthering <hi>Concoction</hi> creates an Appetite. <hi>Lastly,</hi> it <hi>increases</hi> Lust and <hi>Courage</hi> in him, provided he not <hi>too early</hi> air'd.</p>
                  <p>But whereas Mr. <hi>Markam,</hi> in his <hi>Way to get wealth,</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>pag.</hi> 44. directs, if your Horse be very <hi>fat</hi> to <hi>air</hi> him before <hi>Sun-rise,</hi> and after <hi>Sun-set;</hi> and that the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Gentleman's Jockey,</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>pag.</hi> 14. says, that nothing is more <hi>wholsome</hi> than <hi>early</hi> and <hi>late</hi> Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; I think the contrary may be made out from <hi>Experience.</hi> For in this Art, all things that any ways hinder the <hi>strength</hi> and vigor of <hi>Nature,</hi> are to be avoided; now, that extreamity of Cold, and being out early and late do so, is evidently seen by Horses that <hi>run abroad</hi> all Winter, which however <hi>hardily</hi> bred, and kept with the <hi>best</hi> care and Fodder, yet cannot by any means be <hi>advanc'd</hi> to so good case in <hi>Winter</hi> as an <hi>indifferent</hi> Pasture will raise them to in <hi>Summer.</hi> And this holding true of the <hi>Nocturnal Colds,</hi> must needs be verified in some proportionate measure of the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening Dews,</hi> and that piercing Cold which is observ'd to be more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense</hi> at the <hi>opening</hi> and <hi>close</hi> of the Day, than any
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100171:255"/>
part of the Night. Besides that, the <hi>Dews</hi> and moist <hi>Rimes</hi> do as much Injury to a Horse, as the sharpest <hi>Colds</hi> or <hi>Frosts:</hi> since (as I have found by experience) a Horse any ways inclinable to <hi>Catarrhs, Rheums,</hi> or any other <hi>cold</hi> Distempers, is apt to have the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors augmented, and the disease most senbsily increasd by these early and late Airings.</p>
                  <p>But if he be not had forth to <hi>aire</hi> till the <hi>Sun</hi> be <hi>risen,</hi> (as you must cast to have him dress'd, and ready to lead forth against that time) his spirits will be chear'd and comforted by that <hi>universal Comforter</hi> of all living Creatures; and indeed all Horses natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire to enjoy the Sun's <hi>warmth,</hi> as you may observe by those Horses which <hi>lie out</hi> all Night, who as soon as the <hi>Sun</hi> is <hi>risen,</hi> will repair to those places where they may have the most benefit of his <hi>Beams,</hi> and by them be in part <hi>reliev'd</hi> from the coldness of the foregoing <hi>Night.</hi> And besides the benefit of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> will be so mild and temperate, as it will rather <hi>invigorate</hi> than <hi>prey</hi> upon his spirits, and more <hi>increase</hi> his Strength than <hi>impair</hi> it</p>
                  <p>Neither, tho we disallow of Early and Late airings, need we be at a loss to bring down our Horses <hi>fat,</hi> and from being <hi>pursive,</hi> and <hi>too high</hi> in Flesh, to reduce him to cleanness, and a more moderate state of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For if you do but observe this <hi>one</hi> Rule of keeping a <hi>fat</hi> Horse so much longer out at a time both Morning and Evening, you will undoubtedly obtain your <hi>end</hi> by such <hi>long Airing,</hi> joyn'd with true sound <hi>Heats,</hi> which you may expect indeed, but will never find from those that are shorter, how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and late soever: for this Method joyn'd with good <hi>feeding</hi> is the best <hi>Prescription</hi> can be given in this case, and tis from the <hi>length</hi> of your <hi>Airings</hi> only, that you must hope to bring your Horse to a perfect <hi>Wind,</hi> and true <hi>Courage.</hi> And therefore a Horse that is <hi>high</hi> in <hi>Flesh,</hi> is a fitter subject to <hi>work</hi> on, than
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100171:255"/>
One that is low, because he is better able to endure Labour, whereas the other must of necessity be so <hi>favoured</hi> in training, to improve his Strength and Flesh, that he is in danger (without he be under the care of a very Skilful keeper) of proving thick wind ed for want of <hi>true Exercise</hi> in Training.</p>
                  <p>When you are returned from Airing, and are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, lead your Horse on the Straw, which (as I told you before) should always lye before the Stable door; and there by Whistling and stirring up the Litter under his Belly will provoke him to Stale, which a little practice will bring him to, and is advantagious for the Horses <hi>Health,</hi> and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Stable clean; Then lead him into his <hi>Staul</hi> (which ought likewise to be well littered) and having ty'd up his head to the empty <hi>Rack,</hi> take off his Saddle, rubb his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Leggs</hi> all over with the <hi>French-brush,</hi> then with the <hi>Hair-patch,</hi> and last of all with the <hi>Woollen cloath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then you shall <hi>cloath</hi> him with a <hi>Linnen cloath</hi> next to his Body, and over that a <hi>Canvas</hi> cloath, and both made so fit as to cover his <hi>Breast</hi> and to come pretty low down to his <hi>Legs,</hi> which is the <hi>Turkish</hi> way of Cloathing, who are the most curious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (sales the Duke of <hi>Newcaslle</hi>) in keeping their Horses, and esteem them the most of any Nation. Over the forementioned put a <hi>Body-cloath</hi> of six, or eight <hi>Straps,</hi> which is better than a <hi>Sircingle</hi> and <hi>Pad</hi> stuft with <hi>wisps,</hi> because this keeps his <hi>Belly</hi> in <hi>Shape,</hi> and is not so subject to hurt him.</p>
                  <p>Now these Cloathes will be sufficient for him at his first <hi>Stabling,</hi> because being <hi>inur'd</hi> to the cool Air he will not be so apt to <hi>take cold,</hi> the weather likewise at that season being indifferently warm; but when <hi>sharp</hi> weather approaches, and that you find his <hi>Hair rise</hi> about his <hi>outward</hi> parts that are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100171:256"/>
uncloathed, as <hi>Neck, Gascoins, &amp;c.</hi> then add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cloath, which ought to be of <hi>Woolen,</hi> and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Horse <hi>bred</hi> under this <hi>Climate,</hi> and kept only for <hi>ordinary</hi> Hunting, this is cloathing sufficient.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>design</hi> of <hi>cloathings</hi> is only by their help joyn'd to the <hi>warmth</hi> of the <hi>Stable,</hi> and the <hi>Litter</hi> (which must alwaies lye under the Horse) to keep his Body in such a <hi>moderate</hi> Natural <hi>Heat,</hi> as shall be sufficient to assist <hi>Nature,</hi> that <hi>skilful</hi> Physitian in expelling her Enemies, by dissolving those <hi>raw</hi> and <hi>gross</hi> Humours which are subject to <hi>annoy</hi> the Horse, and which would very much prejudice him if they were not <hi>removed;</hi> which <hi>warm cloathing</hi> does in a great measure by <hi>dispersing</hi> them into the <hi>outward parts,</hi> and <hi>expelling</hi> them by <hi>sweating</hi> as he sleeps and lyes down, which will be a meanes to <hi>purge</hi> his Body, and keep it clean from <hi>glut,</hi> and <hi>redundant</hi> Humours.</p>
                  <p>But yet (as in all things the <hi>golden mean is best</hi>) there is a <hi>meane</hi> to be observ'd too here: for as too <hi>few</hi> Cloathes will not assist Nature <hi>sufficiently</hi> in the expulsion of her <hi>Enemies,</hi> so <hi>too many</hi> will <hi>force</hi> her <hi>too much,</hi> and cause <hi>weakness</hi> in your Horse by too violent <hi>sweatings.</hi> Therefore you must have a care of following the Example of some <hi>ignorant</hi> Grooms, who because they have acquired a <hi>false</hi> Reputation by living in some Noblemans or Gentlemans Service, that are noted Sportsmen, think they are able to give Laws to all their <hi>Fraternity,</hi> and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reason heap <hi>Multiplicity</hi> of Cloaths on the Horse as if they meant to bury him in <hi>Woolen.</hi> You must know, that both the <hi>temperature</hi> of the <hi>Weather</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> are to be observed; and that all Horses are not to be cloathed <hi>alike.</hi> Your <hi>fine-Skined</hi> Horses, as the <hi>Barb, Turk, Spanish horse</hi> &amp;c. require more clothes then our <hi>English</hi> common
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100171:256"/>
Horses, that are <hi>bred</hi> in a <hi>colder climate,</hi> and have naturally <hi>thicker</hi> skin's, and a <hi>longer</hi> Coat. But that you may not <hi>erre</hi> I have told you already how you are to <hi>cloath</hi> your Horse, and therefore shall only add this one <hi>General</hi> Rule, That a <hi>Rough</hi> Coat shews <hi>want</hi> of Cloaths, and a <hi>Smooth</hi> Coat Cloathing <hi>sufficient:</hi> ever observing, that by his <hi>Countenance,</hi> his <hi>Dung,</hi> and other <hi>outward Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> (which I shall by and by give you <hi>more</hi> at <hi>large</hi>) you perceive your Horse to to be in <hi>health,</hi> and yet notwithstanding your Horses <hi>Coat</hi> still <hi>stares,</hi> you must add <hi>more</hi> cloathes till it <hi>lye;</hi> as on the <hi>other hand</hi> if it will <hi>lye</hi> withe the assist- of a <hi>single</hi> Linnen Cloath it is sufficient.</p>
                  <p>But if when he has been in <hi>keeping</hi> some time, you perceive him apt to <hi>sweat</hi> in the <hi>Night,</hi> 'tis a sign that he is <hi>over-fed,</hi> and wants <hi>exercise:</hi> but if he sweat at his <hi>first coming</hi> from <hi>Grass,</hi> you must know that there is cause rather to <hi>encrease,</hi> than <hi>diminish</hi> the Cloathes I have alloted at his first Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for it proceeds from the <hi>foul humours</hi> which oppress Nature, and when by exercise they are <hi>eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated,</hi> Nature will <hi>cease working,</hi> and he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a <hi>temperate</hi> state of Body all the year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>When he is <hi>cloath'd up, pick</hi> his <hi>Feet</hi> cleane with an <hi>Iron Picker,</hi> and wash his <hi>Hoofs</hi> clean with a <hi>Spung</hi> dipt in <hi>fair watet,</hi> and then <hi>dry</hi> them with <hi>Straw</hi> or a <hi>Linnen cloath,</hi> and if there be <hi>occasion</hi> and that you find your Horses, <hi>Legs durty,</hi> you may <hi>bathe</hi> them likewise, only you must be sure to <hi>rub</hi> them <hi>dry</hi> before you go out of your Stable, then leave him on his <hi>Snaffle</hi> for an hour, or more, which will assist his Appetite.</p>
                  <p>When an <hi>Hour</hi> is <hi>expired,</hi> you shall come to him again, and having tuck'd an <hi>handful</hi> of <hi>Hay,</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100171:257"/>
                     <hi>dusted</hi> it, you shall let your Horse <hi>tease</hi> it out of your hand till he hath eaten it; then pull off his <hi>Bridle,</hi> and having rub'd his <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Neck</hi> clean, with the <hi>Hempen-cloth,</hi> as before, <hi>pull</hi> his <hi>Eares,</hi> and <hi>stop</hi> his <hi>Nostrils</hi> to make him <hi>snore,</hi> which will help to <hi>bring away</hi> the moist <hi>Humours</hi> which <hi>oppress</hi> his <hi>Brain,</hi> and then put on his <hi>Coller,</hi> and give him a Quarter of <hi>Oats clean drest,</hi> in a Sive, having first made his <hi>Locker,</hi> or <hi>Manger</hi> clean with a Wispe of Straw, and a Cloth.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he is eating his <hi>Corn,</hi> you shall <hi>sweep</hi> out your <hi>Stable,</hi> and see that all things are <hi>neat</hi> about him, and turning up his <hi>Cloaths,</hi> you shall <hi>rub</hi> his <hi>Fillets, Buttocks,</hi> and <hi>Gascoins</hi> over with the <hi>hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,</hi> and after that with a <hi>Woolen-cloth;</hi> then spread a clean <hi>Flannel Fillet-cloth</hi> over his <hi>Fillets</hi> and <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks</hi> (which will make his <hi>Coat</hi> lye <hi>smooth</hi>) and turn down his <hi>Housing-cloaths</hi> upon it.

                  </p>
                  <p>After this <hi>pick</hi> his <hi>Feet</hi> with an <hi>Iron Picker,</hi> and <hi>stop</hi> them with <hi>Cow-dung;</hi> and by this time your Horse (if he be not a very slow Feeder) will have <hi>eaten</hi> his Oates, which if you find he does with a <hi>good</hi> Stomack, sift him another <hi>Quart,</hi> and throw them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100171:257"/>
to <hi>feed</hi> him by <hi>little and little,</hi> whilst he eats with an Appetite; but if he <hi>fumbles</hi> with his <hi>Corn,</hi> then give him no more at that time.</p>
                  <p>And this I think a better Direction than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a <hi>set quantity</hi> of <hi>Provender,</hi> as all <hi>Authors</hi> I have yet met with have done. For without doubt no <hi>certain</hi> Quantity of Meat can be <hi>allotted</hi> for all sorts of <hi>Horses,</hi> any more than for all sorts of <hi>Men;</hi> and therefore proportion the quantity to the Horses Appetite: but be sure at all times give him his <hi>full feeding,</hi> for that will keep his Body in better <hi>state</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> and increase his <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>vigor.</hi> Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to keep your Horse <hi>always sharp-set,</hi> is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to procure a <hi>Surfeit,</hi> if at any time he can come at his <hi>fill</hi> of <hi>Provender;</hi> according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proverb, <hi>Two hungry Meales make the third a Glutton.</hi> But tho you perceive he gather <hi>Flesh</hi> too fast upon such <hi>home-feeding;</hi> yet be sure not to <hi>stint</hi> him for it, but only <hi>increase</hi> his <hi>Labour,</hi> and that will assist both his Strength and Wind.</p>
                  <p>When these things are done, you shall <hi>dust</hi> a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Hay,</hi> and throw it down to him on his <hi>Litter,</hi> after you have taken it up under him; and then <hi>shutting</hi> up the <hi>Windows</hi> and <hi>Stable door,</hi> leave him till <hi>One</hi> a <hi>Clock</hi> in the Afternoon; at which time you shall come to him, and having <hi>rubb'd</hi> over his <hi>Head, Neck, Fillets, Buttocks,</hi> and <hi>Legs,</hi> as before, with the <hi>Hair-patch</hi> and <hi>Woollen-cloath,</hi> you shall <hi>feed</hi> him as before, and then <hi>leave</hi> him till the time of his <hi>Evening watring,</hi> (which should be about <hi>three</hi> of the clock in <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>four</hi> in <hi>Summer;</hi>) and then having put back his <hi>foul Litter,</hi> and swept away that and his <hi>Dung,</hi> you shall <hi>dress</hi> and <hi>saddle</hi> him as before, and <hi>mounting</hi> him you shall <hi>rake</hi> him to the <hi>water,</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100171:258"/>
after <hi>drinking</hi> and <hi>galloping</hi> you shall <hi>air</hi> him along by the <hi>River side,</hi> till you think it time to go home; then order him in <hi>all points,</hi> as to rubbing, feeding, stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you did in the <hi>morning;</hi> and having <hi>fed</hi> him at <hi>six a clock,</hi> be sure <hi>feed</hi> him again about <hi>Nine;</hi> and having <hi>litter'd</hi> him well, and thrown him <hi>Hay</hi> enough to serve him for all <hi>Night,</hi> you shall leave him till the next <hi>Morning.</hi> And as you have <hi>spent</hi> this day, so you must <hi>order</hi> him in <hi>all respects</hi> for a <hi>fortnight</hi> together, and by that time his <hi>Flesh</hi> will be so <hi>harden'd,</hi> and his <hi>Wind</hi> so <hi>improv'd;</hi> his <hi>Mouth</hi> will be so <hi>quicken'd,</hi> and his <hi>Gallop</hi> brought to so <hi>good</hi> a <hi>stroke,</hi> that he will be fit to be put to <hi>moderate Hunting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now during this <hi>Fortnights</hi> keeping you are to make several <hi>Observations,</hi> as to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> of your Horse, the <hi>temper</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>course</hi> of his <hi>Digestion,</hi> &amp;c. and order him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. As <hi>first,</hi> if he be of a <hi>churlish</hi> Disposition, you must <hi>reclaim</hi> him by <hi>Severity;</hi> if of a <hi>loving</hi> temper, you must <hi>win</hi> him by <hi>Kindness. Secondly,</hi> you must observe whether he be a <hi>foul Feeder,</hi> or of a <hi>nice Stomach;</hi> if he be <hi>quick</hi> at his Meat, and retain a <hi>good</hi> Stomach, then <hi>four</hi> times of <hi>full Feeding,</hi> in a <hi>Day</hi> and a <hi>Nights</hi> space, is <hi>sufficient;</hi> but if he be a <hi>slender Feeder,</hi> and <hi>slow</hi> at his <hi>Meat,</hi> then you must give but a <hi>little</hi> at once, and <hi>often,</hi> as about every <hi>two</hi> hours, for <hi>fresh</hi> Meat will draw on his <hi>Appetite;</hi> and you must always leave a <hi>little</hi> Meat in his <hi>Locker</hi> for him to <hi>eat</hi> at his own <hi>leisure</hi> betwixt the times of his <hi>Feeding;</hi> and when at any time you find any <hi>left,</hi> you shall <hi>sweep</hi> it <hi>away,</hi> and give him <hi>fresh,</hi> and <hi>expose</hi> that to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> which will prevent <hi>mustiness</hi> and reduce it to its first <hi>sweetness,</hi> before it was <hi>blown</hi> upon.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100171:258"/>
                  <p>Now as to the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Feeding,</hi> you may <hi>sharpen</hi> his Stomach by <hi>change</hi> of Meat, as giving one Meal <hi>clean Oats,</hi> another <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>split-Beans,</hi> and (when you have brought him to eat Bread) you may give him another meal of <hi>Bread,</hi> always observing to give him <hi>oftenest</hi> that which he likes <hi>best;</hi> or if you please you may give him both <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> at the same <hi>time,</hi> provided you give him that <hi>last</hi> which he eats <hi>best,</hi> and which has the best Digestion.</p>
                  <p>Tis observ'd of some Horses, that they are of so <hi>hot</hi> a <hi>Constitution,</hi> that without they may <hi>drink</hi> at every <hi>bit</hi> they cannot <hi>eat,</hi> and those Horses usually carry <hi>no Belly;</hi> in this case therefore you must let a <hi>Pale</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> stand continually before them, or at least offer them Water at <hi>Noon,</hi> besides what they <hi>fetch</hi> abroad at their <hi>ordinary</hi> times.</p>
                  <p>Next you are to observe the nature of his <hi>Digestion,</hi> that is, whether he retains his Food <hi>long,</hi> which is the sign of a <hi>bad</hi> Digestion; or whether Nature does expel the <hi>Dung</hi> more <hi>frequently;</hi> which if he do, and that his Dung be <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>bright</hi> tis a sign of a good <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>Body;</hi> but if he dung <hi>hard,</hi> and <hi>seldom,</hi> then on the contrary tis a sign of a <hi>dry</hi> Body; and therefore to <hi>remedy</hi> this, you shall <hi>once</hi> in a day give him a <hi>handful</hi> or two of <hi>Oats,</hi> well <hi>wash'd</hi> in good <hi>strong Ale,</hi> for this will <hi>loosen</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> and keep it <hi>moist,</hi> and you will sind it also good for his <hi>Wind,</hi> notwithstand-the opinion of some to the contrary.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP V.</hi> Of the Second Fortnights Diet, and of his first Hunting, and what Chases are most proper to Train him.</head>
                  <p>BY that time you have <hi>spent</hi> this <hi>Fortnight,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the foregoing <hi>Rules,</hi> your Horse will be in a pretty <hi>good state</hi> of Body; for the gross <hi>Humors</hi> will be <hi>dry'd</hi> in his Body, and his <hi>Flesh</hi> will begin to be <hi>harden'd,</hi> which you will perceive (as I told you at first) by his <hi>Chaul,</hi> his short <hi>Ribs,</hi> and his <hi>Flank;</hi> for the <hi>Kernels</hi> under his <hi>Chaps</hi> will not feel so <hi>gross</hi> as at first they did, his <hi>flesh</hi> on his short <hi>Ribs</hi> will not feel so <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>loose,</hi> nor the <hi>thin</hi> part of his <hi>Flank</hi> so <hi>thick</hi> as at his <hi>first</hi> housing; so that now you may without <hi>hazard</hi> adventure to <hi>hunt</hi> him moderately.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed, I think it necessary to clear one <hi>point,</hi> which I have heard much <hi>discuss'd</hi> amongst <hi>Horsemen,</hi> which is, What sort of <hi>Chase</hi> is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the <hi>training</hi> of a <hi>young</hi> Horse? some being of <hi>one</hi> Opinion, some of <hi>another.</hi> For some would have a Horse, which is <hi>design d</hi> either for a <hi>Buck-hunter</hi> or <hi>Fox-hunter,</hi> us'd from the beginning to the <hi>Chase</hi> which they are <hi>design'd</hi> for. Others think those <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> too violent for a <hi>young.</hi> Horse, and therefore chuse to train him after <hi>Harriers;</hi> and of this Opinion I must own my self to be, since <hi>Exporience</hi> has fully <hi>shewn</hi> me the <hi>Advantages</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100171:259"/>
of the <hi>other.</hi> Now to prove this <hi>Assertion,</hi> let us take a slight view of the <hi>several</hi> Chases which are commonly used by our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> where the Horse is made a <hi>Companion</hi> and <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Sport,</hi> and they are these; the <hi>Stag, Buck, Hind, Fox, Otter,</hi> and <hi>Hare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>three first</hi> here mention'd, as there is not much <hi>difference</hi> in the hunting of them, so the <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences</hi> from each Chase are in a manner the <hi>same</hi> also. For which soever you <hi>hunt,</hi> tis either in <hi>Covert,</hi> or <hi>at force.</hi> Now if <hi>Deer</hi> be hunted in a <hi>Park,</hi> they usually chuse the most <hi>woody</hi> parts of it, as a <hi>Refuge</hi> from the pursuits of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> which is both <hi>unpleasant</hi> to the <hi>Rider,</hi> and <hi>troublesome</hi> to the <hi>Horse,</hi> to <hi>follow</hi> the Dogs thro the <hi>thick Bushes;</hi> and besides, usually the Ground in <hi>Parks</hi> is full of <hi>Mole-banks, Trenches,</hi> &amp;c. which is <hi>dangerous</hi> for a young Horse to gallop on, till he has attain'd to some <hi>perfection</hi> in his <hi>Stroke.</hi> But if they be <hi>turn'd out</hi> of the Park, and be hunted <hi>at force,</hi> you will find, that as soon as you have <hi>unharbour'd</hi> or <hi>rous'd</hi> them, they will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately make out <hi>end ways</hi> before the Hounds <hi>five</hi> or <hi>six,</hi> nay sometimes <hi>ten</hi> Miles, they following in <hi>full Cry</hi> so swiftly, that a Horse must be compell'd to run <hi>up</hi> and <hi>down hill</hi> without any <hi>intermission; leaping</hi> Hedg, Ditch, and Dale, nay often <hi>crossing Rivers,</hi> to the great <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>Rider,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Horse.</hi> So that in my opinion tis altogether <hi>improper</hi> to put a <hi>young</hi> Horse to such <hi>violent</hi> labour at the first, till by <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> he hath been made acquainted with <hi>hard service.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now besides the <hi>swiftness</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of this Chase, and the danger of <hi>cracking</hi> his <hi>Wind,</hi> and <hi>burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his <hi>Belly;</hi> besides the <hi>straining</hi> of his <hi>Limbs</hi> by such desperate Riding, and the creating in a young Horse a <hi>loathsomness</hi> to his <hi>Labour,</hi> by undergoing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100171:260"/>
such violent and unusual service; the <hi>seasons</hi> for these Chases begining about <hi>Midsummer,</hi> and ending about <hi>Holy-Rood-tide,</hi> which is that part of the year in which the Sun's <hi>heat</hi> is <hi>excessive,</hi> and so scorches the <hi>Earth,</hi> that a <hi>violent</hi> Chase would hazard the <hi>melting</hi> his <hi>Grease</hi> and the <hi>weight</hi> of the Rider, by reason of the <hi>hardness</hi> of the Ground, would occasion <hi>Foundring, Splents,</hi> and <hi>Windgalls,</hi> insomuch that in <hi>short</hi> time the Horse would prove altogether <hi>vseless.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here I cannot but desire to be rightly <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,</hi> since tho I <hi>object</hi> against these Chases as <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> for <hi>young</hi> Horses, yet I do not mean that Horses should be <hi>excluded</hi> this <hi>Recreation;</hi> but I would have those which are imploy'd herein, to be Horses of <hi>stay'd years,</hi> and by long practice and experience have been rightly <hi>train'd</hi> to Hunting. <q>Young Horses (as the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>New castle</hi> says) being as subject to Diseases as <hi>young Children,</hi> and therefore he advises any man that would buy a Horse for <hi>use</hi> in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occasions, as for <hi>Journeys, Hawking</hi> or <hi>Hunting,</hi> never to buy a Horse until the <hi>Mark be out of his Mouth,</hi> and if he be <hi>sound</hi> of Wind, Limb, and Sight, he will last you <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Nine</hi> years with good keeping, and never fail you; and therefore (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues he I am always ready to buy for such purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses an <hi>old Nag,</hi> of some <hi>Huntsman,</hi> or <hi>Falconer,</hi> that is sound, and that is the useful Nag, for he gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops on <hi>all Grounds, leaps</hi> over Hedges and Ditches; and this will not <hi>fail</hi> you in your Journey, nor anywhere, and is the only Nag of use for Pleasure or Journey</q>  Thus far the <hi>Duke.</hi> And if it may be permitted to add to his Advice, I would have them <hi>strait-bodied clean-timbred Nags,</hi> such as may be <hi>light, nimble,</hi> and of <hi>middle stature,</hi> for those Horses are not near so subject to Lamness as those of <hi>bulk</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100171:260"/>
                     <hi>strength,</hi> the causes whereof have been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd.</p>
                  <p>The next <hi>Chase</hi> propos'd was that of the <hi>Fox,</hi> which although it be a Recreation much <hi>in use,</hi> and highly <hi>applauded</hi> by the generality of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry;</hi> yet with submission to their judgment I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could find that <hi>pleasure</hi> in it which has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to me by some of its <hi>Admirers:</hi> and I am sure it is <hi>inconvenient</hi> for the <hi>training</hi> of a <hi>young</hi> Horse, since it is <hi>swift</hi> without respite, and of <hi>long</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, both which, as I have already fhew'd, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastful to him; but the greatest <hi>Inconvenience</hi> that happens to a Horse in this Chase is this; that when a <hi>Fox</hi> is <hi>unkennel'd,</hi> he seldom or never betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a <hi>champion</hi> Countrey, but remains in the strongest <hi>Coverts,</hi> and in the thickest <hi>Woods;</hi> so that a Horse can but <hi>seldom</hi> enjoy the pleasure of <hi>accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> the <hi>Hounds,</hi> without hazarding being <hi>stubb'd,</hi> or other as <hi>dangerous</hi> Accidents. The fittest Horses sor this Chase are Horses of great <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> since this Chase begins at <hi>Christmas,</hi> which is the <hi>worst</hi> time of Riding, and ends at our <hi>Lady-day,</hi> when the Ground is <hi>best</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>next</hi> Chase to be spoken of is the <hi>Ottexs,</hi> which although it may seem <hi>delightful</hi> to some, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any means think it <hi>convenient</hi> for a Horse: for he that will truly pursue this <hi>Amphibians</hi> sport, must <hi>often swim</hi> his Horse to the equal <hi>hazard</hi> both of the <hi>Rider</hi> and the <hi>Horse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to conclude with the <hi>last,</hi> and the <hi>best</hi> of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that is the <hi>Hare.</hi> It is in my opinion the most <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> Chase of any whatsoever, and the most <hi>beneficial</hi> for training a <hi>young</hi> Horse. It
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100171:261"/>
is <hi>swift,</hi> and of some <hi>indurance,</hi> like that of the <hi>Fox,</hi> but far more <hi>pleasant</hi> to the Horse, because <hi>Hares</hi> commonly run the <hi>Champion</hi> Country; and the <hi>scent</hi> not being so <hi>hot</hi> as the Foxes, the <hi>Dogs</hi> are <hi>oftner</hi> at <hi>default,</hi> and by that means the Horse has many <hi>Sobbs,</hi> whereby he recovers <hi>Wind,</hi> and regains new <hi>strength.</hi> This Chase begins at <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> and lasts till the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>February.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>best Dogs,</hi> to bring your Horse to <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Wind and Speed, are your <hi>fleet Northern</hi> Hounds; for they, by means of their <hi>hard-running,</hi> will draw him up to that extraordinary <hi>speed,</hi> that he will not have time to <hi>loiter,</hi> and by continual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice will be so <hi>inur'd</hi> and <hi>habituated</hi> to the violence of their Speed, that in a short time he will be able to ride on <hi>all sorts</hi> of <hi>Ground,</hi> and be at such <hi>command</hi> upon the <hi>hand,</hi> that he will <hi>strike</hi> at what <hi>rate</hi> you please, and <hi>three-quarters speed</hi> will be less trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to him than a <hi>Canterbury-gallop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have often thought this one of the <hi>Reasons</hi> why your <hi>Northern Breeders</hi> for the generality <hi>excel</hi> those of the <hi>South;</hi> since certainly the <hi>speed</hi> of their <hi>Hounds</hi> contributes much to the Excellence of their <hi>Horses,</hi> and makes them endure a four mile Course without <hi>Sobbs,</hi> which some Horsemen call <hi>Whole-Running:</hi> but of this more in another place.</p>
                  <p>The time being now come that he may be <hi>hunted,</hi> you shall order him on his days of <hi>Rest</hi> in <hi>all points,</hi> as to his <hi>Dressing,</hi> hours of <hi>Feeding, Watring,</hi> &amp;c. as in the <hi>first Fortnight</hi> afore directed; only since his <hi>Labour</hi> is now to be increas'd, you must endeavour to increase his <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> likewise; and this will be <hi>effected</hi> by adding to his <hi>Oats</hi> a third part
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100171:261"/>
of clean old <hi>Beans</hi> spelted on a Mill, and as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus to allow him <hi>Bread</hi> made after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Take four Pecks of clean old <hi>Beans,</hi> and two Pecks of <hi>Wheat,</hi> and <hi>grind</hi> them together, and <hi>sift</hi> the <hi>meal</hi> thro a Meal-sieve of an indifferent fineness, and <hi>knead</hi> it with <hi>warm water</hi> and good store of <hi>Barm,</hi> and let it lie an hour or more to <hi>swell,</hi> for by that means the Bread will be the <hi>lighter,</hi> and have the easier and quicker <hi>Digestion;</hi> after which being with a <hi>Brake</hi> or any other way exceedingly <hi>well-kneaded,</hi> make it up into great Houshold <hi>Peck-loaves,</hi> which will be a means to avoid <hi>Crust,</hi> and prevent its <hi>drying</hi> too soon; <hi>bake</hi> them <hi>thoroughly,</hi> and let them <hi>stand</hi> a good while in the <hi>Oven</hi> to <hi>soke,</hi> then <hi>draw</hi> them, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>bottoms</hi> upwards let them stand to cool.</p>
                  <p>When your <hi>Bread</hi> is a <hi>day old</hi> you may venture to feed your Horse with it, having first <hi>chipt</hi> away the <hi>Crust;</hi> and sometimes giving him <hi>Bread,</hi> sometimes <hi>Oats,</hi> and now and then <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>spelted Beans,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you find his stomach; you need not <hi>fear</hi> but such Feeding will bring him into as good <hi>condition</hi> as you need desire for <hi>Ordinary Hunting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When your <hi>Bread</hi> is prepar'd, and you <hi>first Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night</hi> expir'd, you must then pitch upon a Day for his first <hi>going abroad</hi> after the <hi>Dogs,</hi> and the <hi>Day before</hi> you <hi>hunt</hi> you must always <hi>order him</hi> after this <hi>manner.</hi> In the morning proceed in your <hi>usual method</hi> as before, only <hi>observe</hi> that day to give him no <hi>Beans,</hi> because they are hard of digestion, but give most of <hi>Bread</hi> if you can draw him on to eat it, because it is more <hi>nourishing</hi> than <hi>Oats;</hi> and after your <hi>Evening Watering,</hi> which ought to be somewhat <hi>earlier</hi> than at other times, give him onely a little <hi>Hay</hi> out of your hand, and no
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100171:262"/>
more till the next day that he <hi>returns</hi> from <hi>Hunting:</hi> and to prevent his <hi>eating</hi> his <hi>Litter,</hi> or any thing else but what you give him, you shall instead of a <hi>Muzzle</hi> put on a <hi>Cavezone</hi> joyn'd to a <hi>headstall</hi> of a Bridle, being lin'd with <hi>double Leather</hi> for fear of <hi>hurting</hi> him, and tying it so <hi>straight</hi> as to hinder his <hi>Eating;</hi> and this will prevent <hi>Sickness</hi> in your Horse, which is incident to some Horses when their <hi>Muzzle</hi> is fet on, notwithstanding the invention of the <hi>Lattice-window,</hi> now adays so much in use; but this way your Horses <hi>Nostrils</hi> are fully at <hi>liberty,</hi> and he will never prove <hi>sick.</hi> But as to his <hi>Corn,</hi> give him his <hi>meals,</hi> both after his <hi>Watering,</hi> and at <hi>nine</hi> a clock, at which time be sure to <hi>litter</hi> him very well, that he may the better take his <hi>Rest,</hi> and leave him for that <hi>Night.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>When the <hi>Hounds</hi> are <hi>unkennell'd,</hi> (which should not be till <hi>Sun-rising</hi>) go into the <hi>Field</hi> along with them, and <hi>rake</hi> your Horse up and down <hi>gently</hi> till a <hi>Hare</hi> be <hi>started;</hi> always observing to let him <hi>smell</hi> to other Horses <hi>Dung,</hi> (if he be desirous of it) which will provoke him to <hi>empty</hi> himself, and let him <hi>stand still</hi> when he does so: and if you meet with any <hi>dead Fog, Rushes,</hi> or such like, ride him upon them, and by <hi>whistling</hi> provoke him to <hi>empty</hi> his <hi>Bladder.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>When that time is expired, and you think it may be <hi>throughout cold,</hi> then come to him, and having <hi>drawn</hi> his <hi>Bridle rubbed</hi> his <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>pick'd</hi> his <hi>Feet</hi> from Durt and Gravel which he may have gather'd abroad, put on his <hi>Coller,</hi> and <hi>sift</hi> him a Quart, or three Pints of <hi>Oates,</hi> and <hi>mix</hi> with them a handful of clean dusted <hi>Hempseed,</hi> and give them to him; but give him not above the <hi>quantity</hi> prescribed, for fear of taking away his <hi>stomack,</hi> which will be very much <hi>weakned</hi> through the <hi>heat</hi> of his <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>want</hi> of <hi>water.</hi> Then remove the <hi>spare-cloth</hi> (if you have not done it before,) for fear of keeping him <hi>hot</hi> too long, and when he has <hi>eaten</hi> his <hi>Corn,</hi> throw a pretty quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Hay</hi> clean dusted, on his <hi>Litter,</hi> and let him <hi>rest</hi> two or three Hours, or there abouts.</p>
                  <p>Whilest you are absent from him, you shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him a good <hi>Mash,</hi> made of half a Peck of <hi>Mault</hi> well ground, and <hi>water</hi> that is boiling <hi>hot,</hi> observing to put no more <hi>water</hi> than your <hi>Mault</hi> will <hi>sweeten,</hi> and your <hi>Horse</hi> will <hi>drink,</hi> and then <hi>stir</hi> them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a <hi>Rudder,</hi> or <hi>stick</hi> and then <hi>cover</hi> it over with cloths, till the water has extracted the <hi>strength</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100171:264"/>
of the <hi>Malt,</hi> which will be evident to your <hi>taste</hi> and <hi>touch,</hi> for twill be almost as <hi>sweet</hi> as <hi>Honey,</hi> and feel <hi>ropy</hi> like <hi>Birdlime;</hi> then when it is <hi>cold,</hi> that you can scarce perceive it to <hi>smoak,</hi> offer it to your Horse, but not <hi>before,</hi> lest the <hi>steam</hi> ascend into his <hi>Nostrils,</hi> and thereby offend him with its <hi>scent;</hi> and when he has drunk the <hi>water,</hi> let him if he please eat the <hi>Malt</hi> also. But if he refuse to <hi>drink,</hi> yet you must give him no other <hi>water</hi> that night, but by placing it in one Corner at the <hi>head</hi> of his <hi>Stall,</hi> in such manner that he may not throw it down, (which you may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by nailing a <hi>Spar</hi> across before the <hi>Bucket</hi>) let it stand by him all <hi>Night,</hi> that he may drink at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>Now you will find this <hi>Mash,</hi> or (as some call it) <hi>Horse-Caudle,</hi> very <hi>beneficial</hi> to your Horse on several Accounts; for it will comfort his <hi>Stomach,</hi> and keep his <hi>Body</hi> in a due temperate <hi>heat</hi> after his days Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it will <hi>cleanse</hi> and <hi>bring away</hi> all manner of <hi>Grease</hi> and gross <hi>humours,</hi> which have been <hi>dissolved</hi> by this Days labour, and the <hi>fume</hi> of the <hi>Malt-grains,</hi> after he has drunk the water, will <hi>disperse</hi> watry <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> which might otherwise <hi>annoy</hi> his <hi>head,</hi> and is allow'd by all Horsemen to be very <hi>advantageous</hi> on that account.</p>
                  <p>When he has eaten his <hi>Mash,</hi> then <hi>strip</hi> him of his <hi>Clothes,</hi> and run him over with your <hi>Curry-comb, French Brush, Hair Patch,</hi> and <hi>Wollen Cloath,</hi> and clothe him up again, and then cleanse his <hi>Legs</hi> as well as his <hi>Body</hi> of all <hi>Dirt</hi> and <hi>Filth</hi> which may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy them, as you have been directed in <hi>Dressing;</hi> then remove him into another <hi>Stall</hi> (that you may not <hi>wet</hi> his <hi>Litter</hi>) and <hi>bathe</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> all over from the <hi>Knees</hi> with warm <hi>Beef-broth,</hi> or, which is better, with a quart of warm <hi>Urine,</hi> in which four Ounces

of <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> hath been dissolv'd; then rub his <hi>Legs dry</hi> as when you came in from <hi>Water,</hi> set him into his <hi>Stall,</hi> and give him a good <hi>Home-feeding</hi> of <hi>Oats,</hi> or <hi>Bread,</hi> (which he likes best) or <hi>both,</hi> and having shook good store of <hi>Litter</hi> under him, that he may rest the better, and thrown him <hi>Hay</hi> enough for all night on it, shut up your <hi>Stable</hi> close, and leave him to his <hi>Rest</hi> till morning.</p>
                  <p>The next <hi>morning</hi> come to him betwixt six and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a <hi>clock,</hi> for that is time enough, because the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings rest</hi> is as pleasant and refreshing to the <hi>Horse</hi> as it is to a <hi>Man,</hi> for then the <hi>meat</hi> being concocted the <hi>sleep</hi> is more sweet, and the <hi>brain</hi> is at that time more thin and pure. If he be <hi>laid</hi> disturb him not, but stay till he rises of his own accord, (and to know this you ought to have a private <hi>peep. hole</hi>) but if he be <hi>risen,</hi> then go to him, and the first thing you must do is to put back his <hi>Dung</hi> from his <hi>Litter,</hi> and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what <hi>Colour</hi> it is of: observe whether it be <hi>greasie,</hi> and <hi>shining outwardly,</hi> and <hi>break</hi> it with your Feet, that you may see whether it be so <hi>inwardly;</hi> for if it be <hi>greasie</hi> and <hi>foul</hi> either within or without, (which you may know by its <hi>outward shining,</hi> and by <hi>spots</hi> like Soap, which will appear <hi>within</hi>) or if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of a <hi>dark brown</hi> colour, and <hi>harder</hi> than it was, it is a sign that your former days <hi>hunting</hi> was <hi>benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> to him, by <hi>dissolving</hi> part of the inward <hi>glut</hi> which was within him; and therefore the next time you hunt you must <hi>increase</hi> his <hi>labour</hi> but a <hi>little.</hi> But if you perceive no such <hi>Symptoms,</hi> but that his <hi>Dung</hi> appears <hi>bright,</hi> and rather <hi>soft</hi> than <hi>hard,</hi> without <hi>grease,</hi> and in a word that it holds the same <hi>pale yellow</hi> colour it did before you hunted him, then tis a sign that days Hunting made no <hi>dissolution,</hi> but that his <hi>Body</hi> remains in the same <hi>state</hi> still, and therefore the next days Hunting you may almost <hi>double</hi> his <hi>Labour.</hi>

                  <p>When you have made these <hi>Remarks</hi> from his <hi>Dung,</hi> you shall then proceed to order him as in his days of <hi>Rest;</hi> that is to say, you shall give him a handful or two of <hi>Oats</hi> before <hi>Water;</hi> then <hi>dress, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, air, feed,</hi> &amp;c. as in the <hi>first Fortnight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as to his <hi>Feeding</hi> you must remember the way I have already <hi>shew'd,</hi> of <hi>changing</hi> his Food; as giving him one while <hi>Bread,</hi> another <hi>Oats,</hi> a third time <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Beans,</hi> which you find he likes best; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving always, that <hi>variety</hi> will <hi>sharpen</hi> his <hi>Appetite.</hi> But <hi>Bread</hi> being his <hi>chief</hi> Food, as being more <hi>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing</hi> and <hi>strong</hi> than the others, you must feed him <hi>often'st</hi> with it.</p>
                  <p>And as in the <hi>first Fortnight</hi> I directed you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his <hi>Digestion,</hi> whether it were <hi>quick</hi> or <hi>slow,</hi> so likewise must you do now that he begins to <hi>eat Bread.</hi> If you find him <hi>quick,</hi> and that he retains his <hi>Bread</hi> but a <hi>little while,</hi> then (as I have already directed) you shall only <hi>slightly chip</hi> your <hi>Bread;</hi> but if he be <hi>slow,</hi> and retains it <hi>long, cut away</hi> all the <hi>Crust,</hi> and give it to some other Horse, and feed your Hunter only with the <hi>Crum;</hi> for that being <hi>light</hi> of Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion soon converts to <hi>Chyle</hi> and <hi>Excrements,</hi> but the <hi>Crust</hi> being <hi>slow</hi> of Digestion requires by reason of its <hi>hardness</hi> longer time before it be <hi>concocted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>next day</hi> after he has <hi>rested,</hi> you shall <hi>hunt</hi> him again as you did the <hi>first</hi> day, observing from the <hi>Remarks</hi> you have made, to hunt him <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you find the <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>constitution</hi> of your Horse; and when you are <hi>return'd home,</hi> observe to put in Practice the same <hi>Rules</hi> which you have just now read; and thus hunt your Horse <hi>three times</hi> a <hi>week</hi> for a <hi>fortnight</hi> together, observing to give him his <hi>full feeding,</hi> and no other <hi>Scowrings</hi> but <hi>Mashes,</hi> and <hi>Hempseed,</hi> which is <hi>equal</hi> in its Vertue to the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>

                  <p>And here before I conclude this <hi>Chapter,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice of the <hi>Abuse</hi> of <hi>Scowrings,</hi> and my <hi>own Ignorance,</hi> being led away by the <hi>perswasions</hi> and my mistaken <hi>opinion</hi> of other mens <hi>Skill,</hi> who because they could talk of giving a <hi>Scowring,</hi> (tho Experience has since taught me, that they never <hi>knew</hi> the <hi>Operation</hi> of them, nay nor the <hi>Disposition</hi> of the <hi>Horses</hi> which they kept) I thought most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and skilful <hi>Horse-Doctors.</hi> But indeed I found to my <hi>Cost,</hi> that my Ignorance led me into the same <hi>mistake</hi> with those men, that take <hi>Physick</hi> by way of <hi>Prevention,</hi> and by that means render their <hi>Bodies</hi> more <hi>lyable</hi> to <hi>Diseases,</hi> their <hi>Pores</hi> being so much <hi>opened</hi> by <hi>Physick.</hi> In like manner I found that tho I bought <hi>Horses</hi> of <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>strong</hi> Constitutions, yet by following the false <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of <hi>Others</hi> I quickly brought them to weak <hi>habits</hi> of Body; and by continually using them to unnecessary <hi>Physick,</hi> to be <hi>tender,</hi> and apt to take <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Surfeits</hi> on every small occasion: which taught me to know, that as <hi>Kitchen Physick</hi> is best for a <hi>Man,</hi> (unless he <hi>languish</hi> under some more than ordinary <hi>Distemper</hi>) so <hi>natural</hi> and true <hi>sound Feeding</hi> is best for a <hi>Horse,</hi> it strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his <hi>Constitution,</hi> and keeping his Body in good <hi>temper;</hi> for a Horse that is <hi>full-fed</hi> with good natural Diet is not subject to <hi>costivencss;</hi> and from hence I infer, that a Horse which is <hi>sound,</hi> and in <hi>health,</hi> and of a <hi>strong</hi> Constitution, needs little <hi>Physick</hi> more than good <hi>wholsom meat,</hi> and his <hi>fill</hi> of it, provided you order him as he ought to be when he is come from Hunting.</p>
                  <p>But as <hi>Horses</hi> no more than <hi>Men</hi> are free from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>When your Horse is <hi>set</hi> over night, and <hi>fed</hi> early in the morning, (as in the <hi>last</hi> Fortnights Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Hunting was directed) then go into the <hi>Field</hi> with him, and when your Horse is <hi>empty,</hi> as he will be by that time you have <hi>started</hi> your <hi>Game,</hi> you shall <hi>follow</hi> the Dogs at a good <hi>round rate,</hi> as at <hi>half-speed,</hi>

But if your <hi>Sport</hi> has been so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as not to <hi>sweat</hi> your Horse thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then you shall make a <hi>Train-sent</hi> of Four Miles long, or thereabout, and laying on your <hi>Fleetest Dogs, ride</hi> it <hi>briskly,</hi> and then having first <hi>cool'd</hi> him in the <hi>Field, ride</hi> him <hi>home</hi> and use him as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Now that I may not leave you in ignorance what a <hi>Train-scent</hi> is, I shall acquaint you that it has its Name, as I suppose, from the <hi>manner</hi> of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>trailing</hi> or <hi>dragging</hi> of a <hi>dead Cat,</hi> or <hi>Fox,</hi> (and in case of Necessity a <hi>Red-Herring</hi>) three or four Miles, (according to the Will of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or the Directions given him) and then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dogs on the <hi>scent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this <hi>Caveat</hi> let me give all Huntsmen, to to keep about two or three <hi>Couple</hi> of the <hi>fleetest</hi> Hounds you can possibly procure for this purpose <hi>only.</hi> For although I have seen skillful <hi>Sportsmen</hi> use their <hi>Harriers</hi> in this Case, for their diversion;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100171:267"/>
yet I would perswade them not to use them to it <hi>often;</hi> for it will teach them to <hi>lie off</hi> the <hi>Line,</hi> and <hi>fling</hi> so <hi>wide,</hi> that they will never be worth any thing.</p>
                  <p>When you <hi>unbridle</hi> your Horse, give him instead of <hi>Hempsecd</hi> and <hi>Oates,</hi> a handsome quantity of <hi>Rye bread,</hi> (to which end I would advise you to bake a Peck Loaf for this purpose) which being <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moist</hi> will assist in <hi>cooling</hi> his body after his Labour, and prevent <hi>Costiveness,</hi> to which you will find him addicted, then give him Hay, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a <hi>Mash,</hi> and then order him in all points as formerly.</p>
                  <p>The next morning if you perceive by his <hi>Dung</hi> that his Body is <hi>distempred,</hi> and he is <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>bound,</hi> then take some <hi>Crumms</hi> of your <hi>Rye-bread</hi> and work it with as much sweet fresh <hi>Butter</hi> as will make it into Paste, and then making it into Balls about the bigness of a large <hi>Wallnut,</hi> give him 5 or 6 of them in the morning <hi>fasting;</hi> and then setting on your Saddle upon his Cloth, <hi>mount</hi> him, and <hi>gallop</hi> him <hi>gently</hi> in some adjoyning <hi>grass-Plat,</hi> or <hi>Close</hi> till he begin to <hi>sweat</hi> under his <hi>Eares,</hi> then lead him into the <hi>Stable,</hi> and let him be well rub'd, and throwing a spare Cloth over him, and good store of fresh Litter under him, let him <hi>stand</hi> two hours <hi>on</hi> the <hi>Bridle,</hi> then give him a quantity of <hi>Rye-bread,</hi> then throw him some <hi>Hay</hi> to chew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after that get him another warm <hi>Mash,</hi> and then feed him with <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Corn</hi> as much as he will, and be sure to allow him what Hay he will eat. The next day water him <hi>abroad,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as in his daies of <hi>rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day <hi>following</hi> Hunt him again, but by no
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100171:267"/>
meanes so <hi>severely</hi> as you did the time before till the <hi>Afternoon,</hi> but then ride him after the Dogs <hi>briskly,</hi> and if that does not make him <hi>sweat throghly</hi> make another <hi>Train-scent,</hi> and follow the Dogs three quarters speed, that he may sweat <hi>heartily.</hi> When you have a little cooled him, have him <hi>home,</hi> and upon his first entrance into the <hi>Stable</hi> give him two or three <hi>Balls</hi> as big as Wallnuts, of this most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Scowring; viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Butter</hi> four Ounces, <hi>Lenitive Electuary</hi> two Ounces, <hi>Gromell Broom</hi> and <hi>Parsly seeds,</hi> of each one Ounce, <hi>Aniseeds, Liquorish</hi> and Cream of <hi>Tartar,</hi> of each half an Ounce, <hi>Jallap</hi> an Ounce make the <hi>Seeds</hi> into <hi>Powder,</hi> and stir them into a <hi>Paste,</hi> with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary and the Butter; knead it well, and keep it close in a Pot for use.</p>
                  <p>As soon as you have given your Horse these <hi>Balls rub</hi> him <hi>dry,</hi> then dress him and <hi>cloath</hi> him up warm and let him stand two or three hours on the <hi>Snaffle,</hi> then give him two or three handfulls of <hi>Rye-bread,</hi> and order him as you did before as to <hi>Hay Provinder, Mash &amp;c.</hi> and so leave him till the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then come to him and first observe his <hi>Dung</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it keep the true Colour, or whether it appear <hi>dark,</hi> or <hi>black,</hi> or <hi>red</hi> and <hi>high</hi> coloured; next whether it be <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>thin,</hi> or <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>dry.</hi> If it be of the right colour I mean <hi>Pale yellow</hi> tis a sign of <hi>health, strength</hi> and <hi>cleanness;</hi> if it be <hi>dark,</hi> or <hi>black,</hi> then tis a sign there is <hi>Grease</hi> and other ill <hi>humours</hi> stirred up which are not yet evacuated: if it be <hi>red</hi> and <hi>high</hi> coloured, then tis a token that his <hi>Blood</hi> is <hi>Feaverish</hi> and distempered through inward heat: if it be <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>thin,</hi> tis a sign of <hi>Weakness,</hi> but if <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> it shews the horse to be <hi>hot inwardly,</hi> or else that he is a <hi>foul feeder:</hi> But if his <hi>dung</hi> carry a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100171:268"/>
                     <hi>medium</hi> betwixt <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>soft,</hi> and smell <hi>strong,</hi> tis a sign of <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Vigour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When these Observations have been taken notice of concerning his <hi>Dung,</hi> then you shall <hi>feed, dress, water, &amp;c.</hi> as in his former days of <hi>Rest;</hi> observing always to give <hi>variety,</hi> and his belly full of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Bread.</hi> The next have him abroad in the Field again, but by no means put him to any <hi>labour,</hi> further than to <hi>rake</hi> him from hill to hill after the <hi>Dogs,</hi> to keep him within sound of their <hi>Cry;</hi> for the design of this Day's <hi>Exercise</hi> is only to keep him in <hi>breath,</hi> and get him an <hi>Appetite.</hi> Observe as you ride, that you let him <hi>stand</hi> still to <hi>dung;</hi> and <hi>look back</hi> on it that you may draw Inferences from the <hi>Faeces.</hi> When the Day is well nigh <hi>spent</hi> bring him home without the least <hi>sweat,</hi> and order him as at <hi>other</hi> times, only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to give no <hi>Scourings,</hi> nor <hi>Rye-bread.</hi> You may if you please <hi>water</hi> your Horse this day, both at your going into the <hi>Field</hi> and at your coming <hi>Home,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to <hi>gallop</hi> after it, to <hi>warm</hi> the <hi>water</hi> in his Belly. The next is a day of <hi>Rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>same manner</hi> in every respect as you have <hi>spent</hi> this <hi>Week</hi> you must spend the next <hi>likewise,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration in any point; and by that time assure your self that your Horse will be <hi>drawn clean</hi> enough for any ordinary <hi>Hunting;</hi> so that afterward observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>hunt</hi> your Horse moderately <hi>twice</hi> or <hi>thrice</hi> a week, according to your own <hi>pleasure,</hi> and the <hi>constitution</hi> of your Horses body, you need not question but to have him in as good <hi>state</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> as you would desire, without danger of his <hi>Wind, Eye-sight, Feet,</hi> or <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when you have thus according to <hi>art</hi> drawn your Horse <hi>clean,</hi> you will perceive those <hi>signs</hi> which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100171:268"/>
I told you of, verified; for his <hi>Flesh</hi> on his <hi>short Ribs</hi> and <hi>Buttocks</hi> will be as <hi>hard</hi> as a <hi>Board,</hi> his <hi>Flank</hi> will be <hi>thin,</hi> and nothing to be <hi>felt</hi> but a <hi>double skin,</hi> and <hi>chaps</hi> so clean from <hi>Fat, Glut</hi> or <hi>Kernels,</hi> that you may <hi>hide</hi> your <hi>Fists</hi> in them; and above all his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi> will give plain Demonstration of the <hi>Truth</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> for he will run <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Miles three quarters speed without <hi>sweating,</hi> or scarce <hi>blowing,</hi> I say when this is <hi>perfected,</hi> you must avoid all <hi>scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> after hunting, (because Nature has nothing to work on) but <hi>Rye-bread</hi> and a <hi>Mash,</hi> except your Horse be now and then troubled with some little <hi>Poze</hi> in the Head; and then you shall bruise a little <hi>Mustard seed</hi> in a fine linnen <hi>Rag,</hi> and <hi>steep</hi> it in a quart of strong <hi>Ale</hi> for three or four hours, and then untying the Rag <hi>mix</hi> the <hi>Mustard-seed</hi> and the <hi>Ale</hi> with a quarter of a Peck of <hi>Oats,</hi> and give it your Horse.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, when your Horse is <hi>drawn clean,</hi> you must beware that he <hi>grows</hi> not <hi>foul</hi> again thro <hi>want</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Airing,</hi> or <hi>Hunting,</hi> or any other <hi>Negligence,</hi> lest by that <hi>means</hi> you procure to your self and your Horse double <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> and no <hi>thanks</hi> from your <hi>Master.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of making a Hunting-Match, its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and disadvantages.</head>
                  <p>SInce many <hi>Persons of Honour</hi> delight in good Horses, both for <hi>Hunters</hi> as well as <hi>Gallopers,</hi> it may not be improper to speak a word in this place concerning the <hi>Advantages</hi> or <hi>Disadvantages</hi> which happen in making of <hi>Hunting-Matches;</hi> since he that proceeds cautiously and upon truegrounds in <hi>match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his Horse is already in a great measure sure of gaining the Prize, at least if the Proverb be true, that <hi>a Match well made is half won.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> thing to be <hi>consider'd</hi> by him that designs to <hi>match</hi> his Horse, for his own <hi>advantage</hi> and his Horses <hi>credit,</hi> is this; That he do not <hi>flatter</hi> himself in the opinion of his Horse, by <hi>fancying</hi> that he is swifter than the <hi>wind,</hi> when he is but a <hi>slow Galloper;</hi> and that he is <hi>whole-running,</hi> (that is, will run <hi>four miles</hi> without a <hi>sobb</hi> at the <hi>height</hi> of his <hi>speed</hi>) when he is not able to run a <hi>mile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the ground of this Error I suppose arises from a Gentleman's being mistaken in the <hi>speed</hi> of his <hi>Hounds,</hi> who for want of <hi>Tryal</hi> against other <hi>Dogs</hi> that have been really <hi>fleet,</hi> has suppos'd his own to be <hi>swist,</hi> when in reality they were but of <hi>middle speed;</hi> and because his Horse (when trained) was able to follow them <hi>all day,</hi> and at any hour to <hi>command</hi> them upon, <hi>deep</hi> as well as <hi>light</hi> Earths, has therefore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100171:269"/>
falsly concluded him to be <hi>swift</hi> as the <hi>best;</hi> but upon tryal against a Horse that has been <hi>rightly</hi> train'd after Hounds that were <hi>truly fleet,</hi> has to his <hi>cost</hi> bought his <hi>Experience,</hi> and been convinc'd of his <hi>Error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore I would perswade all <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Hunters</hi> to get two or three Couple of <hi>try'd Hounds,</hi> and <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice</hi> a week to follow after them a <hi>Train-scent;</hi> and when he is able to <hi>top</hi> them on all <hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> and to endure <hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>Colds</hi> stoutly, then he may the better relie on his <hi>Speed</hi> and <hi>Toughness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Horse which is able to ride a <hi>Hare-chase</hi> of five or six miles briskly, and with good courage, till his <hi>body</hi> be as it were bath'd in <hi>sweat;</hi> and then upon the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>Hare,</hi> in a nipping <hi>frosty</hi> morning can endure to <hi>stand still,</hi> till the <hi>sweat</hi> be <hi>frozen</hi> on his <hi>back,</hi> so that the <hi>cold</hi> may <hi>pierce</hi> him as well as the <hi>heat;</hi> and then even in that extremity of Cold to ride another <hi>Chase,</hi> as <hi>briskly</hi> and with as much <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> as he did in the <hi>former:</hi> That Horse which can thus endure <hi>heats</hi> and <hi>colds</hi> oftenest is of most <hi>value</hi> amongst <hi>Sports-men.</hi> And indeed tis not every Horse that is able to endure such extraordinary <hi>Toyl;</hi> and I my self have seen very <hi>brave</hi> Horses to the <hi>Eye,</hi> that have rid the <hi>first Chase</hi> to admiration, that when the <hi>Cold</hi> had struck to them, and they began to grow <hi>stiff,</hi> have <hi>flagg'd</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> and given <hi>quite out</hi> the <hi>third</hi> Heat.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to make a judgment of the goodness of your own Horse, observe him after the <hi>death</hi> of the first <hi>Hare,</hi> if the <hi>Chase</hi> has been any thing <hi>brisk;</hi> if when he is <hi>cold,</hi> he <hi>shrinks</hi> up his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>draws</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> up together, tis an infallible token of <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Courage;</hi> and the same you may collect from the <hi>slackning</hi> of his <hi>Girths</hi> after the first Chase, and from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100171:270"/>
the <hi>setting</hi> of his <hi>Teeth,</hi> and the <hi>dulness</hi> of his <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> all which are true <hi>marks</hi> of <hi>Faintness,</hi> and <hi>Tyring:</hi> and therefore there is no <hi>reliance</hi> on such a Horse, in case of a <hi>Wager.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if on the <hi>contrary,</hi> you are Master of a Horse (not only in your own <hi>judgment,</hi> but in the <hi>opinion</hi> of <hi>knowing</hi> Horsemen) that is <hi>approv'd</hi> for <hi>Speed,</hi> and <hi>Toughness,</hi> and you are desirous to <hi>match</hi> him, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to <hi>run</hi> for a <hi>'Plate;</hi> I will to the best of my power tell you the <hi>advantages</hi> that are to be <hi>gain'd</hi> in <hi>Matching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I enter upon the <hi>subject</hi> propos'd, I think it convenient to tell you the way our <hi>Ancestors</hi> had of making their <hi>Matches,</hi> and our <hi>modern</hi> way of deciding <hi>Wagers.</hi> First then the <hi>old way</hi> of Tryal was by running so many <hi>Train-scents</hi> after Hounds, as was agreed on between the <hi>parties</hi> concern'd and a Bell-Court, this being found not so <hi>uncertain</hi> and more <hi>durable</hi> than <hi>Hare-hunting,</hi> and the <hi>advantage</hi> consisted in having the <hi>Trains</hi> led on <hi>Earth</hi> most <hi>sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> of the Horses. Now others chose to <hi>hunt</hi> the <hi>Hare</hi> till such an <hi>hour</hi> prefix'd, and then to run the <hi>Wild-goose-Chase,</hi> which, because it is not known to all <hi>Huntsmen,</hi> I shall explain the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of it</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Wildgoose Chase</hi> received its <hi>Name</hi> from the manner of the <hi>flight</hi> which is made by <hi>Wildgeese,</hi> which is generally <hi>one after another:</hi> so the two Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses after the running of Twelvescore <hi>Yards,</hi> had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which Horse soever could get the <hi>leading,</hi> to <hi>ride</hi> what <hi>ground</hi> he pleas'd; the <hi>hindmost</hi> Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound to <hi>follow</hi> him, within a certain <hi>distance</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on by Articles, or else to be <hi>whipt</hi> up by the <hi>Triers</hi> or <hi>Judges</hi> which rode by, and which ever Horse could <hi>distance</hi> the other won the <hi>Match.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:100171:270"/>
                  <p>But this <hi>Chase</hi> was found by Experience so <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> aud so <hi>destructive</hi> to good <hi>Horses,</hi> especially when two <hi>good</hi> Horses were match'd; for <hi>neither</hi> being able to <hi>distance</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> till ready both to <hi>sink</hi> under their <hi>Riders</hi> through Weakness, oftentimes the <hi>Match</hi> was fain to be <hi>drawn,</hi> and left <hi>undecided,</hi> tho both the Horses were quite <hi>spoyl'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This brought them to run <hi>Trainscents,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was chang'd to <hi>three Heats,</hi> and a <hi>straight</hi> Course; and that the <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Hunting-horses</hi> might be encourag'd to keep <hi>good Ones, Plates</hi> have been <hi>erected</hi> in many places of this Land, purposely for <hi>Hunters,</hi> and some their <hi>Articles</hi> exclude all others, (namely <hi>Gallopers</hi>) from <hi>Running.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whether you design to <hi>match</hi> your Horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any <hi>One</hi> Horse in particular, or to put him in for a <hi>Plate,</hi> where he must run against <hi>all that come</hi> in general; yet tis necessary that you know the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>disposition</hi> of your Horse, before you venture any <hi>wager</hi> on his head; that is to say, whether he be <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>fiery,</hi> or <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>temperate</hi> in Riding; whether he be very <hi>swift,</hi> but not <hi>hard at bottom,</hi> or <hi>slow,</hi> but yet <hi>sure,</hi> and one that will <hi>stick at mark;</hi> on what <hi>sort</hi> of <hi>Earths</hi> he most <hi>delights</hi> to gallop on, whether to <hi>climb</hi> or <hi>run down</hi> hills, or else to <hi>skelp</hi> on a <hi>Flat;</hi> whether to run on <hi>deep,</hi> or <hi>light Grounds;</hi> whether on <hi>rack-ways,</hi> or Carpet-ground; whether amongst <hi>Mole-hills,</hi> or on <hi>Meadow</hi> ground; whether he be well-winded, or <hi>thick</hi> wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so that tho he will answer a <hi>Spur,</hi> and mend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lapping,</hi> yet he must have ease by <hi>Sobs.</hi> All these things must be known, to the end that you may draw those <hi>advantages</hi> from them which may be offer'd in <hi>matching;</hi> as this for Example.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:100171:271"/>
                  <p>If your Horse be <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>fiery,</hi> tis odds but he is <hi>fleet</hi> withall (for generally those Horses are so) and and delights to run upon <hi>light</hi> and <hi>hard flats;</hi> and must be held <hi>hard</hi> by the Rider that he may have time to recover <hi>Wind</hi> by <hi>Sobbs;</hi> or else his <hi>Fury</hi> will choak him. But whereas it is the general opinion that nothing that is <hi>violent</hi> can be <hi>lasting;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it is impossible that such hot mettled Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses can be <hi>tough</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> at bottom. this I conceive may be but a popular Errour; for I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times seen by Art those two Qualities reconciled, at least so far, as to make the most <hi>Fiery Horse</hi> managa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to endure both <hi>Whip</hi> and <hi>Spur;</hi> and then tho he should not prove at bottom so <hi>truly tough</hi> as the <hi>craving Drudge,</hi> yet by his Riders management his <hi>Speed</hi> shall answer it in all points and serve in its <hi>stead;</hi> But to return to my Subject..</p>
                  <p>The best way to <hi>Match</hi> such a Horse is to agree to run <hi>Train-scents</hi> and the fewer the <hi>better</hi> for you, before you come to the <hi>Course:</hi> Also in these <hi>Train-scents</hi> the <hi>shorter</hi> you make your <hi>distance</hi> the <hi>better:</hi> and above all things be sure agree to have the leading of the first <hi>Trayn,</hi> and then making choice of such grounds as your Horse may best shew his <hi>Speed,</hi> and the <hi>Flectest Doggs</hi> you can procure, give your <hi>Hounds</hi> as much <hi>Law</hi> before you, as your <hi>Tryers</hi> will allow, and then making a loose try to win the <hi>Match</hi> with a <hi>Wind;</hi> but if you faile in this attempt then <hi>Beare</hi> your Horse, and save him for the <hi>Course</hi> at last.</p>
                  <p>But if your Horse be <hi>slow,</hi> yet <hi>well Winded,</hi> and a <hi>true Spurr'd Nagg;</hi> then the more <hi>Trainscents</hi> you run before you come to run the <hi>straight Course</hi> the better. Observing here too, to gain the leading of the first <hi>Train,</hi> which in this case you must lead it upon such <hi>deep Earths</hi> that it may not end near any <hi>light Ground.</hi> For this is the <hi>Rule</hi> received among
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100171:271"/>
                     <hi>Horsemen</hi> that the next <hi>Train</hi> is to <hi>begin</hi> where the <hi>last ends,</hi> and the last train is to be ended at the <hi>start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Post</hi> of the Course. Therefore observe to end your <hi>last</hi> on deep Earths as well as the <hi>first.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place have a care of making a <hi>Match</hi> of a <hi>suddain,</hi> and in <hi>Drink,</hi> for fear least you <hi>repent</hi> when you are <hi>Sober.</hi> Neither make a match against a Horse, which you do not <hi>know,</hi> without first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting some skilfull or trusty <hi>Friend,</hi> on whose <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> you can safely rely, and who is able to give a good <hi>Account</hi> of your <hi>Adversaries</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se's <hi>Speed</hi> and his manner of Riding; and if you find him any ways correspondent to your own in <hi>speed</hi> or <hi>goodness</hi> be not too <hi>Peremptory</hi> to venture, but upon some reasonable probabilities of <hi>Winning:</hi> for tis neither <hi>Braggs</hi> nor <hi>Fancy</hi> that will make your Horse run one jot the <hi>better,</hi> or your Adversarys the <hi>worse:</hi> and remember this, that there is no Horse so <hi>good,</hi> but there may be another as <hi>good;</hi> and then if you proceed on good <hi>Grounds,</hi> and true <hi>Judgment,</hi> you may be the bolder to go on, and stand to your <hi>Match,</hi> notwithstanding the opinion of other men may be against you.</p>
                  <p>One material <hi>Advise</hi> I had like to have forgot and that is this; be sure at no time give <hi>advantage</hi> of <hi>Weight,</hi> for you will find the <hi>inconvenience</hi> of it at the latter <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Day:</hi> for tho a Horse <hi>seel</hi> it not when he is <hi>fresh,</hi> yet it will <hi>sink</hi> him very much when he grows <hi>weak</hi> a <hi>Horse-length</hi> lost by odds of <hi>Weight</hi> in the first <hi>Train,</hi> may prove a <hi>distance</hi> in the streight <hi>Course</hi> at <hi>last;</hi> sor the <hi>Weight</hi> is the same every <hi>Heat</hi> tho his <hi>strength</hi> be not.</p>
                  <p>But if on the other side you gain any advantage of <hi>Weight,</hi> article that the <hi>Horseman</hi> shall ride so much <hi>weight</hi> as you are agreed on, <hi>besides</hi> the <hi>Saddle,</hi> for by this means the <hi>Rider</hi> (if he be not weight of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100171:272"/>
him self) must carry the <hi>dead weight</hi> somewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, which will be troublesome to the <hi>Rider</hi> as well as the <hi>Horse;</hi> and the more to the <hi>latter,</hi> since tis more remote from his <hi>Back</hi> then if it were in the <hi>Saddle,</hi> and by consequence will more disorder his <hi>stroke</hi> if the Rider <hi>incline</hi> to either <hi>side</hi> then if it were nearer the <hi>Center;</hi> as you may see by a pair of <hi>Scales,</hi> where if the <hi>Pin</hi> be not placed exactly in the midst of the <hi>Beam,</hi> the <hi>longest</hi> part (as being most distant from the Center) will be the <hi>heaviest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as to the time that you take for dyeting, that must be according to the <hi>Nature</hi> of your Horse, and the present <hi>state</hi> of Body he is in; for tho he may be clean enough for ordinary <hi>Hunting,</hi> yet he may be far distant from that perfect State of Body, that is required in a <hi>Match,</hi> and to keep him in such strict <hi>Dyet</hi> all the <hi>Season,</hi> (except on such extraordinary Occasions) would be an <hi>unnecessary</hi> Expence.</p>
                  <p>As to your Horses <hi>Disposition</hi> for <hi>Running,</hi> you must know it by use and <hi>Observation,</hi> for in this Point Horses very much differ, for some run best when they are <hi>high</hi> in <hi>case,</hi> others when they are in <hi>middle Condition</hi> of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and some again when they appear to the Eye <hi>Poor,</hi> and <hi>Low</hi> in Flesh; there fore according to your Horses <hi>Nature,</hi> and the time required to bring him into his <hi>best State,</hi> you must order your day for the tryal of your <hi>Match</hi> to be.</p>
                  <p>But if you design to put him in for some <hi>Hunting Plate;</hi> there neither the <hi>choice</hi> of your <hi>Ground,</hi> the <hi>Weight,</hi> nor the <hi>Horses</hi> you are to run against are at your <hi>disposal,</hi> but you must take them as you find them; only the time for bringing your Horse into a good <hi>Condition</hi> is at your own <hi>discretion,</hi> since you may begin as soon or as late as you please to keep him in strict <hi>Dyet,</hi> the time for all <hi>Plates</hi> being usually <hi>fixt,</hi> and annually the same.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Ordering the Hunter, for a Match or a Plate.</head>
                  <p>WHen you have either <hi>Matcht</hi> your Horse, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained thoughts of putting him in for a <hi>Plate,</hi> you must consider that you ought to reserve a Month at the least, to draw his Body perfectly <hi>clean,</hi> and to refine his <hi>Wind</hi> to that degree of <hi>perfection</hi> which Art is capable of <hi>attaining</hi> to.</p>
                  <p>First then you must take an exact view of the <hi>State</hi> of his Body; both <hi>outwardly</hi> and <hi>inwardly</hi> as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be <hi>low</hi> or <hi>high</hi> in <hi>Flesh,</hi> or whether he be <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>Heavy</hi> when abroad, and this occasioned through too much <hi>hard riding,</hi> or through some <hi>Grease</hi> that by hunting has been <hi>dissolved,</hi> but for want of a scowring has not been <hi>removed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he appear <hi>sluggish</hi> and <hi>Melancholy</hi> from either of these causes; than give him half an Ounce of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente</hi> in a pint of good old <hi>Malligo Sack,</hi> which will both <hi>cleanse</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>revive</hi> his <hi>Spirits:</hi> and then for the first week you shall <hi>feed</hi> him continually with <hi>Bread, Oats</hi> and <hi>Split Beans,</hi> giving him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>one</hi> and sometimes the <hi>other,</hi> according as he likes, always leaving some in his <hi>Locker</hi> to eat at his own leisure when you are absent; and when you return at your Hours of <hi>Feeding</hi> to take away what is left, and to give him <hi>fresh</hi> till you have made him <hi>wanton</hi> and <hi>playfull.</hi> To which end you shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that though you ride him every day <hi>morning</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:100171:273"/>
and <hi>evening</hi> on <hi>Airing,</hi> and every other day on <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> yet you are not to <hi>sweat</hi> him, or put him to any violent <hi>Labour,</hi> the design this week being to keep him in <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Breath,</hi> and to prevent <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you are to observe that both your <hi>Oats, Beans</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> are to be now ordered after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then you did before, for first you must dry your <hi>Oats</hi> well in the <hi>Sun,</hi> then put them into a clean, <hi>Bag</hi> and <hi>beat</hi> them soundly with a Flail or Cudgel, till you think they are <hi>hulled;</hi> then take them out of the bagg and <hi>winnow</hi> them clean both from hulls and dust and so give them to your Horse as you have occasion. Your <hi>Beans</hi> in like manner must be separated from the <hi>hulls</hi> which are apt to breed <hi>Glut,</hi> and must either be thrown away or given amongst chaf to some more ordinary Horse. And for your <hi>Bread</hi> whereas before you only <hi>chipt</hi> it, now you must cut the <hi>Crust clean</hi> away, and dispose of it as you please; for tis <hi>hard</hi> of <hi>digestion,</hi> and will be apt to <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>dry</hi> his Body. And now that you are to put him into <hi>stricter keeping,</hi> you are to make a <hi>finer</hi> sort of Bread then before, as thus;</p>
                  <p>Take two Pecks of <hi>Beans,</hi> and two of <hi>Wheat,</hi> and <hi>grind</hi> them together, but not too <hi>fine,</hi> to prevent too much <hi>Bran</hi> being in the Bread; and <hi>dress</hi> one Peck of the <hi>Meal</hi> through a fine <hi>Range,</hi> and knead it up with new <hi>Ale-Barm,</hi> and the <hi>Whites</hi> of a dozen new layd <hi>Eggs,</hi> and so <hi>bake</hi> it in a <hi>Loaf</hi> by it self, and the rest dress through a <hi>Boulter,</hi> and knead it only with <hi>Ale</hi> and <hi>Barm;</hi> and use it in all other points as the former: Now the <hi>Peck-loaf</hi> is to be given your Horse when you <hi>set</hi> him, and the other at <hi>ordinary</hi> times.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Bread</hi> assists. <hi>Nature</hi> much in increasing the <hi>Strength, Courage</hi> and <hi>Wind</hi> of your Horse; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100171:273"/>
you add thereto (as I have always told you) <hi>true Labour,</hi> as any Bread whatsoever; nay even as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of M. <hi>De-Greys</hi> sorts of Bread, which he mentions in his <hi>Compleat Horseman 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> p. 232. ed. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                     </hi> especially his <hi>last,</hi> which he says <hi>is better Bread, and a greater Cooler;</hi> and which he prescribes to make thus, <q>Take <hi>Wheat Meal</hi> one Peck, <hi>Rye-meal, Beans</hi> and <hi>Oat-meal,</hi> all ground very small, of each half a Peck, <hi>Aniseeds,</hi> and <hi>Licorish,</hi> of each one Ounce, <hi>White Sugar-Candy</hi> four Ounces all in fine <hi>Powder,</hi> the <hi>yolks</hi> and <hi>whites</hi> of Twenty <hi>Eggs</hi> well beaten, and so much <hi>VVhite-wine</hi> as will knead it into a <hi>Paste,</hi> make this into great <hi>Loaves,</hi> bake them well, and after they be two or three days old, let him eat of this Bread, but chip away the <hi>Out side.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Reason why I have cited this is, because I have heard several (who would be thought know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Horsemen) applaud this very <hi>Bread</hi> beyond any other to be met with in any Book, tho for my part I can find nothing <hi>excellent</hi> in the whole <hi>Composition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first <hi>Oat-meal</hi> tho it be strong, yet it is a dry grain, <hi>hard</hi> of <hi>digestion,</hi> and a great <hi>dryer up of the Blood.</hi> The <hi>Wheat</hi> is of a drying quality likewise, tho it be light; for the <hi>Aniseed</hi> and <hi>Licorish,</hi> they are not only <hi>Physical</hi> but <hi>hot</hi> also; so that the Body becomes <hi>over heated,</hi> and thereby <hi>costive.</hi> And yet these People will not be <hi>perswaded,</hi> but these <hi>Drugs</hi> will make him <hi>long-winded;</hi> possibly they might assist him in <hi>Neighing,</hi> as some men say it doth <hi>Songsters</hi> in <hi>Vocal Musick,</hi> wherein there is no <hi>Exercise</hi> of the Body used; but where <hi>bodily strength</hi> is required, I am apt to believe it more <hi>prejudicial</hi> than <hi>profitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here some will <hi>object</hi> that there is <hi>Rye</hi> and <hi>Beanes</hi> both which are <hi>moistning;</hi> especially the <hi>Rye</hi> which is both <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moyst,</hi> and is the very reason <hi>DeGrey</hi> himself gives why he put <hi>Rye</hi> into his latter
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100171:274"/>
Bread, because (says he) <hi>Rye</hi> is a <hi>Loosner</hi> and a <hi>Cooler,</hi> and therefore it will make the Horse more <hi>soluble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already said, that if his <hi>Body</hi> have <hi>Feeding</hi> proportionate to his <hi>Labour,</hi> the Horse will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in a right state of <hi>Health.</hi> Yet since he is <hi>hot</hi> by Nature, and <hi>Labour</hi> might increase his natural <hi>Heat,</hi> and render him <hi>costive,</hi> therefore I have all along prescribd him <hi>Rye-bread</hi> alone as <hi>Physical.</hi> But here let the Horse be in what condition soever, whether <hi>bound</hi> in his body or <hi>laxative,</hi> yet <hi>Rye</hi> being a part of your Bread, your Horse must <hi>continually</hi> feed thereon, which has this undeniable <hi>disadvantage,</hi> that if he be <hi>loose</hi> in his <hi>body,</hi> this <hi>Bread</hi> (to use <hi>de Grey's</hi> own words) will make him more <hi>soluble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now whilst I am discoursing of <hi>Horsebread,</hi> I cannot but <hi>condemn</hi> another <hi>curiosity</hi> in some <hi>Feeders,</hi> who think, by dressing their <hi>Meal</hi> to the utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Fineness</hi> they do <hi>wonders,</hi> and that such <hi>pure Food</hi> must of necessity bring him to the <hi>greatest perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> imaginable both of Body and Wind.</p>
                  <p>But in this point I think they are deceiv'd, for the <hi>Meal</hi> being dress'd so very <hi>fine,</hi> nothing remains but the <hi>quintessence</hi> of it; which tho it be lightned by <hi>Barm</hi> and <hi>Whites of Eggs,</hi> yet when it is above a day old twill begin to <hi>harden,</hi> (as may be observ'd by <hi>Manchet</hi>) and especially if <hi>Oatmeal</hi> be in it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its <hi>drying quality,</hi> whereby it will not be so <hi>easie</hi> of <hi>digestion</hi> as it would be otherwise if it had no <hi>Bran</hi> in it; and by consequence will be more apt to <hi>oppress</hi> his Stomach, if he be <hi>heated,</hi> before it be throughly <hi>digested,</hi> and so breed raw <hi>crudities,</hi> and an <hi>inflammation</hi> of the <hi>blood,</hi> and by that means ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a <hi>Surfeit,</hi> than which nothing can be of worse consequence to a <hi>Horse</hi> that is <hi>match'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:100171:274"/>
                  <p>And therefore tis that I advise, that your <hi>Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> should only be made of <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Beans,</hi> and that it should not be <hi>dress'd</hi> too <hi>fine,</hi> nor too <hi>course,</hi> but so, as that there may be neither so <hi>much</hi> Bran left as to <hi>annoy</hi> the <hi>blood,</hi> nor so <hi>little</hi> as to make your Bread too <hi>close</hi> and <hi>solid;</hi> but you may leave some on purpose to <hi>scowr</hi> the <hi>Maw,</hi> and further your Horses <hi>Digestion.</hi> And thus much by way of Digression.</p>
                  <p>Having spoken to the <hi>first</hi> condition of Horses which we propos'd, viz. <hi>melancholly,</hi> and <hi>low in flesh,</hi> we are now to speak of those which are <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> which if your Horse be so, that when you lead him out of the Stable he will <hi>leap</hi> and <hi>play</hi> about you, then you must not only avoid giving him the <hi>Scowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> last mention'd of <hi>Sack</hi> and <hi>Diapente,</hi> but any other whatsoever: for there being no foul <hi>Humours,</hi> or any <hi>superfluous matter</hi> left in his body for the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> to work on, it will <hi>prey</hi> upon the <hi>strength</hi> of his body, and by that means <hi>weaken</hi> it, which it must be your utmost endeavour to <hi>preserve</hi> by full <hi>Feeding</hi> and <hi>sound Labour,</hi> which will necessarily produce a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Wind,</hi> which is the Support of <hi>Strength,</hi> for when his <hi>Wind</hi> once fails, his <hi>Strength</hi> avails nothing.</p>
                  <p>As to the manner of it, if your Horse be ingag'd in a <hi>Hunting-match,</hi> you shall <hi>sweat</hi> him twice this week, but not by <hi>hunting</hi> him after the <hi>Hare,</hi> as formerly, but by <hi>Train-scents,</hi> since the <hi>former</hi> on this Occasion may prove <hi>deceitful;</hi> for tho the <hi>Hounds</hi> be very <hi>swift,</hi> yet the <hi>Scent</hi> being <hi>cold</hi> the <hi>Dogs</hi> will often be at <hi>fault,</hi> and by that means the Horse will have many <hi>Sobs,</hi> so that when he comes to run <hi>Train-scents</hi> in earnest your Horse will look for <hi>case,</hi> his <hi>Wind</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not so perfect as in Art it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>Therefore lead your <hi>Train-scents</hi> with a <hi>dead Cat</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:100171:275"/>
over such <hi>Grounds</hi> as you are likely to <hi>run on</hi> and <hi>best agrees</hi> with yous Horses <hi>Humour,</hi> and be sure make choice of the <hi>Fleetest</hi> hounds you can get, and then your Horse will be kept up to the <hi>hight</hi> of his <hi>speed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Number of <hi>Train-scents</hi> that you are to <hi>ride</hi> at a time, I hat you must order according to your <hi>Match,</hi> or (which is better) according to your Horse's <hi>strength,</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> for performing his <hi>Heats.</hi> For if you <hi>labour</hi> him beyond his <hi>strength,</hi> twill take him off his <hi>speed,</hi> weaken his <hi>Limbs,</hi> and daunt his <hi>Spirit.</hi> If you give him <hi>too little</hi> Exercise, it will give oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for <hi>pursiveness</hi> and ill <hi>humours,</hi> as <hi>Glut,</hi> &amp;c. to increase in him, and gain in him a <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that when he comes to be put to labour above his <hi>usual rate,</hi> he will grow <hi>restiff,</hi> and <hi>settle</hi> like a <hi>Jade,</hi> either of which will redound to your <hi>discredit,</hi> and therefore it must be from your own <hi>knowledge</hi> in the <hi>state</hi> of his Body, and not from any <hi>general Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in writing, that you must steer your Course.</p>
                  <p>Only this <hi>Direction</hi> may be given you, that if you are to run <hi>Eight Train-scents</hi> and the <hi>straight Course,</hi> more or less, you are to put him to such <hi>severe labour</hi> not above <hi>twice</hi> in your whole <hi>Months</hi> keeping; and and if it be in the first <hi>Fortnight,</hi> twill be the better, for then he will have a <hi>compleat Fortnight</hi> to recover his <hi>strength</hi> again; and for his <hi>labour</hi> in his last <hi>Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,</hi> let it be <hi>proportionate</hi> to his <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>wind,</hi> as sometimes <hi>half</hi> his Task, and then <hi>three</hi> parts of it. Only observe that the <hi>last</hi> Tryal you make in the <hi>first Fortnight</hi> be a Train-scent <hi>more</hi> than your <hi>Match,</hi> for by that means you will find what he is <hi>able</hi> to do. And for the <hi>proportion</hi> of his Exercise, <hi>twice</hi> a week (as I have already said) is sufficient to keep him in <hi>breath,</hi> and yet will not diminish or injure his <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if your <hi>Hunting-match</hi> be to run <hi>sewer</hi> Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100171:275"/>
then you may put him to his <hi>whole Task</hi> the oftner, according as you find him in condition; only observe that you are not to <hi>strain</hi> him for <hi>Ten daies</hi> at least before he <hi>ride</hi> his <hi>Match,</hi> that he may be led into the <hi>Field</hi> in perfect <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>vigour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you intend him for a <hi>Plate,</hi> let him take his <hi>Heats</hi> according to this <hi>Direction,</hi> only let it be on the <hi>Place,</hi> that he may be <hi>acquainted</hi> with the <hi>Ground;</hi> and as for the <hi>Hounds</hi> you may <hi>omit</hi> them, as not being <hi>ty'd</hi> to their <hi>speed,</hi> but that of your <hi>Adversaries</hi> Horse's. But as to your <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Heats,</hi> let them be according to what the <hi>Articles</hi> exact; only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that as to the <hi>sharpness</hi> of them, they must be <hi>regulated</hi> according to the <hi>temper</hi> of his <hi>strength,</hi> and the <hi>purity</hi> of his <hi>Wind.</hi> And when you <hi>heat</hi> him provide some Horses upon the <hi>Course</hi> to <hi>run at him,</hi> which will <hi>quicken</hi> his <hi>spirits,</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> him, when he finds he can <hi>command</hi> them at his pleasure. And here too the same <hi>Rule</hi> must be <hi>observed,</hi> not to give your Horse a <hi>Bloody heat</hi> for <hi>Ten daies</hi> or a <hi>Fortnight</hi> before the <hi>Plate</hi> be to be run for: And let his <hi>last heat</hi> which you give him before the day of <hi>Tryal</hi> be in all his <hi>Cloathes,</hi> and just <hi>skelp</hi> it over; which will make him run the next time much more <hi>vigorously,</hi> when he shall be <hi>stript naked,</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>cold Air</hi> pierce him.</p>
                  <p>But now that I am speaking of <hi>sweating,</hi> it may be expected that I should lay down some <hi>Rules</hi> how to order a Horse that is in <hi>keeping</hi> for a <hi>Match</hi> in <hi>Frosty weather,</hi> or in case he be an <hi>old strain'd Horse,</hi> so that you dare not <hi>heat</hi> him in <hi>hard weather,</hi> for fear of <hi>Lameing</hi> him a fresh.</p>
                  <p>In these cases some Horsemen have practic'd <hi>sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their Horse in the <hi>House,</hi> by laying on him multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>Cloathes,</hi> being first made <hi>hot</hi> at the Fire; which is the most <hi>unnatural</hi> way of <hi>sweating</hi> a Horse
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100171:276"/>
that can be, since 'tis <hi>provok'd</hi> by heat arising from the <hi>outward parts,</hi> and is too <hi>violent,</hi> the extreamity of the <hi>heat</hi> joyn'd to the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>Cloathes,</hi> not only <hi>weakning,</hi> but almost <hi>smothering</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>The next way in use, is to give him his Heat <hi>ahroad,</hi> as I just now mention'd in his <hi>Cloathes,</hi> but this too is not so <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>kindly,</hi> as without his Cloathes, since here too the <hi>heat</hi> is augmented from <hi>without,</hi> and consequently abates his <hi>strength</hi> the more, and yet doth not altogether so well improve his Wind.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if either you have a Horse that has been <hi>strain'd,</hi> or otherwise the <hi>weather</hi> be <hi>unseasonable,</hi> find out some <hi>dead Jog,</hi> or <hi>sandy way,</hi> though of but <hi>half</hi> a <hi>Miles</hi> length, and there <hi>breath</hi> your horse till he <hi>sweat</hi> as you would have him. I remember to have heard of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> having <hi>match'd</hi> his horse for a very <hi>considerable summ;</hi> and the weather proving <hi>hard,</hi> took this <hi>course</hi> to keep his horse in <hi>breath;</hi> he caused <hi>Straw,</hi> and <hi>foul Litter</hi> to be <hi>spread</hi> all along <hi>round</hi> an adjoyning <hi>Close,</hi> and every <hi>morning</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnats <hi>shook</hi> it up and <hi>turn'd</hi> it, to keep it <hi>hollow</hi> and <hi>soft,</hi> and then the Horse was had forth to <hi>gallop</hi> on it after his Water, and by this meanes kept his Horse in <hi>tollerable</hi> Wind.</p>
                  <p>Now during this <hi>Month</hi> both on his <hi>Resting-daies,</hi> and after his <hi>sweats</hi> on <hi>Heating-daies,</hi> you are to observe the same <hi>Rules</hi> which you were taught in the <hi>first week</hi> of your <hi>Third Fortnights</hi> Keeping; only you are to omit all <hi>scourings,</hi> but <hi>Rye-bread</hi> and <hi>Mashes;</hi> since your Horse being in so <hi>perfect a state</hi> of Body has no need of any. Only if you think there may be any occasion, and that your Horse prove <hi>Thirsty,</hi> about <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Nine</hi> a Clock at <hi>Night</hi> you may give him this <hi>Tulip</hi> to, <hi>cool</hi> him and <hi>quench</hi> his <hi>Thirst.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Barly-water</hi> Two Quarts: of <hi>Syrrup</hi> of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi> 3 Ounces, of Syrrup of <hi>Lemmons</hi> 2 Ounces, mix
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100171:276"/>
them together, and give them to your Horse to <hi>drink;</hi> if he refuse, <hi>fasten</hi> it from falling as you did the <hi>Mash,</hi> and so let it <hi>stand</hi> by him all <hi>Night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the last <hi>Fortnight,</hi> you must not only <hi>dry</hi> your <hi>Oats,</hi> and <hi>hull</hi> them by <hi>beating,</hi> but likewise take half a Strike of Oats and <hi>wash</hi> them in the <hi>Whites</hi> of a dozen or twenty <hi>Eggs,</hi> and stirring them therein let them <hi>soke</hi> all Night; then the next Morning take them and <hi>spread</hi> them abroad in the <hi>Sun,</hi> till they be as <hi>dry</hi> as at first, and so give them to your Horse, and when they are spent prepare more in the <hi>same</hi> manner. This Food is <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Digestion,</hi> and very <hi>sovereign</hi> for his <hi>Wind.</hi>
                  </p>

And likewise if you find him inclin'd to <hi>costiveness</hi> forget not to <hi>relieve</hi> Nature by giving him Oats <hi>wash'd</hi> in two or three <hi>Whites</hi> of <hi>Eggs</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi> beat together; for that, as I have told you already, will <hi>cool</hi> his Body, and keep it <hi>moist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the <hi>last</hi> Week omit giving him a <hi>Mash,</hi> only give the <hi>Barly-water</hi> as before; but as to <hi>Hay</hi> let him have as much as he will <hi>eat</hi> (which will not be much, if he have his <hi>fill</hi> of better food) till a day <hi>before</hi> he is to ride his <hi>Match,</hi> but then you must hold your hand, that he may have time to <hi>digest</hi> that which he has <hi>eaten,</hi> and then and not before you may <hi>muzzle</hi> him with your <hi>Cavezone;</hi> and be sure that <hi>day,</hi> and so till the <hi>morning</hi> he is led out, to <hi>feed</hi> him as much as <hi>possible,</hi> for such a days Labour will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire something to maintain <hi>strength.</hi> Therefore in the Morning, an hour before you are to <hi>lead out,</hi> give him a <hi>Tost</hi> or two of <hi>White-bread</hi> steept in <hi>Sack.</hi> which will revive his <hi>Spirits,</hi> and so lead him into the <hi>Field.</hi>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:100171:277"/>
                  <p>But if you are to run for a <hi>Plate,</hi> which usually is not till <hi>three</hi> a clock in the <hi>After-noon,</hi> then by all means have him out <hi>early</hi> in the morning to <hi>air,</hi> that he may <hi>empty</hi> his Body, and when he is come in from Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feed him with <hi>Tosts</hi> in <hi>Sack;</hi> for you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that as too much <hi>fulness</hi> will endanger his <hi>wind,</hi> so too long <hi>fasting</hi> will cause <hi>faintness.</hi> When he has <hi>eaten</hi> what you think <hi>fit</hi> to give him, put on his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezone,</hi> and then having <hi>chaf'd</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> soundly with <hi>Piece-grease</hi> and <hi>Brandy</hi> warm'd together, or <hi>Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oyl,</hi> (which ought likewise to be us'd <hi>daily</hi> at Noon for a <hi>Week,</hi> before the <hi>Match,</hi> or <hi>longer</hi> if you see cause,) shake up his <hi>Litter,</hi> and shutting up your <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> close, and preventing any <hi>Noise</hi> to be made near him, leave him to his <hi>Rest</hi> till the <hi>hour</hi> come that he is to go into the <hi>Field.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP IX.</hi> Of the Means to judge of your Horses State of Body, and of curing all Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties that may happen after Matching.</head>
                  <p>THere are several <hi>Observations</hi> to be made by you during your <hi>Dieting</hi> your Horse, which if you <hi>miscarry</hi> in, may be the <hi>loss</hi> of your <hi>Match,</hi> or your <hi>share</hi> in the <hi>Plate.</hi> Therefore, that you may know how to proceed <hi>regularly</hi> in this <hi>Art,</hi> I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>summe</hi> them <hi>up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First then you are to observe his <hi>Chaule,</hi> his <hi>Ribs,</hi> and his <hi>Flank,</hi> according to the Rules formerly laid down; for if he be <hi>clean within,</hi> he will also be <hi>clean there;</hi> but yet he may feel clean <hi>there,</hi> when he is not clean <hi>within;</hi> and therefore those <hi>Grooms</hi> are very <hi>conceited,</hi> who upon their <hi>first view</hi> of a Horse and <hi>handling</hi> of his <hi>Flank,</hi> pronounce him to be in a <hi>true state</hi> of Body; for gentle <hi>Airing,</hi> warm <hi>Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> scanty <hi>Feeding,</hi> may <hi>disperse</hi> the gross <hi>Fat</hi> and <hi>Glut,</hi> and drive it from the <hi>outward</hi> parts, so that he may <hi>appear</hi> clean, when in reality he is <hi>not</hi> so: and therefore you are only a <hi>competent Judg,</hi> who know how he was cleansed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore you are to observe, first, whether in <hi>all points</hi> you have proceeded according to <hi>Art</hi> in his <hi>Training;</hi> as whether he performs his <hi>Heats</hi> with <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi> and true <hi>courage,</hi> whether he have been all along <hi>home-fed,</hi> whether you have not suffer'd <hi>pursiveness</hi> to increase by <hi>too little</hi> labour, or abated his Flesh and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100171:278"/>
                     <hi>strength</hi> by <hi>too much.</hi> These things are the very <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>Keeping,</hi> and therefore ought to be <hi>scan'd</hi> and <hi>consider'd</hi> with <hi>judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next you are to observe his manner of <hi>Feeding,</hi> as whether he holds his <hi>Appetite</hi> or no; and observe what sort of <hi>Food</hi> he likes <hi>best,</hi> and of that give him <hi>oftenest;</hi> and in case his <hi>stomach</hi> abate, keep him out <hi>longer</hi> Morning and Night, at his <hi>airings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner you must observe his <hi>Dung,</hi> which tho it be as fallacious oftentimes as a <hi>Sick-man's Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> it being liable to <hi>alteration</hi> on the <hi>change</hi> of <hi>Dyet,</hi> or being <hi>influene'd</hi> by the <hi>air,</hi> yet being <hi>clean</hi> and in <hi>health</hi> it will usually be a <hi>pale yellow</hi> colour, and be voided in <hi>round Pellets;</hi> but if it be <hi>loose,</hi> and <hi>soft,</hi> it is an <hi>infallible</hi> sign of <hi>weakness,</hi> and therefore must by <hi>good Feeding</hi> be remedied as soon as possible. But if it be <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> so that he cannot dung but with <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>straining,</hi> then you must endeavour to <hi>relieve</hi> Nature, but not with <hi>scowrings,</hi> which would <hi>weaken</hi> too much, but rather chuse to give him this <hi>Glister,</hi> which will both cool and refresh him.</p>
                  <p>Take a Quart of <hi>Whey,</hi> of Syrrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> and <hi>Pulpe</hi> of <hi>Cassia,</hi> of each Four Ounces and of <hi>Manna</hi> half an Ounce; this will <hi>Purge</hi> him gently, and is most excellent to <hi>cool</hi> his Bowels.</p>
                  <p>The next thing to be considered is <hi>Lamness,</hi> which if it proceed from <hi>old strains</hi> you must make use of this <hi>Oyntment,</hi> which I have several times experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with good <hi>success.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take fresh <hi>Butter,</hi> Oyle of <hi>Bayes, Dialthea,</hi> and <hi>Turpentine</hi> of each Two Ounces, <hi>mix</hi> and <hi>boyle</hi> them together on a <hi>soft fire,</hi> and when they are well <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated,</hi> as hot as the Horse can suffer it, <hi>annoint</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:100171:278"/>
the Horse <hi>twice</hi> a day, and give him <hi>exercise,</hi> by <hi>Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> him abroad Morning and Evening a <hi>foot pace,</hi> and you will find it a certain <hi>Remedy</hi> for any <hi>Strain</hi> in the <hi>Shoulder, Clap</hi> on the <hi>back sinews,</hi> or any <hi>grief</hi> what soever, that proceeds from <hi>Strains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if you only fear <hi>Lameness</hi> from <hi>Old Strains,</hi> then you must be careful that your <hi>Exercise</hi> be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and alwaies when you come in from Water and his <hi>Legs</hi> are <hi>rub'd</hi> dry, <hi>annoint</hi> them with such supple <hi>Oyntments,</hi> as are accounted good for the <hi>Limbs,</hi> as <hi>Linseed, Train, Sheepsfoot, Neatsfoot, Nerve-Oyle</hi> and the like; all which may be used on his daies of <hi>Rest,</hi> but on his <hi>heating</hi> daies <hi>Urine</hi> and <hi>Salt-Peter.</hi> Some Horsemen make use of <hi>Brandie</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> Oyl mix'd, and <hi>bathe</hi> his <hi>Legs,</hi> and afterwards <hi>heat it in</hi> with a hot Iron, and commend it as the best thing for the <hi>Limbs</hi> of an <hi>Old stiff</hi> Horse.</p>
                  <p>But if your Horse through <hi>Negligence,</hi> or any <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualtie</hi> happen to have the <hi>Grease</hi> fall into his <hi>Heels,</hi> you must endeavour ro remove it by a good <hi>sound heat,</hi> and a <hi>scowring</hi> after it, and apply to his <hi>Legs</hi> this <hi>Poultiss.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Honey</hi> a Pound, of <hi>Turpentine, common Gum, Meal of Linseed,</hi> and the Meal of <hi>Fenugreek,</hi> of each 4 Ounces, and the Powder of <hi>Bay-berries</hi> well search'd 3 Ounces, <hi>mix</hi> and <hi>boyle</hi> all these well together; then take it <hi>off,</hi> and put to it a Pint of <hi>White-wine,</hi> then boyle it <hi>again,</hi> till it be very <hi>thick:</hi> and with this, as hot as the Horse can suffer it, lap his <hi>legs</hi> about <hi>Plai ster-wise,</hi> and <hi>renew</hi> it only <hi>once</hi> in <hi>three daies,</hi> and it will certainly bring his Legs within compass.</p>
                  <p>If your Horses <hi>Feet</hi> be <hi>bad,</hi> either <hi>surbated,</hi> or <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> then instead of <hi>Cow-dung,</hi> you may stop them with <hi>blew-clay</hi> and <hi>Vinegor</hi> temperd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100171:279"/>
and on his Heating-daies at Night stop them with <hi>grey-sope,</hi> and keep it in with a peice of an old Shoo-sole.</p>
                  <p>If your Horse be troubled with any <hi>Dose</hi> in his head give him <hi>Mustard-seed</hi> amongst his <hi>Provender,</hi> but if it be a <hi>worse</hi> Cold, which you will perceive by his <hi>Ratling,</hi> then give him this <hi>Lambitive,</hi> or <hi>Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Treacle,</hi> each half a Pound, having mixt these together, add to them Powder of <hi>Comminseed, Liquorish, Bay-berries, Anniseeds,</hi> each an Ounce, mix all these together, and put them to the <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Treakle,</hi> which will make it of a thick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. If your horse hath a <hi>Cold,</hi> instead of his <hi>Oates</hi> before Water, give him the quantity of a <hi>Walnut</hi> of this <hi>Lambitive</hi> on the top of a <hi>stick</hi> or in a <hi>Spoon,</hi> and let him <hi>lick</hi> it off; and the same do after <hi>Airing,</hi> when first you come in, and you will find the <hi>advantage</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>These at present are all the <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> that I can call to mind, which are <hi>lyable</hi> to <hi>Hunters,</hi> or <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopers</hi> in their <hi>Keeping;</hi> and tho through <hi>inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> or want of memory I should have <hi>omitted</hi> any, yet from these <hi>Grounds,</hi> you may form your <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> for any common <hi>Accident</hi> or <hi>Distemper;</hi> and now that we draw near to the <hi>Match-day,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Discourse,</hi> we will only discuss some few <hi>Rules</hi> relating to the <hi>Tryal</hi> of the <hi>Hunting Match.</hi> I mean Rules to be observed in <hi>Riding,</hi> and so <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of riding a Hunting-Match, or Heats for a Plate, and the Advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to each.</head>
                  <p>I Have endeavoured to shew the Necessity and the Manner of <hi>Training</hi> and <hi>Dieting</hi> Horses, but this alone is not sufficient to the <hi>winning</hi> of either <hi>Match</hi> or <hi>Plate</hi> without a <hi>knowing</hi> and an <hi>honest Rider,</hi> and a <hi>skilful Judge</hi> or <hi>Tryer</hi> be joyn'd thereto; but since no man is fitter to <hi>ride</hi> the Horse than he that has the <hi>training</hi> of him, I shall lay down some <hi>general Rules</hi> how to <hi>ride</hi> to the best Advantage either a <hi>Hunting-Match,</hi> or three <hi>Heats</hi> and a <hi>Course</hi> for a Plate.</p>
                  <p>The first Requisite in a <hi>Rider,</hi> next to <hi>faithfulness</hi> in his <hi>Trust,</hi> is to have a good <hi>close Seat,</hi> his <hi>Knees</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held firm to his <hi>Saddle-skirts,</hi> his <hi>Toes</hi> turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and his <hi>Spurs</hi> outward from the Horses sides, his <hi>left</hi> hand governing his Horses <hi>Mouth,</hi> and his <hi>right</hi> commanding his <hi>Whip;</hi> observing during all the Tryal throughout to sit <hi>firm</hi> in his <hi>Saddle,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>waving,</hi> or <hi>standing up</hi> in his <hi>Stirrops,</hi> which very much <hi>incommodes</hi> the Horse, notwithstanding the conceited Opinion of some <hi>Jockeys</hi> that it is a <hi>becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Seat.</p>
                  <p>When you <hi>spur</hi> your Horse, <hi>strike</hi> him not hard with the <hi>Calves</hi> of your Legs, as if you would

beat the wind out of his body, bust iust turn your Toes <hi>outwards,</hi> and bring the Spurs <hi>quick</hi> to his sides; and such a <hi>sharp stroke</hi> will be more serviceable to the <hi>quickning</hi> of your Horse, and sooner <hi>draw blood.</hi> Be sure not to <hi>spur</hi> your Horse but when there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and avoid spurring him under the <hi>fore bowels,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and his <hi>Girths</hi> near the <hi>Heart</hi> (which is the tend'rest place) till the last <hi>Extremity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you <hi>whip</hi> your Horse let it be over the <hi>shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> on the <hi>near</hi> side, except upon <hi>hard running,</hi> and when you are <hi>at all;</hi> then be sure with a <hi>strong jerk</hi> to strike your Horse in the <hi>Flank,</hi> for there the <hi>skin</hi> is <hi>tender'st,</hi> and most <hi>sensible</hi> of the <hi>Lash.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe when you <hi>whip</hi> or <hi>spur</hi> your Horse, and that you are certain he is at the <hi>top</hi> of his <hi>speed,</hi> if then he clap his <hi>Ears</hi> in his <hi>Pole,</hi> or <hi>whisk</hi> his <hi>Tail,</hi> be sure that you <hi>bear him hard,</hi> and give him as much <hi>comfort</hi> as ever you can, by <hi>sawing</hi> his <hi>Snaffle to</hi> and <hi>fro</hi> in his Mouth, and by that means <hi>forcing</hi> him to <hi>open</hi> his <hi>Mouth,</hi> which will <hi>comfort</hi> him, and give him <hi>wind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be any <hi>high wind</hi> stirring when you <hi>ride,</hi> observe if it be in your <hi>Face</hi> to let your Adversary <hi>lead,</hi> and to hold hard <hi>behind</hi> him till you see your opportunity of giving a <hi>Loose;</hi> yet you must observe to ride so <hi>close</hi> to him, that his Horse may <hi>break</hi> the <hi>Wind</hi> from yours, and that you by <hi>stooping</hi> low in your <hi>Seat</hi> may <hi>shelter</hi> your self under him, which will assist the strength of your Horse. But if the <hi>Wind</hi> be in your <hi>Back,</hi> ride <hi>exactly</hi> behind him, that your Horse may alone enjoy the benefit of the <hi>Wind,</hi> by being as it were <hi>blown forward,</hi> and by breaking it from him as much as you can possible.</p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100171:280"/>
                  <p>Next observe what <hi>Ground</hi> your Horse <hi>delights</hi> to <hi>run</hi> best on, <hi>bearing</hi> your Horse (as much as your Adversary will give you leave) on <hi>level Carpet-ground,</hi> because your Horse naturally will be desirous to <hi>spend</hi> himself more <hi>freely</hi> thereon. But on <hi>deep Earths</hi> &amp;c. give him more <hi>liberty,</hi> because he will naturally <hi>favour</hi> himself thereupon. Be sure, if you are to run <hi>up hill,</hi> to <hi>favour</hi> your Horse and <hi>bear him,</hi> for fear of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him out of wind; but <hi>down hill,</hi> (if your Horses <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Shoulders</hi> will endure it, and you dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your own <hi>Neck</hi>) always give him a <hi>Loose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only take this for a <hi>general</hi> Rule, that if you find your Horse to have the <hi>Heels</hi> of the other, that then you be careful to <hi>preserve</hi> his Speed till the last <hi>Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,</hi> if you are not to run a straight <hi>Course,</hi> but if so, then till the <hi>Course,</hi> &amp; so to husband it then too, that you may be able to <hi>make a Push for it</hi> at the last <hi>Post.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next you are to observe the nature of your <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites</hi> Horse, and if he be <hi>fiery,</hi> then to run just <hi>behind,</hi> or just <hi>cheek by joul,</hi> and with your <hi>Whip</hi> make as much noise as you can, that you may force him on <hi>faster</hi> then his Rider would have him, and by that means <hi>Spend him</hi> the sooner. Or else keep just <hi>before</hi> him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a <hi>slow Gallop,</hi> that he may either <hi>over reach</hi> or by treading on your Horses <hi>Heels</hi> (if he will not take the <hi>leading</hi>) endanger falling over.</p>
                  <p>Observe on what ground the <hi>contrary</hi> Horse runs <hi>worst</hi> and on that <hi>Earth</hi> be sure to give a <hi>loose</hi> that your <hi>Adversaries</hi> being forced to <hi>follow</hi> you, may haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard <hi>stumbling,</hi> or <hi>clapping</hi> on the <hi>back Sinnws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe likewise in your <hi>Riding</hi> the several <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Corrections</hi> of the <hi>Hand</hi> the <hi>Whip</hi> and the <hi>Spur,</hi> and <hi>when</hi> and how <hi>often</hi> he makes <hi>use</hi> of them; and when you perceive that his Horse begins to be <hi>blown</hi> by any of the former <hi>Synptoms,</hi> as <hi>Whisking</hi> his <hi>Tail,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100171:281"/>
clapping down</hi> his <hi>Ears, holding</hi> out his <hi>Nose</hi> like a <hi>Pig &amp;c.</hi> you may then take it for granted that he is at the top of what he can do; therefore in this case observe how your <hi>own</hi> rides, and if he run <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> and <hi>strongly</hi> without <hi>Spurring,</hi> then be sure keep your <hi>Adversary</hi> to the same <hi>speed</hi> without giving him <hi>ease</hi> and by that means you will quickly bring him to <hi>give out,</hi> or else <hi>distance</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>Observe at the <hi>End</hi> of every <hi>Train-sent</hi> what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> the other Horse is in; and how he <hi>holds</hi> out in his <hi>Labour;</hi> which you may be able to give a <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of by his <hi>Looks,</hi> the <hi>Working</hi> of his <hi>Flank,</hi> and the <hi>slackness</hi> of his <hi>Girths.</hi> For if he look <hi>dull</hi> tis a sign his <hi>Spirits sail</hi> him; if his <hi>Flanks</hi> beat much, tis a token that his <hi>Wind</hi> begins to <hi>fail</hi> him, and then of necessiity his <hi>Strength</hi> must too. If his <hi>Wind</hi> fail him, then his <hi>Body</hi> will grow <hi>thin</hi> and appear <hi>tuckt up,</hi> which will make his <hi>Girths</hi> appear <hi>slack</hi> to the Eye. And therefore take this for a <hi>Rule</hi> that there is no <hi>greater</hi> Sign of <hi>Weakness</hi> then this which I have last <hi>mentioned;</hi> so that if your <hi>Adversaries</hi> Horse want <hi>girting</hi> after the <hi>first Scent,</hi> provided he were <hi>close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt</hi> at his first <hi>starting,</hi> you need not much <hi>dispair</hi> of <hi>winning</hi> your Wager.</p>
                  <p>When each <hi>Train-scent</hi> is ended (and so likewise after every <hi>Heat</hi> for a Plate) you must have <hi>dry</hi> Straw, and <hi>dry</hi> Cloaths both <hi>Linnen</hi> and <hi>Woollen</hi> which have been <hi>steep'd</hi> in <hi>Urine</hi> and <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> a day, or two, and then dryed in the <hi>Sun;</hi> and likewise one, or two of each which have been so <hi>steeped,</hi> must be brought <hi>wet</hi> into the <hi>Field;</hi> and after the <hi>Train</hi> is ended you must have two or three <hi>Helpers,</hi> and after your <hi>Groom</hi> has with a <hi>Knife of Heat</hi> (as the D. of <hi>New-Castle</hi> calls it) which is an old piece of a <hi>Sword blade,</hi> scrapt off all the <hi>Sweat</hi> from your Horses <hi>Neck, Body &amp;c.</hi> you must see that they first with Straw, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100171:281"/>
then with their <hi>dry Cloaths rub</hi> him dry all over, whilst others are employed about his <hi>Leggs;</hi> and as soon as they are rub'd <hi>dry</hi> then <hi>chafe</hi> them with your <hi>wet</hi> cloaths, and never give over till you are called by the <hi>Judges</hi> to <hi>start</hi> again. This will keep his Joynts <hi>plyant</hi> and <hi>nimble,</hi> and prevent any <hi>inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> which might arise from any <hi>old Strain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing to be considered is the <hi>Judges,</hi> or <hi>Tryers</hi> Office, which is to see that all things are <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> according to the <hi>Articles,</hi> which to that end ought to be publickly <hi>read</hi> before the Horses <hi>Start.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next that each <hi>Tryer</hi> on whose side the <hi>Train</hi> is to be led, according to the <hi>Articles</hi> give <hi>directions</hi> for its <hi>leading</hi> according to the advise of the <hi>Rider,</hi> or his <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Disposition</hi> of that Horse on <hi>whose side</hi> he is <hi>Chose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next that each <hi>Tryer</hi> be so advantageously <hi>Mounted,</hi> as to <hi>ride up</hi> behind the Horses, (but not upon them) all day; and to observe that the <hi>Contrary</hi> Horse <hi>ride</hi> his <hi>True-ground,</hi> and observe the <hi>Articles</hi> in every particular, or else not to <hi>permit</hi> him to <hi>proceed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next that after each <hi>Train scent</hi> be <hi>ended,</hi> each <hi>Tryer</hi> look to that Horse <hi>against</hi> whom he is <hi>chosen,</hi> and observe that he be <hi>no ways</hi> reliev'd but with <hi>rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,</hi> except <hi>Liberty</hi> on both sides be given to the <hi>contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, as soon as the <hi>time</hi> which is allow'd for <hi>rubbing</hi> be <hi>expired,</hi> which is generally <hi>half</hi> an hour, they shall <hi>command</hi> them to <hi>mount,</hi> and if either Rider <hi>refuse,</hi> it may be lawful for the other to <hi>start</hi> without him, and having <hi>beat</hi> him the <hi>distance</hi> agreed on, the <hi>Wager</hi> is to be <hi>adjudg'd</hi> on his <hi>side.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, the <hi>Tryers</hi> shall keep off all other <hi>Horses</hi> from <hi>crossing</hi> the <hi>Riders,</hi> or <hi>leading</hi> them; only they themselves may be allow'd to <hi>instruct</hi> the Riders by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100171:282"/>
                     <hi>word</hi> of <hi>mouth</hi> how to <hi>ride,</hi> whether <hi>slow,</hi> or <hi>fast,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Advantages</hi> he perceives may be gain'd by his <hi>Directions</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, if there be any <hi>weight</hi> agreed on, they shall see that <hi>both</hi> Horses bring their <hi>true</hi> weight to the <hi>starting</hi> place, and carry it to the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Train,</hi> on penalty of <hi>losing</hi> the <hi>Wager.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same <hi>Rules</hi> are to be observ'd (especially this <hi>last</hi>) by those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> which are <hi>chosen</hi> to be <hi>Judges</hi> at a <hi>Race</hi> for a <hi>Plate;</hi> onely they usually <hi>stay</hi> in the <hi>Stand,</hi> that they may the <hi>better</hi> see which Horse <hi>wins</hi> the <hi>Heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for <hi>running</hi> for a <hi>Plate,</hi> there are not so many <hi>Observations</hi> to be made, nor more <hi>Directions</hi> requir'd than what have been already mention'd; onely <hi>this,</hi> that if you <hi>know</hi> your Horse to be <hi>tough at bottom,</hi> and that he will <hi>stick at mark,</hi> to ride him each <hi>Heat</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>best</hi> of his <hi>performance,</hi> and <hi>avoid</hi> as much as <hi>possible</hi> either <hi>riding</hi> at any <hi>particular</hi> Horse, or <hi>staying</hi> for any, but to ride each Heat <hi>throughout</hi> with the <hi>best speed</hi> you can.</p>
                  <p>But if you have a very <hi>fiery Horse</hi> to manage, or one that is <hi>hard-mouth'd,</hi> and difficult to be <hi>held,</hi> then <hi>start behind</hi> the rest of the Horses with all the <hi>coolness</hi> and <hi>gentleness</hi> imaginable; and when you find your Horse to begin to ride at some <hi>command,</hi> then <hi>put up</hi> to the other Horses, and if you find they ride <hi>at their Ease,</hi> and are <hi>hard held,</hi> then endeavour to <hi>draw</hi> them on <hi>faster;</hi> but if you find their <hi>Wind</hi> begin to <hi>rake hot,</hi> and that they want a <hi>Sob,</hi> if your <hi>own</hi> Horse be in <hi>wind,</hi> and you have a <hi>Loose in your hand,</hi> keep them <hi>up to their speed,</hi> till you come within <hi>three quarters</hi> of a <hi>Mile</hi> of the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Heat;</hi> and then give a <hi>Loose,</hi> and <hi>push</hi> for it, and leave to <hi>Fortune</hi> and your Horses <hi>Goodness</hi> the <hi>Event</hi> of your Success.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:100171:282"/>
                  <p>Many more <hi>Rules</hi> there are which may not occur at present to my <hi>memory,</hi> and others which I <hi>purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> omit; but these may serve the <hi>honest Jockey,</hi> and for the others which relate to <hi>Foul-play,</hi> as <hi>crossing, hanging</hi> on the <hi>Posts, leaning</hi> on the other <hi>Horseman, yoking,</hi> &amp;c. I desire not to <hi>instruct</hi> any one in them, and could <hi>wish</hi> that they might <hi>never</hi> be <hi>made use of,</hi> but be wholly <hi>relinquish'd</hi> by all <hi>honest</hi> Horsemen.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, when either your <hi>Hunting-Match,</hi> or your <hi>Tryal for the Plate</hi> is ended, as soon as you have <hi>rubb'd</hi> your Horse <hi>dry,</hi> you shall <hi>cloath him up,</hi> and <hi>ride him home,</hi> where the first thing you give him shall be this <hi>Drink</hi> to comfort him.</p>
                  <p>Take a Pint and a half of <hi>sweet Milk,</hi> and put three <hi>Yolks</hi> of <hi>Eggs</hi> beaten into it; then make it <hi>luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm,</hi> and put in three penny-worth of <hi>Saffron,</hi> and three Spoonfuls of <hi>Sallet-oyl,</hi> and give it him in a Horn.</p>
                  <p>When this is done <hi>dress</hi> him <hi>slightly</hi> over with your <hi>Curry Comb, Brush,</hi> and <hi>Woollen Cloth;</hi> and then bath the place where the <hi>Saddle stood</hi> with warm <hi>Sack</hi> to prevent <hi>Warbles,</hi> and <hi>wash</hi> the <hi>Spurring-places</hi> with <hi>Piss</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> and then afterwards <hi>annoint</hi> them with <hi>Turpentine</hi> and Powder of <hi>Jet</hi> mix'd together; and be sure let the <hi>Stable</hi> be very well <hi>litter'd;</hi> and then <hi>cloath</hi> him up with <hi>all speed,</hi> and so let him <hi>stand</hi> two hours. Then feed him with <hi>Rye-bread,</hi> after that with a very good <hi>Mash:</hi> then give him his <hi>Belly full</hi> of <hi>Hay,</hi> and what <hi>Corn</hi> or <hi>Bread</hi> he will eat. Then <hi>bathe</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> well with <hi>Urine</hi> and <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> leave him <hi>Corn</hi> in his Locker, and so let him <hi>rest</hi> till the <hi>next</hi> Morning; at which time order him as <hi>before directed</hi> in his days of <hi>Rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have <hi>imparted</hi> to the Publick what my own
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100171:283"/>
                     <hi>Experience</hi> has <hi>taught</hi> me, relating to this part of <hi>Horsemanship.</hi> I desire no Person to <hi>rely</hi> on it further then they shall find it <hi>advantageous</hi> upon <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Tryal.</hi> If others <hi>more skilful</hi> would be as free to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> their <hi>Observations</hi> on this Subject, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable part of <hi>Knowledge</hi> might then perhaps be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to <hi>perfection.</hi> The giving a <hi>Specimen</hi> was all that is here <hi>design'd.</hi> If the <hi>Reader</hi> finds any <hi>Errors,</hi> he is desir'd either to <hi>pardon</hi> or <hi>amend</hi> them.
