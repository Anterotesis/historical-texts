         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You will finde him a perſon of morall and religious principles; one who kept ſelect company; one, who in all parts he arrived at, took not his information at the ſhore or Suburbs, but either for occaſion or curioſity, viſited the inteſtines and ſupreme, whence he might the better look below, and round about him. I do ingeniouſly acknowledge I have injured him in the rudeneſſe of tranſlation; which, next to my want of faculty, I beſeech you attribute to the haſte was preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, for I had no more dayes allowed to tranſlate it, then would ſufficiently have ſerved to tranſcribe it: and it was the firſt piece I ever attempted.

            <p>I Cannot look but with admiration, upon the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of ſuch as are not confirmed in a due belief of divine Providence, ſince all mundane effects ſhew daily ſuch ſenſible teſtimonies, and eſpecially humane Actions, wherein this wiſe guide directing all things to their end, is ſufficiently apparent, though ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, yet forcibly compelling all things. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears teſtimony enough in my particular, that from my firſt entrance into the world, have been aſſiſted by this divine wiſdome and goodneſſe to my 78. year, my inſtant age, ſo as I can give moſt reall aſſurance. I have been ſenſible of ſupernatural effects in my continual pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinations through ſuch diverſe parts, and ſo remote from inhabitable Land for above ſixty four years, in ſuch ſeveral dangers, both by Sea and Land, amongſt people ſo diſcrepant in Religion, Laws, Manners, Language, and courſe of living, through all by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preſerved healthful, and ſecure, with the bleſſing at laſt to produce ſomething that may be beneficial to my country and poſterity. For having ever had an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Propenſion to travail, when I was ſcarce advanced out of my Infancy, and of judgement, neither for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, nor election; I felt though ſecret, ſuch vigorous motions, that I had not power to reſiſt them: So as
<pb facs="tcp:98515:4"/>
without conſidering why, or for what end, like a man forlorn, I threw my ſelfe into this courſe of pererra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which afterward, invited by affaires, and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able content, I embraced with deſign and reſolution: Nor needs it be much admired, ſince well conſidered, our life is but a continual voyage, without reſt or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red home, till we arrive at the end, where in a ſempiternall ſtate, our Soveraigne felicity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits.</p>

               <p>I Was not fully arrived at my fourteenth year of age, when ſeeing a veſſell making ready for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Grand <hi>Caire,</hi> impulſed by that noble ambition to view the world, I reſolved to embark with the Company, though ſecretly, and without the privity of my deareſt parents. Of this veſſel, called our <hi>Lady of Victory,</hi> one <hi>Robert Pontoine</hi> a Merchant, and my Father <hi>Raphael le Blanc</hi> were owners, which ſo delightfully took the affections of my infancy, that I ſpent the better part of my time aboard her. I often beg'd my Fathers conſent for the voyage; but he, as a perſon experienced in ſuch affairs, foreſeeing the hardſhip and dangers my tender age was to encounter, ſtill denied me. Notwithſtanding I perſiſted in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98515:8"/>
my reſolution to go in what ſort ſoever; and though I received ſome ſeverities from my mother on this occaſion, yet with a ſute of apparell and ſome linnens I had provided, I took my way one morning towards <hi>Civitad</hi> about five leagues diſtant from <hi>Marſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ills.</hi> But my mother reflecting on ſome words I had let fall (that they ſhould never ſee me more) ſent ſome to overtake me, who with fair words perſwaded me home again. At laſt ſhe perceiving my reſolution peremptory, and that I watched all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to eſcape; without acquainting my Father, who would never have conſented, ſhe gave me leave: ſo as delivering me ſome moneys, and recommending me to one <hi>Baptiſt Cote</hi> a Merchant of integrity, ſhe acquainted not the Captain, who was my Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe ſhe would not have him know ſhe was privy to my voyage. Then I privately went aboard in the <hi>Victory,</hi> and dealt with the Pilot <hi>Auguſtine Battaillon</hi> to conceale me; which for the affection I had to travaile, and the reſpect he had to my Father he performed.</p>

Both our Merchants and Seamen on a feſtivall day coming aſhore to make merry, they were ſo ſurprized with the beauties and ſubtleties of the Iſland Curtizans, that they not onely exhauſted all their money but ſold their commodities to undervalews to ſatisfie their pleaſures, which ſome of them were glutted with to the loſſe of their lives: and having thus ſpent near two moneths, we put to ſea for <hi>France,</hi> and two or three dayes had a proſperous winde, which on a ſudden turned to the North-Eaſt, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to a furious violent North-wind, that drove us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coaſt of <hi>Turluru,</hi>

               <p>And it is worth obſervation that the greateſt part of our company were reprobate perſons, and abſolute Atheiſts, for ſome of our Marriners ſeeing themſelves in this imminent danger, their veſſel being filled with water, ſecured ſome cans of wine which they pour down their throats, amongſt the reſt one <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> a <hi>Marſeillian,</hi> put on his beſt apparell, and with ſome <hi>French</hi> coin threw himſelf into the Sea: thoſe raſcals endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him, inviting him to drink, ſaying 'twas better to dye full than empty, but the poor creature not able to ſwim ſunk im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, his body was within few dayes caſt upon the ſhore, the Clark of the ſhip ſtript him, took his clothes and money, and buried him, ſince being ſent into <hi>France</hi> to be impowered, by the Merchants to receive four or five thouſand Zequines, which the goods and commodities ſaved from ſhipwrack were ſold for, he carried the news to <hi>Honoratus</hi> widow, but I doubt whether he reſtored her his goods as he told us he did.

               <p>After reſt and victuals had a little recovered us, and our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary returned to the ſea ſide, to view the remaines of the wrack: the Conſul of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, reſiding in a Town in <hi>Canee,</hi> eight leagues diſtant, upon notice repaired with ſpeed to us with twenty Souldiers, to preſerve what was ſaved, who took good order to ſee the commodities dryed, and reſtored to the right owners: having taken his due fees, and leaving our Secretary with the Souldiers in charge with the goods, he took me home to his houſe, and provided me clothes after the <hi>Greek</hi> faſhion and other neceſſaries that I wanted: I ſtayed ſix or ſeven months with the Conſul, who gave me noble and free entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for my Fathers ſake, whoſe friend and acquaintance he

His Court is ſtately and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, he hath a great number of men devoted to his ſervice, who freely offer up their lives for him at his command, believing they go ſtreight to heaven, dying for their Prince.</p>
               <p>They relate of a Turkiſh Emperour returning home from the <hi>Perſick</hi> war through this country, deſired the ſight of the Prince <hi>Sequemir,</hi> and of his <hi>Salſidas,</hi>

that he demanded twelve of them to take back into his Country, which the <hi>Sequemir</hi> willingly granted; and being aſked whether they would have as great an affection for a new Maſter, and if they would as willingly dye for him, as for their old Lord; one of them made anſwer to the Turk: if our Prince commands us to dye for thee, we are from this very inſtant ready to obey him: The Turk told them, in time he ſhould have need of them, and that he would preſerve them, and eſteem them his beſt friends; and taking them away with him, he maintained them handſomely, and near his perſon; but after the death of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Emperour, they all returned back to their old Maſter, eſteeming it the greateſt happineſſe and ſafety to be near unto that Prince.

               <p>The Nobility of the Country affect much to eat <hi>Ambar, Musk,</hi> and other ſweets: the <hi>Soudan</hi> of <hi>Aden,</hi> ſubject to <hi>Sequemir,</hi> ſpends yearly ſix thouſand Duccats therein, for his ſelf, wife, and family, their kitchins may be taken for perfumers ſhops ſo ſweet and odoriferous.</p>
               <p>The Red Seas coaſt towards <hi>Aden,</hi> is thick of good towns, and well traded; and among the Merchants are many thieves, which you muſt have a care on; you ſee the towns called <hi>Ahra, Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, Coubita, Erit, Aridan, Magora, Rabon, Salta,</hi> and others; with many villages ſubjects to the <hi>Sequemir,</hi> who commands ſix <hi>Soltania's,</hi> or kingdomes, all fill'd with good towns: upon the Sea ſide grow ſtore of reeds or Canes, which in time make little Iſlands, rendring the landing difficult; and from thence the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes call that Sea <hi>Souf,</hi> which ſignifies a reed.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> had ſome reaſon for what they did, for from thence depended the whole Trade of the Kingdom, and adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes; and the <hi>Portuguais</hi> keep all that Countrey in ſubjection; from <hi>Diu</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> and the <hi>Cape Comarin,</hi> 270. leagues in length.

               <p>The furniture within their houſes is rich, which they have from the <hi>Portuguais,</hi> they ride in littars, and are great Lovers of Muſick; their houſes are ſumptuouſly dreſſed at <hi>Diu,</hi> and <hi>Ormus,</hi> many of them beautified and enriched, with <hi>Calcedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Turkey</hi>-ſtones, <hi>Amariſts, Topaſes,</hi> and other jewels.

it makes the Souldiers valiant and furious, fighting to the laſt drop of bloud: and is therefore a rich commodity, the <hi>Aſſa foetida,</hi> Turbith, Agathes, and other jewels are brought from <hi>Diu,</hi> where there are many Goldſmiths and Jewellers, thither the Merchants bring them to have them cut into ſeveral figures.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:98515:31"/>This diligence was a little raſh, for I was immediately adviſed by our hoſt, a rich broker or merchant, that my camarade had taken his journey in vain, having not with him a roll of his goods ſtoln, nor the Viceroy's <hi>Cartaco</hi>; I ſtreight reſolved to follow him with the papers and paſſe-port he ſtood in need of: <hi>Caſſis</hi> overtook this venturer at <hi>Ormus,</hi> where he debauched at his charge, and for want of the liſt of wares nothing could be proved againſt him.

                  </note>The <hi>Gentills</hi> had a moſt magnificent Temple built of ſtone, in a little Iſland neere to <hi>Goa,</hi> called <hi>Dinary,</hi> where they adored the Devill that appeared to them in diverſe moſt terrible and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſhapes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugais</hi> ſeeing this diabolicall profanation, demoliſh't the Temple and the Idols, without leaving the leaſt marke behind them, and with the ſtones they fortified the Town, and built ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair houſes, which bred a great malice and hatred amongſt the Idolaters. The Temple was built of a black ſtone, and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes, or Idolls, were moſt horribly ſhaped. When the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gais</hi> managed that great Warr againſt <hi>Samorin</hi> of <hi>Calicut,</hi> it was then in their power to demoliſh this Temple.</p>

               <p>The Inhabitants live very deliciouſly, feed much upon <hi>Areca,</hi> and are carried in rich Sedans by their ſlaves, and the inhabitants have liberty of conſcience.</p>

of Juſtice, and above all, a moſt admirable govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an Hoſpital, which is very rich, where notwithſtanding are great number of ſick, and maim'd, from the Armies: The Viceroy and Archbiſhop contribute liberally thereunto; the <hi>Portugais</hi> prove themſelves, of an affable, and compaſſionate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, although the Indians hold them rough and uncharitable, becauſe they poſſeſſe much of their land.</p>
               <p>This Hoſpital is the faireſt, and the moſt accompliſht, in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries I know in the world; and I dare affirm that neither that of the Holy Ghoſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the infirmary of <hi>Malta,</hi> although they are ſerved in plate in both thoſe places, do equall her in riches, good orders, and ſervices: that are farre better obſerved and tended, then you can expect to be in your own houſe, as I often was a witneſſe of, viſiting the <hi>French</hi> that were there ſick: the Fathers of the ſociety have the keeping of it, and are very charitable therein; It is built upon a River, founded by the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi>; beſides the charity and gifts of the Nobility, which are great; they have for the moſt part a Factor at <hi>Cambaye</hi>; a Country plentiful in all ſorts of grain, who makes their proviſion at the cheapeſt rates: there a great number of ſlaves, that are employed in all inferiour offices; and are alſo made uſe of in the other Indian Hoſpitals, and other Monaſteries. Perfumes are daily burnt, to prevent infection, and to leſsen the unwholeſome ſents that would otherwiſe very much offend: they uſe very fine linnen, and wine of Dates is their onely drinke, and is full as delicious as that of Grapes: the <hi>Portugais</hi> are very voluptuous; and great ſenſualiſts and are ſerved in <hi>Purcelain,</hi>

               <p>The Churches of <hi>Goa</hi> are fair and well adorned, the Windores of Mother of pearl, very curiouſly carved. At <hi>Pegu</hi> they are made of <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> ſhells of diverſe colours, and are the faireſt of the world; the Lanthornes belonging to the Hoſpital, are made of the ſhell of a fiſh, a kind of Mother of pearl.</p>
               <p>They burn nothing but wax in the Churches, nor little elſe in the town, it is ſo well provided therewith.</p>

               <p>There is great commerce of all wares and merchandiſe, of ſlaves eſpecially, both males and females; 'tis but a peccadillie, for a Maſter to lye with his ſlave, but if ſhe proves with child, the law enfranchiſes her, and ſhe may go whither ſhe pleaſes.</p>
               <p>The waters are good and well taſted, and although the tyde goes up beyond the town, yet there remaines not the leaſt brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſſe in the water, the beſt is fetched halfe a mile from the town, from a place called <hi>Banquenin,</hi> which is ſold. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugais</hi> are richly clad, with breeches like Sea-men, very rich but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, coats, and Caſſocks, pretty ſhort, and broad hats; they have their <hi>Paraſols</hi> carried by them, with bottles full of <hi>Colos,</hi> and other pleaſing drinks, and they weare very rich ſwords; and in a word, they are very vain and proud, as the Prophet ſpeaks them, <hi>Pocos y Locos.</hi>

               <p>The Haven is very good, onely there is a ſhelf of ſand, as at <hi>Larack</hi> in <hi>Fez,</hi> they have an inquiſition, or Court of Parliament, which is their Judicature; The Viceroy is removed every third year.

               <p>The Iſle is mountainous, ſandy, and reddiſh, yet very fertile, being well water'd with many ſprings, and rivers: of this red earth or clay, are made many ſorts of cups and vaſes white, ſome gray, others red, and as clear and fine as glaſſe, as <hi>Bolarmeni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have two crops a year, of Rice and <hi>French</hi> Wheat, and it is green all the year long: this land is ſcituate under the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick <hi>Cancer,</hi> near to the Equinoctial.</p>
               <p>There grow many Date-trees, and ſhips come daily into the Haven, laden with <hi>Cocos,</hi> and other commodities vented in the town.</p>
               <p>The ſhips ſtay at the barre or mouth of the Haven wanting wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring them up: They hold it two miles from the town to the mouth of the river, where are two ſtrong Block-houſes or Forts, to defend the ſhips that ſayle in the middle.

for the Pyracy committed, as well as for their murdering the Captain; the chief of theſe Malefactors was called <hi>Raymondin</hi>; they were aſſiſted at the time of their ſuffering by ſome good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church of the five wounds of our Saviour, near to the publick place of execution; and the fathers of our Ladies of Mercy cloathed them all in white according to their cuſtom with white caps, and a croſſe in their hands; they died very couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and penitently, fully contrite and ſorry for their ſin and ſhame; ſome were hanged at Saint <hi>Katherines</hi> key, others in the Corne-Market.

The Inhabitants are partly Gentiles, partly Mahometans, but much civilized; of complection between fair and brown, of good ſtatures, and diſpoſitions, both Sexes. The town is invironed with many good <hi>Barroughs,</hi> that reach unto <hi>Decan,</hi> ſome five leagues off; the town is ſtrongly wall'd, and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Jewes, who drive a great trade, and inhabited by all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſhe is tributary to the King of <hi>Marſingue,</hi> they are carried in littars by Cammels, of horſes they have very few, we ſerved our ſelves ſometimes with oxen, which they harniſe, and ride, they eat bread made of Rice, which is more ſavory then wheaten, there grows no grain, but the Country beares moſt excellent fruit, their drink is wine of dates.</p>
               <p>About 3. Musket ſhot from the town, there is an Iſle named <hi>Amadiva,</hi> which hath a large haven, on the continent ſide, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by <hi>Moores,</hi> and abounding in paſtures, and cattle. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are the <hi>Portugaiſes</hi> mortal, and irreconcilable enemies, but their Iſland being ſmall, not above 8. leagues about; they are not capable to trouble them. The town is rich, and is called <hi>Centacola,</hi> ſubject to the King of <hi>Baticola:</hi> there are ſome Jews amongſt them that may eaſily be diſtinguiſht by the complexion, the <hi>Moores</hi> be tawny, the Jews clearer: women uſe waters and other waſhes that make them very beautiful, and they are held the prettieſt of all the Eaſt, the faireſt are Jews, and they very chaſte, and ſtrangers can only obtain to viſit them, in certain aſſemblies of fair girles; but they go meanly clad, contrary to the cuſtomes of all other towns: they ſing certain ſongs like K. <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pronouncing their words, and mingling inſtrumental muſick with their vocal; and thus they entertain their gallants.

                  <hi>Calicut</hi> is a great Town, one of the faireſt, richeſt,<note place="margin">Calicut.</note> and of the greateſt commerce of all the <hi>India's</hi>: ſome will have it anciently called <hi>Barygaze,</hi> yet the <hi>Mores</hi> hold ſhe hath been built many years ſince, and that ſix hundred years agone, <hi>Aſarama Perimel,</hi> was Emperour of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and the Natives reckon upon the years ſince his reign, which is their moſt famous <hi>Callander</hi>: He kept his Court at <hi>Coulan,</hi> where was the chiefeſt trade of ſpices,<note place="margin">Samorin.</note> and gave the Countrey of <hi>Calicut</hi> to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it very much for commerce; they made this King a Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who went through devotion to end his dayes at <hi>Meka,</hi> diſtributing his eſtate to divers Lords, leaving them the Title of Kings, as of <hi>Cananor, Coulan,</hi> and others. <hi>Calicut</hi> fell unto a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of his named <hi>Samorin,</hi> which ſignifies ſoveraign Emperour over all the reſt, in temporall affairs, as he of <hi>Coulan</hi> was chief in Spiritualls, ſurnamed <hi>Cobritin, viz.</hi> high Pontife of the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins. Samorin</hi> built this Town, the Metropolitan of <hi>Calicut,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by the <hi>Meres,</hi> where was the greateſt trade of groceries, ſince removed by the <hi>Portugais</hi> to <hi>Cochin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98515:36"/>The Prince is an Idolater at this preſent, although the Town be peopled by all Religions, Gentils, Mahometans, Jewes, and Chriſtians. The building is very good, though the houſes are very low, becauſe they ſtand upon an ill foundation, the Sea water ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing if you dig but a little depth, yet they have by art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry raiſed the Temples, and Pallaces, whereof there are four Royal ones, inhabited by the Kings wives, and concubines; there ſtands one of them without the Town, fair to the ſight, and high. Their Temples are ſo too, and built round, the firſt of that form I ſaw in thoſe parts; they adore the Devil, and put his picture upon their coin, in moſt horrid poſtures: They put two Demons embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, with cloven or cocks feet at one ſide, on the other a certain Character, which ſignifies, think upon this people.</p>
               <p>The King is impiouſly devout, and every Wedneſday performs a moſt ſtrange adoration of Satan; he is pictured ſitting in a chair, with a Crown upon his head, in the middle of many little Devils, moſt ſtrangely and terribly repreſented; after the King hath offered him incenſes, he proſtrates himſelf on the ground in ſign of ſubmiſſion, then begins his prophane prayers, then he ſtretches himſelf at length upon a rich carpet, leaning his head upon his left arm, thus he dines, inviting the Devil to his repaſt; four <hi>Bramins</hi> aſſiſt him in this impious ſacrifice, and hearken very attentively to the diſcourſe, or Sermon, the King makes during his dinner; repreſenting to them the ſervice they owe to their Idol, they anſwer him not in words at that time, but give him <hi>Betel</hi> and <hi>Areca</hi> mingled together, which he drinks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching the cup, according to their ſuperſtitious cuſtom: becauſe that day his mouth is ſacred, and filled with the praiſes of Sathan; when he hath ended his repaſt, the meat he leaves is carried into a garden near at hand to be devoured by Crows, that there expect it, in ſo great numbers, that they hardly get two bits a piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calicut</hi> I conceive is as big as <hi>Millan,</hi> but not ſo well built nor ordered. The Strangers and Merchants are upon their arrivall put (to a great inconvenience) to buy houſes to dwell in, which troubled us very much, being forced at our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to leave it for half it coſt us: you buy women for your ſervice, and put them off again, but not without ſome loſſe. The Port is a pretty way diſtant from the Town; there is but one channell; which the ſhips cannot reach by a mile and a half, by reaſon of the ſhelves of ſand, and therefore they uſe flat bottoms, which do great ſervices upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: The King keeps a frigate or pinnace called <hi>Jonques,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jonque.</note> for his pleaſure, which he treats the Ladies in, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> do in their <hi>Gondola's,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gondola.</note> all the houſes in the Towne are covered with palm-leaves, the Kings onely excepted that are tyled; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no private perſon may have means to fortifie himſelf.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98515:36"/>
the town is very ſubject to fires; and therefore the houſes are built farre aſunder. 'Tis ſurrounded with pleaſant fields and paſtures, but they never eat beef; they are ſo ſuperſtitious, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them holy and ſacred cattle, that their <hi>Dume</hi> hath appointed them to cultivate the land onely, which makes them hard to be bought and ſold; this ſuperſtition is only publickly obſerved, for ſome of the <hi>Bramins</hi> treated us with beef, who borrowed a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Cook, and entertained us with a whole calf, the head and intrals ſtewed, and the reſt roſted as we uſe: He feaſted us becauſe one of the company had cured him of a certain diſeaſe, and refuſed any reward, and thus they do like the <hi>Turkes,</hi> who abſtain from wine in publick, but drink it privately: nevertheleſſe theſe <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> have the devil pictured open mouthed, red, and flaming, ready to devoure, the law-breaker, and when they have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſacrifice to him a white cock: which is derived from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient and ſuperſtitious Idolotry of the <hi>Pagan,</hi> who offered a white cock to <hi>Hercules,</hi> to the night, to <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> and to <hi>Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis:</hi> thus the devil renews theſe old ſuperſtitions, and appears vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly unto them, ſome believing him to be God, ſome a creature of Gods, ſome hold him good, others bad, theſe ſerve and adore him, for fear he ſhould do them harm.</p>
               <p>Not far from <hi>Calicut,</hi> is an ancient Temple or <hi>Bagode,</hi> which they call <hi>Dumana,</hi> where there is a general pardon to be gained, certain dayes of the year, they have fifteen dayes of liberty, and freedom, which time the thieves, and baniſht perſons, may appear with ſafety to ſacrifice; the Temple is built in a Marſh, held up by great pillars, with many trees of diverſe ſorts growing about it, each pilgrim chuſeth himſelf one for his reſt, and to hang his cloaths in.</p>
               <p>There are many burning lamps which the pilgrims offer up to be purified of their ſins: The <hi>Bramins</hi> ſay prayers aloud, and ſprinkle them with water, in expiation of their crimes; and after this ablution, they preſent themſelves to the Idol, and adore it: from thence they return to their trees, having provided their lamps with oyle and wick to burn at night; 'Tis pleaſant to ſee ſo much light. The next morning they bathe themſelves all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Lake, men, women, boys, and girles, without the leaſt ſhame of their nakedneſſe; then dreſſe themſelves in their beſt clothes, and return to the ſacrifices, which ended, the <hi>Bramin</hi> makes them a ſhort Sermon clothed in a white ſurplice, reaching down to the kneees, and bare-foot, the legs rounded with bands wrought, and hung round with ſilver bels, and ſtanding thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the picture of the devil, repreſented gaping, ready to ſwallow the ſpectators crowned, and with ſparkling eyes; Thus the <hi>Bramin</hi> begins his ſacrifice, caſting himſelf upon the ground murmuring ſomething, and beats himſelf ſo furiouſly, that he ſeems enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; then he turnes himſelfe to the people (who are very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98515:37"/>
ſhewing them the Devil, at which ſight they begin to howle and cry for mercy with ſo furious and horrid a noyſe, as Gods thunder could ſcarce be heard. Next he takes a white cock, and wrings off his head, and mingles his blood with water, which he ſprinkles upon the multitude, who retire as contented as if they had gained an Empire. In the mid-way they meet a man of good preſence, but diſtracted, with the devils picture about his neck, and clothed in a white <hi>Tunick</hi> or <hi>Albe.</hi> At the head of the people, the devils picture is carried by eight devotes clothed in cotton robes, followed by four <hi>Bramins,</hi> and many others, fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick-like, running, leaping, ſinging, and dancing before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: ſtabbing themſelves into the faces and arms; and he is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the holyeſt, that hath given himſelf the deepeſt wounds, of which many dye, when they come before the diſtracted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is expoſed upon theatre; they ſtand ſtill to fulfill the ceremony of the ſacrifice; and having burnt ſome perfumes, the <hi>Choourt</hi> or <hi>Bramin</hi> ſprinkles him, with the bloud and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the people offer him their charities, and dedicating their clothes and lampes to him, they enter the Temple at another gate, leave their Idol in the place they found him, and thus they end their Idolatrous proceſſion. From thence they go to dinner, which they ſprinkle with the ſame water; and feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Vyands, they ſacrificed, and of others they brought thither, the ſacrifice is ended.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Bramins,</hi> and other religious, never eat any thing that hath received life in publick; although we eat fleſh with them in private, they keep company with none but their fellowes.</p>
               <p>They wear white <hi>Turbants,</hi> Cotton gownes that reach to their heeles, red ſhooes; under this they wear a long linnen cloth or towel, that goes twice or thrice round about them, a fine girdle, long haire, their eares bored, and pearles hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them: they wear next to their fleſh certain ſtrings, the badge of their order, which are given them with great ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; there are of them of ſeveral ſorts, ſome of them go to the warres with the <hi>Naires,</hi> others trade, and are rich Merchants, and they are generally peaceable, and meek natured. The King himſelf is of the order, wearing the ſtring in a ſcarf, they are much eſteemed throughout the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ſome of them are very able Phyſicians. When they affirm any thing to be a truth, they lay their hand upon their ſtring, or upon their <hi>Cabaye,</hi> or gown. The <hi>Portugais</hi> did live pretty peaceably amongſt them, but the <hi>Moores</hi> have ſet them together by the eares.

               <p>FRom <hi>Calicut</hi> we went to <hi>Cochin,</hi> about the eighth degree,<note place="margin">Cochin.</note> and twelve leagues from <hi>Calicut.</hi> This kingdome is confederate with <hi>Calicut,</hi> profeſſing the ſame religion, the town is ſcituate in a ſweet and temperate ayre, the country abounds in cattle and fruit,<note place="margin">Pepper of all ſorts.</note> grain is ſcarce but is plentifully ſupplyed from <hi>Cambaye.</hi> Pepper growes there of three ſorts, of the long excellent conſerves are made: throughout the coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi> which reaches from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Comori,</hi> grows the white and black pepper. The Ginger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of much is confected for their uſe in all ſeaſons, is called <hi>Aliah,</hi> in the <hi>Malaicke</hi> tongue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> are in good eſteem at <hi>Cochin,</hi> the King being their friend and allye, Since <hi>Triumpara</hi> ſhewed himſelf conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, againſt <hi>Calicut</hi>; ſince, when the Kings of <hi>Cochin</hi> have never broken their promiſes, whatever made to them; but have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably kept their Articles, <hi>viz.</hi> to give unto the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> a tribute of twelve pearles,<note place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Portugais</hi> do chiefly trade in pepper, which they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to all parts of the world; that which they tranſport into <hi>Arabia, Suria, Perſia, Babylon,</hi> and other places along thoſe coaſts, is farre better then that they carry into <hi>Portugal,</hi> becauſe much of its ſtrength and vertue is loſt, in the long navigation; and the price falling, they put off the worſt, and often moſt of it green, which nevertheleſſe the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> carry into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, they load their veſſels with refuſe, and never bagge any of it; whereas the <hi>Mores,</hi> that are bound for the red ſea, the <hi>Perſick</hi> Gulph, and other parts of the <hi>Levant,</hi> give a good price for it, and therefore deſerve the beſt.</p>

I have ſeen of ſeverall ſorts, one which the Weſt Indians, at <hi>Carthagene,</hi> and <hi>Caramel,</hi> call <hi>Jerac,</hi> which ſignifies white, and laid in the ſun becomes as black as the other, and though a little different, yet hath great vertue, and is like a young beane, but ſomething lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: the grain is incloſed in a little cod, as the beane: This ſort of tree beares no leaves, the others, which are the ordinary ſort, beare many both long and large.

               </p>

                  </note> Moſt of the Inhabitants plant Cinamon, and make great eſteem of the oyle they draw from it, which is very odoriferous, and uſeful for many things.</p>
               <p>There are gold and ſilver mynes, but they have great want of workmen. For the Iſlanders are ſlothful, and vicious.

               <p>In a word; this Iſle is one of the richeſt of the world, and of great commerce in all commodities, which renders the King both wealthy and potent; for from the Ruby myne alone, he deduces a vaſt treaſure, though he hath ſold a corner of it which is of great value, yet all thoſe that ſurpaſſe four or five <hi>Abir</hi> or <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats,</hi> belong unto him.</p>

The people are rather fair then Brown, there dwell no Jewes, but many Mahometans. Both men and women are richly apparelled, begirt with girdles of jewels of value. Women do but overcharge their eares with pearles, Rubies, and Diamonds; The country language is the ſame as is ſpoken at <hi>Malabar.</hi> There grow great ſtore of Oranges in this Iſle, and the Inhabitants delight in eating the rinde, which is as good as thoſe of Lemmons. They drink <hi>Areca,</hi> and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious drinks, mingled with ſugar and cinnamon. They make ſome drinks will inebriate like wine, both men and women drink of it; and when they are intoxicated, they go to ſleep. They have five ſorts of Date trees, which augments their trade; there grows a herb called <hi>Nabuc,</hi> whereof they make oyle, as well taſted as that of Palmes; the cinnamon oyle is too ſtrong.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Bengale,</hi> and <hi>Coromandel,</hi> trade much in this Iſle, whither they come to truck Indian rarities, but they go as much to make merry, and carrouze with them, as for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; they eat Rice-bread, as they do throughout the <hi>Indies.</hi>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98515:46"/>
ſhe immediately led to the place of execution, where a fire was kindled to conſume her body: ſhe cloathed all in white, her hair hanging over her eares, covered almoſt all her body; took the golden bowle, and made her prayer to God, and Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> to vouchſafe to grant her mercy; and to diſcover her innocency; which done, ſhe drunk the poyſon, and threw her ſelf into the fire, where without the leaſt harme either to her perſon, or cloathes, ſhe remained upon her knees, continuing her prayers to almighty God, untill all the wood was conſumed; ſhe ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came out of it to the great aſtoniſhment, and admiration of all the admiring ſpectators; and being helped into her litter, was carried to <hi>Narſingue,</hi> brought into her chamber, and was never ſince in the power of the King her huſband: ſhe ſpent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her dayes, recluſe, in great abſtinence and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>

               <p>This Prince had a daughter about eight yeares of age, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted much to play with the Cub, &amp; fed him with her own hands; the young Bear was continually at her heeles.

The Lady-Mother one day perceiving the Bear to pull up her daughters coats, to lick her feet; angry to ſee ſuch familiarities and carreſſes; commanded a ſervant to beat <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtan,</hi> (for ſo was the Bear named) the beaſt of an immenſe growth, though but 15. months old, flew upon the man (armed with a cudgel onely) very furiouſly, and ſtrangled him, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervant came to help him, upon the place: this ſet a ſtrange Alarum through the houſe, all running headlong to kill the beaſt, that made a moſt ſtrange ſlaughter, and got into the wood, and of three years there was no tidings of him.

               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:98515:47"/>The Town of <hi>Ternaſſery</hi> is large and pleaſant, well built,<note place="margin">Ternaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</note> not walled on the River ſide, but ſtrengthned by ſome Forts well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and provided: ſhe is ſcituate in a plain, with a Caſtle on the North, with an incloſure or Parke, fenced with a great ditch, where the Queen keepes a breed of ſtately Mares, given her by her Father, who recovered them of an <hi>Indian</hi> Prince that owed him money, which he could no otherwiſe recover, for in that Country horſes beare a great value.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Ternaſſery</hi> is provided with good Cavalry, which renders him potent and formidable, he is of Perſon ſtrong, and Robuſte, and wars continually with the King of <hi>Narſingue,</hi> and <hi>Bengale.</hi> The <hi>Narſinguer</hi> would indamage him much, did he joyne with the other, but he is ſo generous he ſcornes it.</p>
               <p>This King is a <hi>Gentill,</hi> and hath above a thouſand Elephants trained up to Warr, and of the largeſt ſize of the Eaſt; cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the very ground with beefes hides, and ſeverally trapped; thoſe hides are faſtned underneath the belly, with iron chaines, and are hardly got off, four men may fight on their backs at a time, without the leaſt incumbrance to one another, bearing broad bucklers, made of Tortoyſe ſhells, taken in that River; he that rides the trunk to guide the beaſt, is the beſt Armed of the five, becauſe he lies open to the enemy; their darts have three very ſharp points, or heads, with a ball of iron upon the middle, which ſerves for counterpoiſe. 'Tis a warr-like Nation, yet curteous, civill, and voluptuous; they have fair women, which they Court and Treat in gardens full of rare fruits. They have Cattell, Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and fowle of all ſorts, they delight much in perfumes in their meates and dreſſes, and chiefly in Musk, called <hi>Sagay.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Musk, and from whence.</note> The beſt Musk is not drawne from the codd, nor blood of the beaſt, but from a certain ſwelling, or riſing upon the lower part of his belly, at the full of the Moone, and that is the ſweeteſt of all: for there gather the humors mixt with the blood, and Impoſtume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like riſe and break, which dryed caſt ſo lively and ſearching ſent, that it drawes blood from the very noſe.

               <p>They met with thoſe Buſſes loaden, and returning home, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their aſſiſtance, to hale, and tow them along unto <hi>Maturane,</hi> that there they might mend their ſayles, and they promiſ'd a reward for their ſervice, the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> enemies to the Chriſtians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to conduct them thither, and there to uſe them at will, and having tow'd them two nights and a day to that Haven, ſuddenly the others plaid with their Canon, and ſeizing unawares of the place, made great ſlaughter amongſt thoſe miſerable creatures, burnt their fleet, ſack't the Town, and full fraught with rich plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they retired.

               <p>The Kings of <hi>Bengale</hi> were able to conquer the Kingdom of <hi>Deli,</hi> were not the great deſerts of <hi>Damida,</hi> and the Inpenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Forreſts of <hi>Sacara</hi> interpoſed the two limits Southward, on the one ſide is the Cape <hi>Sogora,</hi> or <hi>Sagagora,</hi> and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that of <hi>Caſtigan,</hi> or <hi>Catigan,</hi> at the third mouth of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> over againſt the Kingdom of <hi>Verma,</hi> where are the mines of <hi>Chryſolites, Sardonix,</hi> and <hi>Topaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verma</hi> hath formerly belonged unto the Kingdom of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> the people are very civill, and given to trade. And all Nations have free traffick, as <hi>Perſians, Greekes, Abyſſins, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes, Guſerates, Malabares, Turkes, Moores, Jewes, Ruffes,</hi> or <hi>Georgians,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>There is great commerce of Jewells, and other Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes, brought by the Mouth of <hi>Ganges</hi> ſtreight to <hi>Bengale,</hi> going up ſix miles by land, but above twenty by water, by reaſon of the ebb and flow, which (as I have already ſaid) is different from other ſeas, the ſmalleſt tides falling out at the full of the Moone, but when the water is at the loweſt 'tis three fadome deepe round the Walls of the Town, ſo that ſhips ſafely enter the Haven, and are there very numerous. 'Tis thought there are fourty thouſand families in the Town, and the King dwells in a ſtately Pallace built of brick, with faire gardens unto it. The Town is pleaſantly ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:98515:49"/>The King keepes a great Court, followed by a gallant Nobility, and his chiefeſt guard conſiſts of women, as the cuſtom is in <hi>Jave, Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Franſiane,</hi> they put more truſt in them then in men, they march very gravely, are very valiant, and expert horſeriders and vaulters, uſe the Cimitere and buckler, and battle axes very dexterouſly: you muſt take a care to come neer them in their March, for they will abuſe you, calling you <hi>Gueriaer,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies bold villain, the King maintains a great many of them in his Pallace, and the handſommeſt are richly attired.</p>

The Captain of the guard carries in his hand a poyſoned noſegay, which (as it were by chance) he puts to the noſe of any perſon he hath a mind to kill, and he dies within two houres, or thereabouts,<note place="margin">Subtle poyſon.</note> or elſe he cauſes his hands and feet to be cut off. This cuſtomary law is with more rigour executed upon the inhabitants, then upon ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>If the women are ſurprized in their amours, they run no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and men are very ſeldom exempt from puniſhments. One of thoſe women being caught with a ſlave, was brought before the King, weeping, to excuſe her fault, ſhe ſaid, that had ſhe not conſented to that act, the ſtrangling of her matrix had killed her, which the King took for an excuſe, and ſentenc'd the ſlave to death, who was a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> and married his wife richly to a Lord of his Court.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Bengale</hi> is an Idolater, as generally all the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern are, he is valiant of Perſon, and can draw into the field a great Army, both of horſe and foot, wanting not wherewithall to maintain them, for his Countrey is rich in gold, ſilver, and jewels, he can draw forth two thouſand Elephants capariſon'd, their teeth are ſhodd with ſteele, and they will carry as many men as thoſe of <hi>Narſingue,</hi> they uſe hand-guns, muskets, ſwords, javelins, halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, and pikes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bengalians</hi> are the gallanteſt Perſons of the Eaſt, both men and women, both ſexes go richly apparel'd and perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. All other Nations of the <hi>Indies</hi> flock thither to ſpend their money, and chiefly to buy young ſlaves to attend and guard their women, and manage their buſineſſe; they are bought and ſold as horſes are here: they buy them young the ſafer to geld them; the Parents being poore, do not ſcruple to ſell their children to ſtrangers for three ſcore, four ſcore, and a hundred Ducates, more or leſſe,<note place="margin">Children ſold in market.</note> for they are ſure their children run no hazardous fortune, they being inſtructed in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Vertues.

The King of <hi>Orixa</hi> payes him tribute too, and many more Gentiles and Mahometans, although he himſelf in ſome manner acknowledges the great <hi>Mogull</hi>: he hath an Army ever ready to draw into the field upon an inſtant, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility being generally tributary, and releaſed from that duty, are obliged to ſerve their Prince upon his firſt ſummons, with a certain number of horſe, and other neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>And when they are engaged and obliged to it, the war once ended, the King rewards them with money and favour, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them as his children, and after a ſolemn feaſt prepared for them, diſmiſſes them home to repoſe.

Mid-<hi>May,</hi> untill Mid-<hi>Auguſt</hi>; and from mid-day, to mid-night; onely, as at <hi>Bengale,</hi> and as it happens, in moſt of the countries under that Zone. The King of the country diſcovering his ſubjects falſhood, (which cauſes him no ſmall contempt and prejudice) he forbids trading, and takes notice of what quantity of pepper or other Drugge or commodities each ſubject hath, and ſets ſuch a rate upon them, as they may gain thereby; then he ſends one of his chief officers with them to the Magazine, to trade and vent theſe commodities to ſtrange Merchants; &amp; they uſually exchange or put off their commodities for half the rate in ready mony, the other half in other ſorts of commodities. The <hi>Bahar</hi> of pepper which is 360. pound weight,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bahar</hi> Peper.</note> is worth three crowns and a half, or four at the deareſt, which amounts to about a Ducatoon, or 55. pence. Notwithſtanding this order, many are privately licenſed, to trade freely, and by help of the <hi>Portuguais</hi> interpreters, much is to be got. They have many ſorts of jewels, aromatick drugs, and moſt excellent balms; there is great plenty of all ſorts of fowl and fruit; they feed much upon <hi>Buffle,</hi> which they eſteem an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meat; their beefs have a ſwelling upon the top of their necks (like their Cammels) which is only fat: ſheep of no wool. There are many tame Elephants, and great ſtore of wild ones in the woods.<note place="margin">Hunting of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</note> Thoſe of <hi>Malaca</hi> who live upon the Continent with the Kings leave, come hither to hunt the Elephant, with their hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and engines, with many trumpets, hoboyes, and drums, with fire, to fright and to drive them up into a ſtreight, and when they have taken them, they almoſt famiſh them; then they bring them amongſt the tame ones; and by degrees make them ſo, feeding them gently, and otherwiſe inſtructing them, and in time they become very ready to learn, and ſerviceable in all things.</p>
               <p>The King himſelfe takes much content to feed them, and at ſuch times,<note place="margin">Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodites.</note> their allowance is doubled.

               <p>They have plenty of cattle, of wool, and poultry, which they feed at home, and of all neceſſaries to life. We have

               <p>And indeed we trade not with them without ſome danger, by reaſon of their cruelty, and brutiſhneſſe, ſince ſome ſhips coming from <hi>Malaca,</hi> to <hi>Sumatra,</hi> killed ſome of their people paſſing by, ever ſince they ſtood upon their guards, and have ſurpriſed as many as they could, and have ſtruck ſuch a terrour into thoſe parts, that whoever paſſes there, muſt be ſtrong and well adviſed, otherwiſe they are ſure to be robbed, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and eaten.</p>

               <p>They ſay it is 150 l. long, the breadth is undiſcovered, and ſome think it reaches the Continent Southward, runs from Eaſt to Weſt, and South,<note place="margin">Severall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</note> the Inhabitants are Idolaters, groſſe and brutiſh, and ſome are Anthropophager, it containes ſeverall Kingdomes, as <hi>Draſima, Dragoyan, Lembri, Falec, Sumara, Balambua, Bavarucam, Paſſeruan, Andrageda, Auri, Sandacanda, Bacani, Javara,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Javanians</hi> ſay they came from <hi>China,</hi> being oppreſſed with ſlavery, they left that place, and planted here, they were for a time Tributary to the great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartarye,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Falec</hi> abounds in gold, ſilver, ſpices, and all ſorts of cattell: the capitall Town is <hi>Biſmari,</hi> two dayes journey from an Iſland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cambahar,</hi> where is <hi>Baſma,</hi> a Town ſcituate upon the Sea, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, where are bred Elephants, Monkeys, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns. <hi>Dragoyen</hi> produces the Camphire, as <hi>Borneo</hi> the Braſill, and all Groceries; neer this place are the Iſles of <hi>Bombe, Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> and <hi>Java</hi> the leſſe.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Paſſeruan</hi> is a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> he demanded the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the King of <hi>Balambua</hi> in Marriage, and obtained her, and having enjoyed her, murthered her and all her train, becauſe ſhe was not of his Religion. <hi>Sandacanda</hi> and <hi>Bacani</hi> afford good ſtore of ſpices, their Kings are <hi>Mahometans,</hi> they were infected with that impoſture by a famous Pyrate, named <hi>Mahomet Chap,</hi> who left them two of his ſhips full of men to inſtruct them; there are ſtill ſome Idolaters amongſt them,<note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm eaten.</note> who have not left their old error, of ſtrangling their neereſt kindred, when they think them taken with incurable diſeaſes.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98515:55"/>
come (as the cuſtom was) to devour them, and indeed as they came to ſtrangle the poore men, they cudgelled them ſo luſtily that they left the ſport, and the man recovering his health, lived many years after; and thus was diſcovered the roguerie of thoſe <hi>Magitians,</hi> who thorough an inſatiate thirſt of blood, when a man was the leaſt indiſpoſed, made him believe he could not live, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to haſt to their fathers God. Then the poore patient with teares in his eyes, deſired them to cleanſe their bones, when they ſhould have conſumed their fleſh, believing that their ſoules would not be at reſt, til their fleſh were wholly conſumed, &amp; that then they would reunite to the body, and to remain in peace for all eternity.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the King underſtanding what had happened to <hi>Baſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> and his ſlave, cauſed him to be brought before him, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told him, that (if he would not devour the Magitian) he would put him to death. The other moſt willing, replyed, he was ready to obey his Prince, and that if the Magitian were brought him, he would eat him up raw in his very ſight. The Judges had already condemned him, and others for their deceipts and villanies to be baniſhed, and he &amp; others were fled into the Ile of <hi>Camorre</hi> for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but was taken, &amp; brought to <hi>Baſaram,</hi>

               <p>Theſe <hi>Canniballs</hi> ſay, we are very ignorant to ſuffer mans fleſh, (that is ſo ſweet and delicious) to rot under ground. The King keepes his Court in <hi>Gazima,</hi> guarded by women, which he truſts, rather then ſuch unnaturall and ſanguinary men: he maintains three or foure ſcore of the handſomeſt he can pick out, armed with Bowes and Arrowes, and Cimiteres. They are expert Archers, he traines them up, and ſends them to other Maritime Towns, as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Though theſe Iſlanders have many gold and ſilver mines, yet they dare not digg them, for going almoſt naked, the ſtones fall ſo ſharp, and keen upon them, they are not able to endure it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they value that treaſure at all, being very well ſtored with fleſh, fiſh, herbs and fruits, all in great abundance; but as I have ſaid, they are very likorous of mans fleſh, and of their neereſt kin, pretending they do it thorough charity, as they may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98515:56"/>
not be conſumed by the wormes.</p>
               <p>I was informed by a Merchant of an accident happened to two Fathers of the order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> puſhed on with a fervent zeale to endeavour the converſion of that Countrey, by the help of the language they had learnt, but they got nothing in requital but ſcorns and jeers, of thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> who let them live,<note place="margin">Two <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans</hi> eaten.</note> believing their Idols would revenge them, but ſome of them beginning to taſte and diſgeſt their rationall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, it bred ſome differences amongſt them; of which the King being informed, and fearing that their inſtructions might bring prejudice unto his State, commanded the good Fathers to be thrown into the Sea, thoſe villains unwilling to loſe their fleſh, drained their bloud dry, and fed upon it, then brought them to the publick place of execution, dead and disfigured.</p>
               <p>All thoſe that had taſted of their blood dyed ſuddenly, by the permiſſion or vengeance of God, which the King hearing of, aſked why they were not drowned according to his commands, and their falſe Prieſts replyed, it was not in their power to kill them: but the King ſatisfied of the manner of their death, all aſtoniſhed, went to his Temple to aſk his Idols forgiveneſs: ſome fourty Dutchmen having loſt their ſhip upon a ſhelve, ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon this coaſt, but taken by theſe Iſlanders were cruelly murdered,<note place="margin">Japara.</note> and eaten. The Inhabitants of <hi>Japara,</hi> (a Sea Town) adore the Sun, and are all flat-noſed, have great eyes, and are thin bearded like the <hi>Chyneſes.</hi> They eat bread made of a root they call <hi>Igname</hi> or <hi>Gouera,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Igname. Gouera.</note> their complexions (the womens eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) are rather fair than black: they wear nothing on their heads but their naturall hair platted, like the Italian Curtizans, and if any perſon offers to cover them with any thing, they are in danger of being abuſed to death.</p>
               <p>Their houſes are low, being but one ſtory high, for they will ſuffer nothing over their heads, they are all Pyrates, Thieves, and Magicians, they are ſkilfull in Aſtrology. They obey and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (an old Magician called <hi>Manguin</hi>) as their lawfull Prince: when any Pyrates land upon their coaſt, to rob them of their cattle,<note place="margin">Pirates how ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> or other commodities, the Wizard makes a round hole in the ground; and cauſes ſome young virgin voted, to be ſacrificed in their feaſt of <hi>Fotoque</hi>) to urine therein, and at the ſame time there riſes a ſtorm, ſo that the theeves have onely time to ſave themſelves, flying to their boats, and if any are left behind, they are devoured, nor do they kill them out-right, but prolong their dying pains, they pinnacle them, and deliver them up to the fury of the children, who put them to tedious torments, walking them about the Town, and expoſe them to the ſcoffs and abuſes of the multitude: ſome will clap a pompion on their heads hung round with plumes of feathers,<note place="margin">Cruelty of the <hi>Javans.</hi>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98515:56"/>
then having walked them warm, (as they do the Buls in <hi>Spain,</hi> to make their fleſh tender) they cut them in pieces, and divide their fleſh, if there be not enough for them all, they play at ball for it, and the gainers treat their friends therewith. This is the ſad fortune travailers are ſubject to, who according to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> proverb, <hi>Buſcan la vida y topan la muerte,</hi> ſearching for life they find death.</p>

This Town is of the ſize of <hi>Roan,</hi> peopled with divers nations, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have a Temple wherein they adore a triple-crown'd Demon, offer fruit and other things to him,<note place="margin">The devil adored.</note> and they ſay becauſe he is malicious he muſt be appeaſed, and that the great and good God hath no need of ſuch offerings or adorations.</p>
               <p>They bring into this Town their ſilks, jewels, and other rarities: here their King reſides, a Mahometan, who governs his own ſubjects and ſtrangers with great juſtice, allowing all perſons free liberty of traffick. He is a great Politician, well belov'd and honoured by his ſubjects, and obſerves good orders in commerce, wherein conſiſts the glory of his greatneſs: of late the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there with good ſucceſs, and very few years ſince ſome <hi>French</hi> have travelled thither, and have been courteouſly received;<note place="margin">

                  </note> they have a great eſteem of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and have permitted Dominicans (ſent out of <hi>France</hi>) to inhabit there, and promiſe them favour and aſſiſtance. The commodities that go off beſt there are iron and ſteel, lead, paper, and ſulphure.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Fedeyda</hi> (a Town in <hi>Java</hi>) is got the beſt amber-greece of the Eaſt,<note place="margin">Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris.</note> that which is found in <hi>Aniane</hi> (an Iſle adjacent) is equal unto the former in goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Not long ſince the greateſt part of <hi>Java,</hi> and the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, as <hi>Bali, Madura,</hi> and others, obeyed a potent Prince or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who kept his court in the great town of <hi>Demaa,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Japara</hi>; he was a Mahometan, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> relate how he had a mind to propagate his law, and obſerving the King of <hi>Paſaru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> (an Idolater) to ſlight it; he reſolved to invade him with a ſtrong Army made up of his own ſubjects, and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> of <hi>Malaca</hi>: his greateſt ſtrength conſiſted in certain Souldiers called <hi>Anoco,</hi> which ſignifies reſolute, and deſpiſers of their lives, perſons who uſed to anoint themſelves with certain oyls, to ſhew their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to dye, with theſe men he beſieged the King of <hi>Paſaruan,</hi> who ſtood gallantly upon his defence, but probably had in time bin

The boy taken, and put upon the rack, confeſſed no other reaſon, was ſtaked through with his father, brothers, and 60. of his kindred, and his whole generation according to their laws: and thus by this ſtrange accident the King of <hi>Paſaruan</hi> was freed, and the Empire of <hi>Demaa</hi> reduced to confuſion.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſignall thing in <hi>Java</hi> is the bone of a fiſh (found no where elſe) called <hi>Caball,</hi> that ſtops bleeding, as 'twas experienced upon a Captain of <hi>Malabar,</hi> called <hi>Neoboada Beguea,</hi> who killed in a fight againſt the <hi>Portuguais,</hi> in the time of <hi>Albukerke,</hi> his bloud never iſſued at his wounds untill that bone was taken away, which he wore about him. That rarity was loſt by ſhipwrack, as it was carried to King <hi>Emanuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Iſles of <hi>Sumatra, Java</hi> and others more remote, are very temperate, rich, and fruitfull in moſt of them, they live very long without any infirmity, the air is ſo healthfull in other places, if any perſon fall ſick he is left by kindred and friends, as defiled with ſin, and viſited by God for expiation, whereupon many hide themſelves when they are ſick, and die in holes without any help, ſome live to ſeven-ſcore years active and jolly, and for that reaſon many ſtrangers come thither to inhabit.</p>
               <p>Others reſort thither, for the trade of ſpices, which are extream cheap there.</p>
               <p>As in other parts there is ſuch plenty of Cattle, that they will give you four Cowes for an old ſhirt, a dozen of ſheep for a pewter ſpoon, a Sea-man once ſhewed an old brazen diſh to a Shepherd, who aſked the price, the Sea-man ſaid his whole flock, the other wondred not much at it; onely replyed 'twas ſomething too dear; I remember that in the Iſle of S. <hi>Laurence</hi> I ſaw a ſheep given for a counter, and as much for a ſheet of paper; this ſhews the goodneſſe of thoſe Countries, and the Inhabitants ſimplicity: moſt of them are civilized, living in the fear of one onely God, and believe, that in the next world the good will be rewarded, and the bad puniſhed; ſome have no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet they hold naturally the immortality of the ſoul, and one providence.</p>

                  </note>As touching the ſpices that grow in theſe Iſles.

about a pint, they are called <hi>Cani,</hi> by thoſe of <hi>Banda, Palla,</hi> the places they grow in are unwholeſom: Theſe trees grow naturally in the deſerts, and who ever pleaſe may gather them, ſome are planted and kept by particular perſons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Calenfour,</hi> or carnation Clove-tree, growing in the <hi>Melukes</hi> is a ſhrub leafed like to the almond, but is larger and longer, and bears Gillyflowers like wild grapes, it needs a prop to bear it up, for 'tis weak; they grow naturally, and from every flower that falls a tree or plant ſprings up in a ſhort time, and they ſuffer no other trees to grow about them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Sumatra</hi> the ſtalk is bigger, and can ſubſiſt alone, having the collar and trunk like a quince tree, but very upright, and caſts forth great ſtore of white bloſſoms, that become yellow, then red, and thickning they become of a blackiſh colour as they do here, they preſerve them green, and are excellent for the ſtomach, they are gathered from <hi>September</hi> to <hi>January.</hi>

               <p>There grows great ſtore of ginger in the Eaſt-Indies,<note place="margin">Ginger.</note> and chiefly in <hi>Nova Hiſpaniola,</hi> whence they tranſport yearly for <hi>Seville</hi> a hundred thouſand weight, this root is beſt if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved every third year, and beſt of all if removed yearly, when they gather it, they take away the earth, and cull the young root: from the old ones, which they replant and do eaſily take root in the weſt 'tis little worth, for in the Iſles of <hi>Barlovento</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> may have ſeven hundred weight for a crown.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Betell</hi> which we have ſo often ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Betel.</note> is a tree very common in all the Eaſterne parts, and alſo in the Weſt-Indies, where are many, as at <hi>Caramell,</hi> and called <hi>Eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rucou.</hi>

               <p>There are of them in the <hi>Preſte-Johns</hi> Country, and are kept for the Kings own uſe where er'e they grow; and 'tis death for any tradeſman or Merchant to eat of it, and he that watches the tree may kill any ſuch perſon, and not be queſtioned: for thoſe trees belong to the King, and none dare touch them,

               <head>CHAP. XXV. Of the Kingdomes of <hi>Malaca</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> with a prodigious Hiſtory of Serpents.</head>
               <p>LEaving all thoſe Iſles, to return into the Continent, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Sumatra</hi> Northward, ſtands the Town and Kingdom of <hi>Malaca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malaca: Ophir.</note> where is that ſo famous a ſpot of land, with her Cape and Streight called <hi>Sicapura,</hi> at one degree northward. <hi>Malaca</hi> is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent kingdom, formerly the golden <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> (as ſome yet hold) and the <hi>Ophir</hi> of <hi>Salomon,</hi> becauſe much gold is found in many places of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> contiguous to the other: the Ancients believed her joyned to the Continent, as you have heard already. This Country obeyed the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> untill a Lord of <hi>Java</hi> ſubjected her, and by the aſſiſtance of ſome fiſhermen, and Pyrates built the Town of <hi>Malaca.</hi> Since the <hi>Malacans</hi> became Mahometans, trading with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Guzerates,</hi> and at laſt <hi>Alphonſus Albukerke,</hi> ſurprized the Town for the King of <hi>Portugall</hi>; it is the center of the Eaſt for trade,<note place="margin">The traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick of <hi>Malaca.</hi>
                  </note> and the mart for all Merchandizes of the Eaſt-Indies, which improves her in grandeur, treaſure, and power. The language is eſteemed the ſmootheſt, moſt elegant, and copious of the Indies, as the mother of all their other tongues, which they diligently ſtudy: they are much addicted to Poetry, Amours, and other Gallantries. <hi>Malaca</hi> is ſcituate upon a pleaſant river called <hi>Criſorant,</hi> alluding to <hi>Chriſe,</hi> or land of gold, which others rather believe to be <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan</hi>: this river is not altogether ſo big as the <hi>Thames,</hi> and divides the Town in two parts, coupled by fair bridges ſtately built, as is the reſt of the Town. The people are very civill, of a good ſtature, but a little tann'd; the Country

abounds in fruit, ſubject to the King <hi>Siam,</hi> though the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> where they have a ſtrong Fort, and a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that brings in great Revenues, by reaſon of the cuſtomes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the infinite number of Merchandizes, are imported from forreign parts. Thoſe impoſts or cuſtomes were formerly paid to the King of <hi>Siam.</hi> The Captain hath two good ſhips, well rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and man'd, with which he ſcowres thoſe ſeas, and ſailes into <hi>China,</hi> loaden with wedges of gold and ſilver, cloves, pepper, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, linnen and woollen cloth, ſcarlets, ſaffron, corrall, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, vermillion, and all other exquiſite commodities of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and brings back from thence ſilks, purcelaines, ſatins, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask, harts-horn, musk, rubarbe, pearles, ſalt-peter, iron, ivory, boxes, and fanns; Theſe two places are eight hundred l. diſtant,<note place="margin">Quinſay.</note> and a great river, upon which (they ſay) ſhips are drawn by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants to <hi>Quinſay,</hi> capitall of <hi>Tabin,</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> where the ſhips ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving, ſalute the King with three peeces of Canon, and the Town with one, if they think good; then the Captain ſetting foot on land, is ſworn upon the Kings Picture, that he comes <hi>Bona Fide,</hi> to negotiate, and then he is admitted.

               <p>From <hi>Malaca</hi> we went to the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> very potent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, containing many Kingdomes.

                  <note place="margin">Marta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</note>FRom <hi>Siam</hi> we came to the Kingdom and Town of <hi>Martaban,</hi> ſometime ſubject to <hi>Pegu,</hi> but ſince to the King of <hi>Syam.</hi> It buts Weſtward upon the Gulfe of <hi>Bengale,</hi> Northward upon <hi>Pegu,</hi> Eaſtward upon <hi>Siam,</hi> and Southward upon <hi>Tanaſſerim</hi> and <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gome.</hi> The Fathers of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and thoſe of the Society have built them Churches there. The ſoyle is very fertile, yielding or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily three crops, the year; there is plenty of Rice, and other ſorts of grain, fruit, trees, ſweet and medicinall hearbes of all ſorts, mines of all mettalls, rubies and other ſtones, and the aire is very wholeſom.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gaypou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</note>The Capitall Town is <hi>Martaban,</hi> ſixteen degrees towards the North, hath a good harbor, and ſcituate upon the river <hi>Gaypoumo,</hi> or rather upon an arme of the ſea, where the tide runs ſtrangely toward <hi>Pegu</hi>; for whereas ordinarily it flowes by degrees, with an eaſie motion, without violence, here it fills that arme of the Sea, or River, on a ſudden, and flowes with ſuch fury and impetuoſity, as it were mountains rolled up in water, and the moſt rapid torrent in the world doth not parallel this in ſwiftneſſe; and by three paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages fills the harbor, and other receptacles, with a moſt fearefull force and rapidity. This arme is by the <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>Macaroou</hi> (which ſignifies) beware the <hi>Tyger,</hi> for the vehemence of the waves, which I will more amply ſpeak of in another place.</p>

                  <hi>Martaban</hi> joynes to the Territories of <hi>Dougon,</hi> the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Town of <hi>Pegu.</hi> The Inhabitants are given very much to trading,<note place="margin">Laque.</note> and eſpecially in <hi>Lacca,</hi> a kind of gumm they draw out of trees, very fine, and better then that is made in <hi>Dalaſcia,</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which I have already ſpoken of. They have many more <hi>Droggues,</hi> as Galingall, Turbith, or Camomell, Rubarb,<note place="margin">Rubarbe.</note> found upon the mountains of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and is called <hi>Jubara:</hi> The leafe is broad, and bitter as gall, they gather it in <hi>May,</hi> which is the latter end of their winter, the root is of a tan'd collour, ſome is yellow, purple, and red, according to the land

that bears it. Some ſeaſon their meat therewith, and 'tis a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt many infirmities; 'tis ſold very cheap, and is mingled with perfumes: there growes wood of <hi>Aloes,</hi> red <hi>Sendal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aloes·</note> and <hi>Cittern</hi> upon the hills. Women burn of all theſe to make concoctions, and uſe them in their labours, and delivered, they ſeek for a black-headed lamb, and carry the child to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, covered with flowers, drugges, and perfumes.</p>
               <p>Then they begin their ſacrifice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Banean</hi> &amp; <hi>Satalico</hi> ſacrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. <hi>Caſtigay</hi> an Idoll.</note> delivering their child and lamb into the hands of the <hi>Banean,</hi> or Prieſt called <hi>Satalico,</hi> the ſkin, head, feet, and entrals, fals to his ſhare, this is done in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Caſtigay</hi> their Idol. All thoſe <hi>Flamins</hi> are great Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; They caſt the childrens nativities new-borne, and ſet down, what ſhall befall them during their lives. This writing is carefully kept by the parents, for to prevent the bad accidents. For they eſteem whatever thoſe <hi>Baneans</hi> ſay infallible, and when any perſon is ſick, they are conſulted whether the party will dye or recover, and when they have given their opinion, 'tis believed as Goſpel. One being once (as I may ſay) condemned or ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to death by a Wizard, and left off; was undertaken by one of our company, and recovered in nine dayes, which made them believe the Chriſtians were more knowing then their Magicians: the like happened to another, whoſe wife was by a Chriſtian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, to ſhut out the Magician that had given his opinion of her husband; he recovering, was ſatisfied of the abuſes and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of their Magicians, <hi>Pagodes,</hi> and <hi>Caſtigais,</hi> and of their falſe Prieſts, and was alſo inſtructed in the truth, and purity of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that he might leave his own Idolatries: but Alas, the poor creatures heart being hardened, replyed: I believe (ſaid he) that thy God is great, and more powerful then ours, and that being ſo great and Majeſtical, he will not vouchſafe to make himſelf known to ſuch miſerable ſimple creatures, as we are; and it would be very unfit to believe a God were not willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us. Ours (ſaid he) makes his will known to us, which we all ſubmit unto, and obey, but I ſhall never more truſt the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans,</hi> for they are falſe Prophets: and upon theſe accidents, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them remove their habitations. It were eaſie to perſwade them to the truth, they being ſimple, and very credulous; and beſides, they bear a great reſpect to the memorie of Saint <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>: but opportunities to deſtroy their Idols are wanting, that they might ſee, they have neither force nor motion. 'Twere dangerous to attempt it, without a conſiderable ſtrength. Thoſe deceitful <hi>Baneans,</hi> do ſo enſlave the people, that they believe things ſtrange, and abſurd, beyond relation.</p>
               <p>In their feſtivals, when their Idols are carried in ſtate upon chariots, ſome of them (through zeal) throw themſelves under the wheels, and are broken in pieces. Others thruſt their heads into ſteel hoops, keen as razers, and cut their own throats, putting
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98515:61"/>
their feet in a rope faſtened thereunto: and ſuch are afterwards eſteemed Saints, and regiſtred in their Temples; others cut a hole in their ſides, and faſten a rope thereto, and are dragged by the Chariot after their Idol, then their friends ſay to them (remember that I have ever been thy friend) and believe he hath power to ſave them.</p>
               <p>Parents are reverenced, and if poor, they are aſſiſted upon the publick account.</p>
               <p>They have a ſolemn feaſt wherein they reckon up the twelve moons or moneths, with the twelve ſignes, and make great jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; when they draw their Idols upon Chariots, another of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins is drawn off one hand, to incenſe and perfume it.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Martaban</hi> there growes a fruit, which opened, repreſents the perfect figure of a Croſſe. At <hi>Martaban</hi> ſome years before, we made our travels there; a rich and potent King (as the <hi>Portuguais</hi> relate) named <hi>Chaubaina</hi> was beſieged by <hi>Bramaa</hi> of <hi>Pegu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chaubai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremity, he implored the aſſiſtance of <hi>Portugal,</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great treaſures, which for ſome conſiderations was denied; and the diſtreſſed Prince forced to deliver up himſelf, wife, and children, to that inhumane Tyrant of <hi>Pegu,</hi> who contrary to his promiſe, put them all to cruel deaths, and ſack't that flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town; and the <hi>Portuguais</hi> were much blamed for refuſing their aſſiſtance. There was a vaſt treaſure, and (they ſay) ſix and thirty thouſand Merchants all ſtrangers, that repaired thither from fourty ſeveral nations of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and other remoter pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as <hi>Portuguais, Greeks, Venetians, French, Engliſh, Abyſſins, Turks, Jewes, Arabians, Armenians, Tartars, Mogors, Corozans, Perſians, Malabarians, Javans,</hi> and many others. This Town had 24. gates.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pegu.</note>We went from <hi>Martaban</hi> to <hi>Pegu,</hi> four ſmall dayes journey di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant by land, and no more by ſea, although 'tis much further; but their Frigates fleet ſayling, bring all to one; and putting forth with the tyde; if your ſhip ſtrikes upon a Rock, and is able to bear the ſhock, it glides over, like a <hi>Balon,</hi> for no arrow flyes fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I have ſhot ſeven or eight times through the ſtreight of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar</hi> againſt tyde, but with full ſayles, and ſo you may ſtop in thoſe ſeas, without caſting Anchor, in expectation of better wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in <hi>Macaraou,</hi> the road to <hi>Pegu,</hi> 'tis impoſſible with the ſtrongeſt winds againſt tyde, to make a ſtand, for the waves there over-powre the winds, I have not ſeen the like fury of the ſeas in any place of the world as in <hi>Martaban</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> for there is a gulph of water, and the tyde taking her courſe, meets with thoſe waters, the one roling againſt the main body of the ſea, there is a terrible conflict, they withſtand each other for a time, at length the weakeſt muſt yield, the two bodies ſeparate with ſuch ſwiftneſſe and vehemency, that it ſeems a great hill overturned; nor is there a courage ſo great it daunts not, and where before a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98515:61"/>
hollow was ſeen empty and dry, covered over with ſhips; on a ſuddain, the Surges are ſo violent, you would believe, the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal powers were all united, to toſſe thoſe ſhips. I never yet heard a reaſon given for it, a ſearch worthy the labour of the greateſt wits in the world. I remember that ſome yeares after, meeting with a moſt famous Sea-Captain at <hi>Calis</hi> or <hi>Cales,</hi> I related him this wonder of <hi>Macaraou</hi> (ſaying that I ſhould not be credited, if I made any ſuch relation in print) he anſwered me that the words, or little faith of ignorant perſons, could not prejudice the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of knowing men, and that he himſelf (had he not ſeen) could not have believed the impetuous,<note place="margin">Seas from North and South meet in the ſtrait of <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi>
                  </note> and moſt violent encounter of two ſeas, from the North and South, in the ſtreight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> from the North the water entred 60. leagues within the ſtreight, from the South forty, where meeting with an unconceivable fury, they ſtrike horrour and amazement into all beholders; which made him believe the diſcourſes, and opinions of all natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers to be uncertain, ſince his own experience ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted them.</p>
               <p>He told me he was very deſirous to go witneſſe what I related of <hi>Macaraou,</hi> at <hi>Cambay,</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> but ſince I have diſcovered, that there is nothing liker to what I have ſaid of <hi>Macaraou,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Maskaret</hi> of <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux.</hi>
                  </note> then the <hi>Maſcaret</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> That is well known to be a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of water gathered together (in the River of <hi>Dourdonne</hi>) while the waters are all quiet; that mountain is framed on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and rolles down the river, overturning what boats ſoever are in the way, which every man endeavours to avoyd, making with all haſte to the ſhoare.</p>
               <p>I have aſked the reaſon of the Inhabitants, who have told me it proceeded from the height of the Seas, meeting with the ebbe of the River, and by that encounter this water gathers together, but others agree not to this, for (if ſo) the like would happen in the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and in other places, which I never heard of:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Garonnne</hi> River.</note> ſo that with more reaſon they attribute the cauſe to ſome ayre incloſed in ſome channel or ſpring under ground, running from <hi>Garonne</hi> to <hi>Dourdonne,</hi> which raiſes this mountain of water when the Sea flows: but I know not whether the ſame reaſon might be given for <hi>Macaraou.</hi>

               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> is one of the largeſt, richeſt,<note place="margin">Kingdom of <hi>Pegu.</hi>
                  </note> and moſt potent of the <hi>Indies,</hi> next to <hi>Mogor,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> but to the two laſt are lately happened ſtrange revolutions, they are extremely fallen off from their ſtate, and have been diſmembred by the Kings of <hi>Tangu,</hi> and <hi>Aracan,</hi> who had in my time the poſſeſſion of the white Elephant, that bred ſo much contention in <hi>Siam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Empire of <hi>Pegu</hi>'s length. Town of <hi>Pegu.</hi>
                  </note> This kingdom in my days contained many others, <hi>viz.</hi> two Empires containing 26. crowned States; Southward, <hi>Pegu</hi> confines upon <hi>Martaban</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> Eaſtward upon <hi>Brama, Cambay,</hi> and <hi>Cochin, China,</hi> Northward upon <hi>Ava Tazatay,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aracan,</hi> Weſtward upon <hi>Bengale</hi> and the gulf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:98515:62"/>The Town of <hi>Pegu</hi> is very large and ſquare, 5. gates at every ſquare or ſide, encompaſſed with a deep work or trench full of Water-Crocodils, and other dangerous Serpents. The walls are built of wood, with Watch-towers of rich work, and gilt, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red every tenth year. The houſes are ſtately edifice. At new <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu</hi> the King keeps his Court, the ſtreets are exactly ſtreight, and large; about the heart of the town you diſcover almoſt all the ſtreets, which is a gallant curioſity; old <hi>Pegu</hi> is built after the ſame model, and there the Merchants inhabit: In new <hi>Pegu</hi> the ſtreets are ſet with Palm-trees, and <hi>Cocos</hi> loaden with fruit; the new was framed and built by the line near a foreſt of Palmes towards the North in a large field: in the trenches (filled with water by the river that waſhes that coaſt) there are certain baths accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted purpoſely; and very ſafe from Crocodils, otherwiſe ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming were very dangerous. The Town is as bigge as <hi>Fez,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is the old and new, as <hi>Pegu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Pegu</hi> is ſo potent that he never goes to war with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a million and a half of men, well armed, with Arquebuſes and other Guns: they are the beſt Gunners in the world, but not many of them, and their Guns are far better then ours, being made of better iron, better temper'd, and better wrought. They have a 100000. good ſouldiers.<note place="margin">Iron Guns:</note> they live of little, and for need upon leaves and roots, and are gallant and reſolute men. His guard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of 30000. horſe,<note place="margin">Good horſes, and from whence.</note> either <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Perſian:</hi> and to have them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at a pinch, there is an edict or law, that what Merchant ſoever brings 20. horſes to be ſold, ſhall have the reſt of his commodities free, which make them furniſht from all parts of the <hi>Indies, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Soltania</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> where are the beſt of the world; the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers exerciſe themſelves much at marks, and often, the King gives rewards to the beſt marks-men. He may have 5000. Elephants, and many other beaſts. Merchants follow the Armies upon bulls and oxen.</p>
               <p>The country is rich in Mynes of Gold and Silver, Rubies, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrs, Garnets, and other ſtones: Theſe daily augment the Kings treaſures: his Magazines may paſſe for the treaſure of the Eaſt. In one Court of his Pallace at new <hi>Pegu,</hi> there is ſuch ſtore, that 'tis little eſteemed,<note place="margin">Statues of beaten gold.</note> not one man to guard it, nor the dores kept ſhut: There ſtands the figure or ſtatue of a proper tall man, all of beaten gold, a crown upon his head of the ſame, enriched with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies of ineſtimable value; and round it four ſtatues more of youths all of gold, which ſeem to be Idols, (yet they ſay) they were made for delight.<note place="margin">Other of ſilver.</note> In another Court is repreſented a Gyant ſitting, of ſilver, with a Crown of the ſame, but far richer ſet with Jewels: in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:98515:62"/>The <hi>Peguans</hi> go all cloathed alike, in Cottons, linnens, and ſilks the beſt, and all are barefoot ever, whether walking or riding; the country abounds in Sugars, which they make great and many uſes of, they cover their houſes with it, and mingle it with ciment, Their buildings are coſtly carved and wrought, ſparing neither Gold nor Azure. When the King or any Noble-man builds a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he provides himſelf with the pureſt gold to guild it. For there, as in many other places of the <hi>Indies</hi> Gold is not coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is merchandize: at <hi>Tahaba,</hi> or old <hi>Pegu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tahaba.</note> are many refy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and gold and ſilver beaters, they work it into leaves (as we do) for the eaſe and benefit of the Gilders, without committing much waſte, for they gild, (as I have ſaid) the very walls and towers, and their houſes after the <hi>Perſian</hi> faſhion. New <hi>Pegu</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all ſo built, and nothing ſpared to make up a ſumptuous ſplendid ſtructure, they cover them with tortoiſe ſhell, which they place and joyn very neatly. There is a certain place, where Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Litters, Trunks, Boxes, Saddles, Harneſs for Elephants and horſes, are only made, covered with gold and ſilver; I ſaw there a ſaddle and furniture for an Elephant, bought at a very high rate, for their King.</p>
               <p>What is moſt remarkable of their buldings is, that thoſe that live of their own rents or eſtates are contented with the meaneſt and pooreſt houſes: they are convenient, but like country houſes, and thatch'd with ſtraw, and only able to preſerve them from the injuries of the weather. The Merchants and other tradeſmen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Goudons</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> houſes.</note> and ſhop-keepers, who have ſomething to loſe out of their ſhops, or warehouſes, they live in ſtrong houſes well built, of ſtone &amp; brick, cloſe ſhut with ſtrong gates and locks, and call thoſe houſes <hi>Godons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Throughout all the Towns of <hi>Pegu,</hi> there are the <hi>Taregha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Taregha.</note> or perſons ſworn, to ſee good meaſure and weight made of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, to the Merchants they have charge of: and if a bad bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be made, the fault is laid on them,<note place="margin">Faithful trading.</note> with diſcredit and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which they eſcape ſometimes very narrowly: ſo you take much pleaſure to trade with them, they are ſo faithful and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and a moſt excellent order is obſerved both in buying and ſelling: and whatever is either bought or ſold, is put in a lump into the <hi>Senſals,</hi> who gives notice of the number, and ſets a price upon them; and ſets a rate of what they ought freely to get over and above all charges whatever: if the price be liked, the mony is payed, and the <hi>Senſal</hi> keeps an exact account; for they are able choſen men.

               <p>You hear for what reaſons the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> waged this war, that bred ſo much ruine and deſolation, for a white Elephant onely, a fatal and unhappy beaſt, as <hi>Sejans</hi> horſe hath proved to all that ever poſſeſſed him, and hath coſt five Kings their lives, and whole Eſtates, as it happened to the laſt King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> who had it lately taken from him by the King of <hi>Aracan,</hi> by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the King of <hi>Tangus</hi> his Brother-in-law.

               <p>After this worthy miracle, ſome <hi>French</hi> Jeſuites at <hi>San-Thomas,</hi> obtained leave of the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> to build a Church in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the miracle.

Thoſe Elephants are exceeding ſtrong,<note place="margin">Telanſin.</note> the King takes great content to be drawn upon a <hi>Telanzin,</hi> which is a kind of litter, but with four wheeles: One day I heard him command his <hi>Nangin,</hi> or chiefe Coachman, to make his <hi>Telan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin</hi> ready, deſirous to take the aire. Two of the Elephants being brought forth to be ſhewen the Prince <hi>Souac,</hi> he praiſed them to be two of the ſtrongeſt in the World, he let one of them looſe out of his hand, that took up the litter, (with all belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, as wheeles and draughts) in his teeth, and carried it before the Prince, and ſet it ſoftly down, as if it had been a ſmall weight, and yet it was 500. weight.

fifty pounds to their portions, beſides they are turned into the fields, and feed upon ſycamore leaves, and other pleaſing leaves, they love cooleneſs, and bathe in thoſe ponds: they are ſubject to the bloody flux, and heat is very troubleſom to them. When the waters are not high enough to cover them, they lie down and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, their naturall diſcretion is ſuch, that they never mingle with females before company, they go two years with their young, and live two hundred.</p>

               <p>When they are tame they are lodged in a Princely roome, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over, with imagary and forreſt work, and are fed in ſilver, the King eſteems them the ſtrength of his Army, they are richly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and eat bread, they are fed with ſeverall ſorts of corn, or grain boyled, as barly, rice, lupins, and others, they love fruit, but care neither for fleſh, nor ſiſh.</p>

               <p>I remember that in this ſolemnity a baſe fellow croſſed the ſtreet before the Royal Throne, the beaſts ſtopt ſuddenly, and could not be driven on till the Criminal was brought unto them, who expected death, a toſſe or two at the leaſt. They gazing upon one another ſcorned to touch him, one of the riders beat the fellow ſorely with his bridle; Their Governour told them with fair words, that they had done an act worthy themſelves; the beaſts ſatisfied, continued their march.</p>
               <p>I ſaw a mighty big one preſented to the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> by him of <hi>Siam</hi> his Tributary. The King immediately commanded meat to be brought him, to know his breeding, for the beſt bred eat with great modeſty; but he that brought him ſaid, that if he had drink, he could live without food: he that had the charge of the reſt, either for ſcorne, or to diſparage the beaſt's nature, brought him water in a foule veſſell, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant gave him a diſdainfull look, and putting his tronk into his mouth, ſpouted a great quantity of ſtinking and hot water upon the Maſters head, who returned him a blow with a ſtaff upon the head, the Elephant immediately killed him with his tronk.</p>
               <p>The King admired his prudence, and cauſed him water to be brought in a clean ſilver veſſell, and bought him harneſſe, moſt rich and magnificent; they are ſometimes ſerved in golden veſſells, and with great reſpect, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they will kill their Keeper for the leaſt offence.</p>
               <p>They are capable both of hearing and underſtanding, and learn whatever is taught them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. Continuation of <hi>Pegu,</hi> of the Government and Policy, of Superſtitions, and Magicians.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>PEgu</hi> is innumerably peopled with very good ſubjects, ready upon the leaſt command to give obedience, and execute, (and they ſay) that to ſerve their Prince, is to ſerve God: and hold their companions moſt happy, who dye in the Kings ſervice; when the King will raiſe an Army, he enrolls, the number he requires, with their names, their qualities, by certain itinerant Heralds, or <hi>Calfenes</hi> who publiſh the war abroad, with flaming Torches in their hands,<note place="margin">How they raiſe an Army.</note> as I have already ſaid. They ride on <hi>Dromada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and change often: and they are kept in moſt towns for the Princes ſervice, as are our Poſt-horſes. When the people are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Kings will, they generally leave home, wife, and children, and follow the King; every town and village hath a treaſurer, who duely pay the penſions allotted by the King, and every one is ſure of a livelyhood, according to his merit in the Kings ſervice, which is faithfully diſcharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Triennial Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note>The Governours of all towns have triennial commiſſions, and are promoted according to their birth to the kings favour, and the peoples free conſent. They behave themſelves with great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and diſcretion; and take care the Kings treaſure ſhould be diſtributed to them that ſerve beſt, to their wives and children, and implore them in honourable occupations, according to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, capacity, and the occaſion of ſervice, there being publick work-houſes purpoſely maintained; where the third part of the people are continually imployed: as Mynes, Paper-mils, Silk-works, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar engines, and other trades, and works belonging to the King. If a ſoldier returned from war complains to the King, that his General had not diſtributed to his family, what the King had commanded: The General is preſently ſent for, laid flat upon the ground or table, where ſome Courtier takes a cudgel (with three whip-cords at the end, and a ball of ciment faſtned thereto) ſtriking upon the ground without touching the man, and the King aſks why he had not payd the <hi>Zimbou,</hi> or allowance to the ſoldiers family:<note place="margin">Zimbou.</note> the other muſt confeſſe the truth, and if he doth alledge any reaſonable excuſe, he hath not ſo many ſtripes, but he hath three at leaſt given him however. The exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner ſtrikes upon the ground, untill the King commands otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:98515:67"/>The criminal is next helped up by his friends, and makes the King a low reverence, giving thanks for the mercy he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in not ſtripping him. Then the King either invites him to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner himſelf, or ſome other Noble-man, and the puniſhment he ſuffered, is not held diſgraceful, nor ignominious. The trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſound gives the King notice of his coming, and at his going it ſounds twice, and the multitude cry out, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or Governour of ſuch a place was retiring. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſts himſelf at the Kings feet, and kiſſes the ground, the King imbraces him, and preſents him with ſome rich <hi>Carcanet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> or chain of Gold, or Jewels: ſo diſmiſſes him, as content, as if he had got a kingdom, and this is a credit to them.</p>
               <p>Suits in Law are ſoon decided, for if a man be at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with his neighbour, the firſt <hi>Danubir,</hi> or Juſtice,<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decided;</note> they appeale to, decides it upon the place.</p>
               <p>The King once a week, ſits in his ſeat of Juſtice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides differences of the greateſt importance, by, and with the aſſiſtance of a <hi>Naire</hi> or Gentleman, that holds him a golden cup to ſpit in: 'Tis held ſhameful to ſpit on the ground in the Kings ſight, but they ſpit in handkerchers.</p>
               <p>The King before he riſes, drinks <hi>Areca</hi> and <hi>Betel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Areca. Betel.</note> brought him by one of his women, and another of his favourites an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noints his body with a certain oyle, or ſweet balſome, to preſerve his health. Moſt of thoſe nations eat on the ground, and uſe leaves, inſtead of cloathes, they eat in curious wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den veſſels, artificially painted, in various manners; others are ſerved in <hi>Purcelain,</hi> which will not endure poyſon, no more then the wood <hi>Avate.</hi> At his riſing from his ſeat of juſtice, a Merchant preſents him with ſome delicate drink; he hath a guard of a hundred <hi>Naires,</hi> armed with ſhort ſwords hanging by their ſides, in ſcarſes richly embroydered with gold and jewels: There are many Gold-ſmiths, as are in moſt parts of the Eaſt. He hath other Gentlemen of his guard armed with ſteele bowes gilt, and neatly enamel'd:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peguans</hi> Armes.</note> they are expert bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and are trained up from their infancy; the guard of 100. <hi>Naires,</hi> beſides their ſwords bear quivers and arrows gilt,<note place="margin">The Kings march.</note> with a marvellous ſtrong Cane that never breaks with a Pike or Fork at one end; azured at both ends like a walking ſtaffe: They march in order. A Noble-man bears the Kings ſword before him, another his buckler, made of Tortoiſe ſhels, garniſhed with Diamonds, and Rubies, as bright as the Sun.</p>
               <p>The King weares the <hi>Tiara</hi> richly adorned with gemmes: at one ſide of him a Lord carries a <hi>Paraſoll,</hi> before him walk two jeſters, with ridiculous motions and geſtures, relating how they had like to have killed one another: the King is very much pleaſed with ſuch Fictions and Drolleries.</p>
               <p>One of theſe <hi>Bouffoones,</hi> known in many languages, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98515:68"/>
very much Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> of the ſocieties company, by whom,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> jeſter baptized.</note> he was inſtructed, and ſatisfied of the truth of our religon, and reſolved to be baptized.</p>
               <p>The Father advertiſed the King, he conſented, and the man was preſently baptized, and entertained for a time amongſt thoſe good fathers: mean while, his wife not willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her huſbands example, aſſembled her friends and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated her huſbands funeral, as for a dead man, and built him a tombe, where they made pitiful moanes, with many ſeperſtitions, bringing the women thither to weep and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they all dined together upon his Tomb. They do this, that the wife of a newly baptized Chriſtian, may marry; otherwiſe they hold her conſenting to her huſbands Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>This new Convert was named <hi>James,</hi> he came fourty days after his Baptiſme, to ſalute the King, who deſired to know whether he would perform his office as before, and that his penſion ſhould be ſtill continued (he replyed) Sir, I ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you in the ſtead of a dead man, but now I will ſerve you alive, and retyring with the Fathers, he was not ſeen of two moneths, in which time his wife married another of meaner quality. But as I have heard, ſhe would have returned to her firſt huſband, and become a Chriſtian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied and perſwaded thereunto by a <hi>Portuguais,</hi> but her huſband would not conſent thereunto; knowing it could not availe him much.<note place="margin">Big canes.</note> Then ſhe married a Rope-maker, which is a great trade there, for they have great need of Lines, Ropes, Reeds, and Canes, which they cleave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Cables, and other tackling for ſhips. The biggeſt of thoſe Canes they make Pikes or Lances of for Horſe-men, as the <hi>Mores</hi> uſe, and of the ſtrongeſt they make, Cheſts or boxes; for they never break; of others they make hoops, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and halfe barrels, to keep their drink or water in. There are of them, of an incredible ſize.</p>
               <p>In this country (as well as throughout the <hi>Indies</hi>) they bear a great reſpect to the Image of the bleſſed Virgin, and to the memory of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> who hath wrought many miracles in the country. He raiſed from death to life a brother of the King of <hi>Granganor,</hi> who became chriſtian thereupon, and built a Church upon the ſide of a little hill near the Sea, dedicated to that Saint, and left great revenues thereunto, which are continued to this day, but are very ill deſerved. They ſay that the ſame King of <hi>Granganor,</hi> and another brother named <hi>Abanachacon,</hi> and that the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> deſired S. <hi>Thomas</hi> to vouchſafe him a viſit, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to become a Chriſtian, upon condition he might enjoy all his women, which (as he alledged) he could not live without, by the frequent prayers and interceſſion of this Saint, his concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence was wholly allayed and aſſwaged; and in a viſion this King
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98515:68"/>
thought himſelf dipped in a pond by three celeſtial vertues,<note place="margin">A Viſion. A heathen King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</note> to cleanſe him of all filth and ſenſuality, from thence lifted up into heaven, and made partaker of the heavenly glory, and received knowledge of his ſalvation, and was baptized by St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and by his good prayers obtained of God Almighty, that his tomb (built of tranſparent marble) ſhould be ever full of that water wherein he was purified, that ſhortly after this King ended his dayes wounded in a battle he fought, to aſſiſt a Brother of his againſt King <hi>Sangiſcan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bramins</hi> who at preſent have the poſſeſſion of this Church, where ſtands this Tomb, ſay that his body is covered over with water to this very day, which is ſeen through the tranſparency of the marble, at the light of three bright-burning lamps, and that this Tomb is four fathom height raiſed from the ground. This they relate of it. And I remember I have ſeen at <hi>Arles</hi> (in <hi>Rolands</hi> Chappel, in the Church of St. <hi>Honoretus,</hi>) an ancient Marble monument replete with water, which increaſes and diminiſhes according to the motions of the Moon; and let the air be never ſo hot or dry, yet at full Moon the Tomb is full of water. They relate as much of another in the Church of St. <hi>Severinus,</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Lord viſiting this wonder, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me he had ſeen the like in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as at <hi>Verona</hi> in St. <hi>Zeno's</hi> Church, the ſepulture of <hi>Pepin,</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> Son of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> is ſeen full of water: many things are naturally known to riſe and fall according to the courſe of the Moon, as the ebbe and flow of the Sea, ſtones, plants, and animals. They hold that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> (as I have already ſaid) was martyred at <hi>Granganor,</hi>

               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory ſaith that his body was tranſlated from <hi>Meliapur,</hi> or <hi>Calamina,</hi> to <hi>Edeſſe,</hi> from thence to <hi>Ortuna</hi> in <hi>Pouilla.</hi> The Chriſtians (that are in the <hi>Indies,</hi> who ſtile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſay they are inſtructed from Father to Son, by that Saint, are <hi>Neſtorians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Neſtorians.</note> and infected with many more hereſies, for to this day they are inſtructed by the <hi>Syrian</hi> hereticks.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> Kings rely much upon Magicians and Conjurers: the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> maintains one in his Court, to foretell what he deſires to know; he was called <hi>Bongi</hi> or <hi>Bonze,</hi> (as their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators are called) a bruitiſh man addicted to all ſorts of vices and abominations, yet he is the Kings minion. He carries ever in his hand a very keen hanger, like a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cymeter, onely more bow'd, dreſſed in two Monkeys ſkins, which he wears, the one before the other behind, hung all over with bells, to the weight
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98515:69"/>
of fifty pounds, which make a hideous noyſe: upon a time the King taking the air in a chariot, ſpied one of his choiceſt Ladies at a window, he ſent for her to take the air upon the lake in a barge, or <hi>Gondola,</hi> covered and richly adorned, they were no ſooner both in,<note place="margin">Tempeſt.</note> but a ſudden and dangerous ſtorm aroſe from the weſt; that overcaſt and clouded the ſkies. The King preſently called to his <hi>Bongi,</hi> to clear the air; the Conjurer immediately made a hole in the ground, wherein he urined, and uſing ſtrange Conjurations, many Devils came forth of the earth, making a moſt horrid and fearfull din, and howling, ſcattered the clouds, and tempeſt; the King made with all ſpeed to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, putting no great confidence in his <hi>Duma,</hi> for fear of being overturned.</p>

'Twas the ſame Magician, (who as I have already ſaid, treating of the <hi>Maldives</hi>) undertook to bring birds and beaſts out of the inchanted Iſle of <hi>Pallouis,</hi> and was ſoundly beaten for his raſh undertaking, and brought back onely with life enough to witneſſe his ſhame.</p>

               <p>As throughout <hi>Arabia</hi> they obey the <hi>Seque,</hi> or <hi>Sequemir,</hi> in ſpirituals, ſo do they in the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu</hi> their <hi>Abedale,</hi> of a Sect called <hi>Abedali,</hi> and there are of them at <hi>Malabar.</hi> They are <hi>Santons,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXIX. Of the Idols in <hi>Pegu,</hi> bloudy Sacrifices, Exorciſms, ſtrange Communions.</head>
               <p>WE have mentioned before how the Rivers of the Country yield the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> a grand revenue in fine gold,<note place="margin">Idols of <hi>Pegu.</hi>
                  </note> which he deſigns for embelliſhment of his Temples and Idols, whereof they have abundance of ſuch extravagant effigies, as the Devil preſents to their fancies.

At the Princes Palace in the back Court, there are abundance of theſe Idols, all of pure gold, with Crowns, enriched with gems, as I ſaid before; one amongſt the reſt of a prodigious heighth, they call <hi>Apalita,</hi> who aſſiſts pilgrims and travellers, through the world, whoſe Temple no man viſits but with ſome preſent, which is converted to the uſe of the Prieſts, who ordinarily have wives and children.

adoration would think to have ſome miſerable end before they returned home, if they brought not ſome offering with them, ſo as he that hath but a leather to cover his pudenda, will take it off to offer to the Idol: others will preſent little bels of ſilver and gold which they hang at their genitories, in little rings drawn through the fleſh, which they do to be the better eſteemed of women, teſtifying herein that they delight in no other ſex but theirs. Some there are ſo ſuperſtitiouſly devout,<note place="margin">Bleeding ſacrifices.</note> that they will cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to immolate the bloud to their Idol. 'Tis ſomething proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the <hi>Turks</hi> who ſo ſcarifie their bodies for devotion, learnt it of the <hi>Indians,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> contains no ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts confirm them vigorouſly in this Idolatry, and ſome there have been who meeting poor <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Merchants and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, ignorant of their cuſtom paſſing by their Temple, have cruelly cut their throats, and ſacrificed them to their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palita.</hi> But the Jeſuites complaining to the King, and ſhewing him the horrour and indignity of ſuch an execration, he ſentenced to death 70. of theſe abominable Prieſts, and the ſentence had paſſed further even to their wives and children, but for the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fathers. Notwithſtanding their devotion, the people looked upon this execution patiently, and without the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, for the affection they bear their Prince. Likewiſe through the ſupplications of thoſe Fathers, they were freed from a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall diſeaſe then reign'd amongſt rhem.</p>
               <p>Some amongſt theſe Prieſts uſe holy aſhes and holy water alſo. They are the aſhes of things ſacrificed to the Idols, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of ſuch as have made themſelves voluntary ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.

They believe this <hi>Pagode,</hi> aſſiſts them in their wars, and as their <hi>Mars</hi> renders them victorious: They coin money in honour of him, and ſtamp his name upon it: But he is not alwaies effectuall in his aſſiſtance, for at the time they ſacrificed the poor <hi>Portugueſe</hi> I told you of, the Inhabitants of <hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Malacca</hi> for revenge mann'd eight Gallions and ſome Carvells, put in at one of their Towns, which they took poſſeſſion of,<note place="margin">Idols de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe.</hi>
                  </note> thence advanced to another which they pillaged, burnt the Temples and Idols, with all the Prieſts, their wives and children.</p>
               <p>'Twas at the time the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> was gone to the Conqueſt of <hi>Siam,</hi> ſo as the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> alarm'd the whole Countrey, and had <hi>Don Alouſe d' Aquila,</hi> who commanded the Foot, arrived in time, they had eaſily carried the Town of <hi>Pegu</hi> it ſelf, taken the Kings treaſure, with the Idols rich in gold, ſilver, and precious ſtones, which had been a wealth ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.

They put abundance to the ſword, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way numbers of priſoners: But at the Kings return the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites reconciled the difference betwixt them; at which time 'twas accorded that at new <hi>Pegu,</hi> in honour of the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bleſſed Virgin, a Church ſhould be built at the Kings charges, which in theſe parts is no novelty, where from time out of memory, as I ſaid, they have had an image in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Virgin with her infant, illuſtrated with three lamps, and the Temple of God where this image was reverenced, was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with divers ſorts of Prieſts.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Pegu</hi> this while was much incenſed for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, the violence and indiſcretion of theſe Prieſts had brought upon him, and conceived a hope that the very Idols would take ſome revenge for the injuries they had ſuffered from the <hi>Franques Ramatas,</hi> ſo they call the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but he was perplexed, when inſtead thereof,<note place="margin">The tooth of an ape.</note> he obſerved them perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proſperous, daily overturning more Idols, as they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others burnt the famous Apes tooth adored in <hi>Zelan,</hi> which he would have purchaſed at the rate of ſo many thouſand crowns, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Another Idoll they have, called <hi>Fotoque,</hi> (as likewiſe in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> and <hi>China</hi>) of the ſame ſtature as the other,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fotoque</hi> an Idoll.</note> but of different matter, of lead and braſſe mixt, ſuch as their money is made of. They tell us this Idol with his interceſſion inclines their <hi>Duma,</hi> and obtains grace for all, in particular, for ſoules condemned to black and dark places. The <hi>Palpas</hi> are obliged to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to him every Saturday a black ſwine, and three pullets of the ſame colour. Poultry in this Country contrary to the ordinary, have their fleſh black, which they call <hi>Fare,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fleſh of hens black.</note> and makes the pottage black, nevertheleſſe very ſavoury. All the Sacrifices paſſe into the Prieſts bellies, for they burn nothing but the liver with aromatick odours, and pulverizing the bones, mix it with their holy waters.</p>
               <p>When they would have any ſacrifices brought to their Idol, they go about the Town, ringing a Bell made like a Still,<note place="margin">Sacrifices for the dead.</note> and ſay this is to ſupplicate for ſome of their friends, who are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the black ſhades; for as to thoſe which immitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other bodies, as of oxen or cows there to be kept till the day of judgement, they hold them well quartered,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For this cauſe the <hi>Peguans</hi> had a cuſtome to eat none of theſe ſorts of fleſh, as in <hi>Malabar</hi> and other places; but ſince ſuch time as their <hi>Duma</hi> in a viſion gave precept to one of their <hi>Chaouris,</hi> to uſe all living beaſts indifferently, and that a ſoule condemned to the body of one beaſt, when that dyed, paſſed into the body of another, they have made no further difficulty to eat it. For ſuch beaſts they have
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98515:71"/>
a reverence,<note place="margin">Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Aſſes for chaſe.</note> and bow to them as they would ſalute a friend.</p>
               <p>They have a ſort of ſmall Aſſes that come from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Beluacarin,</hi> almoſt all red and black, or black and white, which they hunt and take with hayes like Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and being brought to hand ſerve for many uſes, but are of low price, by reaſon they hold ſoules never enter them, their fleſh is ſo faint and diſagreeable: we met with heards of them in the Champian, which appeared to be tame, ſuffering one to come ſo near as to lay hand on their neck; when on a ſuddain they ſprung away like Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, and returned about a quarter of an hour after. They are not ſo courtly to them as to other beaſts, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the Prieſts have put in them: and as we in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion would ſalute them, they would reprove us, and tell us, their great <hi>Duma</hi> had commanded <hi>Fotoque</hi> to curſe the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Aſſes, and the ſoules that ſhould take up habitation in them.</p>
               <p>They have likewiſe many other Gods, as that they call the god of atomes in the Sun, and others. Hell, they call the dark cavern of the houſe of ſmoak, where a horrible Serpent devoures ſoules, and whence one of their gods frees them by his power.</p>
               <p>In a word, 'tis ſtupendous to conſider the number of gods and Idols in their ſeverall temples; their Monaſteries, Prieſts, Monks, Hermits, Sects, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their belief likewiſe of the Creation of the world is ſtrange, and of the ſin of the firſt man, all disfigured with a thouſand fables. For in the year 1557. a <hi>Cordelier,</hi> one <hi>Bonfer</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> being at <hi>Goa,</hi> moved with a pious vocation, went to preach the Goſpel in theſe parts, and going to <hi>San Thomas,</hi> and thence by Sea to Port <hi>Coſmin,</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> did what could be done by Sermon to impreſſe the faith in theſe people, but with ſmall effect they were ſo hardned,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peguans</hi> whence derived.</note> ſo as after ſome ſufferings, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to return from whence he went. He learnt, that 'tis held the <hi>Peguans</hi> deſcended originally from certain Jews, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times baniſhed,<note place="margin">The <hi>Pegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> creed.</note> and by <hi>Salomon</hi> condemned to work in the mines of <hi>Ophir:</hi> that they believed an infinity of ſucceſſive worlds to all eternity, innumerable gods receding reſpectively to the diverſe worlds, and lyable to death at laſt. That men having paſſed thorough all ſorts of animalls at laſt became Gods, and that theſe Soules after many ages being purified in certain appointed places, and having returned diverſe times into theſe new worlds at laſt, were placed ſome in Paradiſe, others in Hell, and ſome reduced to <hi>Niban,</hi> that is, nothing, and a thouſand other dreams. After this <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> came the Jeſuites with better ſucceſſe, by means of ſome
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98515:71"/>
ſignal ſervices they did them,<note place="margin">Jeſuites in <hi>Pegu.</hi>
                  </note> in certain popular maladies they were infected with. As amongſt others, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> of the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the time that an epidemical peſtilence deſtroyed innumerable people in <hi>Pegu,</hi> a Chriſtian Townſman came and beſought his interceſſion for his family, that was wholly infected; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demanding wherefore he had not cauſed his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be baptized, he anſwered, he had ſuch a real intention, but that their <hi>Pagode</hi> had prohibited him,<note place="margin">Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and truth.</note> and that his wife would not permit it, but threatned, if he forced Baptiſme up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her or hers, ſhe would publiſh his obſequies according to cuſtom, and marry another: which excuſe the Father took for ſome ſatisfaction, and at his ſupplications the people were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Whereupon many more repaired to him for the ſame cauſe, but he would not grant them any ſuch aſſiſtances but upon engagement to receive Baptiſme; which their Prieſts vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſought to hinder, telling them 'twere better to dy of that malady then be damned by the cure of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Indians,</hi>, amongſt other ſuperſtitions,<note place="margin">Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions.</note> which they have derived by corruption from Chriſtianiſme, they have one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding remarkable, which is, that once a year they make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn communion. Having immolated a white ſheep, and mingled the blood with meal, they call <hi>Agricar</hi>; on the day of the great feaſt of <hi>Duma,</hi> they give it to the whole congregation in form of a heart, with exhortations and remonſtrance, that this which they take, is the blood of their God, and upon that day ſtrangers are not admitted to celebrate the ſolemnity: but on the morrow they are received, and before they communicate, a Sermon is made to excite them to devotion, telling them their God receives them into his alliance, embraces them as his children, to whom he gives his grace by meanes of the blood they have taken. Behold how they transform and prophane what they have been heretofore taught of the Myſtery of the Paſchal lamb, and the Euchariſt. In <hi>Mexica</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> they have likewiſe confeſſion and Communion after their manner. But they have another ſort of ſacrifice yet more ſtrange, that is, they buy a ſlave of a high price, of thirty yeares age, beautiful, ſound, and jolly, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waſhed him in a lake, or other water three mornings by the riſing of the Sun, they cloath him in a white gown, keep him fourty dayes, and ſhew him to the people, telling them, this is the innocent that muſt be ſacrificed for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Then every one brings preſents to him, and with humility beſeeches him to remember them when he ſhall come before the great God. All this while they take a heedful care he eſcape not, giving him good cheer, and <hi>Areca.</hi> Every morning for the fourty dayes when they ſhew him, they beat a kind of Pan, and melodiouſly play on flutes doleful, and pathetical ſtraines, to excite devotion, in which conſet every one beares a part that he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98515:72"/>
may be mindful of them. Thirty dayes expired, the ten Prieſts called <hi>Gaica,</hi> perſons of veneration and antiquity, habited like the <hi>Victim,</hi> come to advertiſe him, that within ten days he goes to inhabit with the great God, and obſerve diligently if his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance change at the ſound of death; and take it for an ominous augury, if he ſhew the leaſt fear: For which cauſe on the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they give him a certain potion that renders him as 'twere frantick, and takes all apprehenſion from him. After diverſe other ceremonies on the fortith, they ſacrifice him, and after eat him.</p>
               <p>They lead him to the very top of their Temple, ſtretch him as it were into an oval upon a ſtone of the ſame figure, rip up his belly alive, tear out his heart which they burn, and ſacrifice to their Idol, beſmearing their cheeks with the blood. This fleſh they eat as a ſanctified and ſacred <hi>Viand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this ſpace, they religiouſly abſtain from all inordinate pleaſures. See but to what deformities they have changed the myſteries of our faith, as Father <hi>Andrew</hi> often made appear to them, though few made profit of it: we muſt attend till God of his mercy open their underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Zibi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note>But amongſt the abuſes and Idolatrie of theſe wretched people, 'tis moſt lamentable to ſee how they are tormented by theſe <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Poſſeſſed.</note> where there are ſome called <hi>Zibi,</hi> which at their grand Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals, enter into them while they dance, counterfeiting the deaf and dumb, contemning all ſort of conjurations: ſo as to eject them, they muſt make new ſuffumigations and ſacrifices; call in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians to implore the favour of their <hi>Duma</hi> for deliverance of theſe miſerable poſſeſſed creatures,<note place="margin">Exorciſms.</note> who all this while nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat, drink, nor ſleep, become meer ſkelitons, ſo lean, and disfigured, that they are the horrour and pitty of all that ſee them. Now doth the Magician repaire to the Devil to know the quality of this <hi>Demon</hi> uſurper, and what is to be done to enfranchiſe the poſſeſſed, whom they carry by night into a field, and put him in a cave or tent without light: Then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the devil, they ſeek out an hearb called <hi>Sacathy,</hi> which gives light by night, containing a ſplendour that may be perceived at a large diſtance, but as they ſay ſo peſtiferous, that he who gathers it dyes immediately;<note place="margin">Sacathy.</note> for prevention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they tye a dog with a line to it, and ſo pull it up, then they burn it in the room with the Demoniacle; and the <hi>Demon</hi> in the inſtant, leaves him, as not able to endure the ſent of this hearb. 'Tis not unlike to the root of <hi>Bachaza</hi> mentioned by <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> which growes near the town <hi>Machera</hi> in <hi>Judea.</hi> They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have their Feſtival the <hi>Corouita,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coranita</hi> and the Sacrifice.</note> but ſome one is unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in this kind. For as they carry along their Idol upon a ſix-wheel chariot drawn by Oxen, or Bufflers covered with flowers, and attended by the multitude, along the town, there are ever two or three pitiful wretches on a Scaffold in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98515:72"/>
long gowns of gray cloth, who declare to the people how they are ready to ſacrifice themſelves for the ſanctification of the reſt; Then down they come with a countenance pale and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd with apprehenſion of death, and caſt themſelves under the wheels of the chariot, where they are cruſhed to death. One there was who after he had been well fed by the <hi>Palpas</hi> or Prieſts for five dayes together, as a thing ſacred, when the houre of ſacrifice was come, his noſe bled, and he would not dye upon any terms, for whatſoever the Prieſts could ſay ſo to encourage him, but at the ſame inſtant there was another, who voluntarily offered to take his place, and was broken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wheels: afterwards his corps was laid in the chariot by the Idol on the ſide of felicity. For the Idol bears in one hand a number of Serpents, to puniſh ſuch as obey not his commands, and in the other a cup of ſome exquiſite liquor, to recompenſe his good ſervants.</p>
               <p>They have ſpecial honour for theſe miſerable Votaries, and all their Alliance. The ſacrifice ended, they take the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered bodies, and give them honourable burial wrapped in a ſear-cloath, and entombe them with ſolemn ceremonies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental muſick, all their alliances coming for certain dayes to rejoyce over the Sepulcher. When, any one being ſick, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician ſhall declare him irrecoverable, he is put apart in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, one of his family being appointed to attend him. But if he chances to recover, he is held as a reprobate, and no man will viſit or converſe with him; ſaying, that had he been any thing of good, their God had not diſdained his company. And if he deſires to be admitted in ſociety, the <hi>Chaouri</hi> or Sorcerer muſt make a ſacrifice of Purification for him: then being purified, he makes his friends a feaſt of the fleſh of black cattle onely, eſpecially a goat, which is eaten with a grand ceremony.</p>

So are they likewiſe of more honour, and the King gives them allowance for the learning of Military Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, as to ride, to vault, and others, for which they have Maſters; but their method is different from that of our Cavaliers. For this reaſon the King keepes a good number of horſes, of purpoſe for his ſubjects exerciſe; Gentlemen themſelves unfurniſhed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taking them for a year, or more, and then employ them on other occaſions.</p>
               <p>They have likewiſe Maſters for ſhooting in a bow, backward upon retreat,<note place="margin">Military exerciſes.</note> as it were upon a charge, like the <hi>Parthians</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and the <hi>Arabians</hi> at this day.

They have had the uſe of Cannon,<note place="margin">Cannons.</note> and other guns from all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, like the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> as they ſay. In a word, they hold Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſcipline in great eſteem, and every one lives happily, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his vocation, the greater part at the Kings charges, who in time of peace employes them in mills of ſeverall ſorts, and ſugar-workes; for you muſt know they ſpend more ſugar here, then in any part of the world; for that as I told you, they make the very plaiſter of it that covers the Taraſſes of their houſes, mingling it with pounded ſhells, whereof they make a mortar, that being dryed becomes firm, as marble.</p>
               <p>They are a numerous people, but were they more they could find meanes to employ them, for every man labours, and you ſee no man in want; and if they ſee one in poverty, their charity is ſuch, that if he be able, he is immediately employed, or his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities relieved.</p>

               <p>The King being come to the Palace, ſits down to eat with the three Princes, and round about for the ſubject Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are many tables ſumptuouſly ſet forth and furniſhed, with a device on each of them, that is, a crown of gold, with the arms of the King that eats at it.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> as Emperour hath three Crowns, and eats with the Princes: Of <hi>Tazatay</hi> hath two Crowns, and eats likewiſe with the Princes.

               <p>The three Princes that bear the Cenſers walk thrice about the Chamber incenſing the King, then ſit down and dine with him at diſtance, notwithſtanding when the King calls for drink, four Princes who have charge of the <hi>Talcadifs,</hi> or his Cup-bearers, every one with his cup of Purcelain, hoop'd with horn of Unicorne, taſte the drinke and preſent it to him, while the hoboys and the reſt of the muſick ſounds.

                  <hi>The Prince whom God hath newly ordained us,</hi> drinks to all the Princes and loyall Subjects: then every one drinks his health, the three aſſiſtants ſtand up and ſalute him, then ſit down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the King continually preſents plates of meat, ſometimes to one, ſometimes to another, ſo that for the feaſt time there is buſineſſe enough.</p>
               <p>The meat is ſeaſoned with muſk and amber.

preſents him a rich Crown of gold,<note place="margin">Preſents to the King.</note> which the King receives with embraces, and kiſſes his cheek in teſtimony of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall amity: Then the reſt kiſſing his buſkin, lay every one their preſents at his feet. The Kings bring Crowns, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces chains and collars; the reſt preſent according to their quality, all in gracefull order: for the kingdoms and provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, march all according to their rank, without confuſion: Then the reſt of the people preſent other things both rare and curious. Theſe preſents are brought in ſuch quantity, that every four hours they are forced to remove them: at the coronation, which was in my time, the preſents laſted five dayes from morning till night, with unparallel'd wealth and magnificence; during this time the people are all provided for at the Kings charge, and take up fifteen leagues of land, with wonderful regularity. The Preſents delivered, they ſtay five days for diſmiſſion to return.</p>

               <p>The King and his Court have this recreation once a week. Their pens are cloſe together, with mats of palm that cover the windows, at which they are fed. At the creation which was in my time, they had this game, and lifting up the mats, the Cocks immediately fell to fighting with their bils, through the ſpaces of the lattice, but the keepers parted them with ſwitches, till they had taken their portions, which is of a ſmall black grain, they call <hi>Verſin,</hi> as big as a grape ſtone, of quality exceeding hot. The mats taken away, then is the ſport, to ſee how they will range themſelves in Battalions for the aſſault, frowning with rage, and the window once open they fall on in good earneſt; till they moſt cruelly tear one another, and fill the place with blood, for a good hour together: then they part them, many lying dead in the place, which they eat, the fleſh being reddiſh like beef, but exceeding tender and taſtefull.</p>

When a new King is elected, all Towns and Villages ſend Deputies to make their acknowledgement, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of rarities, and things extraordinary: As to the elect in our time, were ſent three white Cowes, with tayles dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from others, like ſwine, hornes growing in their ſkins only, not on the top of the head, which they could move as their eares, decked bard bridles, covered with cloathes of crimſon ſilk, and hung over with bells of gold, ſilver, and <hi>Calin,</hi> a mettal like ſilver, much uſed in the <hi>Indies.</hi>

               <p>This preſent was very acceptable to him, notwithſtanding 'twas done in deriſion of another people, his Subjects,<note place="margin">

All theſe ſilks come to the benefit of the

people, though the King takes a good ſhare by reaſon of his ſlaves employed in it, beſides abundance of Orphanes and poor girles brought up at his coſt, under the tuition of matrons and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient women, to govern and correct them for their neglects: and the ſame for men, all with great order and policy.<note place="margin">A great policy.</note> When one hath committed a haynous crime, 'tis beſt if he communicate it to ſome friend that may acquaint the King before the Juſtice is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of it: for the King is moſt clement and ſupremely abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: then the King being informed the quality of the crime, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and matter; it may be, that without hearing the parties, he may grant his pardon. The cuſtom of the country is, that as ſoon as one hath perpetrated a crime, he layes by his apparel, puts on a white ſhirt that drawes on the ground, like perſons doing pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with us, goes bare-head, and bare-foot, lies ſtretched out upon the ground, and ſo attends his ſentence.</p>
               <p>Some there are ſit down, others ſtand upright, according to the nature of the offence. Many that preſume upon the Princes grace, are deceived, and meet their death.</p>
               <p>They who are condemned, are immediately given to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, who with their trunks lift them on high,<note place="margin">Adultery puniſhed.</note> then let them fall, and ſo they are broken in pieces; then the bodies are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Lions, and Tigars, whereof there is a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Adulterers are ſeverely puniſhed, as well men as women, and eſpecially, if they are of a good family. One was taken on a time with his ſlave, who were both bound together, and buried alive.</p>
               <p>For account of their marriages,<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> when perſons of quality will marry, they conſult their Divines, and <hi>Magies,</hi> to know the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: when children are born, they have their nativity caſt to know if good or ill ſhall befall them, whereof I ſhall rehearſe a remarkable example hereafter.</p>
               <p>When theſe Grandees, loſe their affection to their firſt wives,<note place="margin">Repudia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> they are allowed to eſpouſe another, without any injuſtice to the firſt, who muſt ſuffer till her huſband pleaſes to call her back, this happening moſt commonly for diſlike and change of diet. Where the huſband and wife preſerve a perfect amity all their life, when the huſband dies, if the wife will do according to the cuſtom of the country, the obſequies ended, ſhe remains with her friends for a certain time to bewaile his death, then makes them a great feaſt, in token of rejoycing, diſtributes her jewels and chiefeſt goods to them, who are dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to her; and having embraced and kiſſed her Parents, Kindred, and Friends, they conduct her with <hi>Flute</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys,</hi> to her huſbands monument under a Tent, adorned with Folliage, and covered with flowers, where they drink, eat, dance, and make merry, and the poor woman takes a potion, that makes her as it were frantick: then dancing,

and carowſing, ſhe ſacrifices her ſelf to her huſbands ghoſt, throwing her ſelfe into a fire, having diſtributed to her friends the reſt of her rings and jewels. Their Prieſts and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians confirm them in theſe abominable cuſtoms, which they obſerve in divers other parts of <hi>India,</hi> as at <hi>Narſinga, Cambaya, Coromandel,</hi> and other places. But they take diligent care in theſe marriages of the great ones, that the women have free choyce with the conſent of their kindred, to the end it may be the vehemence of affection that obliges them to ſo cruel a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. Likewiſe men to aſſure their affection to their Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,<note place="margin">Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of love.</note> uſe ſtrange teſtimonies: ſome with a Torch will burn their Arms before them, others will cut and ſtab themſelves with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards: others taking a cloth dip'd in oyle, will light it, and have the patience to let it burn out and extinguiſh upon their arm: which obliges a woman to the like love, and to render the like proof at his death.</p>
               <p>But that truculent ſacrifice they immolate to their Gods of their poor and wretched daughters, is no leſſe ſtrange and truculent: for in a part of this vaſt Empire to celebrate the feaſt of their great <hi>Crocouatas,</hi>

                     <hi>Palpes,</hi> or Prieſts.</note> beholds her God, and obſerves if he yet call her, for they ſay the <hi>Demon</hi> calls her by name, and invites her to union: then their <hi>Palpes</hi> or Prieſts veſted in their garments ſacerdotal, take her, and ſetting her ſtark naked upon this ſtone; after divers incenſings both to the <hi>Demon</hi> and the maid, they ſtrangle her in the preſence of father and mother, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well if ſhe be dead, that ſhe may not ſuffer a ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom; and having with a ſtone ſharp as a razor ripped up her body, they tear out her heart, which they throw in their <hi>Demons</hi> face, burn it, and ſprinkle the aſhes mingled with water upon their Idols: the reſt of the body they burn at leiſure with aromatick woods, for the uſe of the Temples. In other places the Prieſts eat the <hi>Victim.</hi> The ſacrifice ended, they go to dinner, the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation aſſiſts at the ſervice, and prayers made by the Prieſts with many incenſings: the Prieſts then change their veſtments, and take others of a horrible form, and mounting upon a Scaffold, as ſoon as the Muſick playes, begin to dance. They begin in a low
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98515:78"/>
key, then they riſe, with prayers and imprecations mingled, til heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with keeping time to the cadence of the muſick they become franick, ſome falling to the ground, others continue dancing, holding bells which accord with the inſtruments: So ſoon as any one falls to the ground, none but would think the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil enters into him, they change the tune, and dance with more violence and fury, without miſſing the leaſt point of the cadence.</p>
               <p>But what is moſt ſtrange of all, they ſay at the ſame time they ſee the the devils dance with them,<note place="margin">The devils dance.</note> and that they eaſily know them by the agility of their motion, for otherwiſe they are attired like the Prieſts. They obſerve viſibly that they muſt needs be <hi>Demons</hi>; becauſe only a certain number of Prieſts mounting the Scaffold; when any of them fall, you ſtill ſee the ſame number dancing, without diminution. By reaſon whereof, the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſuffer ſtrange diſtempers, and their hair ſtanding an end.<note place="margin">Strange accidents to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.</note> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that being preſent on a time for curioſity, on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain I felt my ſelf ſeized with a ſwimming in my head, that ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed me, I was almoſt ſuffocated, not able to ſpeak a word, nor draw my breath, and ſtriving to cry out and call for help to my company that was not far off; I could not poſſibly bring forth a word: ſo as being all in a lavour with agony and diſtreſſe, that held me a quarter of an houre, in my heart I made my prayers to Almighty God, by whoſe grace I was deliver'd, having never known the like torment in my life-time; for I felt I know not what paſs betwixt my legges, then leapt upon my ſhoulders, the phantaſm continually graſping me faſt. I was ſo dejected, as nothing could be more, but my companions reaſſured me the beſt they could; and as ſoon as I was gotten away, I went to tell it to Father <hi>Hipolita</hi> of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> order, who aſſured me 'twas a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical illuſion to have deſtroyed me, had not God with his grace ſecured me. He counſelled me to be thankful to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and come no more where ſuch abominations were, the curioſity whereof had coſt me ſo dear; for I was a glad man to ſee it end in a mockery; but thenceforward I had a care how I came within their Temples, and congregations to ſee their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Idolatries.</p>
               <p>But to end the feaſt, when the ceremonies and dances have laſted four dayes, the Nobility makes a feaſt in ſome Palace of account,<note place="margin">Feaſts and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> where the principal of the city, men and women, are invited, and come moſt richly apparelled, and covered with jewels, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies ſometimes as bigge as a nut, blazing like burning coales: then after a ſacrifice, theſe Nobles command the Muſick play ſome pleaſant ayre, and one of them takes a dame, whom he likes beſt forth to dance, not touching her hand nevertheleſs, but hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a handcherchief of ſilk, and all the reſt do the like till the ball be ended. They dance round, and 'tis prety to ſee this humble
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98515:79"/>
dance,<note place="margin">Laudative ſongs.</note> artificiall for the many changes are in it. This ended, the muſick changes to a very ſolemn baſe, as 'twere for repoſe, with certain ſtanzoes ſung in praiſe of their deceaſed Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, celebrating their valours with a thouſand encomiums for the moſt part falſe. Then they ſit round, diſcourſing ſtill of the valour of theſe deceaſed, and the women more tender of heart fall a weeping, and amidſt their lamentations all cry out, they ſhall never be like their Fathers, who did ſuch and ſuch high feats: after having invited each other joyntly to complaints, at laſt being tired, they take a collation together, and ſo the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ends.</p>
               <p>By what is ſaid 'tis plainly ſeen, how ſtrangely ſuperſtitious theſe people are, and how ſerious an honour they bear their gods or demons, to which their Prieſts ceaſe not dayly to excite them more and more, and omit not the leaſt diminutive Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for their honour or profit. Theſe Prieſts bear a wonderfull authority over them, which as I ſaid before, is more remarkable in their wars, than in any other thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How the Prieſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of wars.</note>For theſe Eaſtern Princes in raiſing war differ much from us, inſomuch as having a conſiderable war to be commenc'd with their neighbour Princes or others, the Prieſts take upon them authority to arbitrate the matter, having ſuch priviledge, as freely to remonſtrate to their Prince his duty to the people: whereupon two <hi>Bramins</hi> or Prieſts for both ſides, without paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confer together of their Princes complaint, to find a means to accommodate the matter: when they cannot effect it, they draw a hundred of the prime horſe, and as many foot out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though one <hi>Bramin</hi> find his party ſtronger by a hundred thouſand, he yet makes a conſcience to uſe his advantage as much as may be, to prevent combat, and if of neceſſity it muſt be, he uſes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand proteſtations to his Prince to hinder it; but not effecting it, they order the two ſmall parties to joyn, giving their benediction to them, and exhorting every one to do his beſt, the Victor giving conditions to the other, who is compelled to yield, and ſo their wars are concluded for the moſt part. To them who in this action ſhall have done any thing ſignall, the Prince gives a favour which they keep as ſacred, though many times 'tis but a ſcarf or ſilly taffeta ribbon,<note place="margin">Reward of valour.</note> with a certain character or figure in the middle, that denotes he hath behav'd himſelf well in fight for his Princes cauſe,<note place="margin">A deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> which they wear on feſtivals in hats or palm bonnets, and ſome there are who have divers of them reſpective to the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they ſerved in.</p>
               <p>For the example I touched upon in the predictions at the marriages of great ones, and the fortune of their children,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98515:79"/>
'tis thus. In the land of <hi>Tranſiane</hi> there was a Prince tributary to the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and his near Kinſman, who married a ſiſter of the Prince <hi>Tazatay,</hi> one of the greateſt beauties in the Eaſtern parts. The nuptials were kept with great joy and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, amongſt other things the Divines were conſulted of the ſucceſſe of the marriage, and 'twas found that never two perſons had loved, and ſhould love ſo well as theſe two; the Prince and Princeſſe <hi>Alfonge</hi> and <hi>Abelara,</hi> this hariolation doubled the joy and celebrity; and in effect they lived a ſweet and a happy life, with intire affection, and for their greater felicity they had two twin-ſons, who in their under-growth diſcovered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of great and lofty, and appeared ſingularly hopefull for the future: Theſe Infants having attained their ten yeares age, loved ſo cordially they could not live aſunder,<note place="margin">Fraternal amity.</note> and the ones deſire, ſtill met with the others conſent in all things; but the Devil, that enemy of concord, inſpires a curioſity into the minds of the Father and Mother to know their fates, and to their grief were told, the time ſhould come when theſe two brothers that now loved ſo fondly, ſhould cut one anothers throats;<note place="margin">Curioſity and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions dangerous.</note> which much aſtoniſhed the poor Princes, and filled them with fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>The two Princes being come to their fifteen yeares, one ſaid to the other, Brother it muſt be you that muſt murther me, for I will ſooner dye a hundred deaths, then do you the leſt harm imaginable: the other reply'd, believe it not good Brother; I deſire you, for you are as dear, and dearer to me than my ſelf. But the Father to prevent the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, reſolved to ſeparate them, whereupon they grew ſo troubled and melancholly, he was conſtrained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his deſign, till an occaſion happened that invited all three, the Father and two Sons, to a war betwixt the Kings of <hi>Narſinga</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> upon Title of Territories, one detained from the other: but by mediation of the <hi>Bramins</hi> a peace was concluded, upon condition theſe two young Princes ſhould eſpouſe the two daughters of the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> and the King of <hi>Baticalas</hi> Siſter, two Princeſſes of tranſcendent beauty, and that the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> on him that ſhould marry the elder, ſhould conferre all the Countryes he took in the laſt war, with the Kingdome of <hi>Martaban,</hi> and the other Brother, beſides the Kingdome of <hi>Tazatay,</hi> ſhould have that of <hi>Verma,</hi> which containes the Seniory of <hi>Zait,</hi> that payes yearly for tribute twelve pearles, weighing two <hi>Serafs</hi> of Gold, and of intire perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Theſe contracts agreed upon, were ſignified to the two Princeſſes of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> who, though then very young,<note place="margin">A reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> told their Father they conſented to the marriages, but on this condition, that their huſbands happening to die before them, if they made
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98515:80"/>
not voluntary ſacrifice of themſelves, it ſhould not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an infamy to them, becauſe they were unacquainted with them.</p>
               <p>This was agreed to, and the Nuptials conſummated to the generall joy of all men for the common peace accompanied them, and great feaſting there was every where. The one of theſe Princes ſtayed with his Lady in <hi>Narſinga,</hi> the other went to poſſeſſe the Province of <hi>Verma,</hi> lands ſpaciouſly divided: ſo as a long time they were without inter-view, viſiting each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely by miſſius and preſents of value or curioſity. Now it fell out the King of <hi>Tazatay</hi> was engaged in a ſharp war with the King of <hi>Mandranella,</hi> and ſent to the two Brother-Princes his Sons, for aid: who both haſtening with a good ſtrength of Souldiers, one knowing nothing of the other, the one declining his direct way, marched up to the enemy, and in a bloudy fight defeated him: thence went to preſent himſelf to his Father, but by ſad deſtiny on the morrow, his Brother arriving from <hi>Verma</hi> with his Lady, in the evening came ſecretly into the Town to viſit a Lady, once their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Miſtreſſe:<note place="margin">An unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate meeting.</note> the other Brother being on the ſame deſign they met at the Ladies gate by night, not knowing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where furious with jealouſie, after ſome words they drew and killed each other. One of them dying, amongſt many other things ſaid he, gave humble thanks to God that he had prevented the direfull deſtiny of his Horoſcope, in not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him the aſſaſſine of his Brother, as 'twas prejudicated: Hereupon the other finding him by his voice and diſcourſe, drawing near his end himſelf, crept to him, and embraced him with tears and lamentations, and ſo both dolefully ended their dayes together.</p>
               <p>The Father being advertized of it, ſeeing his white haires led by his own fault to ſo hard a fortune, overborn with grief and deſpair, came and ſlew himſelf upon the bodies of his Sons, and with the grief and tears of all the people, were buried all three in the ſame monument: which ſhews us the danger of too great curioſity, nor is it an eaſie que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion how this can be found by knowledge of the ſtars, or if they are things inevitable, which I leave to be decided by the more learned.</p>
               <p>But before I end this Chapter I ſhall obſerve, that amongſt ſuch a diverſity of Idols, as well of the great <hi>Corcouitas,</hi> who is the principal and moſt ancient, on whom all the others depend, as of the <hi>Oyſima,</hi> the promotor of all things, and diverſe other ſtrange and horrible ſhapes, every one with Temples and Sacrifices peculiar, amongſt all this they have, as I ſaid, the image of the bleſſed Virgin with her infant, which with lighted lamps they honour reverently. Theſe lamps are not of glaſſe, but <hi>Talc</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:98515:80"/>
ſtone, of which they have abundance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Talc</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of glaſſe.</note> whole mountains at one point of the Countrey, eaſtward. They work it very artificially, and make of it ſeverall ſorts of Utenſills, compounding the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Calin,</hi> ſo much eſteemed through the <hi>Indies,</hi> from <hi>Perſia,</hi> as far as <hi>China,</hi> like ſilver; but as eaſily melted as tin. Of this they likewiſe make their windowes, and lantorns: lantorns they likewiſe make of the triple coloured tortoiſe ſhell I ſpoke of before.</p>
               <p>I omitted to tell you that for their dances they uſe a ſort of pans, which being wel handled, yeild an elegant melody,<note place="margin">Muſicall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> but to play well requires long practice. They have other Muſicall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not of uſe in Europe, amongſt the reſt a ſort of pans, flat and double, the cover whereof ſtands two fingers diſtant, ſet with wyar ſtrings, they call it a <hi>Hydrac,</hi> it is tedious,<note place="margin">Hydrac.</note> and difficult to learn. For the quality of their yeares, I could not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their manner of account, but in generall I find they reckon by Moones, as the greater part of the eaſt,<note place="margin">The <hi>Pegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> yeares.</note> and their dayes by the ſun; out of theſe Moones they raiſe five dayes, allowing thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Moones to the year; and the fift day being come, about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they make a ſolemn ſacrifice in their Temples, where they univerſally meet. I conferd with ſome about this matter, who told me, the <hi>Peguan</hi> year was like that they uſe in <hi>China,</hi> which is Lunary, and that they compare it as neer as may be to the Solary; for their year conſiſting of twelve moneths, twice in five years they gain a Lunary month, making that year of thirteen Moones, ſo as they have no knowledg of the golden number, nor the nineteen years circle, and the anticipation of one hour and twenty eight mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, which remits the new Moones to the golden number, with them is accommoded by the annuall ſupputation: for they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have, nor will have a perpetuall <hi>Calander,</hi> but at great charge print every year a new one, which they ſend through all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be our <hi>Peguans</hi> would imitate this after their faſhion, and according to their underſtanding, which is very weak for ſuch matters, which the beſt wits amongſt us find task hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>Of the Philoſophy of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and their opinions in <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> and <hi>Geography,</hi> I ſhall ſay ſomething hereafter.</p>
               <p>Before I leave the ſtate of <hi>Pegu,</hi> I will not omit what ſome of the <hi>Peguans</hi> told me, and have mentioned in writing in their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes. That ſome yeares before we arrived, there was in the Countrey a King of the ancient Royall Race, who had many Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Countrey of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> towards the Lake <hi>Chiamay,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, one in the Kingdom of <hi>Tangu</hi> that rebelled againſt him, defeated and ſlew him, and made himſelf King of <hi>Pegu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu.</hi>
                  </note> they called him the <hi>Bramaa</hi> of <hi>Tangu,</hi> a great Tyrant, and a Potent Prince, who by force of Armes joyned many Kingdomes to his Empire, as <hi>Pram, Melintay, Calani, Bacam, Mirandu, Aua, Marta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:98515:81"/>
and others; He afterwards was put to death by a <hi>Peguan</hi> Lord, called <hi>Xemin,</hi> of <hi>Zatan,</hi> who made himſelf King, but was defeated, and ſlain by another, called <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> who likewiſe being made King, was not long after defeated, and put to death by <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migren,</hi> of near aliance to <hi>Bramaa,</hi> who became one of the moſt Powerfull Kings hath raigned in <hi>Pegu,</hi> who brought totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Empire of the Kingdom of <hi>Syan,</hi> with twelve great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes more.<note place="margin">Vaſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Eaſt.</note> They report that in the War of <hi>Syan,</hi> he led into the field ſeventeen hundered thouſand Combatants, and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Elephants, whereof nine thouſand were for fight, the reſt for carriage. To which the immenſe Armies brought heretofore by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings againſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> may induce us to give credit; the cauſe is, that in all theſe Eaſtern Countreys, the greater part of the people go to the wars, and that there are not amongſt them ſo many Eccleſiaſticks, Lawyers, Clarks, Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and idle Perſons as are with us.</p>
               <p>The King that raigned in <hi>Pegu</hi> in our time, called the <hi>Brama,</hi> was as I think, the ſon of this <hi>Chaumigren,</hi> afterwards hard enough dealt with by the Kings of <hi>Tangu, Aracan,</hi> and <hi>Syan,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>But it is time to advance to the Provinces and Towns of high <hi>India,</hi> ſubject, or confining, and neighbours to <hi>Pegu,</hi> as <hi>Abdia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, Vilep, Canarane, Caſſubi, Tranſiane, Taſata, Mandranella, Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and others.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98515:81"/>
but we had not been long there when there came about us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary number of Apes, the greater part black as jet, ſome ſmall ones black and white, very lepid: one of them addreſſed himſelf to me, as it had been to crave ſomething of that I was eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thinking to fright him away, he was not ſcared at all, as if he were accuſtomed to paſſengers: I caſt a piece of bread to him, which he took very modeſtly, and divided with his company and two young ones he had with him;<note place="margin">Apes.</note> preſently there came three more, which ſeemed to crave their ſhare, I gave them ſomething and they eat very quietly: but on a ſudden part of our company aroſe and took their Armes, by reaſon of a heard of <hi>Fiſmans,</hi>

               <p>Proceeding on our way we met with abundance of other ſorts of ſtrange animalls, as likewiſe of fruits, ſome whereof of growth much to be admired: ſome that bore roſin,<note place="margin">Fruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ten or twelve dayes through diverſity of ſoyles, meeting with many rivers, animalls, trees, and other things unknown to us, amongſt others abundance of civit Cats, whereof they have ſome domeſticall, which you may buy foure for one <hi>Pardai,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Civit cats.</note> but they are ſtinking, and their dung ſmells like Mans. At length we took to the River <hi>Jiame,</hi> and in three dayes came to the Village called <hi>Tanza,</hi> on the morrow to <hi>Canarane,</hi> a faire Town, rich and flouriſhing as any Town in <hi>India,</hi> the Capitall of a Kingdom, bearing the ſame name, confining eaſtward, on the Country of <hi>Tazatay,</hi> ſouth on <hi>Carpa,</hi> and northward on <hi>Moantay,</hi> another great Kingdom. The Town is ſeated betwixt two great rivers, <hi>Jiame</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> it is in circuit about foure leagues, magnificently built: in cuſtomes and conditions the people differ much from thoſe of <hi>Pegu,</hi> for they never go barefoot as the others do. Princes and Noble Men weare rich buskins, and ſandalls ſet with gold.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Canarane</hi> is Potent and Wealthy in Mines of gold and ſilver. He hath alſo one of Emerald, the fineſt in the eaſt,<note place="margin">Mines.</note> whence he drawes great profit. This Prince was never known to diminiſh, but augment his Treaſure. Likewiſe they have Mines of Turkeſſes.</p>
               <p>When a King dies, they interr all his Treaſure with him, and ſweare his Succeſſor not to meddle with it. For the firſt year he and his Court are maintained at the Subjects charge, and all the Nobility by obligation come to make their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment with rich preſents, and ſue to be eſtabliſht in their Eſtates, Offices, Seniories; for the King hath right to ſell eſtates of all ſorts then vacant; and hereupon all his

people high and low, are tied with petition in hand, and with preſents, to ſue for their offices and vacancies, which raiſes him in this year a marvellous treaſure. No one can wear ſhooes, rings, nor girdles of gold, without the Kings licenſe, which brings him in a great gabel, a ſhare whereof belongs to the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> as ſoveraign, who granted him the grace, becauſe the Countrey is colder than <hi>Pegu,</hi> and I have heard it of Merchants, that in the winter here rage certain in windes,<note place="margin">

Their cuſtom is, if a Merchant will oblige himſelf, he obliges likewiſe all his goods, wife, and children, and failing at the day promiſed, the Creditor may ſeize on all for ſlaves.</p>
               <p>The uſual money is called <hi>Canza,</hi> and all the <hi>Peguan</hi> is currant there, which the King ſtamps in gold or ſilver, through the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies called <hi>Jamis,</hi> beſides what every particular Prince coins of his own.

If a Merchant make ſtay in Town, he ſhall have a couple of young women will furniſh him with a houſe, and all neceſſaries, and ſerve him like ſlaves; nay 'tis lawfull to beat and chaſtize them if they do not what they are commanded, having once ſubmitted to it. They go well apparelled and decent as may be, are very affable, dance, and ſing well; preſerve a Merchants goods with great care, Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceny amongſt them being held a notorious ignominy.

               <p>We lay in the Town of <hi>Canarena,</hi> at one <hi>Chamuts,</hi> a Brokers houſe,<note place="margin">Unicorns hornes.</note> who had two Unicorns horns, one whereof had half the head remaining to it.</p>

I aſked him if he ever ſaw of theſe creatures alive, he told me he never ſaw but two, which were very young; and not come to have hornes. That the King going a hunting, took one of them, but they could not take the damme, whatſoever they could do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as they ſay, they ſhun and fly from the aſpect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a man, and the places where the Serpents haunt, whereof we ſpoke before, who make a cruel warre upon them for greedineſſe of their blood, which is ſaid to be of excellent ſcent, as it hath been divers times proved; particularly, when one was ſent by their Prince to the King of <hi>Pegu</hi>: which ſtung by a fly, the bloud which iſſued out, was put in a bottle and brought to the King, who made no great eſteem of it, not finding the ſcent agreeable, though notwithſtanding he found it more odorous then Civet, This the <hi>Senſal</hi> or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker told us. I my ſelf ſaw a perfect Unicorn in the King of <hi>Regues Seraglio,</hi> who had the tongue differing from other beaſts, very long, and jagged; the head more like a horſe then a hart, and there are of ſeveral haires. The Keeper ſaid, 'tis but an uncleanly beaſt, delights in his own ſoyle, and that having often ſeen him drink, he never obſerved him to put his horn in the water.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> report many other things of them, but ſo ſtrange and various, there is no great aſſurance, as that they breed but once in their life-time, and like Elephants, go two yeares with their young, and the like. A <hi>Bramin</hi> (an order Kings themſelves hold it an honour to be of) told me once with a proteſtation, laying his hand on the wreath of his order, that he was preſent with the King of <hi>Caſubi</hi> at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of one of theſe Unicorns, which was all white, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old, the chops ſo hanging down, all her teeth were ſeen, that ſhe was ſo fierce in her owne defence, ſhe broke her horn amongſt the boughs, that being taken, they brought her bound to the Kings Pallace, but being ſo bruiſed with blowes, for having hurt the Kings Nephew, ſhe would not eat, and ſo died within five dayes, which ſhewes ſhe is a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick and ſullen beaſt,</p>

               <p>The King of <hi>Caſubi</hi> reſerved the horne of this beaſt to himſelfe: about five moneths after being at this Princes Court, who was both courteous and curious, I deſired the <hi>Sieur de la Courb,</hi> one of our own company, to requeſt the favour we might ſee this horne, which he did; and the

               <p>This horne was of different colour to thoſe I had ſeen in the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Mecaes Serallio,</hi> and other places, for this drew neare a white gray, whereas the other were of a black gray.</p>
               <p>I have been told that <hi>Lewis de Bartheme</hi> in his travailes, recounts how he ſaw at the <hi>Seldans</hi> of <hi>Meca</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> two of theſe Unicornes, which were ſent him by the King of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> high, as a two year old colt, of a dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the head like a Hart, the horne three fathome long, a little Mane, ſmall legges, cloven feet, and a Goats cley; likewiſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> report, that in their laſt voyage towards <hi>Spiteberg,</hi> in a place called <hi>Horendſond,</hi> they found Unicornes hornes, not knowing of what beaſt they were.</p>

They have a cuſtom every evening to ſtay an houre in the water, then to call them out to ſeat; they have an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſigne, which they readily obſerve. They are very good meat, and delicious. The nature of them is, that turn them into a ground ſowed with Mil, or Rice, they will moſt ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pull up all the weedes by the root, without touching the grain.</p>
               <p>The grain they call <hi>Taffin,</hi> is like our Millet, and hath a leaf like a reed, which theſe birds will in no ſort meddle with, whether for averſion, or other cauſe.

becauſe they think the dead all go ſtreight to heaven.

This done, the wife of the deceaſed all alone, retires to her houſe for fourty dayes more, inceſſantly weeping for her husband; her kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mean while ſupplying her with all neceſſaries, for ſhe would ſooner be her own death, then go forth to demande any thing.</p>

                  </note> a Chriſtian Philoſopher Native of <hi>Tyre</hi> in <hi>Phenicia,</hi> by name <hi>Meropius,</hi> came into the <hi>Indies</hi> with two young Children, his Nephews, called <hi>Edeſius</hi> and <hi>Frumentius,</hi> out of curioſity onely to ſee the Country, at the example of another Philoſopher called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodorus,</hi> ſome years before, and that having well view'd and conſidered thoſe Countries, about to return, his veſſel was aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the barbarous Idolaters, and he and all his ſlain, except the two young youths, who were brought to the King of <hi>Caſubi,</hi> and he taken with their Gentileſſes, cauſed them to be brought up carefully, afterwards made <hi>Aedeſius</hi> his Cup-bearer, and the other <hi>Frumentius</hi> Steward of his houſhold, whereof they did both acquit themſelves very worthily, and to the Kings content, who loved them exceedingly, as alſo the Queen <hi>Arſinda</hi> and her onely ſon.</p>
               <p>The King dying, the Queen became Regent with her onely ſon, who had a ſpeciall favour for the two Chriſtians, to whoſe charge the King had committed his Son for inſtruction, till he came to age; wherefore the Queen had a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of them, and they behaved themſelves laudably in their office, all this while continuing in the right Religion, reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill ſome benefit amongſt ſuch Chriſtians as came into thoſe parts, who were Merchants, or Roman negotiators, whom they ever confirmed in their faith, and by permiſſion royall they built a kind of Church, or Oratory, to meet and make their prayers in. Notwithſtanding wanting ſuch freedome as they deſired, and inclining to their naturall Countrey, the young King being now of age to reign, they requeſted his licenſe, and whatſoever the King or his Mother could ſay to diſſwade them, they could not prevaile, they aiming to

carry neither gold, ſilver, nor other wealth with them. So they both came back into the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the <hi>Aedeſius</hi> retired to <hi>Tyre,</hi> his native Countrey, where he became Prieſt.</p>
               <p>We ſtaid ſome time at <hi>Caſubi,</hi> to ſell and truch our Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes, where we made good profit; and amongſt other things of ſome ſafron we had, of which they make no other uſe then to die their nailes, mingling it with braſill, whereby they make a dainty colour.</p>
               <p>There are men and women that make inciſions in their Armes, with a pointed piece of wood, out of which wood they get fire,<note place="margin">Wood to ſtrike fire.</note> putting the end of one of theſe ſticks in the cleft of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and turning it hard about till ſmoak and fire come.

a kind of muſty flower; but laid it the Sun, or before the fire becomes like wheaten ſtarch, boyling it with <hi>Cocoes</hi> of Palm mingled with yolks of egges and ſugar, they make the moſt delicate diſh <hi>India</hi> affords.</p>
               <p>Of Poultry and Turkies they have abundance,<note place="margin">Poultry.</note> as of white and gray Partridges, and Pheaſants, which are there as domeſtical as Turkies: Peacocks both wild and tame of no great price: their money except the royal coyn is all tin or braſſe.<note place="margin">Money.</note> They have for another dainty a grain in the Iſlands called <hi>Bindi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bindi.</note> very ſmall and black, they boyl it with milk and ſugar, or honey drawn from Palm, and eat it upon broad leaves, which ſerve but for once: they invited us to this as a great dainty.</p>
               <p>Still as we travelled through theſe parts,<note place="margin">Apes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate.</note> we were every where troubled with Apes and Monkeys, which haunted us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and whenſoever we reſted, they were importunate to get ſomething of us. 'Twas our cuſtom in the fields to erect a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tent of cotton cloth with a pole in the middle, and cords to hold it; and having made our repaſt, we went to reſt, while two ſtood Centinel to ſee that our horſes, or beaſts of carriage ſtrayed not away.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of beaſt called <hi>Azoufa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Azoufa.</note> which haunts moſt commonly Church-yards, to ſcrape up dead bodies, and feed on the fleſh, whereof they are very ravenous.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen many of them at <hi>Fez, Morocca,</hi> and other places in <hi>Africa,</hi> where they call them <hi>Chicali</hi>;<note place="margin">Chicali.</note> I my ſelf ſaw them one day pull up one of our company that died ſuddenly.

                     <hi>Ira's,</hi> A beaſt of the ſame nature as the <hi>Chicali,</hi> but red.</note> they go in heards, and if they meet with any ſtraying, they will devoure him: theſe likewiſe unbury the dead for food; but the ſkins of theſe have an odour ſo excellent, that nature ſeems to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it them, that men may be incited to hunt and take them for the repoſe of the living and dead.</p>
               <p>Really the importunity of the Apes is great and troubleſome, but they take good order for them by ſhutting them out of the high wayes, as every one hath notice to do carefully, but the <hi>Azoufa</hi> and <hi>Iras</hi> are both troubleſome and dangerous. Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe countries there are abundance of other wild and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary beaſts, as Tygars extremely fierce,<note place="margin">Tygars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and are not daunted with men, though never ſo troop'd and armed. They are as big as ſmall Aſſes, and go night and day in great heards, their heads are like the Cats of <hi>Suria,</hi> but more furious, a Lions paws, and their colour white, red, and black, and very ſhining.<note place="margin">

               <p>The King and and the whole Court make a great buſineſſe of this chaſe, and take a ſtrong number along for it,<note place="margin">

                  </note>As to the <hi>Rhinocerot,</hi> there muſt be good heed taken of him, becauſe he is armed from head to foot, with his dark gray horn on his noſe, exceeding ſharp, of two foot long, his ſcales not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by any thing whatſoever, of Cheſnut colour: if they can lay hold on man and horſe, they will fling them ſix paces from them. At the <hi>Eſcurial</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> I ſaw one that was brought from the <hi>Indies</hi>; but becauſe he had overturned a Chariot full of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, though fortunately no harm was done, the King command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eyes ſhould be put out, and his horn cut off.</p>
               <p>The difficulty was in the execution; for they were conſtrained to put him in a cloſe place to bind him, which was done with ſo much trouble and danger, that nothing more; for he wounded and maimed divers: there was one <hi>Caſabuena,</hi> a bold reſolute man, who to prevent danger, put an armour of proof under his Caſſock, the beaſt came upon him with ſuch force, that he threw him againſt the wall with ſuch violence, he was carried forth for dead, bleeding both at mouth and noſe. The Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> adviſed the King to kill him with a Muſket, becauſe he had maimed a Gentleman of his, one <hi>Cavalier Mortel,</hi> but the King would not, and at laſt they compaſſed their ends; and his eyes were put out, and his horn cut off. By this we may ſee how dangerous the chaſe is. They are chiefly found in <hi>Bengala, Patana,</hi> and <hi>Macharana.</hi>

town, and when he muttered or grumbled he gave him the cudgel ſoundly; ſo as he got his Maſter a livelyhood, who was a poor man newly come out of ſlavery. We often met upon the way with ſeveral of theſe ſavage beaſts, but we never met with any ſo ſafe as are the Lyons, who will not riſe at the approach of men, be they never ſo few.</p>
               <p>They ſeem to look for nothing from paſſengers, but if they are ſought for, and aſſaulted, they defend themſelves in a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, and are light and ſtrong runners.</p>
               <p>One day as we went from <hi>Caſubi,</hi> to <hi>Tranſiana,</hi> with a numerous convoy of all nations, <hi>Moores, Gentiles, Malabates</hi> and others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other travailing through theſe foreſts, repleat with ſuch beaſts, and every water and river ſwimming with <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles</hi> or <hi>Caymans,</hi> a youth who waited on <hi>de la Courb</hi> in his chamber, a <hi>Frenchman</hi> one of our company, of a daring ſpirit, had a deſire to ſhoot at a Lyon he had ſpy'd, for which purpoſe he left the way ſome twenty paces, and had with him an <hi>Indian</hi> called <hi>Talmaſſac</hi> a perſon of courage likewiſe: a <hi>Bramin</hi> adviſed them as ſoon as they had given fire to make all haſte with the beſt ſpeed of their horſes for fear of miſchief.</p>
               <p>The Lyon lay along under a tree, and though he received two ſhots at the ſame inſtant one in the head, the other in the left ſhoulder, notwithſtanding finding himſelf wounded, he ſprung ſo vigorouſly after them, that though they made good haſte, he overtook one of them in going two hundred paces, and caught his horſe by the Crouper, which he killed like lightning, though his ſtrength was ſpent. Poor <hi>Talmaſſac</hi> was ſo aſtonied with a blow he gave with his head on the ſide, that he fell ſick, and we were fain to ſend him back to <hi>Caſubi</hi> in a <hi>Palanquin</hi> or Litter with four <hi>Camalous</hi> or Porters, yet for a further miſchief he was ſtript by the way. The <hi>Naires,</hi> with leave of the hunters took the Lyon, and preſented it to the King of <hi>Tranſiana,</hi> who admired his growth, having teeth great and thick, as a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets egge.</p>
               <p>The King recompenſed <hi>Talmaſſac</hi> with another horſe in lieu of that he had loſt,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and affability.</note> which was looked upon as a great liberality for the eſteem they make of horſes in that country, and our <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had a gown of razed cloth of gold, and the King cauſed us all to be treated and entertained in his Palace, enquiring diverſe things of <hi>Sieur de la Courbe,</hi> amongſt others the ſtate of our King; and becauſe I underſtood ſomething of the country lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I was called to the conference, and I know not if he were pleaſed with my diſcourſe, but he called one of his grooms of his chamber to bring him a handful of gold, which he gave me, telling me, if I would ſtay with him, he would give me every Moon as much, and that I ſhould have care of his perſon, for the <hi>Sieur de la Courbe</hi> had intimated to him
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98515:88"/>
that I applyed my ſelf to Phyſick. I made him an humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and acknowledgement, ſaying: I was of ſuch a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, I ſhould never ſerve Princes for their money, but I ſhould be ſufficiently ſatisfied with the honour to be near his Majeſty:<note place="margin">Eſteem of the <hi>French</hi> on the Eaſt.</note> he was exceedingly pleaſed with my anſwer, ſaying the <hi>French</hi> are the flower of the world, and I am delighted with your converſation.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he ſhewed us two Culverins given him by a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Diepe,</hi> well wrought, and upon either of them a Dragon for Armes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Sieur de la Courb</hi>'s preſent.</note>The <hi>Sieur de la Courbe</hi> preſented him with a ſteel ſword of <hi>Damis,</hi> which he had gotten in the <hi>Indies,</hi> a thing the Prince highly prized, and inſtantly taking a ring off his finger, with three rich Rubies, would have given it him, but the <hi>Sieur</hi> would not receive it, rendring thanks; and ſaying, 'twere a great indiſcretion in him to acccept of ſuch a rarity, that was worth a thouſand times more then his preſent; and that it was a full ſatisfaction, and ample recompence, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would vouchſafe to accept ſo poor a thing; with many more reſpects and compliments, which gained the Kings eſteem much more; ſaying, 'twas apparent there was ſomething of great amongſt the Chriſtians, becauſe their diſcourſe was more elegant and polite then the ordinary language of other Merchants; and if he would ſtay at Court, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre upon him any office in his Palace, he ſhould like of, and would tender him as his brother; the <hi>Sieur</hi> rendring his acknowledgement with reverence and ſubmiſſion. In brief, we were obligingly treated by this Prince, on whom we waited to chaſes, which is a thing truly royal and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.</p>
               <p>In this country there is another kinde of ſavage beaſt, exceeding fierce, that indifferently falls on all things come before her. She hath four teeth that cut like a razor. About the ſize of a midling oxe, a head like a Bear, and a taile like a hogge.</p>
               <p>Theſe beaſts are naturally black, they hunt them for their hydes which are of admirable ſtrength to reſiſt blows: the fleſh is good and ſpends like Pork, though it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing red.</p>
               <p>This chaſe is exceeding dangerous, and ſome alwayes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, for ſhe flyes moſt furiouſly on the firſt that attempts her, and failes not to ſtrangle him, though a hundred ſhould come to his reſcue, if they kill her not at the firſt ſtroake. She is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding licorous of a fruit they call <hi>Coeoma,</hi> which is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent taſte, and great refreſhment, ſo as in Summer 'tis much ſought after: for one ſhall no ſooner eat of it, but he perceives an entire refreſhment, nay a chilneſs if he eat a quantity.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98515:88"/>
The <hi>Indians</hi> make hollowes in great trees, near this fruit, and hide themſelves within to wait for this beaſt, and kill her, when ſhe comes to feed: but when ſhe findes her ſelfe ſurprized, She enters into ſuch rage, that ſhe tears up the tree for ſpight. There are ſo many other ſorts of ſavage beaſts, that it were too troubleſome to rehearſe them all. They have divers birds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate plumage, whereof they make divers works, the moſt quaint and lively in the world; and birds ſo great, they will take a calf up into the ayre. They have <hi>Griffins,</hi> which in my opinion, are, no other then that they call a <hi>Tofon,</hi> of white plumage, and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh under the belly; but they have not four feet, as our Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters draw them; but two only long and great, as likewiſe Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons like a <hi>Falcon,</hi> but large, and exceeding ſtrong; the beake like an Eagle, but much thicker; they are cruel creatures.</p>
               <p>They have here likewiſe thoſe we call the birds of Paradiſe,<note place="margin">Birds of Paradiſe.</note> the <hi>Irico:</hi> they cut the feet off, and ſell them ſo to Merchants; as I ſaid in another place.</p>

And they have their Maſters to inſtruct them in the uſe of all ſorts of arms, which they practice diligently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:98515:89"/>When they have performed any noble act of dexterity, or feat of arms, they are aſſured of a chain of gold from the King: they are all lodg'd in the Kings Palace. There was one that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a combat once with ſuch grace, boldneſſe, and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the King could not forbear, but taking off her caſk upon the field, he kiſſed her before all the Court, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her neck a chain he wore himſelf, of rubies, pierced in form of pearls, and garniſhed at the ends with fauſet dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of ineſtimable value: opinion was, that after the King had ſo blandiſhed her, and given her ſuch a gift, without doubt he would marry her.</p>
               <p>She was indeed one of the moſt amiable Ladies of the <hi>Indies,</hi> of twenty years age, her ſkin admirably white, her hair diſ-ſhevel'd, black as jet, her name was <hi>Langir,</hi> and I aſking mine hoſt who the maid was, and if 'twere probable the King would marry her? ſmiling he told me in my ear, 'twas ſurmis'd ſhe was ſiſter to the Prince himſelf, ſo paſſionately his Father <hi>Amaycan</hi> lov'd her Mother <hi>Acoſrias,</hi> who was ſo gallant and valiant, that at wraſtling ſhe had not her match, and that ſhe threw all the ſtrangers ſhe wraſtled with: and if they took it with diſdain ſhe would ſtrangle them in the place: ſhe was a Lady of perfect beauty, and was unfortunately ſlain by a Lion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King her lover was violently grieved, he buried her with royall obſequies, and mourned with ſolemnity a long time, abſtaining ſome dayes from eating <hi>Areca</hi> or <hi>Betel,</hi> being ſhav'd, in ſign of grief and ſorrow. In his huntings the King takes great pleaſure to ſee theſe women ſhoot in their croſbows, whence they will diſcharge three arrows at a time, with ſuch celerity and vigour, that lighting upon a tree they ſtrike themſelves ſo deep, that they are not to be drawn out. They uſe alſo fire-locks, and other arms, wherein they are well exerciſed. Theſe women are not at liberty to marry without the Princes licenſe, who allows them not but to Favourites, who at the ſame time have charge or office at Court, or ſome other place, for they never diſplace any. There are other guards called the <hi>Viluaires,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Viluaires.</note> who bear no more before the King than the bow made of <hi>Indian</hi> cane, or Palm-wood which never breaks. The ſervitors and domeſtick Officers of the Palace are called the <hi>Lambri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lambri.</note> who are for carriage of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Palace, and ſerve likewiſe in war, being honourably ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and armed with great <hi>Indian</hi> canes, which they know how to manage very well, and theſe take orders from the King.</p>
               <p>The Prince is very powerfull both in Foot and Horſe,<note place="margin">The mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of the King of <hi>Tranſiana.</hi>
                  </note> being provided alwaies of a thouſand Elephants, and fifty thouſand Horſe, which are leſſe, but ſtronger than the <hi>Perſian,</hi> whereof he keeps divers races; for the Country hath the faireſt and moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile herbage of the world, and abounds in all ſorts of commodities. This King is tributary to the great Emperour, to whom he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98515:90"/>
payes yearly ſo many horſes, the beſt in the <hi>Indies,</hi> being indefatigable in travaile,<note place="margin">Horſes and their breeding.</note> he is likewiſe exceeding carefull, and breedes them of an extraordinary manner, getting Mares from <hi>Perſia</hi>: when there is a number of foles, of foure or five moneths old, they are put to certain wild cowes, that are expreſly for this purpoſe kept in the race: ſo as the little cowes, the mares, and the colts are all together; then taking the calves from their dams, they put the colts to ſuck them: This courſe continued for ſome time, makes them more ſtrong and laſting then can be imagined, and it is obſervable their hoofes are more durable then any others. All their fault is, they are not ſo ſleet as the <hi>Perſian,</hi> which horſes are moſt eſteemed of all in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and next to them thoſe of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiana.</hi> This King hath ſo great a number of them, they render him formidable throughout the <hi>Indies</hi>; he is exceeding peaceful, and beloved of his people. In the Countrey, though it be very fertile, and well tilled, there are notwithſtanding vaſt and profound forreſts, ſtocked with wilde beaſts, who often intercept the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and devoure them; as Ounces, Lions, Tigars, beares, Wolves, and dangerous Boares of an incredible ſize. The King hath huntſmen for the purpoſe, well ſkill'd in the woodes, with little dogs proper for finding out the beaſts. They have alſo tame Lions, and Hart-Wolves brought up to hunt their own kinde, and ſo animated againſt their own Species, that there are not in the world more cruell enemies, as man hath not a more mortall foe then man himſelfe,<note place="margin">Beaſts brought up to hunt.</note> and amongſt men <hi>Renegado</hi> Chriſtians more cruell to true Chriſtians then the other Infidels. Theſe Lions, wolves, and other beaſtes of chaſe are taught to it, when they are young, and trained in parkes to hunt others, till they are at growth; and then they take them abroad to the grand chaſe, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with caps and pointed collars, which with the aſſiſtance of the hunters makes them more dangerous, ſo as they make a great ſlaughter amongſt the other beaſts. There are likewiſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of harts, large as heifers, which lie in the fields, and will not ſtir for a paſſinger. When the King goes into the Country, he is attended with a thouſand horſe at leaſt, and when he goes to the grand chaſe, he takes along abundance of Pioneers, to ſtop up the Avenues with walls of clay, and turf, to ſecure himſelfe and his Court. There will be ſometimes twelve or fifteen thouſand hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the greater part Lords, Perſons of Quality, and the Kings do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, who frequently engage themſelves; there being pleaſure without danger. Sometimes theſe beaſts come in ſuch heards, they are forced to open for their paſſage, and fall upon the laſt; and notwithſtanding the walls are ſtrong and high, being made of palms, and earth mixt with brakes, there are beaſts ſo light and nimble,<note place="margin">Chaſe of recreation.</note> they will leap over them; and before the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, (who lie concealed) can take them, they will do incredible things, making ſuch ſtrange aſſaults, and ſuch havock with teeth
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98515:90"/>
and nailes; but the whole Court, with the female guard, ſtands in order upon the curtain and parapet of the walls, to attend them at the paſſage, where there is a great ſlaughter. But after this tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call danger, comes a comedy of the Marmoſets, Apes, and Monkeys, and others of that kind, for the greater part unknown to us: The young ones will be there ſo faſtned to the necks of their dams,<note place="margin">Apes.</note> you would think they grew there: all together makes a very pleaſant prize. The hair of theſe Apes is ſoft as ſilk, and their genitories violet colour, or pale red. There are huge Munkeyes white as ſnow, that make a thouſand ridiculous faces, ſeeming to crave liberty, and they of the guard that know their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, give them a ſigne to climbe upon a tree, and ſave themſelves, where of ſhe faile not, but then the ſport is to ſee the trees covered over with them, with the confuſed chattering they make one at another.</p>
               <p>For wild ſwine, wild goats, harts, hindes, fallow-Deer, and <hi>Aloroc,</hi> with beaſts of Beaſar there are abundance; as alſo of porcupines, the Country yeilding ſuch plenty of grain, and wild fruits for their ſuſtenance. The boares are very dangerous, panching all they meet with their tuſhes: Elephants they hunt but ſeldom, being forfeit of life to kill one. They go with ſuch vehemency, they break all before them; and when by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety they are once encloſed, they make moſt horrible cries and roarings, for rage breaking all that is near them: being tyred, they lie along, and thruſting their trunk down their throat, they fetch up a loathſom water, as hot as if it came out of a furnace.</p>
               <p>When all the dangerous beaſts are either killed or ſcaped, the King for his pleaſure kills the boares, the goats, and others with the <hi>Ront,</hi> the moſt aſſured armes, and makes the wideſt wound. Then the hunters all chooſe their marke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ront.</hi> Armes.</note> taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in darting their lances, taking what ſerves for proviſion of the Palace, leaving the reſt for another time. The skins of bears,<note place="margin">Beaſts skins.</note> ounces, lions, leopards, ſerve to Arme the foot and horſe, and to bard the horſes, Elephants, and other beaſts for uſe in hunting, whereof they make them caps, that cover ſo well the head and neck, it is not eaſie for the ſavage beaſts to endanger them, there being ſteel piques that make them looſe their hold; nor is there great or ſmall, who hath not his horſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with theſe skins. Towns and Villages circumiacent to the hunting, come with a thouſand preſents and rejoycings to the King, eſteeming themſelves much honoured to have any ſhare of the prize, wherewith they make a publik feaſt, as of a thing ſacred and ſolemn. For their falconry and hawkes, the King hath eagles and ravens, ſo well trained both for furr and feather, that nothing more. Fiſhing is there likewiſe much pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. As we travailed through the Country, we came one day to a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98515:91"/>
mountain of extraordinary height, they call the <hi>Culma,</hi> or <hi>Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> grown over with all ſorts of trees, as Sendal, Danum, Ebony, Palmes of all ſorts, and others. All the ground we paſſed over was full of Rhubarbe,<note place="margin">Rhubarb.</note> with leaves large, and very bitter, and round the skirt of the mountain Tombes orderly ranged, cut in the rock,<note place="margin">Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> ingenuouſly carved. Maritime windes are frequent there which the <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Sourou,</hi> and other windes exceeding drying, which they call the <hi>Mounſons,</hi> and the <hi>Portugueſe Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zador,</hi> which conſume even iron.</p>
               <p>Theſe mountains have a reaſemblance of the <hi>Cordilleras</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> of a long extent. Amongſt the reſt there is one mountain that rain never falls upon, by reaſon the ſouthern windes which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually blow there, force back the cloudes, ſo as the mountain is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding barren.</p>
               <p>The mountain of <hi>Columa</hi> being fanned with the maritime windes on one ſide, preſerves and keepes incorruptible all the bodies brought thither. The other ſide towards the North, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the heads of trees, enjoyes rains in abundance: but both the one and the other ſide are fertilized with large ſtreams, that nouriſh theſe trees of excellent odour.</p>

For this purpoſe there are ſix men engaged, who buy their offices of the King, and whoſoever will cut a Tombe there, muſt pay great rates to the King: Their burialls are ſo conſiderable to them, that ſo ſoon as they are marrried they provide for it.</p>

               <p>As to the dead bodies, they who order them, cleanſe them exceeding carefully, putting within them a perfume like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, then the aſhes put in again, as I told you; the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>

While we were in <hi>Tranſiana,</hi> a Country appertaining to the Empire of <hi>Pegu,</hi> hearing ſpeech of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zatay,</hi> and the wonders of a Mountain there, I prevailed with my companion to go thither, ſo with an Interpreter two ſmall Elephants, and two <hi>Hacambals</hi> or Camels, we parted thence, leaving all our goods and Merchandizes with our Hoſt, having regiſtred them in the <hi>Caſa de la contration,</hi>

               <p>After three dayes travaile we came on the top of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, where there was a ſmall Town called <hi>Braſifir,</hi> here we had convenient accommodation that night; in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning going down we croſſed a River, and came to the other great Mountain we ſo much deſired to ſee,<note place="margin">The mountain of the ſun.</note> that appeared exceeding high and arduous: nevertheleſſe having aſcended

about two good leagues we met a man mounted on a Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medary coming down the Mountain, and aſking him if we had far to the next habitation, he anſwered we had but the tenth part of one Sun, as through the <hi>Indies</hi> they count Suns, that is, by dayes journies. Then travailing about an hour, we came to <hi>Tambo,</hi> and alighting from our beaſts that were all in a water for the difficult travaile, we found there plenty of proviſion for our refreſhment.

               <p>But I found my companion ſo incredulous of this matter, as he had reaſon, that we deſiſted, and on the morrow took the way to return whence we came: and ſince, meeting with a Gentleman of great curioſitie, he told me he had been in a Countrey beyond <hi>Swedeland,</hi> where for four moneths toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sun continually appeared, which muſt needs be in <hi>Lapland,</hi>

                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:98515:92"/>Hereupon I will ſay ſomething of the Aſtronomy uſed amongſt theſe Eaſt <hi>Indians</hi>; their opinion is, the earth is not round but flat,<note place="margin">The <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſtrange opinions in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</note> and that there are not, nor can be <hi>Antipodes,</hi> elſe ſay they, there muſt be two ſuns, one to lighten us, the other them; that there is but one Hemiſphere for the Sun and Moon to move in; that the ſun is not of the bigneſſe we make it, nor ſo great as the earth, whereof it is but the ſixtieth part, that the Sun never leaves our Hemiſphere, no not by night; but then conceales himſelfe behind certain Mountains. That 'twere a great folly to ſay the earth were higher then the heavens, which notwithſtanding muſt needs be, if we allow <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> That the <hi>Poles</hi> held immovable are not ſo, but that theſe two ſtarres turn within two degrees round the <hi>Pole.</hi> That 'tis an errour the Sun ſhould by night go hide himſelf under us: that the two <hi>Poles</hi> are not diametrically oppoſite, ſince, as they ſay, they may be ſeen at the ſame time, upon ſea and land, though very low nevertheleſſe. That if there were <hi>Antipodes,</hi> that muſt be the bottom of the earth, and all rivers would naturally run thither, contrary to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a thouſand other opinions as ſtrange, as abſurd, for want of knowledge in the ſpheare and Aſtronomy:</p>
               <p>So they laugh as at a thing childiſh and fabulous, at the opinion of the Ancients and Moderns on this ſide, of the rotundity of the earth in the middle of the world, and the Ubiquitary habitation, and that the Sun turns quite round from Eaſt to Weſt. They hold for certain, that the Sunne riſes in all other points, as they obſerve in <hi>Tazatay</hi> where they imagine it to riſe as 'twere North, and North-Weſt. They think to prove their phantaſtical imaginations, when they deſcribe the <hi>Iliaca,</hi> a bright ſtarre in the Weſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Iliaca <hi>and</hi> Pili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aca.</note> and oppoſite to that <hi>Biliaca,</hi> which appears beyond the Line; and is, that the ſhepheards fear ſo much,<note place="margin">This muſt be the dog or <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s head.</note> by the <hi>Perſians</hi> called <hi>Zobona,</hi> ſo mortiferous to cattle; for which cauſe they houſe them while that ſtarre raignes, and the better to preſerve them, they make them turn tayle to the ſtarre, for if they face it, it makes them languiſh, and dye in the end.</p>
               <p>They ſay that theſe two oppoſite ſtarres may be ſeen in a Line at the ſame time through a trunck, and that each moves about his Pole in twenty four houres, but that theſe are not the ſame, as the North, and the <hi>Cruſero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The North being no more diſtant from the Pole then two degrees and a quarter, and one of the other two, a degree and a half onely.</p>
               <p>And whereas the ancients obſerved onely two Poles, each in his Hemiſphere, they make ſix Poles in the ſame Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheare,

               <p>They jeer likewiſe at the frame of our ſpheare, and the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Zodiack into twelve ſignes; ſome to the North, ſome to the South, and underſtand not this but after their own way.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:98515:94"/>To paſſe theſe vaſt ſands, there muſt be made good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of victualls, water, and beaſt; for as a Merchant of <hi>Drogomania</hi> told me,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Drogoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> may be <hi>Dragoian,</hi> or <hi>Turco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania.</hi> Deſerts of <hi>Tartary.</hi>
                  </note> a Country confining Eaſtward upon theſe Kingdomes, the deſerts of <hi>Arabia</hi> are little in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to them: and when I told him the fourty tedious days it coſt us, betwixt <hi>Suria</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> through the deſerts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> he anſwered, this was nothing in reſpect, ſince by the help of guides they might here and there find a well, whereas in the deſerts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in two and twenty dayes journey together, nothing was to be found but ſand, and that one day as he travailed along with the convoy, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune one of the jarrs of water broke, which was a great miſchiefe to them, and a very important loſſe, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for want of it to kill one of their Camells, to drink the loathſome water within him, and eat his fleſh.</p>
               <p>He told me then for more commodious paſſage, above all things it was neceſſary to provide good beaſts, and chiefly <hi>Perſian</hi> Aſſes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Perſian</hi> Aſſes.</note> the beſt beaſt the world affords for carriage, and the moſt proper for thoſe wayes, and are worth as much as a good horſe.</p>
               <p>That after theſe ſands they came to huge Mountains, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely barren, which in my opinion muſt needs be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, but they try them not, they are ſo far diſtant, and the way ſo troubleſom.</p>
               <p>I obſerved in my Eaſt and Weſtern voyages, that where the Mines of gold, ſilver, and precious ſtones, where the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were ordinarily barren, having nothing growing about them, as they obſerve of the <hi>Calanfour,</hi> or clove, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no plant near it.</p>
               <p>The Merchant obſerved likewiſe, that in theſe Mountains, which muſt be thoſe the Ancients called <hi>Juac,</hi> dividing high and low <hi>Aſia</hi>; there are abundance of ſerpents of prodigious bigneſſe,<note place="margin">Serpents good meat.</note> but are more advantage then damage to them; for being free from venom, and of an excellent ſubſtance and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, they eat there nothing elſe. As I remember I ſaw in the Mountains of <hi>Syr,</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, paſſing theſe Mountains, and lodging with the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> under their tents, 'twas our admiration to ſee huge ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents play with children, who would give them morſells of bread.</p>
               <p>But to return to our <hi>Tartarian</hi> Merchant, he told me, that having paſſed this Mountainous Country, they came to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſert, of twenty dayes over, void of all food, where he was conſtrained to ſtray a good dayes journey to hunt for water, and other commodities, and this too with weapon in hand, becauſe there lives a certain <hi>Horde</hi> or nation of

               <p>He told me that about three yeares before this breed of Raſcals were almoſt all devoured by their own dogs, after their cruell uſage of certain Merchants who paſſed that way, theſe to revenge themſelves made an Ambuſh, and having taken them, ſerved them as they had done others.</p>
               <p>He told me many other curioſities of this country, and amongſt others, that about twenty years before, he paſſed by the Iſle of <hi>Volmous</hi> or <hi>Ayman,</hi> near to <hi>Cauchinchina,</hi> and the country of the <hi>Meores,</hi> that the people are haughty, great ſouldiers,<note place="margin">Volmous.</note> well clothed, and very civil, lovers of honour and vertue, and of complexion rather white then black: that the land is full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitrable Foreſts, but well ſtor'd with Veniſon, and betwixt the Mountains good paſturadge; that they had there a potent King by the title of Emperour, on the day of his birth, wearing on his head three Crowns, in form of a <hi>Tiara,</hi> for the three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes he poſſeſſed: that this Prince was King of <hi>Sinabo,</hi> the <hi>Magers,</hi> and <hi>Patanes.</hi>

               <p>Amongſt other particulars of this country,<note place="margin">This muſt be the great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor.</hi>
                  </note> he related to me a ſtrange Hiſtory, if it be true: Thus, that in a mountanous country vulgarly called <hi>Iſmanca,</hi> very fertile, where there are clownes very wealthy in cattell, whereof they drive a great trade; as alſo in ſkins of divers beaſts: there was a rich ſhepherd called <hi>Iſmahan,</hi> who amongſt other children, had a daughter of excellent beauty, who according to the cuſtome of the country,<note place="margin">A Hiſtory of an <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
                  </note> kept her fathers flocks.</p>
               <p>This maid of twenty yeares of age, loved a young ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd her neighbour and kinſman, but poor, and to whoſe Father the rich ſhepherd had ſent ſome corn, who ſeeing he could not be paid, and being aware of his daughters affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he told his debtor, that on condition he would ſend his ſon to live in ſome remote parts, he would forgive the debt, which the other did; the young man being thus baniſhed by force, the maid was extremely afflicted, and as one day ſhe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone in the fields, lamenting the abſence of her beloved <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> ſo he was called; a Fiend in the ſame ſhape appeared to her, and demanded for whom ſhe was ſo much tormented, ſince ſhe had him aſſuredly preſent, and that he loved her more then the world beſides.</p>
               <p>Some ſay this poor young man being baniſhed the preſence of his dear Miſtreſſe, ſought out a Magician, who promiſed he ſhould ſee and enjoy her; but bringing into a room to him a ſpirit in the form of the maid, as the ſpirits of joy and love made him fly

to embrace her, the <hi>Demon</hi> ſtrangled him afterwards, taking the ſhape, or rather the body of the dead youth, continued his viſits a long time to the maid, whereof her Father and Brothers having notice, reſolved to ſurprize him; and in effect breaking up her chamber door, they found a ſtinking carcaſſe in bed by her, at which both ſhe and the reſt were extremely frighted; and the King of the country having notice of it, ſent for the maid to know the truth, which ſhe related as it was. The King ſent her to live with an Aunt of his, where they ſay the Devil ſtill frequented her, and would viſit her publickly in the ſhape of her friend, wherein ſhe took extreme content, nor could ſhe be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from his converſation. How I know not, but they ſay ſhe conceived, and was delivered of two children; who grown up, became the moſt valiant and ſtrong in the country: ſo as ſince ſpirits are incapable of generation, as the beſt Divines conclude; we may ſuppoſe this was the youth himſelf, who by the Magicians means enjoyed the maid, and was afterwards killed by the devil that abuſed him; and indeed ſome authentick authours mention ſuch another Hiſtory of one <hi>Phillinnion,</hi> and <hi>Machetus,</hi> and others.<note place="margin">Phlegon Trallianus.</note>

               <p>He had about fifty draughts of the principal townes in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Tartary</hi>; and had leave of the Vice-roy to draw the plots of as many more as he would; his deſign being to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile them in a large volume, and preſent it to the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; but I underſtood afterwards, that returning for <hi>Europe,</hi> he died upon the ſea of <hi>Scarbut,</hi> and for that his Comerade had diſguſted him, he would not give him his memorials and draughts, but by Teſtament bequeathed them to the Captain of the ſhip he was in, <hi>Joſeph Grogne</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> eſteemed a Jew though he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Chriſtian.

In fine, ſo fertile are theſe countries, that like thoſe water'd by the river <hi>Nile,</hi> they yield two harveſts annually, and each harveſt of ſufficiency to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the people with proviſion for five years.

               <p>To conclude, the Iſland is ſo plentiful of cattle, that they have often given a fat ſheep for a Counter, or a leafe of paper; and a Marriner told me for truth, that being at the point of <hi>Cape Salido,</hi> to take in freſh water; an inhabitant of the Town of <hi>Antipara,</hi> gave him four Cowes for a ſcurvie piece of leather, he was about to throw into the Sea with his dead Maſter.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Sieur Amador</hi> told me, how that paſſing through this Iſland, <hi>Alitadir</hi> King of <hi>Janiharou</hi> ſent for him to have a piece of Scarlet, and that being upon a River imbarked with a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> they ſayled two dayes compleat from the mouth of the River; then landed, where were ready for them two Chariots drawn by four bufflers a piece, which brought them to the King.</p>
               <p>This River is called <hi>Janiharou</hi> from the name of the chiefe Town, where they have extream heats in the month of <hi>February,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IV. The Country of <hi>Monbaze, Melinde,</hi> and <hi>Quiloa:</hi> the nature of the Inhabitants, and the reſpect they bear their PRINCE.</head>
               <p>HAving left <hi>Bulgara,</hi> we run all along that ſtretched forth coaſt of <hi>Ethiope,</hi> where we viſited <hi>Melindo, Monbaze, Quiloa, Mozambique, Cefala,</hi> and other Townes, for truck of our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>The country of <hi>Monbaze</hi> takes name from a Town and Iſland ſo called, which on the Eaſt hath the vaſt Indian ſea, on the North <hi>Melinde,</hi> on the South <hi>Quiloa,</hi> and Weſtward the ſpacious lake of <hi>Zaflan,</hi> and the kingdome of <hi>Xoa</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Abyſſins.</hi> Heretofore this kingdome was ſubject to a great Prince ſtyled the King of <hi>Monemuge,</hi> neighbouring to <hi>Ethiope, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natapa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The town of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baze.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Mozambique.</hi> As for <hi>Monbaze</hi> 'tis a Town about the rate of <hi>Monpellier,</hi> built almoſt after the <hi>Italian</hi> model: the people are of Olive colour, affable, courteous, and well apparelled, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the women, who delight in rich apparel.</p>
               <p>There is a good Sea-port, ſtrong, and much frequented by the Indians, who drive a great trade in ſpices, drugges, and precious ſtones, which much enriches the place, and brings a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of people from <hi>Zanzbar, Penda, Agair,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Africa.</hi> There is gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, and Ivory in great quantity. The country abounds in good fruit of all ſorts, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in Citrons and Oranges of prodigious bigneſſe, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent taſte, whereof the rind is ſweet, and good to eat. There are likewiſe Peaches without ſtones, but of little ſavour, Pomegranates exceeding large; and above all, excellent waters, freſh and light, herein ſurpaſſing <hi>Quiloa,</hi> which is defective.</p>
               <p>The People are of a ſweet diſpoſition, contrary to other Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time places, where the natives are ordinarily mutinous, and liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. We had there an Hoſt called <hi>Franceſco Coſmel,</hi> of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion between black and white, as he were born of a Father black, and a Mother white, he gave us teſtimonies of a generous ſoule, and ſeemed to be of good extraction. He lodged us in the chief chamber of the houſe hanged with Matte, both walls and floore, with abundance of well-wrought cuſhions, with an artificial foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on one ſide which water'd little trees, where was a whole flight of birds of Paradiſe male and female, which contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion had feet, as I ſaid elſewhere; whereupon I ſhall relate a pleaſant paſſage which befell us. My companion reſolving to go
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98515:101"/>
to a jolly town not far thence to put off ſome Safron which he had, was taken with an extreme cholick, which made him go to ſtool oftner then he would, in our chamber there was a little Ciſtern full of pure water, he finding himſelf preſſed, and conceiving this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern to be a place of purpoſe for diſcharge, ſeats himſelf on it.<note place="margin">A merry paſſage, ſee the like ſtory in the firſt part.</note>
               </p>
               <p>By misfortune there was a young maid waſhing clothes, who finding this naſty ſhowre fall upon her, began to cry out, and I that knew what the matter was, immediately went out; pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had ſomething to buy; ſo as my companion, who ſuſpected nothing, was amazed, when he ſaw two ſlaves fall upon him with cudgels, who cured his diſeaſe with a new ſort of Cataplaſme.</p>
               <p>Returning up again I ſaw this lucky adventure, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion as well as he could defending himſelf. In fine, after many excuſes, the matter was taken up, by mediation of twenty ſeven Miticales, each being in value four French Livers; which my companion was forced to pay for mundifying the Ciſtern. True it is he was cured of his cholick, but ſo aſhamed of the accident, he had not confidence to ſuppe with us.</p>
               <p>The Territory of <hi>Monbaze</hi> is of no great extent, confining on one ſide on the Town of <hi>Orgaba,</hi> or <hi>Orgabea</hi> ſeated on the river <hi>Onchir,</hi> which runs to powre it ſelf into <hi>Nile</hi> near Mount <hi>Amara,</hi> where the kingdome of <hi>Melinde</hi> begins, having <hi>Amara</hi> on the North, and <hi>Monbaze</hi> on the Eaſt. The common diet of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is honey and rice, their drink <hi>Areta, Fatigar,</hi> and <hi>Belinganze,</hi> which they keep in great Oxe hornes, cut in ſeverall figures, that they may be the more uſeful.</p>
               <p>This ſort of veſſel is much uſed in the Ethiopian Court, as well for their capacity, as their not being liable to break, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with the <hi>Monbazians,</hi> who nevertheleſſe will make no uſe of any but of a beaſt that had his throat cut, deriving this cuſtome from the Jews.</p>
               <p>In their traffick with Merchants they apply charms to force them to their intent, a thing I never obſerved in any other nation.<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</note> When notice comes that ſome neighbour Prince hath ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to their King upon affaires of importance, they doe then much more. They take a wilde goat by them called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorati,</hi> and having laid ſome charmes upon it, mounted upon his Elephant, the Prince paſſes three times over him with moſt horrible cries and imprecations, which their <hi>Labis</hi> or <hi>Prieſts</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt their <hi>Singiſcan</hi> or <hi>Demon:</hi> Then having made three cries more in manner of prayer, they require to know if this Embaſſadour comes for Peace or Warre, if it be anſwered for Peace, they march before him with abundance of perfumes, and ſignes of joy; and being arrived at the Town, the perfumes are caſt into the water, to ſhew that all this was only to do him honour, and to endear him. But if it be for Warre, they teſtify the plain contrary.</p>

In great reverence they have likewiſe a Virgin by name <hi>Peru,</hi> and have Monaſteries where live recluſe maids; moreover, they are grand magicians, as they are through the whole country of <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee.</hi> There came a certain one who reported he had paſſed the kingdomes of <hi>Candabar, Couzani, Tranſiani, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſbeque,</hi> and many other countries of the Eaſt, as <hi>China, San, Pegu, Bengale, Beſnagari, Calicut,</hi> and the wide ſea of <hi>Alondon,</hi> to have runne through all the dominions of <hi>Preſte John,</hi> to have been in the floods of the Torrid without wetting himſelfe, clothed with a meer Sattin, walking upon the clouds, to have paſſed the <hi>Zember</hi> upon the back of a devill, and to have arrived in the kingdome of <hi>Sahama,</hi> to finde the <hi>Monopotapa</hi> to declare his Religion to him, having in few dayes gone thirteen thouſand leagues. He added far more, the particular ſatisfaction he received after ſo long a travell, in that the Prince cauſed four Chriſtians their hateful enemies to be maſſacred, and engaged in honour of their God to pray at the Temple five times the day, under pain of the ſcourge.</p>
               <p>The King building a faith in this ſorcerer, made an ordinance that all ſhould yield obedience to this <hi>Mulila</hi> and his aſſociates, whom they named the <hi>Jubacumba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt time the people preſented themſelves at their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but being abſent the ſecond time, theſe impoſtor Prieſts, coming forth, fell upon them with ſcourges made of Elephants hyde, and beat them moſt rudely, perſevering in this harſh way of treatment, till on a day a young <hi>Portugues,</hi> called <hi>Franciſco Sanche,</hi> who lived in the Fort of <hi>Safala,</hi> being come to the town for trade, and to viſit a Miſtreſſe he had, a Merchants daughter, received ſome laſhes in the ſtreet from theſe magicians, whereupon being ſenſible of his injury, lets flye his cimeterre at one of them, and lays him dead on the ground, without much trouble, confiding in the Kings favour, to whom he had brought a preſent from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Fort <hi>Henrique Mendez,</hi> and they joyning in their defence, he killed four, and wounded four more, then mounted on horſe, and went ſafe off.</p>
               <p>The King being told of it fell into laughter, and praiſed the <hi>Portugues</hi> for his courage, which ingratiated him with his Miſtris; ſo as ſhe after married him.</p>
               <p>True it is, this Prince had not long before put ſome Jeſuits to death, but he made them ample ſatisfaction, by putting to death all the Mahometans, who gave him ſuch councell, whereupon the Fathers of <hi>Cochin</hi> being advertiſed of it, ſent others preſently, who declared to the King the benefit they were to all mankind, in inſtruction and ſalvation of ſouls, and gain'd ſo highly upon his grace, that beſides other particular favours which he did them, he granted free liberty to his people to be converted, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Chriſtian faith. So it is that Chriſtian faith was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the fathers of the ſociety, where to this day 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98515:107"/>
and practiſed by them and the Dominicans, and though the Prince be an Idolater, he is a well-wiſher to the Chriſtians. He holds a ſtately gravity, allowing audience to none but on the knee, nor tergiverſation in retiring. No man hath acceſſe but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extreme ſubmiſſions, and proſtrating himſelf on the ground on ſix paces diſtance, the Princes anſwers are briefe. He delights at be decked with chains and ſtones as women are, beſtowes little, and loves to be preſented with all curioſities poſſible. He keeps a great <hi>Pack</hi> or <hi>Seraglio</hi> of wives, and ſome ſay he hath a guard of armed Ladies, like <hi>Amazons,</hi> and a number of fierce great dogges.</p>

               <p>The King muſt not go robed, but after the manner of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; that is, a Caſſock of his own country ſilk, for ſtuffes brought from forrain parts he wears not for fear of poyſon, over this a large and long ſcarfe, like a womans mantle, which comes betwixt his legs, and is brought up to be tucked under his girdle, with a rich handcherchief over his ſhoulders, he hath buskins embroydered with gold, and rich carkanets on his neck, with a band about his hat interwoven with big pearles, rubies, and emeralds. He makes great uſe of Elephants, and of a beaſt called an <hi>Alſinge,</hi> ſeldome ridden on, which reſembles a hart, never uſing horſes, for that rhere are ſo few.</p>
               <p>What is moſt remarkable in this place is, that there is no ſort of priſon, the reaſon, becauſe all matters of juſtice are finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon the place.

               <p>The Kings wives are moſt richly and artificially attired, who live ſeparate in ſeveral apartements, without any knowledge of one another, unleſſe when through ſpeciall grace he convokes them. 'Tis pain of death for him that but goes about the lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of theſe Ladies.</p>
               <p>Many Colledges likewiſe where youth is inſtructed in vertue. The Ladies of quality held it an honour to dreſſe the Princes meat, and wait by turnes, taking charge of his diet at meals, at which time he hath Muſicians for his alacrity, but they are hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinded, that they may not view his face, and when he drinks, a great perſon calls out aloud, <hi>Pray for the Kings health.</hi>

The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers for his ſervice are compounded with odours. When he goes forth in a morning, if the Sun with his rayes have not refined the

               <p>The Royall Pallace is very commodious, flank'd with Towers without, within furniſh'd with cotton cloth of diverſe colours, gold tiſſue: the floore coſtly pav'd with plates of gold cut in figures, with great Candleſticks of ivory hung in chaines of ſilver; Seats enriched with gold Folliage, properly beautified with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and Tranſparent Ennamell, and foure Principall Gates, ſumptuouſly wrought; and Guarded by thoſe they call <hi>Sequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> His Family is by a number of Officers, very orderly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, who obſerve him with a moſt profound ſilence. While he ſits at Table, you heare not a whiſper, nor the leaſt noiſe. His Veſſell is Purcelan, garniſh'd and ſet round with ſprigs of gold, faſhion'd like Corall.

               <p>When this King Marches to the Warr in Magnificence, he weares a Robe of ſilke, with hanging ſleeves, a girdle enchaſ'd with ſtones of peculiar vertues, as the Magicians make him beleive; a Poniard at his girdle, and his ſword borne before him by a Prince, with a ſmall casket of jewells; Himſelf in a Littar, born by Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, called <hi>Singaro,</hi> one Page marches before him, with his Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brella, another with a fan of <hi>Auſtrich</hi> feathers, which are here in

He hath with him a hundred Elephants, capariſon'd with the skins of Sea-oxen, unpeirceable by any dart, each carrying foure <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nukes,</hi> with croſs-bowes, of farther reach then long-bowes.

This <hi>Beſigu</hi> beares a bow and quiver, a ſhort ſword, and a coat of Sea-oxe. In the Van of the Elephants march great Maſtiffs, cap'd in the ſame manner, to each a keeper, who hath him linked to his girdle with an iron chaine. In ſumme, tis of Faith with all of them,<note place="margin">Subjects zealous to their Prince.</note> that he who dies for his King, gains ſalvation, though in other points they embrace all ſorts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, telling you they cannot be damn'd, for that they are freinds with all the Gods in Heaven, and cheifely with <hi>Runia, Adula, Iſaten,</hi> thoſe are the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Gods.</p>
               <p>In the Head of this Maſtiffe-Regiment, Marches a body of Musketteirs, who do good ſervice with their fire-clubs: before them above two thouſand chariots, covered with leather, drawn with ſix oxen, which carry each fifteen men, of thoſe called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſrait,</hi> with ſhort guns, like <hi>Carabins.</hi> One part of the Army may ſhade by day under theſe Charrets, which again will ſhelter them by night, while the Maſtiffs with their keepers lye in the Head, under Tents, who by turns ſtand centinell abroad. The whole Army Marches divided in three Squadrons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eunuques</hi> go clothed like women, and do all ſorts of ſervice, dreſs their Maſters diet, made of Rice, Mill, or the Root <hi>Igname,</hi> whereof they make cakes, which are heavy, and offenſive to the ſtomack, and ſoon hurt it. Their ordinary fare is powder'd beef, milke a little turn'd their drink; The King, &amp; Great ones drink hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed-wine, which they keep in oxe-hornes, as they do in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>

               <p>The Vulgar are cloathed only from the girdle downwards, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up their privities in little purſes, or pumpions, made hollow like ſheaths, when they go into the field, by reaſon of certain venimous creatures, which ſting cruelly, wherewith ſome have been ſore handled.</p>
               <p>All that belong to the Court, are known by the priviledge they have, to weare upon the ſhoulder the <hi>Talmaſſaca,</hi> or Mantle of ſeverall ſtuffs, according to quality, and of the ſort the King wears it, which is very coſtly, and tis a high Honour to weare the Mantle of the Kings make.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:98515:108"/>Poyſon is very common throughout the Empire, and at deare rates, there being ſome that is ſold at a hundred Miticales, or Sequins the ounce; The reaſon ſo much is uſed, is, the rigour of the King, and his Miniſters of Juſtice, who inflict ſuch cruell pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments upon Offenders.</p>
               <p>For, no ſooner hath a perſon committed a Crime, but he is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the inſtant, and if the Crime requires the Offender ſhould be ſuſpended ſome dayes, to render his puniſhment more long and greivous, he is tyed to a tree, with ſtrong guards, there being no Priſons, as I ſaid before; ſo, as the Criminall ſeeing no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſcape, the beſt remedy is to poyſon himſelf, by a ſpeedy death to cut off the rigour of a long paine.</p>
               <p>Nor will the Prince be clothed with any thing but what is made within his own Palace, for fear of poyſon. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain trees called <hi>Coſcoma,</hi> which beare fruit like the golden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of violet ſent, which taſtes well, but, being eaten in any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, purges ſo violently, that it voids blood, and at laſt is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. There are thoſe that ingroſs the poyſon by Patent, for which they pay a high exciſe to the Prince, by reaſon there are ſo many who uſe it for there death, to free themſelves from the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Juſtice, for there is no pardon to be expected for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If one injures another without cauſe, he is cruelly baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do'd, as they are in <hi>Turky,</hi> where I have ſeen Judges themſelves, for that they have failed in Juſtice, puniſhed in that manner.</p>
               <p>They are laid naked upon the ground, and the Officer, or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, is to beat them with a cord knotted, and buttond at the end, and when the Preſident gives the word, then he doth his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: having done, he gets up, puts on his clothes again, and gives thanks to the Judges, and Executioner, for their Juſtice, without any diſgrace for the matter, and returns to his function, as if no ſuch thing had happened. This makes the Judges can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did in their ſentences. The greateſt Lords and Magiſtrates find the like from the King, as I obſerved before, ſpeaking of <hi>Melnida.</hi> For, he hath them caſtigated in his preſence privately, and then with inſtructions diſmiſſes to their charge. Juſtice thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely executed, without exception of perſons, preſerves the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in firm Peace and Tranquillity, and gets the King as 'twere a Divine Adoration, ſo really, that as he paſſes thorough the ſtreets, the people praying for him, caſt themſelves to the ground on their face, not preſuming ſo much as to look upon him.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Princes and particular Lords, fancy much to hang bells at their neck or leg, conceiving it well becomes them.</p>
               <p>At Court every man goes habited as pleaſes him beſt, ſo,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lions</hi> skins</note> as there are Courtiers: but they are of the higheſt rank, who, over all, weare a large caſſock, of a Lions skin, made up unſhapely enough, as they uſe in <hi>Preſte Johns</hi> Court; but no man can weare this Lions garment, but a Prince of the blood.

               <p>BEeing here, we further came to underſtand that <hi>Alfumigarba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> one of the laſt who raigned in this Empire, dying ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the age of 47. years, without leaſure to call a prudent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, or ſettle the ſucceſſion in the child, that of all the reſt, he moſt deſired, amongſt the ſixty four ſons and eleven daughters, which he had by ſeveral wives, whoſe name was <hi>Abditſinda,</hi> his minion, a gallant and generous Prince.</p>
               <p>This change bred great tumults and diſſentions at Court, each of theſe wives ſtriving to thruſt her childs head under the crown, ſo as to attain more eaſily to it, and to gain the Peers and Officers of the Crown, to purchaſe the Scepter, they ſpared not whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was deareſt to them, a cauſe of much blood and murther. Of theſe ſons there were four principal, whoſe names were <hi>Abga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou, Adala, Corcut,</hi> and <hi>Gulman,</hi> who having ſeap'd ſome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes upon their perſons, united themſelves againſt their other brothers, of whom they put to death as many as they could lay hold on, the reſt ſaved themſelves in ſeveral places, flying the cruelty of thoſe who proclaimed Offices and places of truſt to whoſoever brought in their heads. During this ſtate of things, here raged great warres, and many bloody encounters paſſed, wherein two of the four brothers payed their lives, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained only <hi>Corgut</hi> and <hi>Gulman,</hi> who at laſt reconciled with a general peace, and lived in great amity, copartners in the royalty, ſo as after the modell of <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polinice,</hi> thoſe ancient Kings of <hi>Thebes,</hi> each governed ſix moneths by turns. This laſted for a time, till <hi>Corcut</hi> took to wife the Princeſſe <hi>Dafila,</hi> an ambitious Lady, who ſix moneths after her nuptials, perſwaded her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to murther his brother, and reign without a partner, which was done accordingly, calling him to Court under pretence of communicating ſome affaires of conſequence, and ſo he became ſole King, and reigned thirteen years, till an Uncle of his called <hi>Nahi,</hi>

in revenge, put both him, his wife, children, and all his allies to death, to the great content of the people, for the hatred he bore to this unfortunate Fratricide. Then they imagined an ancient Prophecy which they kept amongſt them, was accompliſhed: <hi>That the Lamb ſhould kill both the Wolfe and his wife:</hi> She was called <hi>Gildada,</hi> and was drowned. But the King of <hi>Dafila</hi> incenſed with the death of his daughter and Son-in-law, brought a moſt cruell warre upon the new King <hi>Nahi,</hi> wherein fell numbers on both ſides. In the mean while, amongſt the Princes who had ſcap'd the truculent hands of their brothers, one there was who ſtrayed far off, and got into the kingdome of <hi>Deli,</hi> where contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to live meanly as an unknown private perſon, he purchaſed a ſmall poſſeſſion for his livelihood, and betook himſelf to labour: where taking a wife, ſhe brought him a ſon they called <hi>Alfondi</hi>; who at ſeven or eight years of age, gave the world great hopes of his perſon, for the excellent parts which began to bud in him, and which made him amiable to all men; in ſo much that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting himſelfe to the words, as yeares encreaſed his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, he did wonders in the ſlaying of Lions, Beares, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, and other furious beaſts, and in all his actions appeared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was great and noble; inſomuch as hearing ſpoken on day how ſtrenuous a war there raged betwixt <hi>Tahachi</hi> his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known great Uncle, and the King of <hi>Dafila,</hi> he was tranſported with emulation to be a Party, and being furniſhed with a good horſe and Arms, with the ſociety of a Troop of brave young men, he haſted to thoſe parts, where, in the ſervice of <hi>Tahachi,</hi> he ſoon gave proofe of his Courage, and abilities in warr; but, amongſt others, on one ſignall occaſion which preſented it ſelfe, where, with a ſmall party of Souldiers, he defeated the much more numerous Enemy; and the King of <hi>Dafila</hi> admiring his Valour, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under-hand to win him to his ſide, by offering a Daughter of his in Marriage, with a Province, which he had taken from <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hachi.</hi> To which <hi>Afondi</hi> ſeeming to give eare, dexterouſly made uſe of the opportunity, to ſeize upon the Towne of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> a moſt conſiderable place, which exceedingly pleaſed <hi>Tahachi,</hi> and heightned his affection to him, feeling, I know not what ſecret motion in his ſoul, which puſhed him on to this Dearneſſe, without any apprehenſion that he was his Nephew; but, Good blood, as they ſay, cannot diſſemble.

                  <hi>Alfondi</hi> raiſed to ſo high a degree, reflects upon his father the honeſt labourer, whom he omitted not to ſend for, who being arrived, and having declared who he was, begat an unparalleld joy in <hi>Tabochi</hi> and his whole kingdome, every one ſhedding teares for his diſcovery, rendring praiſe to God, and his juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for reducing things to ſo unhoped for a point, and after ſo many years repoſing the inheritance on him, to whom of right it appertained.

He had conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the Province of <hi>Quame</hi> one <hi>Abdalami,</hi> a perſon of high quality, his confident, a gallant Cavalier, and one who had done moſt ſignal ſervices in the war with the King of <hi>Dafila</hi>; but being inclined to avarice, and hord up wealth, he played the Tyrant, and ſacked the country to ſatiate his own humour, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of ſome women he gave entertainment to: When <hi>Tahachi</hi> was informed thereof, he was much diſpleaſed, for 'twas his rule to maintain equal juſtice, peace and freedome amongſt his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Notwithſtanding he concealed his reſentments for a while, giving way to his proceedings as well for his great ſervices, as for that he had beſtowed on him a kinſwoman to wife, called <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinda,</hi> by whom he had children. He admoniſhed him often by letter, to bear himſelfe more temperately, but perceiving his ſmall regard, by the conſtant intruſion of complaints that came to him, he ſent expreſſe command that he ſhould repaire immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to Court to give account of his actions upon pain of death, and being proclaimed rebell, and guilty of his treaſon. <hi>Abdalami</hi> underſtanding his own wealth and power, ſlighted this ſummons, and fortified himſelf in the holds of his Government. Whereupon the King cauſed his wife and children to be apprehended and brought priſoners to his city royall. This Princeſſe with her beſt art excuſed her huſband, beſeeching his Majeſties mercy towards him, for his former ſervices, adding withall that theſe complaints, were but a calumny raiſed by the malice of his enemies. The King covering his reſentments, mildely anſwered her, that ſhe ſhould only procure her huſband to come to Court, but ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring his perſon in danger, thought beſt only to adviſe him
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98515:110"/>
to ſend a certain Casket of rings, and all ſorts of rich jewels for a preſent to the Queen, and by that means work his peace: This he did, and ſhe having preſented it, the Queen ſhewed them to the King, who wondred at ſo great a treaſure, where amongſt others were five hundred pearles, each being a Miticale or Crown and half in weight, beſides many other jewels of value, ſufficient to buy a kingdome. 'Twas much affliction to the Prince to ſee ſuch treaſures gotten at the price of his peoples blood, and then he commanded the Princeſſe his kinſwoman to bring her huſband to Court by a day appointed, or he would make feel the weight of his diſpleaſure. Poor <hi>Abdalami</hi> was amazed at the news, and fearing not without cauſe, the Kings incenſement, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to come accordingly; and without calling on his wife and children, went ſtrait to the Palace, where having ſounded the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet according to the cuſtome, as I obſerved before; he unclothed himſelf, and ſitting on the ground ſtark naked, only a linnen cloth before his concealed parts, he attended in this manner the mercy of the King: whereof notice being brought to his Lady, ſhe with her children diſrobed in like manner, went to the Palace gate, and there ſeated themſelves on the ground by him, with each a great ſtone on their head.</p>
               <p>The Queen eſpying them from her window, in this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, moved with compaſſion, ſhewed them to the King, who gave order they ſhould be bidden to reveſt themſelves, go back to their lodgings, and there attend his further pleaſure; ſo they did, trembling with expectation of the conſequence.</p>
               <p>Many adviſed <hi>Abdalami</hi> to make eſcape, and his wife her ſelf was of that opinion; but he would not be perſwaded, his ſervices raiſing him a confidence of the Kings clemency. Now moreover to compleat his calamity, when the King began to relent, the ſuits and ſupplications which came on all ſides in his behalf, one of the principal perſons in the Court called <hi>Iſman,</hi> charges him with a new crime, complaining to the King that he had ſeduced &amp; debauched a daughter of his, for which he craves juſtice, which ſuſpended the Kings clemency, reſolving to examine the truth of the matter, which proved, in fine, to be but a meer ſuppoſall.</p>
               <p>For it was moſt true, that <hi>Abdalami</hi> being a Prince of an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble form and beauty, and of high eſteem for his valour, this Lords daughter had ſo impetuous a Love-paſſion for him, that ſhe fell ſick to death, and <hi>Abdalamies</hi> Lady viſiting her as a friend, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſhe fell on weeping as oft as ſhe beheld her, whereupon one day ſhe importuned to know the reaſon, conjuring her to ſpeak freely if ſhe had in any thing offended her, proteſting ſhe was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make her as ample ſatisfaction, as ſhe could deſire. The poor Lady confounded with ſhame, was ſometime before ſhe could form her anſwer, but at length love taking place of Virgin-modeſty, ſhe ingenuouſly confeſſed the eauſe of her diſtemper,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98515:111"/>
with ſuch abundance of tears, ſighs, and ſupplications of pardon for the affront ſhe offered her, that the other was moved to ſuch tenderneſſe, ſhe promiſed her notwithanding one ſo near and dear to her as a huſband was aimed at; nevertheleſſe in pity of her violent paſſion, which deſerved ſome pardon, ſhe would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute what was poſſible to her reliefe; hereupon the young Lady told her, how ſhe had preſented by her bond-maid a chain of pearl and rubies to her huſband, with requeſt that he would wear them for her ſake, which he accepted as well for the value of the thing, as for that the ſlave was a gay and pretty girle, to whom he gave a pair of pendants of <hi>Fauſer</hi> diamonds, of an Olive figure; but for the Miſtreſſe, he returned her a bare meagar thanks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further acknowledgement, which the ſlave notwithſtanding diſſembled, making her Miſtreſſe believe he had a ſtrong affection for her, and for love of her, wore her favour: and ſo this ſlave treated her with theſe fictions, in hope to give ſome remiſſion to the violence of her paſſion, and twas ſhe who firſt embarked her in theſe amorous follies.</p>
               <p>The Lady was amazed at theſe paſſages, and remembred the chain, becauſe her huſband had given it to her ſelf, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting her where he had it.</p>
               <p>Now being deſirous to invert ſome cure for her malady, though a moſt perfect reciprocal affection animated both her huſband and ſelf, notwithſtanding compaſſion forced her inclinations to offer her a nights concubitation with her huſband; which ſo reviv'd this Damſells heart, that immediately ſhe aroſe from her bed, and in few dayes was perfectly recover'd. To compaſſe this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her husbands diſcovery, ſhe conſulted both with the daughter, and the Lady her Mother, who was likewiſe of the Party; ſo, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, ſhe told her husband ſhe found ſome unuſuall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in the ſtate of health, and entreated him he would forbear her enjoyments for ſome nights, which expir'd <hi>Abdalami</hi> paſſionate for her commpany: ſhe, to heighten his flame, ſhewed ſome unwillingneſs, till preſſing her with importunity, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented for the enſuing night, upon condition that for that night he ſhould not ſpeak a word to her. Being thus agreed, ſhe gives the Lady notice to be ready at the houre appointed, ſo being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the wives roome, ſhe conceived with child, without the husbands knowledge of the juggle. Meanwhile, time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Father perceive the growth of his daughter, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by her acknowledgment, whoſe act it was, fired with rage, accompanied with his Allies and Relations, without delay he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires to the King, with a violent complaint of this injury, as I ſaid before. Hereupon <hi>Tahachi</hi> enters into a deep conſideration of theſe two Perſons, whereof the one was his Kinſman, and of high deſerts for his ſervices, the other was Lord of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Eſſen,</hi> between <hi>Dafila</hi> and <hi>Ganfilira,</hi> below <hi>Barnagaſſo,</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:98515:111"/>
heretofore tributary to the great <hi>Negus,</hi> but being not inclined to be a Chriſtian himſelf, nor be ſubject to a Chriſtian King, had put himſelf voluntarily under the dominion of <hi>Tahachi</hi> an Infidel. In concluſion the King reſolved to have the matter examined, and to pronounce Juſtice as the cauſe merited. And hereupon notice was given to <hi>Abdalami</hi> of the accuſation, wherein being conſcious of his own innocence, he was much ſatisfied that the Kings anger lay on that ſide, and conferring with his Lady, told her he admired the impudence of that Lord, to accuſe him of a a thing he was ſo ignorant of, and much more at the inſolency of his daughter, that laid two baſtards to his charge: The Lady ſmiled, as who ſhould ſay it may be true, whereupon as he was about to make oaths and proteſtations to the contrary ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and related the whole to him, and how the buſineſſe was brought to paſſe by her invention, whereat he was ſtrangely amazed, admiring his Ladies goodneſſe, that was ſo charitable to her own injury. In this conjuncture, the King gave licence to Lord <hi>Iſman</hi> to take revenge of <hi>Abdalami</hi> in what ſort he could, under his aſſured grace; ſo he now layes wait for all occaſions to effect it, and to ſurpriſe him on the water as he went to take the Ayre, for the town of <hi>Zanzibar,</hi> or <hi>Zanguebar,</hi> is compleatly encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled with water, which runs both within and without, and almoſt every inhabitant hath his <hi>Almady</hi> or flat boat, wherein they recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate upon the Lake. But <hi>Abdalami,</hi> whether advertiſed, or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting it, ſtood upon his conſtant guard, ſo as paſſing one day upon the water, before the windowes of the Palace-royall, that the King might have the proſpect, if any one attacked him, <hi>Iſman</hi> comes up with his boats to aſſault his enemy, who was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided: then there ſucceeded a fierce combat between them, where <hi>Abdalami</hi> did miracles in his own defence; ſo effectually, that he put the adverſe barks to flight, to the extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the King. In the mean while Princeſſe <hi>Abaſinda</hi> waits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queen, and recounts to her the plain truth of the myſtery, which being told the King, he ſent to <hi>Iſman</hi> to let him know, that if the caſe were found ſuch as he apprehended, he would lay the head of <hi>Abdalami</hi> in his hands, to carry into his own country; whereof, though ſpight &amp; ſhame of his defeat had made him their Bedfellow, and he had not ſtirr'd forth of twenty dayes; he was ſo ſatiſised, he came immediately to the King, who remitting the matter to Councell, 'twas concluded that the Mother and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be brought to Court, to anſwer what ſhould be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them. At the ſame time the King made a perſonall viſit to <hi>Abdalami,</hi> who upon this vouchſafed deſcent to come thus alone to his houſe, conceived ſome hopes of his buſineſſe, and caſting himſelf at his feet, ſaid he held himſelf over happy in the favour his Prince had done him, and for ever after he ſhould eſteem it an honour to lay down his life for his ſervice. The King cauſing him
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98515:112"/>
to riſe, embraced him, aſſuring him of pardon for what was paſs'd, for which he and his Lady rendring humble thanks, attended him to his Pallace. Three dayes after, the Mother and her daughter arrived in their <hi>Pelanquins,</hi> born on their ſlaves ſhoulders, then the Councell being ſate, three <hi>Calſena</hi> or Officers were ſent for <hi>Abdalami,</hi> as who underſtood not the matter looking on him as a loſt perſon, and <hi>Iſman</hi> for his part conceiving he durſt not appear, but rather truſt to flight, had laid ſouldiers to wait and intercept him on the way. But they were ſtrangely amazed when they ſaw him appear at the Palace in his <hi>Talia Maſſara,</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> mantle down to the foot, under a Caſſock, a figur'd cloth of gold, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a white Cipreſſe in teſtimony of his innocence, and about his head a cord made of ſmall reeds according to cuſtome, in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſelf-puniſhment, if he were found guilty. The Judges then examined both parties, and finding they could produce no ſufficient evidence, they took the Mother and daughter apart, and learning from their mouthes the pure and reall truth, they thought fit to have Princeſſe <hi>Abiaſinda</hi> to be brought, and ſince 'twas through her charity this affair was conſented to and contrived, 'twas but reaſon ſhe ſhould ſpeak her opinion: Then placing her on the Bench with the Judges, <hi>Abdalami</hi> was called forth, who being aſked if he would ſtand to what ſentence his Lady ſhould pronounce, anſwered, Yea moſt willingly: then raiſing her voyce, ſhe pronounced, that ſince <hi>Alberane</hi> had ſo firm an affection to her huſband, and had born for him two lovely children, by the good favour and permiſſion of his Majeſty, ſhe condemned him to eſpouſe her preſently, and ſhe would receive her for her faithful compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The judgment was admired by the whole Aſſembly, and the Father being asked if he held this Award ſufficient reparation of his honour, was ſo confounded with the unfolding of what he was before kept ignorant, he knew not what to ſay, but the King preſſing his reſolution, in teſtimony of ſubmiſſion, he caſt himſelf on the earth, ſaying, If <hi>Abdalami</hi> would honour him with marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his daughter, he would give with her the Province of <hi>Aſſen,</hi> with the mines, and threeſcore carriages of fine gold, which he had gotten that preſent year. The buſineſſe ſo well accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, the King gave order for great rejoycings, with ſolemn feaſtings, and open court for fifteen dayes, for all Princes and Lords of his Train. The Councell would have had the moity of this treaſure diſpenſed, for ſatisfaction to the complaining province of <hi>Zuamin,</hi> but the King oppoſed, content only to abridge him of the Crown rights for five yeares, which amounted to much more then all that treaſure: which was done accordingly, to the content of all, and theſe two Ladies with ſincere affection, lived dear companions in peace and unity.</p>

               <p>HAving ſtaid ſome dayes in the Court of <hi>Tahachi,</hi> and learnt what is here before rehearſed, we took our way back to our company, whom we left at <hi>Cheſicoure,</hi> who were ſomething troubled for us having ſpent two and twenty dayes in this ſhort voyage: for paſſing by <hi>Aruama</hi> a beautifull town, the <hi>Sieur de la Courbe</hi> for ſome occaſion would needs ſtay; then upon a ſtreame from <hi>Zuama</hi> we came to <hi>Gazira, Sequeſma, Boagiara, Salera, Aimaca,</hi> or <hi>Armeta,</hi> and many other Townes and Villages. At length being come to <hi>Guſtigoari</hi> we underſtood there had happened a difference in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany whereby ſome were wounded, and being come to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> three dayes journey thence, we took the other part of the River, which bears name with the Town of <hi>Zuama,</hi> croſſing the Province of <hi>Almadrega,</hi> which with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men is called <hi>Calhouras,</hi> becauſe the capitall Town bears the ſame name; 'tis but ſmall, governed by the King of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grai, Vaſſail</hi> to the grand <hi>Zeguz,</hi> facing Weſtward the Province of <hi>Bagamidri:</hi> we made it four dayes from <hi>Calhouras</hi> to the town of <hi>Bagamidri,</hi> and it happened well we covered our <hi>Almadies,</hi> for the rain much inconvenienced us travelling theſe four dayes through a waſte country,<note place="margin">Land Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes.</note> where land-Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes abound of exceeding bigneſſe, which were very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for our diet, and within them there were great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of egges which purged us ſtrangely, this being very laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meat.</p>
               <p>Our fellows lying at <hi>Chaſicours</hi> had intelligence that we were on the other ſide the River, and enquiring, found us at <hi>Carboran,</hi> a Village three leagues diſtant from <hi>Bagami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dri,</hi> where you may imagine the joy this review diffuſed through all of us. In the firſt place we conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled their diſcord, on the morrow together went we all to dine at <hi>Bagamidri,</hi> where we reſted ſome dayes to truck and put off our commodities, as well in Town, as the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Villages. We had all the ſame deſire to behold the Court, and perſon of the grand <hi>Negus,</hi> who ever reſides in field un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tents and Pavillions, ranged about like a formall City.

To be ſhort, I ſet not down the wayes and diſtances betwixt <hi>Bagamidri</hi> and <hi>Barra,</hi> another town of Ethiope, becauſe for our negotiation we made diverſions to both hands, as we did through <hi>Arabia, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> But from <hi>Barra</hi> to our compleat return, we obſerved as near as might be.

               <p>The countrey of the <hi>Abiſſins</hi> was known to our Anceſtours by the name of Ethiope under Egypt, afterwards the leſſer <hi>India.</hi> This Ethiopia is divided into the Eaſtern, the Weſtern, and the middle.

               <p>The people of theſe kingdomes when they bring their <hi>Gibre</hi> or tribute to the Prince, They have wound a rope about their head, and proclaim with a loud voice, The Revenue of ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, My Lord I am here preſent.

Now is the Revenue ſmall, for they have trees, of which we finde many growing upon the high ways loaded with ſilk, not by the work of art but nature, whereof the gatherers pay a fift to the Prince, as they do of their gold and ſilver mines, where they employ their ſlaves, as ſometimes they do the children of them who have not paid the King dues for their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of ſilk. Of <hi>Benjamin, Storax,</hi> and other Aromaticks, 'tis the ſame thing, for the gathering whereof they make choyce of young lads, as concerning their ſmell to be more exquiſit, and more firm, and indeed the Merchants have a ſpeciall regard for theſe gatherers, and the younger, the more they give them. They who get Safron, pay the ſame rates, but they obſerve not the like niceneſs in the gathering. The Farmers of theſe cuſtomes have a ſet day to bring it in to the Prince himſelf, who receives it in perſon, who ſo much delights in odours, that whatſoever uſed in Court even to the <hi>Flambeaus</hi> is perfumed.

               <p>But the Ancients made ordinarily two <hi>Ethiopes,</hi> the one Eaſt on the other ſide the red ſea, in <hi>Sabia,</hi> or <hi>Arabia</hi> the happy, the other weſt, on this ſide, or under <hi>Egypt.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts,</hi> a people of <hi>Arabia,</hi> along the coaſt of the red ſea are called <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and there is ſome evidence, that heretofore Kings of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> reigned on both ſides the <hi>Gulph</hi>; alſo ſome do opinion the Queen of <hi>Saba</hi> came from <hi>Arabia,</hi> others from the true <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia.</hi> The weſt <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was either the lower from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Meroe,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Some hold the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> to have been the firſt Idolaters, as deſcending from <hi>Chus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cham,</hi> and that they firſt received Judaiſme, and circumciſion upon the Queen of <hi>Saba</hi>'s voyage to <hi>Salomon</hi>; and after Chritianiſme, by the Queen <hi>Candace</hi>'s Ennuch. Times paſt the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Kings were very potent, and brought under yoke <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſelf, and being by <hi>Semiramis</hi> and <hi>Cambyſes</hi> aſſaulted, defeated their armies, nor durſt <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> thoſe famous Victors, invade them: The Poets had this land in ſuch eſteem, were it for the goodneſſe, or for Religion, that here they would celebrate their Deities feſtivals, and inthrone <hi>Alemnon, Cephee</hi> and <hi>Perſet,</hi> mighty and illuſtrious Kings of this Countrey. There was one <hi>Melilec,</hi> who holds the chief renown amongſt them, who they report to have been the ſon of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Mecheda</hi> Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> and of whoſe race by lineal deſcent, from Father to Son, all their Kings to this day report themſelves deſcended: I know not how juſtly it can be proved. Howſoever it be, the moſt ancient Hiſtories atteſt, that about the year 521. in the time of <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Emperour, there was one <hi>Eleſbaan</hi> King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> a Chriſtian, who ſubdued <hi>Dunaam</hi> a Jew, King of <hi>Arabia</hi> the happy, who infeſting the <hi>Homerites</hi> being Chriſtians,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98515:114"/>
                  <hi>Eleſbaan</hi> he freed them, and being returned into his Countrey, became Hermite. Afterwards there was another King named <hi>Helliſteus,</hi> a Chriſtian alſo, who entred confidence with <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour, and brought famous victories from the Infidels in <hi>Arabia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe kings made the royal town of <hi>Cachumo,</hi> ſometimes called <hi>Aucumo,</hi> their manſion, which ſtil holds the name ſince thoſe times, by reaſon of the length and difficulty of roads, we have had little or no intelligence of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Kings, the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracins</hi> having conſtant poſſeſſion of the paſſages, til the voyages of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who have given us ſome light ſince this latter age. As to ſpiritualty this Countrey hath ever ſubmitted to the direction of the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who for the danger of coming thither by reaſon of the <hi>Saracins</hi> who ruled in <hi>Egypt,</hi>

But 'tis more certain that ſince the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> converſed with them, the Kings have made a fuller acknowledgement of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. As to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though it be Chriſtian, yet they retain divers Jewiſh ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and other hereſies, received as wel from <hi>Pagans,</hi> as from the heretical <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> ſent to them by ſchiſmatical Patriarchs from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whereof at preſent they begin to be purged, and better inſtructed by the Jeſuite Fathers, and the Patriarks ſent to them from <hi>Rome,</hi> as we find in modern relations.</p>
               <p>For a long time there have regular Religious been in the Countrey, and Anchorites of the order of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> St. <hi>Macharius,</hi> and St. <hi>Baſile,</hi> but no Dominicans, as ſome would have us believe.</p>
               <p>From St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> order is proceeded another, they call <hi>Eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farrus,</hi> which muſt be St. <hi>Stephen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the nature of the people, they have a ſtrong propenſity to vertue, and orthodox religion, render exact obedience to their Prince, and moſt high veneration to Church and Clergie, are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely chaſt, and addicted to pennance, and auſterity of life, very charitable and very hoſpitable.<note place="margin">See <hi>Alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> ch. 41.</note> Prieſts while they celebrate maſs are covered with a vail, after the <hi>Greek</hi> manner, and the men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a part from the women in the Church.</p>
               <p>The whole Court lodges alwaies under pavilions in the field, rang'd in the form of a Town, for places and ſtreets drawn to a direct line, where there is aſſigned for every one a Captain, or Juſticiar to prevent tumults. 'tis of great circuit, ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining two leagues of land, with twelve ports in honour of the Apoſtles: within this circuit there are two Churches, one for the

When the Sacrament is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated, one rings a bell of ſtone, the clapper of wood, (as are all the bells in <hi>Ethiope</hi>) and immediately all fall upon their knees. The Emperour himſelf if he be on horſeback, alights in haſte, and continues on his knees till another ſign be given. The Prieſt is never ſeen while he conſummates, becauſe he is covered and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a white vail, as likewiſe the people never behold the bleſſed Sacrament, but they bow their face to the ground, jogging their bodies in a dancing manner, and ſtanding on their toes. The Offertory is made at the end of Maſſe. They give the Sacrament to little children as well as others, cauſing them to abſtain before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Negus</hi> never eats in gold or ſilver, but in veſſels of <hi>Euate</hi> onely, which endures no poyſon, but breaks immediately. For wine there is none made but in his Palace, or in the <hi>Abuma</hi>'s houſe. As for the <hi>Abiſſine,</hi> or <hi>Nubian</hi> language, 'tis a diſtinct tongue, but much compounded as they ſay, with <hi>Hebrew, Chaldean, Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> words, which reaches to the very Eaſt, by reaſon of the ſoft and ſweet pronunciation, and becauſe 'tis plain and eaſie to learn. So the <hi>Abiſſins</hi> when they travel, as I have often mark'd, make themſelves eaſily underſtood, with the <hi>Guinoii</hi> themſelves. They uſe the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> for ſacred matters and ſciences, in which all their books are written, and Maſſe celebrated, as the <hi>Abiſſins</hi> do in their Church of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>India</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in like manner as the <hi>Maronites</hi> and other <hi>Syrians.</hi> Now for the Rivers in this Countrey there are many very great ones, but the principal is the ſo famous <hi>Nile,</hi> which cuts it from one end to the other, ſallying, as ſome ſay, out of an unſoundable lake in the Country of <hi>Guyame,</hi> others will have it from the Mountains of the <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Cafartes,</hi> and from <hi>Befſi</hi> or <hi>Zech,</hi> whence likewiſe iſſues the <hi>Zaire</hi> and the <hi>Aquilonde,</hi> which run Weſtward, and the <hi>Zuama</hi> ſouthward.

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Town of <hi>Bagamidri,</hi> and the coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Kings.</head>
               <p>TO return to our voyage, I ſhal tell you that <hi>Bagamidri</hi> is a Town in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in three degrees of altitude beyond the line, in a fair champion upon the River <hi>Zuama,</hi> which diſbanks as <hi>Nile</hi> do's. For the kingdom of <hi>Bagamidri</hi> it reaches to the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick,</hi> watered by <hi>Zuama,</hi> called by the inhabitants <hi>Zimbada,</hi> which croſſes the deſerts of <hi>Manica,</hi> where are diſmal Mountains, and goes til it ingulphs it ſelf in the Oriental and Meridian ſea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a moſt commodious ſhore, where veſſels take in freſh-water and fuel. Here are abundance of wild goats, and ſmall Buls and Cows ſo fierce, that he muſt be very ſkilfull that takes them, they have little horns which grow but ſkin-deep, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them as their ears, as I obſerved in another place. This River of <hi>Zuama</hi> is by the <hi>Portugalls</hi> called, <hi>Rio del Spiritu ſancto,</hi> for the content they receive who ſaile upon it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in paſſing or bathing in this River, there ought great caution to be had, and to be well arm'd againſt the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, which are here in great numbers: nor is the danger on land much leſſe, for the Tigars, of which there are great Troupes, and will very ſawcily diſmount you, either from Horſe or Mule.</p>
               <p>Towards the Weſt the Countrey borders on <hi>Mancigonge,</hi> Eaſtward on <hi>Cafates,</hi> to the North it lyes on <hi>Gidada,</hi> which ſome call the Countrey of <hi>Amazons,</hi> South-ward on <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potapa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Bagamidri</hi> is called Imperial, by reaſon the King of <hi>Tigrai,</hi> or <hi>Tigremahon,</hi> having received his firſt Crown at the place of his election, receives the ſecond here.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Here I ſhal tell you by the way, that in <hi>Tigramahon</hi> I ſaw a Church of one intire piece, wrought in a Rock near
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98515:116"/>
to <hi>Tecaſſin,</hi> which they call the Church of Creatures, for that 'tis dedicated to the four Evangeliſts. In the lower <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia,</hi> there is the like which they call the <hi>Maiant Calaſſen,</hi> that is, the Seat of Eternity.</p>
               <p>For the Kingdome of the <hi>Amazons</hi> they report it to be betwixt the country of <hi>Damut</hi> and <hi>Gorage,</hi> or <hi>Goraga</hi> and <hi>Gongara</hi> where they recount many things, not unlike the ſtories of our Anceſtors; as that the women have the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, are exceeding valiant, and excellent Archers, that they cut off their right breaſt to draw a how the better, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of that kinde.</p>
               <p>There is mention made of the like women in many other parts of the world. Some ſay the word <hi>Amazon</hi> is derived from a country belonging to the <hi>Negus,</hi> or <hi>Monopotapa,</hi> near <hi>Mancinconge,</hi> where the women are of great courage,<note place="margin">Amazons.</note> though the men are Maſters, and <hi>Preſte John</hi> makes uſe of them in his warres.

               <p>They who live Weſtward from the countrey of <hi>Agagne</hi> to <hi>Ambian</hi> are intirely black, and four degrees from the Line, troubled with exceſſive raines for three moneths together.

               <p>BEing at <hi>Bagamidri,</hi> ſome of us more curious then the reſt of our company, agreed to go ſee the Court of the Grand <hi>Negus,</hi> or King of the <hi>Abiſſins</hi>; and to this purpoſe leaving them that had no ſuch deſire we took a ſide-way towards the towns <hi>Barra,</hi> and <hi>Barua,</hi> where we were told the Prince moſt commonly reſided: Following on this road, and having croſſed many Provinces and Kingdomes, at length we arrived at <hi>Barra</hi> the chief town of the Country, where we found a numerous multitude of people living under Tents, to the number of ten thouſand, or more. Amongſt theſe there was one covered with white cloth conſpicuous above the reſt, with twelve gates of marvellous largeneſſe belonging to it. We Inn'd in an <hi>Abyſſins</hi> tent, who obliged us with curteſies, and while meat was making ready, they brought us in an oxe horne honied wine, whereof we drunk. Not long after, we percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the way, a troop diverſly armed with twelve <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gandes</hi> or Trumpets before them; then came a Prince mounted on a black and white Elephant, which is a great rarity, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with four Noble-men, who bore over him a Canopy of gray damask. Being advanced near the Kings tent, he diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preſently was attended with a numerous and honourable train. Next with great ſubmiſſion he ſuffered his garments to be taken off; they were of ſilk, interwoven with gold, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered with pearles of exceeding greatneſſe: He was a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Prince, who having received injury from another King, came to ſeek juſtice at his Majeſties hands. 'Twas not for want of power to take revenge himſelf, but he would ſhew this defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the King, who inflicts moſt ſeverely on all tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.<note place="margin">Aranuhi.</note> Now this Prince, called <hi>Aranuhi,</hi> ſtript off his gorgious habilliments, caſt over him a Lions skin, which in the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns preſence all are obliged to weare, with a large ſhirt of ſilk trailing on the ground. Being come before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, the Trumpets began in a dolefull ſound, and the King having notice, gave order he ſhould enter; for this Prince in times paſt had done famous military ſervices, then caſting himſelf on the ground, framed his complaint, that the other King his enemy had violently carried away his wife, with a daughter which he had heretofore refuſed him, intending to marry her to another a greater Prince then he, and had taken beſides 40. <hi>Quintalls</hi> of gold.<note place="margin">A hundred weight.</note> Upon this complaint the <hi>Negus</hi> immediately diſpatched a <hi>Calſcena</hi> to ſummon the Prince offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

When the latter was arrived and diſrobed as the former, and mantled with a Lions ſkin, he took a ſtone, carried for him by a Gentleman to the Palace gate, and having cauſed the Trumpets ſound, he could not be admitted; but for above two houres waited in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, taken for a bad omen amongſt them, till a ſlave brought or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he ſhould repair to his lodgings, and attend there till he were called for.

This Officer conducting him by the hand, brought him before his Majeſty in ſtate, under a rich Canopy, with a Curtain of ſilk of the ſame colour as the Canopy, ſcreening his face, then cryed aloud; <hi>Moſt mighty Emperour, I bring thee here this Prince thy ſervant, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary according to thy command.</hi> At that time the King was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing a Princeſſe wife to the <hi>Tigraian</hi> King, arrived lately at Court in a very plain habit of frized Cottons. The Prince no ſooner entered, but he caſt himſelf on the ground, the complainant who was ſummoned being preſent, of whom the <hi>Negus</hi> demanded what he had to object againſt this perſon; the other anſwered, that this Prince of <hi>Jauas</hi> had ſtolne away his daughter, and a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fined gold. To which the <hi>Negus</hi> commanded the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to make anſwer, and deliver the very truth; who firſt putting his hand to the ground, then laying it on his head, with eyes lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to heaven, a ſad pale countenance, fell on his knees, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to turn an eye towards the Kings face, who is alwayes ſcreen'd, and anſwered.</p>
               <p>Moſt excelſe and redoubted Sir, moſt true it is, I ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt this Prince for his daughter <hi>Adila</hi> in mariage, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied without further inſtance I deſiſted, content to ſeek another of my own degree. But not long after, the Queen her mother ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many of her Alliance brought her to me, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with gold, which ſhe told me was of her own proper treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not her huſbands, and thereupon gave me both reaſon and licenſe to marry her, and that with her own free mind and conſent, without the leaſt violence impoſed upon her, whom I love and honour more then the whole world beſides.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Negus</hi> having then taken the matter into conſideration, told Prince <hi>Aranuhi,</hi> he found not the other ſo guilty as was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that his ſentence was, he for his part ſhould repay the gold
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98515:118"/>
doubled, that the Princeſſes, his wife, and daughter ſhould be bor'd through the lips, and confin'd during pleaſure, to what place he ſhould appoint. The Prince of <hi>Jauas</hi> to this ſentence durſt make no reply further, then to deſire time for payment: two moneths was allowed him, and immediately Commiſſioners were diſpatched to ſee the Arreſt of the Court executed, nor did either of the Princes quit the Court till the King bad them retire. But in this conjuncture, the Princeſſe of <hi>Tigremahon,</hi> moved with compaſſion for the condemned young Lady, caſting her ſelfe at the <hi>Negus</hi> feet, beſought him, that for a ſingular grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to her, he would vouchſafe the young Lady might continue with her huſband; and the Queen having applyed her prevalency to <hi>Aranubi</hi> for his conſent, by the mediation of theſe two Ladies, all was ended in peace, and the two Princes embraced as friends and Allies. Mean while the Commiſſaries ignorant of what had paſſed, had already done execution upon the mother, and had likewiſe on the daughter, but that ſhe made a ſeaſonable eſcape, to the joy of the whole Court, and the <hi>Negus</hi> cauſing them to come to Court, would have the Nuptialls ſolemnized there with all ſorts of rejoycing, feaſts, and combats of ſavage beaſts.</p>
               <p>Then certain Lords of the Court with the Kings Siſter were ſent to the Sea-ſide to bring the Ladies, who being arrived, covered with a white linnen cloth, and bare-footed, caſt themſelves on the ground before the King and the Father. At that time the King wore a Crown of ſilver for ſome myſtery which I could not learn by any enquiry I could make, and the treaſure and jewels being brought, were diſtributed by the Father to his two children, and the King in token of his favour and indulgement releaſed to Prince <hi>Aranubi</hi> all rights of Signeurie, with letters Patents of free and abſolute Principality.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Combats at this ſolemnity, one was of a white ſhaggie Ape put within an incloſed liſt, with a Serpent that had ſix wings, and was 14. foot in length. The Ape was armed with a wooden helmet, having a pike on the top exceeding ſharp, and his body mailed with leather, liquored, and made fit, ſo as he could uſe his teeth at pleaſure, the liſts were rounded with painted cloth, with pieces of timber, and cords hard ſtraind, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Ape might ſhift when he was hard preſſed upon, he made moſt horrible faces when the Serpent came to aſſault him, who raiſed himſelf upon little feet like a Gooſes. Next was brought in an Ape of extraordinary ſize, armed with ſilvered Paſte-board, mounted upon a great ſheep, with a ſmall lance, againſt a beaſt they call a <hi>Chilacou,</hi> like a wolf, whoſe deſign was to attack the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, not the Cavalier, who during the conflict, fretted, and made mouthes in a ſtrange manner; at length they were parted.</p>
               <p>After them was brought in a ſmall Lion of a brave courage, who finding nothing to combat, laid him down along, but he no
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98515:118"/>
ſooner ſaw a Creature called a <hi>Bachuro</hi> enter, arm'd with ſcales, but with a loud roar, he nimbly flew upon him; for a good hour the fight laſted, with terrible aſſaults on both ſides, till at laſt the Lion had the day, ſtrangled his foe and eat him, for the fleſh is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Cheger,</hi> or Elephant with the <hi>Rhinocerot,</hi> which was a moſt furious combat, but of little delight, becauſe for their bulk and weight, they could ſhew but little agility or motion. Then was brought in play another ſort of Elephant, called by the <hi>Indians</hi> a <hi>Gachias,</hi> and againſt him four dogs of exceeding greatneſſe, of which at the very firſt bout he kil'd one: The fierceneſſe of the beaſts made this fight of much recreation. Next was a Crocodile and a Tigar, who treated each other very rudely. After them two great Dogs againſt a <hi>Targout,</hi> a kind of wolf, but much different from ours, 'twas a bloudy combat, where one of the dogs was kil'd, and the <hi>Targout</hi> hurt.</p>
               <p>So this day was concluded with the combats, for other dayes there were other Triumphs, which I omit, to avoid prolix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie.</p>
               <p>This is all of remark which happened at Court, while we ſtaid at <hi>Barra,</hi> which I thought fit to recount, for information of the nature and manners of the people.</p>
               <p>We ſtayed ſomething the longer at <hi>Barra,</hi> in expectation to ſee his Majeſty the <hi>Negus</hi> who was ſuddenly to come thither, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had not been there of a long time, a magnificent entrance was prepared for him.</p>

brief, The <hi>Negus</hi> was received into the Town, with a ſumptuous ſtate and magnificence, and we had the ſatisfaction to ſee his whole Court march.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Embaſſadour arriv'd, of whom I ſpoke, with a train of twenty men, all mounted upon Mules; having ſtaid, as they told us, three months, at the famous monaſtery of the Viſion in the Country of <hi>Bamazaz</hi> towards the red ſea, where report goes are 2000. religious gray-Friers, who live in great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity without want either of victuals or habit.

                  </note>About break of day the Vaunt-guard marched firſt, conſiſting of ſome twenty thouſand Horſe without ſhoes, which in thoſe mountainous and ſtony waies, is a great inconvenience to them. They ride as the <hi>Arabians</hi> do with a bill, their ſtirrups very ſhort, wearing certain cimeters, and generally a certain two-edg'd arms they call <hi>Perdagalzes:</hi> This troop was led by a great Prince called <hi>Lychano,</hi>

Then the officers and ſervants of the kitchin, about three thouſand, who carried the kings fare in baſkets, and his drink in ſmall barrels marked and ſealed: next followed a great number of horſes, mules, elephants, <hi>Alſinges,</hi> and other kinds of beaſts with carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Amongſt others there were four Lions, as tall as mules, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one mans charge, who never ceas'd raving and rating after them, to keep them from ſtraying from their company: They were gentle and tame as ſheep; and by the way, 'tis a ſtrange thing to ſee theſe beaſts feed; their keeper to ſhew us a rarity, hung up a joynt of mutton, upon the wall of the ſtable or den, all the four gaz'd upon it, and then lay down, as knowing their ſhare was in it: afterwards the firſt that was hungry came, and at two or three mounts &amp; active leaps ſpear-high, fetches down the piece of meat. But after this train of ſeven or eight thouſand head was paſt, came 12. or 1500. Foot, with bows, quivers, and ſhort ſwords, led by one they called <hi>Abagarindas</hi>: after them followed another part of the Cavalry, and the body of the Army in handſom order, with trumpets and hoboys before them, to cheer and recreate them. Laſtly came twelve or fifteen thouſand Muſqueteers upon the wings, as 'twere in the form of a half moon, carrying their guns ſtrait upright; cimeters they had, and wore a very large cap or hood, which they folded up, and let hang upon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98515:119"/>
becauſe they are troubleſome and inconvenient.</p>
               <p>The Army which conſiſted of fourſcore or a hundred thouſand men, being paſt the <hi>Negus,</hi> his Majeſty followed, of whom we could not then have a ſight: Afterwards he came to Church with Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart borne before him by the <hi>Berenega</hi> upon an Elephant; 'twas the figure of a plain croſſe in a piece of ſilk. And 'tis remarkable, that you finde not the figure of our Saviour nailed to the Croſſe in any Church of the <hi>Abiſſins,</hi> and their reaſon is, becauſe we are not worthy to behold him in his paſſion.</p>
               <p>Before this Enſigne march about fifty Prieſts ſinging Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and four in Pontifical robes, who carry a hollowed ſtone large and ſquare, which they call the <hi>Tabuco,</hi> which they uſe when they celebrate Maſſe before the <hi>Negus:</hi> before it veſted as the four are, marches another who going backward,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tabuto</hi> the altar ſtone.</note> incences the ſtone: then followes the Standart, and ſome five hundred gentlemen of quality, all on horſe-back, and clad in large white ſhirts of ſilk, and plaited like a Chanons Surplice. One part of this company they call <hi>Calſena,</hi> who are exempt Officers in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to execute the Kings commands. After this attended with Muſick and Hoboyes, appears a Canopy high exalted, and before it one whom they call <hi>Licadona</hi> mounted on an Elephant, bearing in his hand a lump of gold or ſilver guilt, who ſeemed to be the chief of this muſick. Four Princes, upon four of the higheſt Elephants can be gotten, bear the Queens Canopy, plainly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited with Lions ſkins over their ſhirts, and broad hats on their heads: the Queen her ſelf's in a Littar, and with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a little childe for her recreation, accompanied with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous train of Littars, Chariots, and other attendance in great magnificence. Next comes a man mounted on a great horſe, trapped with <hi>Aiofar,</hi> a ſort of ſtuffe which the tree <hi>Areca</hi> bears, and he often cries aloud, <hi>Tacar</hi> and <hi>Etefra,</hi> which is the ſame; as take heed, and make room. Then three hundred Elephants follow richly mail'd with Sea-wolf ſkins, lin'd with ſkins of Crocodile, of four or five hundred pound weight, and of ſuch firmeneſſe, that they are Muſquet proof. One clothed in Velvet, embroydered with gold, ſits for-moſt upon the head; the principal rider beares a banner of a Lions ſkin at the end of an <hi>Indian</hi> Cane: upon the neck ſits one who guides the beaſt with two barres of ſteele faſtened to his jaws, hanging downwards, not turning up, as our Printers repreſent them; the Saddles are girt with chaines of iron, four men beſides the guides may conveniently mount them. They call the guide the <hi>Digali,</hi> who is armed with a moſt hard ſkinne, and in time of battel hath a Trumpet or Cornet to put in the beaſts eare, to make him know his meaning, who otherwiſe could not for the confuſed noyſe: after follow many chariots, ſome of four, ſome of ſix wheels, bound with maſſie bonds

of iron drawn by horſes, mules, and other beaſts, wherein the baggage of the Army is carryed. They alſo uſe theſe chariots againſt the Elephants, who at firſt onſet falling into fury by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the riders, make bloody havock. Againſt which the enemy ſometime provides fire-works, which thrown into their eyes before their feet, terrifies them, and makes them turn and ruſh over their owne men; but being backed with theſe ſtrong chariots, and managed by ſouldiers ſkilfull in the art of war, they maintaine battell. Two thouſand foot next with bows arrowes,<note place="margin">Ariates.</note> and broad ſhort well temper'd hangers. In the middle of them twelve men march, termed the <hi>Ariates,</hi> that is, the Apoſtles: after them came a Prince mounted on a white Elephant, bearing upon his lance a banner of a Lions ſkin, who marched with ſolemne gravity before 2000. horſe, richly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſon'd with a certain ſtuffe, down as low as the <hi>Cambrell,</hi> a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head-piece of a hard ſkin doubled, which arm's the whole head, except the ears. The Prince that led theſe, they called the <hi>Betu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dete</hi> or Generall, who had to wait on him a company of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſes</hi> pages, whom they called <hi>Legameneos.</hi> Next to theſe marched another great Lord they called the <hi>Alicaſſin,</hi> upon a gallant horſe in the head of two thouſand horſe more, armed with ſwords; and woodden bucklers, who are Gentlemen of Guard to the Prince, with them called <hi>Cumali.</hi> Then another great Lord mounted on an Elephant, and two horſe-men advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething before others, who often cry out <hi>Imbrane,</hi> room, room: next two thouſand barded Cammels, each mounted, with two men armed with halfe-pikes, and ſtrong bucklers of leather: then another on horſe-back with a banner of a Lions ſkin, the like as I ſaw before the King of <hi>Angotera,</hi> with a company of four thouſand horſe; this Prince bore a ball of ſilver, with four pages riding bare, excellently mounted, called <hi>Laga Menegus.</hi> The <hi>Audrugez,</hi> or high Steward, with a thouſand horſe in rich equipage: at the heeles of theſe came twenty vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old men in gowns ſo large, they almoſt covered the horſe, then as many on foot, who ſeemed to be of the family of thoſe they call <hi>Snachagora,</hi> who are Phyſicians, Philoſophers, and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Then appears a moſt rich Canopy, with Valence of gold and ſilver, borne by four Noble-men, with a numerous cavalry, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy under it, and four <hi>Beteneguz,</hi> who carry lumps of ſilver gilt, all accompanied with muſick of Hoboys, and other Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Then comes the King of <hi>Tigrai</hi> with his ſtandart and a numerous company; and not farre after the <hi>Abuna,</hi> or grand Patriarck, with four <hi>Lycanates,</hi> or Prelates, who beare a <hi>Tabutt,</hi> with the <hi>Logatera,</hi> and march reverſed, giving incenſe, facing the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> or body of the Army.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Baldaguin</hi> or Canopy of State of the grand <hi>Negus,</hi> appears, accompanied by the reſt of the Princes, himſelf mounted
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98515:120"/>
on a horſe richly trapped, with excellent muſick. Two Kings on foot hold his bridle, two more at his ſtirrups, and two at the crupper; all in white ſilk ſhirts, which they call <hi>Aotila,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wearing over all a Lions ſkin, a thing allowed to none but thoſe of the blood, except ſome few upon ſpeciall favour. The <hi>Negus</hi> goes under the State with a vaile over his face, nor does he appear unvail'd to his people more then foure times in the year, and ſome years only at New-years tyde, and Eaſter, when he keeps open Court. But ſince the death of <hi>Negus Nahut</hi> was concealed ſo many moneths after his deceaſe, this cuſtome is changed, and 'twas enacted by the Councell generall, or States aſſembled, that he ſhould ſhew himſelf four times the year at ſolemn feaſts.</p>
               <p>When theſe times come, the people expreſſe extraordinary joy, as if the Deity it ſelf deſcended to them, by reaſon this Prince is exceeding juſt, compaſſionate and mercifull, dividing his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in three parts, one for his family, a ſecond for the Church, and a third for Orphans, widowes, and others in want, for which purpoſe he builds abundance of well-founded Hoſpitalls.</p>

               <p>LEaving <hi>Barra</hi> we went to the town of <hi>Barua</hi> out of deſire to ſee more of the <hi>Negus,</hi> and the triumphant entrance provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him, for a victory lately had over the <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Gorago,</hi> a people ſo wilde and ſavage, that of how many ſoever are taken in war, 'tis impoſſible to preſerve one alive; by reaſon they are no ſooner priſoners, but by the ſent of a certain poyſon they have in readineſſe, they die in the very inſtant, or ſuddainly after. In this war the King of <hi>Tigray</hi> brought him very effectuall auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, elſe he had had a bad match of the <hi>Goragues,</hi> a mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the <hi>Abiſſine,</hi> whom they call <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In concluſion, after he had put them to the rout, he purſued and beſieged them in <hi>Tamar,</hi> a town ſurrounded with ſtrong walls, and good ditches, where they were provided of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, made of great timber-pieces ſo drawne and bent by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and wheeles, fixt oppoſite, that the reverſe was ſo vigorous, they would founder or break a ſhip in pieces. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>Negus,</hi> after the trench was filled forbore to ſtorme, nor indeed, but for the help of a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> had he accompliſhed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne without extream loſſe. This <hi>Genoeſe</hi> by mine blew up a Tower, which opened a marvelous breach. Then the people,

mad with deſpaire, chooſing rather to dye, then be reduced to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, expoſed their wives and children in the face of the aſſault. In the end, the town was taken and demoliſhed, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to a man put to the ſword, not one amongſt them yielding to accept of mercy. The <hi>Negus</hi> took priſoners the Kings wife and daughters, and while he was uſing perſwaſions to gain them to come live with his Queen, and that he would wealthily beſtow the daughters, the mother and one of the daughters had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched themſelves with poyſon: The other who was faire in perfection had no ambition of death. The <hi>Negus</hi> gave her to his wife, who richly clothed her, and uſed all ſorts of blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to comfort her.</p>
               <p>After this victory in <hi>Gorago,</hi> againſt the <hi>Negus</hi> was to viſit <hi>Barra,</hi> the inhabitants amongſt other magnificences had erected to him a ſtately Pyramid of timber, covered with <hi>Fauſell garnets,</hi> either cut by the hand of <hi>Lapidaries,</hi> or coming ſo from the mine, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by four Gyansts: with a ſpacious Palace of divers works and <hi>Niches,</hi> furniſhed with ſtatues of Ladies, gloriouſly adorned with gold and ſilver, and laid with colours to the life, many Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of victories.

               <p>The <hi>Negus</hi> and all the Court were much delighted therewith, and the Divertiſement diſcharged a good part of thoſe griefes, which oppreſſed the captive Princeſſe, to whom the combate of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall beaſts was very pleaſant, it continued above two houres, till at laſt the conflict grew ſo robuſtious, they overturned the Fabrick under them; and all fell at once, and vaniſhed in the River together, to the exceeding pleaſure of all the Beholders, and thus was this day ſpent. The <hi>Negus</hi> on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row went to Maſſe, and as he paſſed, the Militia of the town ſaluted him with fire-works of ingenious invention. Being returned from Maſſe, and going to Dinner, unexpected came in a ſtrange Prince, who falling to his feet, petitioned him he would beſtow upon him the captive Princeſſe, or vouchſafe to impoſe a ranſom on her,

The King looked upon him as admiring how he paſſed the guards, a thing extraordinary, and unuſual amongſt them; nevertheleſſe admitting his paſſion for an excuſe, he demanded who he was; the other anſwered that his Countrey bordered upon the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Barnaguz,</hi> that is high-Admiral, north-ward towards <hi>Ganfrila</hi> and <hi>Drafrila,</hi>

               <p>The Queen had gotten a promiſe from her that ſhe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtian, and being mov'd anew, ſhe ſaid ſhe was moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; then turning to the affianc'd Prince, ſhe declared to him that being a Chriſtian ſhe could not match with an Infidel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requeſted him they might together receive their baptization: this at firſt ſeem'd very harſh to him, yet at length by perſwaſions and manifeſtations, they ſo prevailed, that he condeſcended, and both of them with divers Lords of his train were baptized toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Negus</hi> releaſed him of a certain tribute due, which, as likewiſe other Princely preſents, he gave his Lady.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. The manner of ſervice at the <hi>Negus</hi>'s table, the receipt of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Embaſsadour.</head>
               <p>AS to the ſervice at the <hi>Negus</hi>'s table, 'tis as magnificent as with any Prince on earth, for the multitude of Officers: our curioſity found ſo much favour as to ſee it, and amongſt other things remarkable, there were three pages in raz'd tiſſue, ſuitable with a bed in a corner of the room, as we perceived coming in, the <hi>Negus</hi>'s lodging as I ſuppos'd. Theſe Pages brought to the Table three diſhes made of a black wood they call <hi>Euate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Al.</hi> calls it <hi>Gauete.</hi>
                  </note> like to our Ebony, of precious eſteem with them, for the property it hath to burſt in pieces as ſoon as poyſon comes within it. Theſe diſhes were half full, one you muſt know with a ſort of pear, which cut in middle preſents the perfect figure of a Croſſe, a ſtrange rarity in a fruit, the ſecond half full of burning coals, and the third of aſhes. This to repreſent Chriſts Paſſion, Death, and Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:98515:122"/>The reſt of the ſervice was moſt ſplendid, as well for ſtate as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of meats, ingeniouſly dreſſed and perfumed, with an odour ſo ſweet and pleaſant, as 'tis impoſſible any could be more. The canopy of ſtate over the Princes head was of the ſame as the bed and the Pages apparel were. There were others diverſly habited, but all rich, and every one two diſtinct veſtures, one that had but a half-ſleeve, with baſes falling over their buſkins, and hiding ſome part of their ſhoe. But I will relate the reſt of the ſervice, when I deliver the reception of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings Embaſſadour, <hi>Don Franciſco di Lopes,</hi> ſent to the grand <hi>Neguz</hi> for leave to build Forts upon his coaſts, as well for the advance of commerce, as the propagation of Religion. He came on land in <hi>Africa,</hi> towards the river <hi>Souac,</hi> near the Monaſtery of the Holy Ghoſt, of the religious Obſervantines I ſpoke of before. We met with him before that in our travels, and he came along with us as far as the head of that River, where we ſet him on ſhore near the Church or the Monaſtery of the Holy Ghoſt, which is one of the chiefeſt Fortifications the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> hath, and 'tis there 'tis ſaid 300. religious are, where he ſtaid ſome dayes to refreſh himſelf, then took his journy towards the Court, whither from that place he had 4. or 500. leagues of land to croſſe, and yet 'twas a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to him that the Court was no further remov'd, for as it might have happened, he might have had above 700. leagues before he reacht thither. Being furniſhed with horſes at this Monaſtery for himſelf and his company, (who were ſome fourteen or fifteen in number, he came, as he ſince told us, to another Church or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery ſome ſeven or eight leagues from thence, but with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream trouble, his horſes ſo tiring, that the ſervants were fain to carry the baggage themſelves for two leagues together. At length he got to the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> as he called it, where he found good entertainment, and changed his horſes, which were for no further ſervice, being ſo extreamly beaten out with travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſhod, as they uſe in thoſe parts, becauſe they have not the art of ſhooing. As he was upon the point to depart thence, there fell ſuch an exceſſe of rains, that the Rivers were ſo broken out, that he was conſtrained to ſtay near a month longer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect till they retir'd within their banks. Then he continued his journey, and having croſſed a vaſt Countrey came to <hi>Mongibir,</hi> where he made a viſit to the King, who was then ſick, but uſed him with great civilities. The Embaſſadour offered him the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Phyſician, but he told him our Lord who had ſent his grief ſhould cure it. He furniſhed him with horſes, and appointed his own Son to conduct him even to the Court. By the way he met with many other Monaſteries, and mountainous and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Countries: thence he came to the Province of <hi>Tigremahon,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Negus,</hi> who hath five kingdoms under his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: here 'twas he firſt drunk the honied wine kept in great ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98515:122"/>
From thence he travailed to <hi>Culuſen,</hi> and many other Countries, till he arrived near <hi>Barra,</hi> where the Court lay. As ſoon as we had notice of it, we failed not to preſent our reſpects to him, and he returned many civilities to the <hi>Sieur de lu Courb,</hi> as the principal amongſt us, but nevertheleſſe with a <hi>Soſſiego</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gravity, of which the <hi>Sieur</hi> ſeemed to take no notice, for that we deſigned by his mediation to ſee the <hi>Negus</hi> at table, which as yet we had not compaſſed; though for his own part out of the gravity or vanity of his Countrey, he diſdained to ſee it, yet by reaſon of his quality he might have done it without difficulty. This being obſerved by the <hi>Sieur de la Courb,</hi> he ſo well feaſted a Maſter of houſhold to the <hi>Abuma,</hi> that he promiſed us we ſhould ſee him at ſupper, as we did two dayes after: but I believe he firſt demanded his Maſters licence, then he brought us to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Atania,</hi> for the <hi>Negus</hi> ſeldom lodges in tents, where he finds Monaſteries or Churches, as there are plenty in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. 'Twas there we ſaw the Prince ſup, in the manner I ſpoke of.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Embaſſadour, the <hi>Negus</hi> having intelligence of his coming, ſent a handſom company of Cavaliers to receive him, and ſome eight dayes before had ſent a grand <hi>Serami</hi> to conduct him, which <hi>Serami</hi> was not ſparing of his cudgell to any upon the way, that gave not the Embaſſadour honour, who being met by theſe Cavaliers many ſalutes and complements were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed. Being arrived at the Camp they preſented him a tent of Canvas, which was ſomething diſliked by the Embaſſadour, as being unſuitable to his quality, nevertheleſſe he ſeemed to take no notice of it; but the <hi>Serami</hi> perceiving ſomething, told him for excuſe, they uſed him no courſer than the Prince himſelf who had no better: which gave ſatisfaction to the Embaſſadour: then they brought him in proviſion of victuals, for him and his retinue. 'Twas three dayes before he had audience, then ſome principall Gentlemen and Officers came for him by night, and conducted him to the Court, which was then at a goodly Monaſtery; and being brought into the chamber of preſence, he found the <hi>Negus</hi> ſitting on a bed of raz'd gold, and ſilver tiſſue, four pages in the ſame ſtuff ſtanding bare at the bed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> feet with lighted <hi>Flambeaus</hi> in their hands. The Embaſſadour made him a moſt reſpectfull reverence at ſeven or eight paces diſtance, bowing exceeding low, whereas others kiſſe the ground; and the <hi>Negus</hi> unvailing a little one ſide of his face, demanded the Preſents the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſent him, where the other being ready to anſwer, ſuppoſing he ſhould have a compleat audience, the perſon that brought him in told him at preſent it might not be, and that the King had ſeen him was ſufficient for the firſt time, and ſo without further cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies he delivered his letters, which were read by an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. On the morrow about midnight the Embaſſadour was ſent
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98515:123"/>
for again in the ſame ſort and ceremony; then the Embaſſadour carried the Preſent, which was in pieces of ſilk, ſpices, and ſome rich and well-wrought arms. The <hi>Negus</hi> received them, then diſmis'd him, cauſing one to tell him he ſhould ſhortly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd.</p>
               <p>The next day he was ſent for again to Court, where he dined with the King and Queen, the King a little remov'd at ſome diſtance from them. The firſt ſervice was three gold diſhes, the firſt full of fire, the ſecond of aſhes, and the third of the miraculous pears I ſpoke of, in which, being cut, there appears a perfect natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall croſſe, repreſenting our Redemption, as the other eternall pains and death.</p>
               <p>Afterwards came all ſorts of exquiſite and delicate meats. The Embaſſadour having ſtaid ſome months in the Court, the <hi>Negus</hi> ſent him a letter for his Maſter, though letters are not in uſe with them, content onely to ſend their meſſengers, who deliver their miſſives by vocal relation: but this letter was at the proper inſtance of the Embaſſadour himſelf, as he told me a good while after, when I met him at <hi>Grenada</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I mentioned the Army of the <hi>Negus,</hi> I forgot to tell you 'tis ranged in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>Lanciers</hi> are quarter'd outmoſt round the Camp, lined with the Cavalry, and muſqueteers within them, all quarter'd in order, and ſtreets, as in a Town: the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers apart by themſelves, Merchants on one ſide, and Artificers on the other; ſix or ſeven thouſand tents will ſerve for fourſcore thouſand men. The Cavalry moſt commonly conſiſts of thirty thouſand horſe, all unſhod, for they have not the art to ſhooe them, ſtout and indefatigable, being brought up by Cowes from which they take the calfs and put colts in their places.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Emperour ordinarily depends not upon his proprietary poſſeſſions: for bedes the gold and ſilver his people pay as tribute, they pay him amber, musk, civet, ſtones, and all ſorts of victuals and ſuſtenance; ſo as he hath not much uſe of money more then to pay his Officers and ſervants, who are paid their ſtipend in gold or ſilver uncoin'd in gobbets exactly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beſides ſuch a proportion of diet every day for their lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as in <hi>Italy,</hi> Cardinals, Princes, and the Nobility uſe to do.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the kingdom and policy of <hi>Mongibir,</hi> of the Mountain <hi>Amara,</hi> where the <hi>Abiſſin</hi> Princes are.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe I have made mention of <hi>Mongibir,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mongibir.</note> I ſhall inform you that this Countrey, the capitall Town whereof is called <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourin,</hi> is ſubject to the <hi>Negus,</hi> and neighbour to the Province of <hi>Calaſen.</hi> The Natives are of a middle ſize and olive colour, which makes them affect ſtrangers exceedingly, eſteeming them more beautiful than themſelves; though very few come amongſt them: for they are wretched, baſe, and timorous beyond imagination, trembling at the report of a gun, which they ſay is the Devils han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycraft, and call him <hi>Hocalſic,</hi> that is a good man, who carries none of theſe fire cudgels. Nevertheleſſe they maintain a continuall war upon the <hi>Calaſens,</hi> who are Chriſtians, and they Idolaters, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the ſun, the <hi>Negus</hi> never being able to reconcile them, nor introduce Chriſtian religion amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other hereſies they believe, that after death the ſoule enters into another body, which makes them indulge ſtrangers ſo highly, upon opinion they may be of their alliance; yet they hold they cannot enter into the <hi>Calaſenians,</hi> nor the <hi>Suecans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>Romarins,</hi> that is Chriſtians:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Romarins</hi> Chriſtians</note> nor delight to inhabit a body of a contrary Religion, and ſo ceremonious and auſtere as ours is.</p>
               <p>The earth, ſay they, was made for our ſuſtenance, and 'twere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to the Maker not to make uſe of all which it produces. When one ſpeaks to them of the kingdom of Heaven, they ſay 'tis the manſion of the Gods and Lights, and not of men, and that God will have no communication with ſinners, who are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to approach a thing ſo holy, which ſhews they once had better knowledge of our myſteries,<note place="margin">Strange proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wives.</note> though in the whole time of our travaile there, we ſaw not any book or the leaſt record of the true religion. They will invite Paſſengers to lodge with them, and command their wives to keep them company; while they go to the wood or river for entertainment for their gueſts, their wives careſſe them, and eſteem it a happineſſe if they prove with child by a ſtranger, which when they bring into the world, they call it <hi>Gilchaquillan,</hi> that is a child of the ſun, who being grown up, the Prince takes him to his ſervice, ſaying, this is the way to multiply his Nation with vertuous people. And what is more, the wife is the better eſteemed of her huſband; and the Prince, if it be a male child, ſends him a little ſnake of gold or ſilver, in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98515:124"/>
form of an ear-pendant, which renders him ſo qualified, that the time may come he may be capable of the charge of <hi>Benchaye,</hi> who is the perſon next to the King: if it be a girle ſhe ſhall be married to a perſon of high degree. Though they want not mines of baleys, rubies, and of ſilver, beſides other mettals, as tin and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whence they get an earth which makes the moſt pure violet colour in the world, wherewith they make their houſes very gracefull to the eye, nevertheleſſe their fancy is to paint their arms and legs, ſpecially the nails, and hang pieces of old iron in their ears. A <hi>Portugueſe</hi> one day ſhewed them a piece of gold againſt the ſun, which charmed them ſo, that they immediately made it known to their king, who reſolved to have it at any price to hang in his ear, as a thing miraculous and ſacred, and gave for it half a tun-weight of cinamon.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Articles of their Faith, they have no Idols in their Temples, but on ſolemn feaſts being aſſembled they dance round, and ſing hymns in honour of the ſun, abſtaining from ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance till his ſetting. They acknowledge a place where ſinners are tormented after death, and ſome more grievouſly than others, proportionably to their offences.</p>
               <p>Further they have no ſpeculation, being Maſters neither of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature nor characters, a ſimple people eaſie to deceive, content with a bare ſufficiency for livelyhood, not ſtudying how to make uſe of their national commodities to the beſt advantage: beſides ſo kind, they give freely to one another whatſoever they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, and ſo groſſe, there are many things amongſt them they know no name for, and are abſolute forrainers at a mile diſtance. Their onely traffick is for honied wine, which is brought them from <hi>Suechan</hi> and <hi>Calaſen,</hi> in truck for wild beef-hides, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, which they ſell to <hi>Biguen.</hi> They are of ſuch fidelity in their commerce, that they are really ignorant what 'tis to lye, and keep their promiſe with religious obſervation. 'Tis true the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes to the Countrey are very dangerous, by reaſon of robbers of diverſe nations who rendezvous there, but the King executes moſt ſevere juſtice on them that are apprehended, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to the jawes of wild beaſts, which he keeps in Parks.</p>
               <p>This Princes court is governed with good policy, and is moſt commonly attended with four hundred tall men at arms, drawn out of his Provinces called <hi>Marac,</hi> which on the South confine on the kingdom of <hi>Couran,</hi> ſmall Countries, but the Inhabitants have a particular renown for their fidelity: Beſides he hath conſtantly near him 400. horſemen well mounted, and in his ſtable a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand able horſes at reſt, becauſe being generally bare-foot, they are apt to batter their hoofs. To march before him he hath 50. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers whom they call the <hi>Joarmamir,</hi> that is the chief Guard, cloth'd in cotton cloth, with bow and arrow in hand: then follow
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98515:124"/>
fifty Cavaliers more in cotton Caſſocks variouſly painted, with a ſhort ſilk Cloak, not unlike <hi>Meca</hi> Tapiſtry, wearing on their head a cap in faſhion like a Miter, at their girdles hang little balls of ſteel with three pikes, wherewith they ſeldom miſſe when they ſtrike, and at their Saddle bow a ſharp'ned iron like the head of a lance. Theſe they call the Kings Champions.</p>
               <p>Theſe two troops march in the field about a bow-ſhoot before the Prince, having between them fifty Elephants richly trapp'd with Tapiſtry of ſilk, each bearing three or four men with ſtrong bows, and arrows three ells long, <hi>Ethiopian</hi> bonnets on their head, and <hi>Alparyates,</hi> or open ſhooes on their feet: them they call <hi>Jourles,</hi> that is Archers. Then 50. Cavaliers mounted on white horſes, bearing balls of ſilver richly wrought, in white ſhort cloaks with ſilver buckles, on their head a red bonnet hanging over their ſhoulders, like a Chapperoon, they term theſe <hi>Gouaique Soumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara,</hi> that is, the Princes Councell of ſtrangers. Then a hundred more well mounted, ſtuck with abundance of feathers, their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes covered with caſes of Beares, Lions, or other beaſts ſkins frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with little coloured feathers, a bow in a ſcarfe, and a club in their hand of a ſufficient length. In the laſt place comes up the troop which is called <hi>Mameiteque Ebaulbic,</hi> or the Guard of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy armed with long <hi>lances</hi> pointed with certain ſtones keen as any razor, which next fire-pikes is the moſt dangerous arms I ere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. One amongſt them bears the Standart, which is the figure of a Sun, and the King marches next after, habited much after the ſort as the <hi>Gouaique Soumimara,</hi> a bonnet on his head, band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a white Taffety hanging over the horſe cruppers, with many devices repreſenting the high atchievements of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, to ſatisfy the humour of the people, who glory in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Princes, whoſe fame may live with poſterity.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other the fundamental lawes of this Nation, there is one whereby the King is obliged to marry three wives all of his own quality, without regard to their being forrainers, or of a contrary religion, holding that a good wife ought to make her huſbands will her rule in all things. If they conform not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this law, they render their children incapable of ſucceſſion, and muſt be content with a bare penſion, and become ſubject to an elected King, who poſſibly he might have raigned over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But this difference ſeldome happens amongſt them, and Tradition makes mention only of one <hi>Cbapoularin</hi> ſon of <hi>Jazal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> whom his mother had inſtructed to adore the infernal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which was ground of much combuſtion in the State, ſo as the mother and nine of her ſons were maſſacred in a ſedition, and they elected for King a ſon of the laſt wife, from whom the people received ſo prudent a Government, that being dead, they erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſtatue to his memory in the middle of the Market-place, in the town of <hi>Biguen,</hi> where it ſtands at this day. This is a town
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98515:125"/>
of exceeding ſtrength, mantled with good <hi>Baſtions,</hi> every ſtreet provided of chains for caſe of neceſſity, girt with good ditches, ſcituate upon the fair River <hi>Gambir,</hi> abounding in fiſh, which they fiſh for in little boats made of reeds, capable only of two men. The King hawks at river in thoſe boats, as 'tis the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of the country. They uſe bridges of ſtraw to croſſe the rivers, as they do in the kingdome of <hi>Garamel,</hi> which ſtraw they call <hi>Ingar,</hi> as in the Weſt-Indies they call it <hi>Tortora.</hi> The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men appear freely in the ſtreets, their garments are a ſhort gowne after the <hi>Arabian</hi> cut, ſleeves to the elbow onely, linnen hoſe, hanging on the left ſide a rich girdle colour'd in devices, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh maids from married women, upon their head a linnen vaile curiouſly wrought, hanging down their ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>Three times the year they admit commerce with the <hi>Suecheui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for their civility at <hi>Memite,</hi> when they took away all their women, and by expreſſe command of their King, reſtored them without the leaſt injury to their honour, a moſt heroick action of a barbarous Prince. From this country of <hi>Suechen</hi> they receive very conſiderable commodities, as likewiſe from <hi>Couran</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> countreys where they have plenty of honied wines, corne, cattle, fiſh, and excellent fruits, which they tranſport to <hi>Biguen</hi> without the leaſt tribute for any thing whatſoever. When the Kings wives go abroad, they are ſeated on Chariots, in ſuch manner as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> or the <hi>Geneſes</hi> are, all three together, in the ſame dreſſe like three ſiſters, and with like affection. The Prince keeps a perfect amity amongſt all the three, a thing much to be admired. Three principal noble-men called <hi>Genelcoulbre</hi> ever aecompany them, walking ſeven or eight paces before them, with ſtaves in their hands. The Ladies wear crowns of flowers and ſtones won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful refulgent, their face open, with pendants in their ears of rich pearls, and bracelets of the ſame.</p>
               <p>If they meet the King, they deſcend from their Chariots, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſcend again without further complement, as if they had never ſeen him. He makes a turn towards them, then paſſes on; and three of the chief of his train alight from horſe, and come kiſſe the Queens Chariots, who deliver ſome certain words to them, and ſo the Gentlemen remount. I often enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what it might be they ſpoke, but I could never be ſatisfied for the ſeveral relations told me. The Princes royall are educated in the Province of <hi>Marat,</hi> with prudent perſons well warn'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in obedience to the King, whom they viſit once in the year, which they divide into four ſeaſons as we do. The Daughters remain near their Mothers, where for their exerciſe they are taught to work the ſhort coats, which reſemble the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry of <hi>Meca,</hi> which the King beſtowes as preſents on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of his Court, to whom he marries his daughters: theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by priviledge may have two wives more, but of inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98515:125"/>
to his Lady-Royall, and ſo may be elected <hi>Bene-Chayc,</hi> an honourable office next his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The Court is well governed, and very polite, but the vulgar are exceeding groſſe and ignorant. Daughters of the Nobility marry not but with huſbands of vertue and valour. The King uſes all endeavour to civilize the People, but to no effect. Upon a time the King met a clowne carrying fiſh, and aſking him what he was, received but a ſlight anſwer; but being told 'twas the King ſpoke to him, he was ſo overjoyed, he would needs give him all his fiſh, which the King refuſed, but out of love he would needs force it upon him, and kindly threw it all in his lap, whereat the King laughed heartily, and cauſed one to give him a thanks of a better price, and made him come to Court, whence he would part no more.</p>
               <p>Some dayes journey from <hi>Bilguca</hi> towards the Province of <hi>Marat,</hi> Weſtward there is a mountain to imagination ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the higheſt ſteppe of the <hi>Ceuares</hi> in altitude, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wants ſnow, no not in <hi>July</hi> when we ſurmounted it, which is the end of Winter there. At the foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there is a gentile towne called <hi>Moulgas,</hi> the inhabitants whereof are Jewes, tributary to the King of <hi>Mongibir:</hi> one of theſe Jewes was our Hoſte, who gave us good entertainment, and falling into diſcourſe upon the Old Teſtament, he took us for Jewes, and preſently we had a whole Synagogue about us to congratulate, but they were ſoon ſcared away, when we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them we were Chriſtians. Our Hoſt preſented us for a dainty with the fleſh of Crocodile, but not being uſed to it, for my part I could not taſte it, for the apprehenſion I had of that furious creature, though I were ſufficiently ſatisfied the meat was wholeſome, white, and ſipid. He ſhewed us two <hi>Ducarfs,</hi> the leaſt I ever ſaw, who for paſtime he had hors'd upon a ſheep. Having gotten an Elephant for the remove of our baggage and commodities, we left <hi>Moulgas,</hi> and came to <hi>Suarin,</hi> the firſt Town in <hi>Marat,</hi> a place of ſtrength ſcituate upon a little Mountain, whence there ſallies a ſtream of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that turns three Mills. The people are kinde and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but Idolaters, believing the Sunne to be the maker of all things, and like them of <hi>Mongibir,</hi> that Heaven is onely for the Gods, and not for men.</p>
               <p>Thence we came to <hi>Moucal,</hi> an uniform Town, having eight ports, which are all perſpicable from the middle ſtation of the Town: Before the Palace-Royall ſtands a Pyramid, upon which there is the ſtatue of a King named <hi>Soualin,</hi> who once reſcued this Town out of an enemies hands, by the ayd of the Towneſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who in the action atteſted an un-heard of Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, for a monument whereof, he enacted a Law in their favour, that they may have three huſbands, but the men
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98515:126"/>
for their baſeneſſe, onely one Wife.</p>
               <p>Some few dayes journey from thence, we entered the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Couran,</hi> a good and fertile countrey, but full of Foreſts, infeſted with very dangerous wilde beaſts, and amongſt others with a ſort of fierce and ravenous dogges, by which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Paſſengers are devoured; as by the way we met with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence in bones, apparel, and bagges of Pearles and Emeraulds.</p>
               <p>Afterwards we paſſed through divers countries, as <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalbi, Choucay,</hi> and others. In all theſe parts we far'd at a cheap rate, for it coſt us not in two dayes the value of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the good people bringing us ſhare of what prey they had in hunting, came themſelves to eat with us: for our exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they uſed certain ſtrange inſtruments which they play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on. The women are reaſonable faire, very chaſt, but ill apparelled. The maids at twenty yeares of age, may marry whom they will, without hinderance of either Father or Mother.</p>
               <p>When they ſolemnize matrimony, they go to the Temple, where the Father ſayes to the young man, I give thee my daughter for thy ſpouſe, and the other Father ſayes the like to the maid. Then they take two ſheeps hearts, male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and preſent them to the Prieſts; who ſaying certain pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, burn them on the Altar, then kiſſe the married couple, and joyn them in mutuall embraces: then they feaſt with muſick, and deprive the maid of a lock of haire growing on the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of her head, as is the cuſtom for all maids and widowes, they religiouſly obſerve marriage all their lives, in perfect peace and concord.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98515:127"/>
the <hi>Negus</hi> had abſolutely loſt, for the <hi>Barnagaz</hi> who was Governour, was then come to Court, to do homage to the new Prince, who underſtanding that his Countrey was ſeiz'd on, with all poſſible expedition, repaired thither with fifteen or ſixteen thouſand men, and brought a ſeaſonable relief, aſſiſted by a Prince called <hi>Lulibella Abelicano</hi> eſteemed a Saint, and in effect with a handfull of men in compariſon of the Enemy, they got but little leſſe then a miraculous victory. This religious man told us many more very remarkable things of the death of the late <hi>Negus,</hi> father to him who reigned when we were there; a Prince ſo vertuous, and ſo beloved of his people, that after his death many of his chiefeſt Noblemen left their Fortunes and ſtately manſions, and becoming recluſe religious ſpent the remainder of their dayes in pennance. Amongſt others a Prince who had eſpouſed a ſiſter to the deceaſed, mourned with ſuch paſſion, that he fir'd his Palace, and got himſelf to ſo uncouth and ſolitary a place, that no man knew where to find him.</p>
               <p>'Twas in a Cave in the wild of the woods, where he concealed himſelf, and this by the conſent of his Lady, who on her part with two of her daughters became a recluſe Nun, in a Monaſtery of women called <hi>Aranatingil,</hi> to whom after deceaſe of the Mother, the <hi>Negus</hi> ſent to perſwade to become ſecular again, and prevailed with the one who was married to the Prince of <hi>Dafila,</hi> but the other called <hi>Agaria,</hi> perſiſted in her devotion, and proceeded to ſuch ſanctity, that, as they ſay, by revelation, ſhe underſtood the Place where her father was retired, and ſent her Confeſſor to viſit him, whom he found in the hollow of a rock, to which one muſt aſcend by many ſteps, and in one corner of the rock he had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle garden with a fountain, and ſome <hi>Coco</hi> Dates, which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſſins</hi> call <hi>Miguel,</hi> and other trees ſet round. There the Prince ſpent his daies with one onely ſervant, living on the fruits of theſe trees. He was exceedingly beloved and lamented by the whole Court, as well for his valour and vertue, as for that he was of the bloud of <hi>Tigray,</hi> being deſcended from the Emperour of <hi>Tigray</hi>: and the <hi>Negus</hi> himſelf, holding wars with the King of <hi>Deli,</hi> felt ſpecial want of him; and coming to underſtand where he was concealed, took the pains to go in perſon with his whole Army thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to entreat his aſſiſtance in a buſineſſe of ſo main importance, to the preſervation of the Faith, promiſing him that the wars en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he ſhould return to his hermitage; whereto the other would not be refractory, but leaving his grotte, and appearing to the Army, they conceived ſo great a confidence of good ſucceſſe in the war, that with a generall ſhout they cryed out victory. 'Twas a noble pleaſure to ſee the kindneſſes wherewith the whole Court welcom'd the Prince, ſome embracing his knees, other caſting themſelves at his feet, ſo great is the devotion of theſe people. Then arming him with arms of the skin of <hi>Coſcuma,</hi> back and

breaſt, and mounting him on a gallant horſe with an azure Croſſe in a white ſtandart before them, as on the day of battel, they have a red Croſſe of the colour of the Emperours tent, they marched into the field, and the war was proſperouſly ended to the wiſhes of the <hi>Negus</hi>: whether this Prince returned to his grotte or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at Court I cannot tell. But to proceed, the Province of <hi>Amara</hi> confines upon <hi>Angote,</hi> divided by the River <hi>Ancona,</hi> 'tis true that <hi>Olabi</hi> lies betwixt, through which the River <hi>Cabella</hi> paſſes, riſing out of the lake of <hi>Amara,</hi> abounding with Sea-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by them called <hi>Gomaraes,</hi> and by the <hi>Arabians Garmaran,</hi> and another like to a Lamprey, which being boiled in water, makes pottage white as milk, but red being boiled in milk. The <hi>Negus</hi> is eſteemed one of the richeſt and moſt potent Princes in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe. His ordinary Army conſiſts of thirty thouſand horſe and fifty thouſand foot, partly of tawny, partly of entirely black peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by reaſon of the heat of the Countrey, though notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they have both winter and ſummer. The Prince never ſtayes in Town above three dayes, and ever hath a well ordered Army in the field, amply provided of all ſorts of military ammunition, and his Court walled with a ſtrong and magnificent Guard.</p>
               <p>When any one ſues for acceſſe to the Prince, there is a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe office is to queſtion him, what he is, whence he comes, and what he deſires of his Majeſty, and holding him conſtantly by the hand at the gate of the Tent-Royal, he ſpeaks in a loud tone after a manner of ſinging, and ſo gives the King notice of this perſons arrivall, who immediately receives a diſpatch of his buſineſſe in few words and ſhort time.</p>
               <p>When the King marches into the field, which is never without his Court and Army, of above fourſcore or a hundred thouſand men, he removes not above four or five miles a day, ever lodging at Churches or Monaſteries. The Army marches foremoſt, with all the baggage packed up in baſkets inſtead of coffers. This Court is not hung upon by ſuch a raſcallity as ours is, nor is the Countrey harried and eaten up by ſuch a rabble, the villages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing, but the whole is diſcharged out of the treaſure and revenue of the Prince. After the Army is paſſed, comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three thouſand Officers, who carry the proviſions for the Kings table, wine in Barrels, and meat in Panniers, every one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his proportion on his head, thoſe who conduct them are called the <hi>Seraif:</hi> Then the Lords called the <hi>Serami</hi> follow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, a javeline in their hand, and a guilt falchion like a ſhort ſword by their ſide, and the Prieſts bare-headed, whereof four, who ſerve by the Quarter, carry the ſacred ſtone for cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration.</p>
               <p>The Prince marches under a Canopy, in an Apoſtolike ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of white ſilke, with wide ſleeves, and a broad large hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:98515:128"/>When the Court marches they are all well mounted, but ill-armed, for their Armes are neither ſo neat nor ſo well wrought as ours: The Prince hath one compleate ſuite of Armes which he puts on but ſeldom: The King of <hi>Spain</hi> preſented him with a ſuit by his Embaſſadour, which was muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet proof.</p>
               <p>Their ordinary Arms are half-pikes, and battle-axes, of which they know how to make good uſe. Their tents of thick ſtrong cloth: the Prince's of white linnen lined with leather, ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, 'tis capable to comprehend twelve thouſand perſons, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Officers, and Servants, as I ſaid before, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Honour to the Queen, beſides the Cavalry who ſerve by Quarter, and are thoſe who wear the Lions ſkin. In the middle of the Tent there ſtands a Church of vaſt circumference, near to which the King and Queen onely inhabit, for upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of any conference, they come into other apartements. His Tent alone is like a little Town, containing within it his very ſtables, all regularly compoſed, and well governed. He hath his muſick ſinging day and night, the Muſicians diſcharging their duties by turns; though he be not in his Tent, the ſame reverence and reſpect is obſerved as if he were preſent. He who hath the office to expoſtulate and induct thoſe who make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Prince, after he underſtands the buſineſſe; if he cannot of himſelf give ſatisfaction, he repairs to the Prince, to whom he relates the whole upon his knees, without preſuming to behold his face, or riſe up while the King ſpeaks, then returns and exacts the like reverence from others to himſelf.</p>
               <p>As touching Juſtice there, 'tis equally and ſpeedily admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, without any tedious proceſſe. If any man either in court or Army be found guilty of a crime, he is immediately puniſhed with baſtinadoes, the ordinary chaſtiſement, but they uſe alſo buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting as the <hi>Turks</hi> do.</p>
               <p>For the tributary kingdoms and dominions under the <hi>Negus,</hi> the Law is ſuch, that no one can confer the ſucceſſion on his Children without expreſſe licence, and 'tis ſeldome that the Sonne ſucceeds the Father, but where he hath done ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſervice for the State: inſomuch as they are as it were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments for life, nor have they aſſurance to continue ſo long; for ſometimes the Prince to reward their ſervices will deprive them of their Crown or Government to advance them to a higher. If he be diſpleaſed with any one, he ſends but a meer <hi>Serami</hi> or Lord, with a verbal command onely, for letters they have no uſe of, and the ſubject Prince having notice of his arrivall, puts on his Lions ſkin, in token of obedience, and meets him with all ſubmiſſion and civilities: whom the <hi>Serami</hi> having told that the King commands his preſence, without reply he immediately prepares for his journey, with his treaſure, wife and children.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98515:128"/>
The King afterwards diſpoſes of him at his pleaſure, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him at Court, or ſending him to the warres, till he ſhall think to beſtow on him ſome other government or domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on better or worſe according to his deſert; for this King is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne and equitable Prince, exceedingly beloved of his ſubjects, which ſupports the ſtate in happy juſtice, peace, and tranquillity, every one obſerving his duty: whence it proceeds that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not to erect any State by buildings, having no aſſurance they ſtall deſcend to their heirs.</p>
               <p>The Crown revenues conſiſt in corn, wine, cloth, linnen, ſilk, ſilver, not coyn; but counted by weight, for here there is no mint, no more then in <hi>China.</hi> He hath alſo an impoſt upon ſalt, which is a deer commodity here, and in ſome places is uſed as mony. The Prince hath theſe payments out of the neceſſaries to livelyhood, and hath his receivers in every town. His revenue is extraordinary great, which he diſpenſes part in payment of his Army, part in ſupport of his family, and the reſt to the Church and Poor.</p>
               <p>The countrey abounds in all commodities, except ſpice and ſalt, which comes from very forrain parts, and are exceeding deer, inſomuch that for a little bag of ſalt, you ſhall have what you deſire, weight for weight; for what ſalt they have comes either from <hi>Egypt,</hi> betwixt whom and them there are immenſe deſerts, or from other places ſeven or eight hundred leagues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, which ſets ſuch price upon it: As again they have their ſpices by the red Sea from <hi>Cochin Narſingue,</hi> and elſewhere, and as far as the Weſt-Indies.</p>
               <p>All the Towns of the country are ill built and little, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the Prince reſides ſo little in them, and the Court is continually upon march and change of ſtation. The principall are <hi>Barra, Tiena,</hi> and <hi>Barua,</hi> whereof the greateſt is not by a third part ſo big as <hi>Florence</hi>: They are all ſtrongly wall'd, and ſome well moated, but <hi>Baſtions</hi> with them are not uſed. The Fort or <hi>Citadel</hi> is commonly upon the gates of the Towns, where they keep their Artillery, whereof they have great ſtore, and ſay as well as the <hi>Chineſes</hi>; 'tis two thouſand years ſince they firſt had the invention. I ſaw a piece upon a <hi>Chineſe</hi> veſſel of 800. years caſt, and 'tis no ſmall queſtion, if they had the invention from us, or we from them, as 'tis more likely, if it be of ſuch antiquity with them as they ſay, or whether we happened upon it upon the like accident as they, I transferre to more curious inſpections.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other things I obſerve it as moſt ſingular and laudable in theſe people, that they bear a paſſionate affection to their Princes, and ſo firm a fidelity that they ſubmit to all ſorts of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea to death, rather then fail in their duties; and will conſent ſooner to the deſtruction of their proper Parents, then of their Princes: It being unheard of, that any one ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd

againſt his Prince, and if it ſhould ever happen, they would extirpate him and his, even to the child in the cradle, ſaying; there can be no lawful or valuable excuſe for the ſubject that conſpires againſt the King. A Tenent ſtrange enough to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of nearer nations, and in particular to our unfortunate <hi>France,</hi> who out of I know not what furious enraged and diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical zeale, hath too often dipt her paricide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ands in the Royal blood. God grant her grace to imitate theſe loyal <hi>Abiſſins,</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtians in this then ſhe. In all crimes they uſe a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and exemplar Juſtice; and a man once obſerved to be nefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, is hated and avoyded by all men: ſo as if for any fact he once fall under the hands of Juſtice, he ſhall be ſo baſtinadoed, he ſhall feel it all dayes of his life. And on the contrary, men of good lives are beloved and favoured by all men, and if any misfortune befall him, he ſhall finde every where aſſiſtance. The Priſons commonly are full of priſoners, maintained at the Princes charge, and 'tis but rarely that any ſuffer death in publick, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly within the Priſon where they fell the condemned with a club. They have likewiſe a moſt remarkable Rule for Creditors and Debtors: for if one ſell, or lend to another any thing, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of payment at a certain day, and after the day paſt, the Debtor hath not paid it, the Creditor goes to the Preſident or Judge, to whom he opens his caſe: The Judge gives him a faire hearing, and having given ſufficient teſtimony, the Judge delivers him a wand, wherewith he goes to ſeek the Creditor, and having found him, with the end of that wand draws a circle round about him, with command in the name of Juſtice not to ſtirre thence, till he be ſatisfied; then he muſt either diſcharge the debt, or to priſon without excuſe or delay: and if he endeavour to eſcape, 'tis death. Being in priſon, they aſſign him a day of payment, on which if he perform not, he muſt endure the cudgel; then they aſſign him another day, and ſo forward, till he either pay the debt, or dye with ſtripes; or render his perſon ſlave to his Creditor, till his ſervice hath made ſatisfaction: Sometimes they have the favour to go get their bread abroad. So ſeverely is Juſtice executed, without reſpect of perſons, or bribery; for in ſuch caſe the Judge is both degraded, and puniſhed: but it happens very rarely becauſe they have but few ſuits amongſt them. If one be found to have accuſed another wrongfully, he ſhall ſuffer the baſtinado: again if one deny a fact whereof there is evident proof brought againſt him, they put him to rack, by ſcrewing his fingers between two planks, and in caſe he confeſſe not then, they break his arms and legs. Their priſons are very large, and capable to hold many, where every priſoner labours for his living. The offendors by day have freedome of the houſe, but at night are ſhut up in a room ſo cloſe, they can ſcarce ſtirre.</p>

They conſecrate the Sacrament in a piece of bread according to the Greek rites, and then in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>David</hi> before the Ark, they uſe a motion in a manner of dancing in time of prayer, then bow themſelves very low: When they go forth of the Church, they hang thoſe Crutches out of the Gate in a place covered for that purpoſe, and every one knowes his own again. Their Prieſts live very exemplarly, and in great auſterity: In the Church they never demand any thing, every man gives to whom he pleaſes.<note place="margin">Inſtituted ſince <hi>Al.</hi> time, who ſpeaks not of them.</note> They have ſome amongſt them who never eat fleſh nor drink wine, living on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fruits, hemp-ſeed, ſuch as we feed birds with here, and other ſeeds unknown to us, and on certain roots.</p>
               <p>Others there are of an order not ſo auſtere, but every one, upon pain of moſt rigorous correction, obſerves the rule he hath made choyce of. There are <hi>Icronimites</hi> who ever go barefoot and bare-headed, ſleep upon the boards, wear hair-cloth, never taſte wine nor fleſh, and are as 'twere continually in prayer; Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are in woods, where with leave of ſuperiours, they walk at liberty, without any communication, but at confeſſion. Their office holds from Mid-night till an hour before day, then it rings to prayer, then they repoſe an hour, and return to ſing the office of the Church; which done, they ſay Maſſe with extraordinary devotion, then take their Sandals, and ſit down to a very innocent meal. They confeſſe not at all, have commonly their eyes fixt on the ground, and are much in ſolitude.</p>
               <p>A man when his wife is departed, loſes the repute of honeſty, if he become not religious. They rebaptize as often as they pleaſe, and ever after confeſſions they go to a Prieſt in a corner of the Church to be baptized, and you ſhall ſee thoſe of the greateſt age go to the Font like little infants.</p>
               <p>Some have ſaid that they baptize in fire, but 'tis nothing ſo, for they uſe water onely as we do, though their words are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſcrepant.</p>
               <p>They have long precept-faſts, and keep lent very ſtrictly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation being allowed neither to Soldier nor Infant, therefore this is the time the enemy chooſes to invade them, ſuppoſing they ſhall finde them weak. At Eaſter they communicate after the Greek rites, and force the ſucking infants to receive it, giving
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98515:130"/>
them the Teat after it, ſo that the Church is filled with the cries and bawling of children.</p>
               <p>Obſtinate Hereticks they condemn to the fire, but this hath not often occurred, but with Moores who diſſembled Chriſtians. In ſumme, the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> though Chriſtians, retain many ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſuperſtitions, and hereſies, both of the Jewes and Grecians, as Circumciſion, Purification, the Sabbath, abſtinence from Swines fleſh, from Hare, from blood, from all things ſtrangled, and from certain fiſh. With the Grecians they deny the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, the two-fold will of Chriſt, repeat Baptiſme, condemn the Councel of <hi>Calcedon</hi> in favour of <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus,</hi> hold that the ſoul freed from the body, enters not into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till the diſſolution of the world, and many other errours at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to them, denyed by ſome of them: but of this the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern relations of the Jeſuites, afford better information; who live amongſt them, and bring in a plentiful harveſt to the Church, by the converſion of theſe people to the Catholick and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. Of the Town of <hi>Barua, Bagamidri,</hi> and others. Stories of Sorcerers.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>BArua</hi> is a Town, that for bulk and ſcituation may ſtand in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell with <hi>Samacara</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> the happy, whereof I ſpake in the firſt part. It is raiſed upon a Mountain, at the Foot where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſlides a lovely River called the <hi>Arabic Arat,</hi> by the <hi>Abiſſins Morato,</hi> which yields abundance of fiſh, but chiefly ſtore of Crocodiles, which are excellent meat, and they eat them chiefly in lent, at which ſeaſon there comes more plenty then at any time of the year beſides. They come up from <hi>Nile,</hi> and ſo diſperſe themſelves through all the Rivers of <hi>Ethiope,</hi> that fall upon it. This creature lives both on land and water, is a great deſtruction of cattell, chiefly of ſheep, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is very licourous, and will devour one at a morſel, for want of them will break into gardens, and eat the fruits. This crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo ſubtle, that he will hide himſelf near to houſes, and vent moſt heavie ſighs, to entice people to him and devoure them, as it had fortuned to a poor woman at <hi>Barua,</hi> who had been ſo taken and devoured, but for the timely reſcue of her huſband, howſoever was mutilated.</p>
               <p>The like happened to us going by night from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Rouſſete,</hi> for we ſaw one, which we took for a block, and as a ſervant belonging to the Conſul of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſtept before to take it up, he was caught by this beaſt, who with his tayle drew him under water, and was never ſeen more.</p>
               <p>In fine having wandered to and fro amongſt theſe townes of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ſelling or trucking our Merchandizes, we reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to fall again upon our way to our country. In the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there were ſome <hi>Nubian</hi> Merchants of the town of <hi>Caſas</hi> civill perſons and good Chriſtians. We conſulted together of our way, if we ſhould take towards the River <hi>Falucia,</hi> or make to <hi>Gayuelle,</hi> along the River <hi>Morabon,</hi> which runs to <hi>Barua.</hi> But our company being compoſed of perſons of divers intereſts, according to their affaires, there aroſe ſome diſpute; but at laſt 'twas determined we ſhould go by <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelle,</hi> whither we had ſeven long dayes journey, to avoyd the danger of robbers, who are very infeſtuous to thoſe parts; as alſo the <hi>Tigars,</hi> whereof there is ſtore through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and ſo at length gaine <hi>Zuama,</hi> or <hi>Bagami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dri,</hi> where we left our veſſels, and part of our goods.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98515:131"/>
Then we travailed along the river through diverſe wild and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited places, being ever ready upon our guard for robbers that might way-lay us to ranſack what we had, and ſo croſſing <hi>Areal</hi> and <hi>Chauſſabir</hi> two Provinces, we met with Heardſmen of exceeding bigneſſe, who kept tame goats, which furniſhed us with milk and cheeſe, and veniſon as much as we would have, for a ſmall quantity of ſalt in exchange, being of opinion we had given them ſomething of high price. Not long after we beheld <hi>Gazuelle,</hi> and other ſmall Townes, where the greater part are Chriſtians, though they hold ſomething of Judaiſm, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>As we thought to go take our dinner at <hi>Moradar,</hi> about a league from <hi>Almina,</hi> a ſtormy wind under a cloak of thick black clouds purſued us at the heels, which made us keep near our boats, that if the rain ſhould ſurprize us we might have ſhelter at hand.</p>
               <p>At the inſtant, two men and a Prieſt in a gray habit accoſted us, the Prieſt with his hat in his hand, ſaluted us in <hi>Italian,</hi> ſaying he was of <hi>Cagliari</hi> in <hi>Sardaignia,</hi> and that 'twas his deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for his Countrey, whence he came into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Biſhop, who paſſed to the other world at <hi>Magadeli:</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ſome <hi>Italians</hi> that were travailing through <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for <hi>Egypt,</hi> he had ſought us out to be admitted into our company, intending to take ſhip at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſteer the courſe for <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Rome.</hi> The two men that were with him gave us high commendations of him, aſſuring us he would pay well for his paſſage, for that the Biſhop had left him threeſcore <hi>Doublons</hi> for his voyage. We made little anſwer, but at the ſame time, two Noblemen overtaking us in <hi>Palanquins,</hi> or Littars born by ſlaves on their ſhoulders, this Prieſt made to them and aſked an alms, and one of them gave him a piece of ſilver, then preſently returned to us, and as familiarly as we had been acquainted all dayes of our life, told us, by asking one could looſe nothing but the deniall.</p>
               <p>At length we came to <hi>Moradar,</hi> where we ſtayed our boats, as we had often done, ſince the loſſe of <hi>Monſieur de la Courbs</hi> man, in hope to find the body, for he had rich things about him.</p>
               <p>Being at our Inne we ſmelt a ſtrong ſent, and found 'twas ſome musk cats this Prieſt carried with him, which he would have trucked with us for other commodities, but we were loth to be troubled with ſuch unwholſome things. There they brought us to table a diſh of raw fleſh, well ſeaſoned with ſalt and ſpices, which was of delicate taſte and an excellent meat. After dinner we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved certain people, looking ſtedfaſtly in a bright ſhining baſon, and asking the reaſon, they told us they were looking to ſee a troop of Devils that were going to a battail, that was preſently
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98515:131"/>
to be fought. We replyed if it might be without danger we ſhould be very glad to participate with them, and would content them with a piece of money, which they accepted of, and the <hi>Sieur de la Courb</hi> gave them what we promiſed. Hereupon one of them caſt a kind of greaſe upon a chafing diſh of burning coals, which flamed and went out again, and there aroſe a thick ſmoak, then they perfumed the baſon, and oyled it with a ſort of oyl, and in an inſtant a formidable darkneſſe involved us, and we ſaw paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the air, as it were great ſwarms of knats, not being able to diſcern directly what likeneſſe they were of, we deſired the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician he would ſtay them, and aſk theſe Demons or hags whither they went with ſuch celerity; then renewing the fumigations and muttering I know not what incantations betwixt the teeth, we ſaw as 'twere ſwarms of Ants, which removing on his command, in imagination we ſaw the form of a body covered with linnen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to diſtinguiſh more: but this Phantaſme drawing near us, ſuch horrour ſeized us, that for my part the hair of my head ſo ſtarted up, that it threw my cap on the ground, and ſtrait a moſt loathſom ſtink, as 'twere of carrion, filled the room: this thing gabbled ſomething which the Magician underſtood, and told us he learnt by theſe demons there was a battaile at hand, to be fought by the king of <hi>Barma,</hi> and thither they were travelling, to receive the ſouls of the ſlaughtered, that they had croſſed a Sea of darkneſſe and horrour, and the confines of a land where the Sun never ſhone, nor Creature lived, and things of the like kind which this man related.</p>
               <p>At laſt all vaniſhed, leaving a ſcene of ſuch lovely trees, that from thence-forward we were bewitched with no ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky ambition to ſee Diabolicall deluſions: But to our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, after many daies travaile we arrived at <hi>Bagamidri,</hi> where we learnt the reſt of our Company, who would not come along with us, ſtayed for us at <hi>Zambera,</hi> or <hi>Zambre,</hi> a gentile Town upon the lake of <hi>Zuame.</hi> We were thirteen dayes travelling this ſhore, where we found many villages or hamlets, but few good dwellings:<note place="margin">Abibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cains.</note> from <hi>Zets</hi> to <hi>Caſera</hi> which are the beſt Towns, 'tis three dayes journey, and from <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ari,</hi> which is the Biſhoprick of St. <hi>Abiblicano,</hi> three more, and to <hi>Cafata</hi> four: we had extraordinary rains all this way, which nevertheleſſe hindered not our journey.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:98515:132"/>From thence we went to <hi>Albias</hi> or <hi>Albian,</hi> a ſmall Town, but full ſtocked with people, here we lodged at a <hi>Dragoyan</hi> merchants houſe, who was married there, and he let us want for nothing. At this Town, in the River were abundance of tame ducks, and a number of diſplumed geeſe, as likewiſe moſt part of the ducks were, the reſt frizeled, which cauſed a laughter amongſt us; to ſee theſe poor birds ſo ill apparelled, which ſome of the Town obſerving, and amongſt them ſome of the Conſuls or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates themſelves called the <hi>Abiari,</hi> they told us, when theſe ſhould come to our table, they would bring us a double pleaſure both in eating and ſleeping, and at laſt we underſtood 'twas uſual to pull their fowle alive to ſtuffe their beds with the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, making little caſes of tender Oſiers, which ſtuft with feathers, compoſe a very eaſie lodging, then for the meat 'tis both wholſom and delicate: for this purpoſe they fleece them twice a year: Sheep they have in abundance, which are of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable increaſe, bringing young ones two or three times a year, and very often two at a fall. They conſtantly coat them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der covert by night, holding for certain that the two ſtars which predominate in theſe parts in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> which the Indians call <hi>Zobana,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Or <hi>Zabano</hi> as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> call them. See the firſt part, c. 37. which muſt be <hi>Meduſa's</hi> head, or the dog, or one of <hi>Orion.</hi>
                  </note> riſing in the Eaſt, are mortiferous to their cattle: they have a cuſtom they teach their heards to feed ſo as they turn their heads from them as they paſſe by.</p>
               <p>In this Town of <hi>Abbiar</hi> we had good entertainment for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, all upon the Princes account; But whereſoever we came we diſtributed ſome grains of ſalt, which is very acceptable in thoſe Countries, as indeed throughout the whole Empire of <hi>Preſte John,</hi> being in effect their moſt currant money, for that is ready truck for any thing.</p>
               <p>In this place we ſtaid two dayes, at the inſtance of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and others of Quality, and left our <hi>Almadies</hi> and goods in charge with ſome of our company, to take the way to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> and ſo upon a branch of the <hi>Tecaſſin,</hi> viſit the Town of <hi>Saba</hi> or <hi>Soba.</hi> We made it about nine miles before we arrived at <hi>Amina,</hi> by a road caraſſed with the ſweeteſt folliage in the world, that is of dates, citrons and oranges, which grow there to a very great harveſt. The fields are full ſtocked with cattle of all kinds, and wild poultrey, leaving their eggs upon the earth, which the ſhepherds and others will not ſtoop for: we had good ſport to catch theſe fowls wherein no one hath propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; amongſt them ſome have combs like cocks, and many other kinds there are.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Amena,</hi> which is a pleaſant Town, there we agreed with a man to furniſh us with two <hi>Bungi,</hi> or barks, to carry us to <hi>Saba</hi> and back again. The <hi>Bungi</hi> are little cloſe boats like the <hi>Gondolaes</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> toed by two <hi>Bibaries</hi> which are ſmall bulls trained to it, who go a conſtant trot. We went off in the

morning and breakfaſted above ten leagues off, by reaſon of the ſwiftneſſe of our <hi>Bibari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This branch of <hi>Tacaſſin</hi> is much about the rate of the ditch or channel of <hi>Piſa</hi> at <hi>Liuorne</hi>; but towards <hi>Amina</hi> it runs ſoberly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, where fiſh is plenty and cheap, as all other neceſſaries, by reaſon of the fertility of the Countrey in all things. The whole Iſland or Countrey of <hi>Saba,</hi> called by the Natives <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedan,</hi> or <hi>Soba,</hi> is environed with two large Rivers, <hi>Sabalete</hi> and <hi>Morabo,</hi> waſhed with the <hi>Tecaſſin,</hi> who runs thither to joyn with <hi>Nile,</hi> of large extent, very populous and fertile. The Inhabitants are Chriſtians, except ſome ſtrangers of ſeverall Religions, there being liberty of conſcience, and freedom to enjoy their own Temples. There came in our company a man and his wife in a boat of his own, both decently habited, he wore a large two-corner'd cap of <hi>Chamlett:</hi> many diſcourſes paſſed betwixt us, his wife being very reſerv'd and diſcreet in her huſbands preſence, but in his abſence more free and jolly.</p>
               <p>The evening brought us to a fair Town called <hi>Salete</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leta,</hi> a different from that which is 'twixt <hi>Barra</hi> and <hi>Barua,</hi>

That ſhe travers'd <hi>Nubia, Canſila, Dala,</hi> and <hi>Tamatas,</hi> and arriving in the lower <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſhe diſmiſſed her Cavalry, as incapable to travail the Deſerts, and croſſing the red ſea, landed at <hi>Ziden</hi> a Port in <hi>Meca,</hi> came to <hi>Medina,</hi> and thence to <hi>Sina,</hi> and in forty five dayes journy upon the Deſerts to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> that being to paſſe over a river, upon a piece of timber, being informed by the prophetick ſpirit what it was, ſhe choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wade through the water in her clothes, then ſet her foot upon that wood, wherein the Maker of the Univerſe for us, ſhould conſummate his death and Paſſion, and how of this beam then buried in the ground, was afterwards fram'd the Croſſe on which our Saviour ſuffered; and many other things of like mettle they relate; which they ſay come to them by tradition.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Candace</hi> they ſay more, ſhe built the firſt Church in <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> by the Title of S. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> and that the ſacred Table of the Altar was brought from thence. But reverting to <hi>Saba,</hi> the ayre is temperate, and the ſoyle exceeding fruitful, loaded with Oranges and Lemons, and covered with birds of game. They are a good natur'd people, kind and civill, of long life, and not ſubject to many maladies; and 'tis not improbable theſe are the <hi>Ethiopian Macrobees</hi> ſo much celebrated by the Ancients for Longaevity. They delight in good horſes, and chiefly in thoſe brought from <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> which they eſteem the beſt of the world. They affect to go handſomely apparelled, wearing two corner'd hats of <hi>Chamlet</hi> lin'd with cloth of cotton or ſilk, their garments long, their doublets and hoſe of the Mariners cut, like them of <hi>Goa.</hi> The women are decently dreſſed in ſilk, their face open, with little round bonnets exquiſitely wrought; at the crown whereof, which is ſlit, comes out a lock of their hair, deck'd with gemmes; of pearls they wear abundance, eſpecially the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; others wear a vaile of linnen over their face. They have an hearb they call <hi>Amatura,</hi> which makes the beſt <hi>Carnation</hi> and

                  <hi>Nacar</hi> dye in the world, and being waſhed, becomes an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent crimſon which never loſes colour. The town in proſpect may be aptly ſaid like <hi>Tauris.</hi> Directly over againſt it on the other ſide the river, ſtand two other towns and a ſpacious Village. The kingdome of <hi>Saba</hi> is ſtor'd with many other good towns, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drara, Ambadarae</hi> or <hi>Ambadora, Mathida</hi> or <hi>Machada, Betma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Madraneli</hi> or <hi>Manadelli,</hi> and others of great trade, the people Chriſtians, of devotion enough, but with ſome mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Judaiſme. They worſhip Saints, but above all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, and when the Angelical ſalutation, or <hi>Ave Maria</hi> is rung, the Prince, if he be on horſe-back deſcends to ſay the prayer on his knees, otherwiſe he ſhould be mulcted. They have a Legend of a Paralitick, who being on horſe-back, and hearing the Bell ring, without excuſe preſently alighted, and was cured; whereupon he became a Monk of S. <hi>Abiblicanus</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all his wealth to the poor. 'Tis death to blaſpheme the name of God or the bleſſed Virgin, and all both men and women, as they are generally addicted to labour, while they work ſing pious ſongs to cheer them. <hi>Curteſans</hi> and publick Harlots are there expreſſely prohibited, and ſeverely puniſhed. A Shooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſeeing one who was very beautiful, (for lewdneſſe) led to puniſhment, took her to wife, and ſaved her, for which he had a general applauſe of all men, and ſhe ever after lived vertuouſly and modeſtly during her matrimony. They bear great honour to the Croſſe, and ſalute it on their knees, as oft as they finde one on the high way, inſomuch as one ſhall ſcarce ſee a Croſſe without divers kneeling about it: When a Church, Chappel, or Oratory is to be erected, they ring the <hi>Gadapi,</hi> which means the bell of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the bell made of baked clay, and the clapper of wood, which calls them together; and a <hi>Calſena</hi> declares the neceſſity of the ſtructure, to which they make a general voluntary contribution. I have ſeen the very principal Ladies along the river, carry, two and two, the neceſſaries to it, as Stones, Lime, Sand, and other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, which ſome will carry on their heads. The Princeſſe her ſelf leads the way on ſuch occaſions, and all the other Ladies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her example. The men likewiſe do their parts, and in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtations ſtand religious perſons, with muſical inſtruments to recreate the Lady-taſkers; on the other ſide 'tis the Princes part to provide fruits and other refreſhments for them, with tables ſet here and there, furniſhed with all ſorts of diet, and wine of honey in large hornes, for they ſeldom uſe other wine, except ſome of Dates; wine of the vine being forbidden by Law to all whatſoever. In this town is the Church of S. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> of which I ſpoke before, which they will have to be the firſt in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, built by the Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> wherein they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; there being more probability, 'twas the Queen <hi>Candace,</hi> or ſome other after her: for in the dayes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and long
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98515:134"/>
after, there was no Temple but that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whither they reſorted from all parts, to the ſervices and ſacrifices at certain ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn feaſts. There are 300. <hi>Debeteres</hi> or Cannons belonging to this Church: There is likewiſe a ſtately Palace for the Tribunal Juſtice called the <hi>Macabate,</hi> where they judge the Proceſſe, and Appeal to <hi>Tigray,</hi> whereon they depend; the Province being tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the kingdome of <hi>Tigray.</hi> The Town of <hi>Saba</hi> or <hi>Soba</hi> is properly upon that <hi>Nile</hi> which comes from <hi>Zaire,</hi> for the other branch called <hi>Tecaſſin,</hi> or <hi>Tagazzi,</hi> deſcends from the Lake <hi>Baret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in high <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and they joyn about <hi>Ermita.</hi> From <hi>Saba,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we went aboard, we had a deſire to go ſee the Town of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the Seigniory whereof confines upon <hi>Gianamora,</hi> or <hi>Giana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara</hi> towards the Eaſt and North, towards the South upon the Kingdom of <hi>Cauas,</hi> and on the Weſt upon the Province of <hi>Sieto,</hi> which touches upon <hi>Nubia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a Church dedicated to the ſacred Virgin, which is one of the moſt famous in the country, for that by exquiſite artifice 'tis cut out of the natural rock. <hi>Candaces</hi> Eunuch is ſaid to be the Founder of it. Within we ſaw thirteen <hi>Domes</hi> or <hi>Niches</hi> excellently wrought with fine columns, and drawing near the Altar in one of the <hi>Niches,</hi> the picture of the Virgin with her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Jeſus crowned, and a creſcent at his feet, then in the middle of the Church the figure of a Bird, ſignifying the Holy Ghoſt, without any either image or figure in the whole Church: The <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> made Seats for the Prieſts, in repreſentation of the thirteen Apoſtles. They have many Sects amongſt them. The chiefe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late wore a long garment cloſe girt to him, at which is faſtened a picket capouch. The man ſhewed much gravity and Majeſty, and ſtood amazed when he ſaw us on our knees before the image of the Virgin, whereof he deſired to know the reaſon. But as there were but few amongſt them of the ancient religion, ſo omit they not to ſing the Prime, the third, the ſixt, and other Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal houres, ſinging the Pſalmes ſtanding, Interjecting many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and prophane ceremonies. They much rejoyced at our devotion to the bleſſed Virgin, and began to cry out with great joy, <hi>Anderi,</hi> behold people of the fartheſt point of the world of our religion, then ſhewing them our Primmers with ſome pictures in them, they could not contain from kiſſing our garments, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming us with ſuch profound humility, that in tenderneſſe we melted tears.</p>

                  <note place="margin">May be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of <hi>Abba Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riman.</hi>
                  </note>The Prince of the place having heard of us, and that we were entertained by theſe Prieſts, conceived well of us, and imagined we were Prieſts, travailing towards <hi>Saba</hi> in <hi>Meroe,</hi> to viſit the chaire of a holy Prophet of the great God <hi>Magoura,</hi> which they hold to be the Chaire Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> preached in, by them called <hi>Nabi Aſiſta,</hi> and the Robe King <hi>David</hi> danced in before the Ark, preſerved as a venerable Relick, with a ring preſented,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98515:134"/>
as they ſay, by <hi>Salomon</hi> to the Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> a very ſplendid one, and ſeems like a burning coale.</p>
               <p>Now being lodged in the Prieſts apartment, he entertained us with excellent fare, variety, and well-dreſſed, but the firſt diſh ſeemed ſtrange to us, for 'twas fleſh raw, ſeaſoned with ſpices; 'twas of no ill taſte, but rather procuring appetite; then we were ſerved with all ſorts of good meat. At this feaſt many came to accompany us, and I ſuppoſe every one brought in a ſhare, for the people underſtanding us to be of their religion, uſed us with great kindneſſe, and as we came out of the Church, kiſſed our garments, and preſented us with birds of divers kinds, for which we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a gratitude, but accepted nothing.</p>
               <p>While we were at Supper, we had every one an Inhabitant ſitting by him with a cup of Date wine in his hand, others waiting to fill again when occaſion was, and not one of thoſe who ſate with us eat a bit, but ſate onely to entertain us. More we obſerved, that in all the meats, there was not one bone, but ſo neatly ordered, one could not perceive how they were taken out. There was no fruit for the laſt, though they have great abundance; but Plates full of little fryed cakes, like fritters, to which none of us had any great ſtomack, yet to comply with them, every one took one for a taſte onely, but for my part I liked them ſo well, that two douſins ſcarce ſerved my turn. After ſupper a great concourſe came in to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and ſome amongſt them modeſtly deſired me to ſhew them my Primmer, for a picture of the bleſſed Virgin which was in it, which I did, and they took it, and ſhrunk away ſo in the throng, I could never hear more of it.</p>
               <p>After this they brought us to our lodging, our beds were mats,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernuſſe</hi> a ſort of <hi>African</hi> cloth.</note> and <hi>Bernuſſe</hi> inſtead of ſheets.</p>
               <p>That night we ſlept very well, and on the morrow we went to hear their Church-ſervice: where there was an extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. We ſung a <hi>Salve</hi> before the Image of the Virgin, and interpreted the ſignification to them, wherewith they were extremely edified, weeping for joy to ſee and hear us, and learnt by heart what we had taught them, for they are a very docile people, and proclive to Religion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Of ſome particular Towns in <hi>Ethiope,</hi> viſited by the Authour in his Peregrination.</head>
               <p>HAving ſtayed there ſome few dayes we returned back to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biar,</hi> where we found our company, with our <hi>Almadies</hi> and goods, then together we held our courſe upon the <hi>Nile</hi> for three dayes journey, meeting neither with Town nor Village of any importance, but we ſaw abundance of Cattle, Bufflers, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and a ſort of Goats, which have hair ſoft and delicate, as white ſilk, then ſteeceleſſe ſheep; others all white but the head: Swine of extraordinary greatneſſe, which quietly carry boyes who guide them, and travell them like horſes; but for Apes and Monkies, 'tis incredible what number and variety there is in thoſe parts, beſides many other <hi>Specieſes</hi> of beaſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us.</p>
               <p>The third day we paſſed by a corner of a wood, which is in the famous deſert of <hi>Goran,</hi> whereof we had the proſpect fifteen days before. There we found Tortoiſes of ſuch prodigious great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they will travel with a man upon them. The fourth day we came to a gentile town called <hi>Camiſſan,</hi> where amongſt other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities; their women are of extraordinary beauty, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us with many kindneſſes, and the more freely, becauſe there were but few men in town, the greateſt part being in the Princes attendance, who at that time made a new entrance into <hi>Caſila,</hi> another Province upon the <hi>Nile.</hi> Then we came to <hi>Caſſoudra</hi> three leagues from thence, where there is a Colledge, and a School of the <hi>Syriack</hi> language, which the Mahometans of <hi>Dalaſcia,</hi> as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the <hi>Negus,</hi> are obliged to maintain for their tribute; at night we went to bed at <hi>Baza,</hi> and were exceedingly moleſted with knats or couſins, by reaſon of a little coppice of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> by which we came, and after that by another of Orange trees, which kept us company as far as <hi>Baza.</hi> Theſe knats breed in the fruit of the <hi>Caſſia</hi> trees, which is ſweet, and falling upon the ground ſoon corrupts, as I ſaid in another place, ſpeaking of <hi>Arabia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Baza</hi> we made three dayes to <hi>Hermita,</hi> a pretty town, only one mile diſtant from <hi>Nile,</hi> which comes not to it, becauſe the Channel is choaked up.</p>
               <p>The ſcituation is very pleaſant, ſtanding in a thicket of Orange and Lemon trees: there again we ſaw thoſe huge Tortoiſes, which men ride on, and 'tis a wonderful thing of thoſe creatures, they, their heads cut off, will live four or five dayes, retaining their blood, as we ſeveral times experienced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:98515:135"/>On the morrow, holding on our journey, we came to lodge at <hi>Fougira,</hi> which ſtands in a wood of Orange trees, that perfumes the air with a ſweet odour. There we ſaw Archers ſo excellent they will ſhoot as directly as a Gunner: and they told of one that ſet an apple upon his ſons head, and ſhot it off with an arrow: we went to ſee the Governour of the Town, who was lately married to a wealthy Lady; and having made our reſpects to him, he had little regard of us, wherewith we were no more ſatisfied, than we were with his Phyſiognomy, which was very ill-favoured, but well matched with his Ladies. We ſpent moſt part of the night to ſee the devices and ſports the people made, in honour of their Governours nuptials to delight his ſpouſe. Leaving <hi>Fougira</hi> we went to <hi>Fougiara</hi> to bed, a ſmall but a pleaſant Town, having all the day had a violent ſtorm at our back, and happy it was our <hi>Almadies</hi> were well covered; but here befell us a ſad misfortune through the fault of the ſteers-man, for holding too cloſe to ſhore, a torrent of water from this deluge of rain falls upon the open part of the veſſel, with ſuch weight and force, that in an inſtant we were all under water, and all our gold, ſilver, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize loſt, with our Interpreter, and two ſervants. 'Twas a moſt deplorable thing to ſee a ſhipwrack ſo near the land. Yet I had notwithſtanding the good fortune to ſave a woman, who with her huſband came aboard with us for <hi>Caſiane,</hi> but with this I had the hard fate, that by preſerving her I loſt a little pannier of the chiefeſt curioſities I had, which was a loſſe of importance to me, and much grieved the good woman, ſince it happened upon her occaſion, ſo as ſhe beg'd of her huſband to take it into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and to give me ſomething in recompenſe when we came to <hi>Carſiane</hi>; but he who was a ſubtle companion gave me good words, which produced nothing. The truth, is in this miſchance, if we had not been relieved by another <hi>Almadie,</hi> we had all been caſt away, beſides that the ſhore is infeſted with robbers, and beaſts of prey, as Lions, Tigars and others.</p>
               <p>'Tis true the Lions here are not altogether ſo dangerous, for they will not meddle with a man except they be firſt aſſaulted: but the Tigars are bloody and ravenous of mans fleſh, ſo as if they once compaſſe a man he is loſt, venturing upon horſemen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, giving moſt ſtupendous leaps and aſſaults, yea they will fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe break into the midſt of a troop of horſe. By night we got to <hi>Fougiara,</hi> where we had a good ſupper provided, but we could eat nothing for the terrour our late danger had left in us, and the affliction for our great loſſe, but for the men above all: For the <hi>Sieur de la Courb</hi> loſt a ſervant that had ſerv'd him twenty years, beſides a thouſand <hi>Spaniſh</hi> doublons, and a pound of pearles, by eſtimation of great value, with great ſtore of other rich commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and curioſities. Notwithſtanding 'twas our duty to embrace all with patience, with praiſes to God that preſerved our perſons,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98515:136"/>
and in this misfortune the <hi>Sieur de la Courb</hi> had a baſon full of gold, of <hi>Pepitas,</hi> (as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> calls them) or ſeeds given him by one of the Lords in our travaile, which was in another <hi>Almadie</hi> with the reſt of his people, and now ſtood us in good ſtead. On the morrow we went to <hi>Carſiane,</hi> and lodged at her houſe who was ſaved when our bark was loſt, ſhe made us a free entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and upon her account we were viſited by all the principall of the Town. There we reſted our ſelves two daies, and the good woman in acknowledgement of her obligation, thought no treaty ſufficient for me, taking ſo much care for me that next morning ſhe brought me a clean ſhirt, and gave me other preſents as ſhe was able, amongſt the reſt, a peice of very ſine cloth of <hi>Calicut</hi> to make me ſhirts. Thence we went to <hi>Saraboma</hi> or <hi>Saraboeſun,</hi> that ſo famous Iſland, which the Ancients called <hi>Meroe,</hi> and now <hi>Caeguere,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the line and the Tropick.</p>
               <p>Some ſay 'twas originally called <hi>Saba,</hi> and took the name of <hi>Meroe</hi> from a ſiſter of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> king of <hi>Perſia.</hi> This Iſland is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the two arms of <hi>Nile,</hi> the one anciently called <hi>Aſtaboras</hi> the other <hi>Aſtupus,</hi> or <hi>Aſtuſapes,</hi> which is on the weſt ſide. <hi>Saraboma</hi> ſtanding betwixt two rivers like <hi>Saba,</hi> is quite hidden in trees very pleaſantly. There we ſaw not ſo much as one Trades-man, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſhop, but every man in his own houſe works by himſelf. The greateſt part ſpin wool or ſilk, and dames of the beſt quality make ſtuffs of ſilk. In brief, they all work except thoſe of baſe repute. They are a people of honeſt and religious life, where there is not a Malefactor, nor a perſon in the hands of juſtice, no Lawyers, nor no Pettyfoggers. They celebrate Maſſe after the <hi>Georgian</hi> rites, with ſome ceremonies of the <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Abiſſine.</hi> Through all the churches they ſay but one Maſſe a day, as through the reſt of all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> and all, men, women, girls and infants, muſt hear every day one: there cannot be a people better, nor more devout.</p>
               <p>They generally obſerve lent, and the greater part faſt it entirely. They give the Communion to ſucking infants, uſe extream auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are of very reſerved life, timorous to offend God in the leaſt, grounding themſelves on the words of the Evangeliſt, who ſaith, <hi>Hardly ſhall the juſt man be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence we paſſed by many habitations of tents, compoſed in the form of <hi>Tremiſen,</hi> or <hi>Ducalia,</hi> where throughout, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were very large of perſon, and ſtoutly armed, and waited on with fierce dogs. Then we travailed five dayes, not meeting with any Town but <hi>Guelba,</hi> a place inconſiderable: nor durſt we lodge there for fear of ſome injury, but lay in our barks. As we paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, we enquired ſtil of the Country-men if they ſaw by the banks the bodies of any drowned men, but in vain, for we could learn no tidings. The fifth day we came to a fair Town called <hi>Eſſere,</hi> in the ſame Iſle of <hi>Meroe,</hi> ſeated on a ſoyle covered with dates, oranges, and other fruit trees. They have likewiſe <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> but make
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98515:136"/>
no account of it. We had ſight of a wild <hi>Rhinocerot,</hi> that was croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a thick wood, that with breaking the boughs as he went made the woods ring, afterwards we ſaw the female follow him. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Country venture not to deſtroy them, for that he is ſo dangerous, and his natural armour impenetrable.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Eſſere</hi> we made towards <hi>Bigan,</hi> having taken in proviſion becauſe we had four dayes journey thither. The way is ſomething dangerous by reaſon of certain <hi>Cafies,</hi> aſſaſſines who murther the paſſengers, and live onely upon pillage.<note place="margin">Tamatan.</note> There they call them <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matans,</hi> becauſe they are of the kingdom of <hi>Tamatas</hi>: They can ſubſiſt three or four dayes together, without eating any more then a little butter, and two dates a day: They are of a large ſize by a good ſpan taller than the ordinary, but very megre and lean, and they never lie down.</p>
               <p>As we paſſed we ſaw vaſte Countries but few inhabitants, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome ſhepherds. But before we arrived at <hi>Bigan,</hi> we came to a great hamlet, called <hi>Carfouran,</hi> where we went on ſhore to refreſh and recreate a little: There we bought a barrel of wine of honey, which barrel was made of a cane of one piece, all but the ends. They have of theſe barrels that are wonderful large; towards the Weſt we ſaw a great field covered over with capers, of which they make little account: we boiled a young calf, which they gave us, I think, for fear we ſhould do them ſome harm, ſeeing us go in company, and well appointed, and every where we took paſſes of the Princes and Lords.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, when we came away we gave them ſome few dragmes, which are little ſquare pieces of ſilver, currant all along <hi>Nile</hi> up into high-<hi>Egypt,</hi> and are taken by weight. Thence we came at night to <hi>Bigan,</hi> and we neglected not as ſoon as we landed, to go viſit the Governour, whom they call the <hi>Baſira</hi>; we ſhewed him the <hi>Negus</hi>'s paſports, which with great ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in token of reverence he laid upon his head, ſhewed us great kindneſſes, and invited us to ſupper.</p>
               <p>He ſent us to our lodging four great hornes of date-wine, exceeding ſtrong and ſearching; for drinking it without water one would think himſelf on fire, and I believe it paſſes through ſome diſtillatory: We kept it to take in mornings in the manner of ſtrong-water. We returned the Governour ſome ſweet-meats in exchange, which were very acceptable, and he gave us beſides certain birds which are good meat, in Province we call them <hi>Franſons,</hi> with ſix turkeys, and four white partridges. Departing from <hi>Bigan</hi> we came in one day as far as <hi>Caſima,</hi> directly over againſt the deſert of <hi>Goran,</hi> which lies on the Eaſt and South of it.</p>
               <p>This was a day of great pleaſure to us, paſſing ſtill by Lawrels and other ſorts of lovely and wholſom fruit-trees, and meeting with many Towns and hamlets, where they have horſes in abundance:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98515:137"/>
We ſaw there a great troop of Munkies paſſing by a lake in the middle of a Plain, and a Gentleman fiſhing with Hawkes, which took great ſtore of good fiſh, and carried them to their Maſter. The ſight of this fiſhing retarded us above an houre, though we had ſeen the like in ſeveral places in <hi>India.</hi> When the people ſaw we were delighted with their ſport, they brought us a good part of their fiſh, as Eels, Trouts, Carps, and Barbels, and we returned them two fine horns excellently wrought, full of Date wine. They walked by us upon the River Bank, and deſired us we would ſtay and drink with them, mean while one of them wrote a note to the Lord of <hi>Caſima,</hi> whereupon when we were arrived, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered us very noble accommodation, ſent us divers ſorts of fruits, and a dozen of rabbets black and white; exceeding ſmall, but of excellent taſte. With great courteſie, he offered us any thing we had uſe of, and on the morrow, he invited us to dinner in his garden called the <hi>Motochon,</hi> which word is vulgar Greek, though uſed in <hi>Nubia.</hi> This garden was made at the Princes charge with great art, full of abundance of trees, graffed with ſeveral kindes one above another, which to the eye is delightful to ſee ſeveral va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety upon the ſame ſtock, as amongſt others two ſeveral ſorts of figs. The like I have ſeen in the Iſle of <hi>Chio,</hi> and at <hi>Zaure,</hi> at the Convent of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> for there on the one ſide I have ſeen fruit ripening, on the other ſide fruit decayed and rotten, out of which corruption, certain knats take life, which immediately go and peck the others, which makes them preſently periſh, which otherwiſe would endure for ever, an admirable thing in nature, nevertheleſſe moſt true. There were beſides certain trees which bear nuts as bigge as Eſtridge egges, full of cotton, as fine as ſilke.</p>
               <p>There were other ſorts of fruit which I never ſaw but there, and one amongſt the reſt, leav'd like the Siccamore, with fruit like the golden apple, but no gall more bitter, and within five ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels as big as Almonds, the juyce whereof is ſweet as ſugar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſhell and the nut there growes a thick ſkin of Carnation colour, which taken before it be throughly ripe, they preſerve with Date-vinegar,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lacque</hi> ſanguine colour for Painters.</note> and makes an excellent ſweet meat, which they preſent to the King as a great curioſity. Another tree bears of the fineſt ſort of <hi>Lacque</hi> for Painters. Alſo they ſow here Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Auil</hi> or <hi>Indico,</hi> an hearb that makes a dye of great price; whereof they make great traffick, and profit.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they have another grain from which they draw an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent oyle, beyond that of Cinamon, which they uſe for reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirits. Then they have a tree like a Pomegarnat, which bears a moſt ſoveraign balme, as I have had the experience: for I brought one of theſe nuts from thence, which I had of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in truck for a <hi>Turqueſe,</hi> wherewith I did great cures amongſt my friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:98515:137"/>I ſhould never conclude if I ſhould write but half the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this garden, where there is a collection of all the Oriental ſingularities: But that which ſeemed of all moſt rare and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, was two hands of tranſparent Marble at the Fortal, which held a bow bent; when any one knock't at the gate, the hands diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged arrowes upon them, but the arrovves had no piles, and the danger vvas not great: all this done by ſprings dexterouſly ſet on vvork. The beauty and excellence of this garden ſtay'd us tvvo vvhole dayes here in contemplation of the rarities.</p>
               <p>In fine, we took our leave of this worthy Lord, whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lebetera,</hi> and bent our courſe for <hi>Miſan,</hi> through which vve vvere to enter <hi>Nubia,</hi> a kingdom vvhich confronts the Deſerts of <hi>Goran, Egypt, Ganga,</hi> and <hi>Borno,</hi> the bounds of <hi>Preſte Johns</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, vvhich confines on that ſide on <hi>Nubia</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. A prodigious Hiſtory of a young <hi>Abiſsin</hi> Prince, by name <hi>Joel,</hi> by enchantment transformed into an Ape.</head>
               <p>AS we paſſed along <hi>Nile</hi> in our <hi>Bark,</hi> entertaining the day with various diſcourſes, one ſhewed me a book of many prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hiſtories, and amongſt others, this of Prince <hi>Joel,</hi> of whom I had heretofore heard at <hi>Pegu,</hi> where the ſtory is repreſented in a Tapiſtry of the Kings, after this manner. In <hi>Janamira</hi> a Province of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> there lived a Prince called <hi>Roſtan Sofar,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Fafarin,</hi> who by a firſt wife had a ſon named <hi>Alarin Sofar,</hi> but uſually called <hi>Joel</hi>; and by a ſecond wife two, <hi>Aman Sofar</hi> and another whoſe name I know not. Not long before his death, he made his will, and left to <hi>Joel</hi> his eldeſt ſonne, his principial do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and all his treaſure; betwixt the other two, he divided the reſt of his dominions. The guardian-ſhip of young <hi>Joel,</hi> he committed to a friend, to whom he diſcovered the place where
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98515:138"/>
the greateſt part of his treaſure lay hid, which he had incloſed in a ſtone that was laid in the bowels of a wall. Three dayes after his deceaſe, this friend dyes with grief, ſo as the treaſure, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Joels</hi> perſon, were left in the power of <hi>Roſtans</hi> widow, <hi>Joels</hi> ſtep-mother: who, ambitious the ſucceſſion ſhould come to her own children, out of a frantick malice, reſolved to ſend <hi>Joel</hi> upon a ſpecious pretence, far enough from his Palace, to a ſiſter of hers, a moſt powerful Magician, who to raze out all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, ſhould by vertue of charms, transform him to an Ape, giving out that he was loſt, and could by no means be heard of.<note place="margin">The ſame we read in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredi.</hi>
                  </note> They ſay the work was executed after this manner. This Sorcereſſe was blind, but on the Sabbath that darkneſſe left her, and ſhe could ſee as others do: <hi>a:</hi> On a Sabbath day ſhe took <hi>Joel</hi> with her to ſacrifice to Sathan, and do him ſuch homage, as his profeſſed ſervants uſe to do. But he refuſing to perpetrate ſuch abhominable duties to the Prince of darkneſſe, ſhe reſolved to diſpatch him by murther; but again moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion by the gracious ſweetneſſe in his face, ſhe changed her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. She compoſed a <hi>Bath</hi> wherein ſhe put him, and by power of her inchantmens, transformed him to an exceeding pretty, and tractable Ape, ſuperinducing an Apes ſkin over his humane ſhape, ſo abſtracting his reaſon and ſence, that little more remained in him then was proportionable to a meer ſenſual creature, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which a knowledge was ſomething more perfect, though he had not the uſe of articulate ſpeech, and with a marvellous addreſſe to render thoſe little ſervices to them of the family, who cheriſhed him, and fancied him exceedingly.</p>
               <p>The deplorable Prince lived divers years in this condition, at length he made his eſcape into the woods, where he ſuffered great acerbities, and often perplexed with illuſions of the devill, but was ſtill aſſiſted by an extraordinary flame of grace, and the vigilancy of his guardian Angell, who for his conſolation appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him ſometimes in the form of a dove, ſometimes in ſome other ſhapes of like quality. Mean while, it being generally belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Joel</hi> was dead, <hi>Aman Sofar</hi> his younger brother had poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his fathers eſtate, and enjoyed thoſe wide dominions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction. Upon a time as he progreſſed with a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent train towards the Province of <hi>Dafila</hi>; he ſate dovvn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf under a ſhade, and cauſed the green bank of a cool fountain to be covered for his table, the pretty Ape being at hand, preſented himſelf before his brother, and addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upright upon his feet, by mute expreſſions ſeemed to beg ſome bread. <hi>Aman</hi> obſerving the quaintneſſe of his dapper gueſt, with a neat white flaxen beard, ſoft as ſilk, and his-body powder'd with Orange colour'd tufts, bad ſome bread and meat ſhould be given him on a Plate, which before he would touch, he went and waſhed his hands at the waſte of the vvell. <hi>Aman</hi> vvas ſo taken
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98515:138"/>
vvith theſe Mimick civilities, that he gave him drink in his ovvn cup of gold, and entertained him as one of his train, taking him along upon one of his Elephants, 'Tis ſcarce imaginable hovv di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and officious this poor creature vvas in their voyage, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for vvater for them, and climbing trees to get them fruits; but 'tvvas obſerved he would be Cup-bearer to none but his brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aman</hi> had married a Lady of high Deſcent, and beſides had a Concubine whoſe name was <hi>Amer,</hi> and by both had many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <hi>Joel</hi> being arrived at Court, failed not to go kiſſe the hands of all his little nephewes, and Neices, and of his brothers lawfull conſort, which he did with ſo courtly a grace, that <hi>Aman</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid, you are very imperfect in your courtſhip to Ladies, if you complement the children, and forget the mother, upon which hint he immediately tender'd the like reſpects to the Concubine, he had before performed to the wife. In a word, there was not the leaſt offence of bruitiſhneſſe to be obſerved in the pretty <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge,</hi> for ſo they named this little Ape, inſomuch that he himſelf in imitation of people would pare his nailes; would ſtill his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews when they cryed with plums, and fruit he would have in a corner, did all kind of offices for his brother and ſiſter, except ſuch as were ſordid and inferiour, which he left for inferiour Officers.</p>
               <p>In Court there liv'd a Lady of Quality, widow to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Tutor of <hi>Joel,</hi> with a moſt beautiful daughter of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fourteen years of Age called <hi>Eugenia,</hi> or as others ſay <hi>Ozania,</hi> who falling ſick, entreated her mother ſhe would deſire the Ape of Prince <hi>Aman,</hi> to be ſome exhilaration to her with his blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments he uſed to ſhew her when ſhe came to Court to viſit the Princeſſe, which was eaſily granted. The Ape being brought, as he had been ſome learned Phyſician, immediately found the nature of her diſeaſe, and preſently applyed himſelf to make her merry: which divertiſement betrayed her into the hands of ſleep, then he ſtept back to the Palace to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and play with his little kinſmen, and returned not long after to viſit the ſick Lady newly waked, ſtroaking her with his little hands, which had ſomething I know not what of finer make then other creatures of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> as I my ſelfe obſerved in the figure I ſaw at <hi>Pegu.</hi> By little and little, ſo firme a friendſhip grew betwixt <hi>Joel</hi> and <hi>Eugenia,</hi> that they could not be aſunder, eſpecially the Lady who was aſtoniſhed to reflect, ſhe ſhould have ſo ſtrong a paſſion for an Ape, without knowledge of any cauſe or ground: That cauſed her greateſt admiration was, that one day paring her nayls, ſhe would needs pare the <hi>Alſinges</hi> alſo, and viewing them attentively, ſhe obſerved ſome part of them to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a thin ſkin like that of his armes, which were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhap'd, and more ſolid then his fellows. This put her often
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98515:139"/>
into muſings, till ſleeping on a night in a viſion, ſhe be held a venerable Matron covered with a white vaile, who ſpake thus. <hi>Ozania my daughter, wherefore protract ye to relieve my ſonne</hi> Joel, <hi>who is the ſelfe-ſame Ape you ſo tenderly cheriſh, reduced to the deplorable eſtate you ſee him, by the infernal cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of a Step-mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But as it pleaſed the Creatour of all things to ſuffer this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and in this forme to preſerve him to this houre; ſince 'tis Heavens Decree he ſhall one day be your husband, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to you. Faile not to ſoak him in a bath of thoſe hearbs I have properly collected for him, and laid them in ſuch a place</hi> (ſhe told her where) <hi>and you ſhall ſee his natural humane form reſtored him, and he ſhall be your Spouſe, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy commanded him, having appeared to him in the ſame poſture and habit you now behold me. And that you may have no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of theſe my words, as ſoon as you awake, go to ſuch a place of your garden, where you ſhall find a ſtone, which you ſhall break, and within you ſhall finde a key of Treaſure, my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band put into your Fathers hands to keep for</hi> Joel. <hi>In uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may you both live long:</hi> And with theſe words ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and vaniſhed. The Lady affrighted wakes, and with a ſuddain ſhreek wakes her mother, who ſuddainly ranne to know the matter, to whom <hi>Eugenia</hi> relating her apparition, the Mother ſoon called Prince <hi>Joel</hi> to remembrance, how about his nine or ten yeares of age, by the malice of his Mother-in-law, he was loſt, no one knew how. Hereupon they both em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Ape <hi>Joel,</hi> who had received the ſame viſion, and was as 'twere out of countenance to be ſo indulged by theſe Ladies, to whoſe hands he paid his kiſſes, but chiefly to his dear and beſt affected <hi>Eugenia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Together they went then to councel what was to be done in this conjuncture, that they might not be liable to the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prince <hi>Aman Sophar.</hi> The Mother thought beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reaſſumed his ſhape by vertue of the intended <hi>Bath,</hi> that he ſhould return to his brother, and after ſome dayes of himſelf get away, and then they would adviſe of what was to follow; But in the firſt place they fetched the ſtone in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and putting it in a ſtrong fire, as they were directed by the viſion, it burſt, and they found a key, and deſcending three ſteps in a little Arch, they found a door, which they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the key, and found a great iron cheſt, with a Maſſe of Jewels, and Treaſure, with ſome notes of what <hi>Joels</hi> Father deſired after his deceaſe. This done, <hi>Ozania</hi>'s mother led back the Ape to <hi>Aman,</hi> acknowledging her obligation, for that the Ape had recovered her daughter. <hi>Joel</hi> then ſtayed ſome dayes at Court performing his wonted offices, and application, and as he went one day to gather ſome fruit for the children, the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98515:139"/>
peeviſh Gardener threw a ſtone at his face, which fetcht ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bloud: upon this hurt he preſently run away, and was ſeen no more at Court, for which all were much troubled; <hi>Aman</hi> cauſed him to be ſought for, but they could find him no where, not with <hi>Ozania</hi> her ſelf. This while the Ape lay cloſe in a buſh, til at night he ſtole ſecretly to the Ladies houſe to his fair Miſtreſſe, who ſuffered torments for him. There he found the bath in readineſſe, and being in it 'twas an admiration to behold how the ſkin which maſked him over, no ſooner felt the heat of the water and vertue of the herbs, but it diſſolved to nothing like a miſt, chaſed by the wind, or diſſipated by the Sun.</p>
               <p>They then cloathed the Prince in ſplendid and rich apparell, and the Ladies entertained and feaſted him with an exceſſe of joy, which he embraced with an affectionate tenderneſſe, all three weeping for joy of ſo ſuddain and unhop'd for a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The joy was generally through the houſe, they to whom the ſecret was undiſcovered, ſuppoſed him to be ſome young Lord, kinſman to the Lady who called him Nephew. Then they entred into conſultation what courſe was beſt, but Prince <hi>Joel</hi> in the firſt place, would aſſure his faith to fair <hi>Ozania,</hi> to whom he promiſed ſolemn Matrimony in fit time and place. After this they peruſed ſeriouſly the Teſtament of Prince <hi>Roſtan Sofar,</hi> father to <hi>Joel,</hi> who in preference of <hi>Joel,</hi> had diſpoſed him all his treaſure, and the dominion of <hi>Chaſubir.</hi> To his ſecond Son he had given the Seniory of <hi>Sanat,</hi> and other Territories, with other ſubſequent diſpoſals.</p>
               <p>All this they found ſigned and ratified by their Soveraign Lord and Emperour, the Grand <hi>Negus,</hi> for they found diverſe letters, many rich preſents, amongſt which a cimeter with curious hangers. Now Chriſtians of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> rites, they celebrate the marriage 'twixt <hi>Joel</hi> and <hi>Eugenia</hi> in the open Church. And after ſome dayes of felicity, they were of advice, that before he diſcovered himſelf to <hi>Aman Sofar</hi> his beſt way would be to make his addreſſe to the Emperour of the <hi>Abiſſins,</hi> that by his authority he might have reſtitution made him of the eſtate and treaſure left him by the laſt will and diſpoſition of his Father, poſſeſſed for ſo long time by his Brother.</p>
               <p>In proſecution of this reſolve, he took his voyage in an ample and magnificent equipage, and came to <hi>Barra,</hi> where the Court then lay, then having erected his Pavillions he advanced to the Palace gate, and having cauſed the trumpets ſound according to cuſtom, two principall Noblemen conducted him to the Princes preſence, where plac'd on his knees, in few words he delivered the ſtory of his fortunes.</p>
               <p>The Emperour with extream wonder called him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, how he was loſt in his youth, and that rumour went,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98515:140"/>
his Mother-in-law had cauſed him to be ſtrangled and caſt into a River; how ſhe had been called to Court, to anſwer theſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and could hardly juſtifie her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Joel</hi> brought moſt rich Preſents to his Majeſty, in a veſſel of gold, amongſt the reſt, a delicate Clock with weights to it, a moſt rich collar with a ſtone inchaſed, of admirable vertue to ſtanch bloud, as was experienc'd upon a goat, which they wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in three ſeverall places, and not a drop of bloud iſſued. The Emperour received <hi>Joel</hi> and his Preſents with indulgements, and deſired his Lady who was come in company with him ſhould viſit the Queen, who received her with exceeding kindneſſes. The Emperour was ſeated on a Throne, under a Canopy, with large curtains, called there a <hi>Mandilate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Princeſſe <hi>Ozania</hi> preſented the Queen with chains of corrall, a croſſe of rich Rubies, a Chryſtall looking-glaſſe, ſet in a fine Emerald, and other beautifull preſents out of the Treaſury of <hi>Joels</hi> father.</p>
               <p>The cuſtomary Ceremonies of the preſents performed, the Emperour at the requeſt of <hi>Joel,</hi> diſpatched a <hi>Calſena,</hi> to ſummon <hi>Aman Sofar</hi> to come anſwer the matter at Court, which ſtrangely amazed him, both for the demande and re-appearance of his brother <hi>Joel,</hi> whom he thought dead long before.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding to Court he came with all diligence, and found the <hi>Negus</hi> removed many dayes journey from the place, where <hi>Joel</hi> found him at firſt, for the Court reſides not above three daies in one place, by reaſon of the numerous train which followes the Prince, and at that time was in the Province of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anamora,</hi> a Countrey of <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who were in rebellion for their impoſts or cuſtoms. Aſſoon as <hi>Aman</hi> arrived, he pitched his Tents, and before he preſented himſelf to the Emperour, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for <hi>Joels</hi> quarter, who having intelligence of his arrivall, though the elder Brother prevented him with a viſit, and knew him exactly, whereas the other had not of him the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Nevertheleſſe at firſt ſight, as right bloud cannot diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he ſaw his Fathers face in <hi>Joel</hi>'s, and his heart melting, he fell at his knees, and wept. <hi>Joel</hi> raiſed him up, kiſſed him, and with mutuall embraces gave demonſtration of joy and affection, then ſupped together.</p>
               <p>Supper ended, <hi>Aman</hi> with exemplar deference aſſured his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ambitioned not to detain any thing from him that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to him, but preferring his love before all worldly wealth, ſince by divine providence he was returned, after ſo long an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, wherein all gave him loſt, with a free heart he ſurrendred all he poſſeſſed into his hands, beſeeching he would have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on him and his children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joel</hi> embraced him upon the ſame, and told him he would
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98515:140"/>
ſhare ſo with him, that he ſhould reſt content, and he deſired to live with him in peace and amity: Then ſhewed him his Fathers Teſtament, which was to regulate them both, wherewith <hi>Aman</hi> was exceedingly ſatisfied, onely he had a little regret for his Brothers matching with <hi>Ozania</hi> as inferiour to his quality, beſide that he had an opinion ſhe uſed ſome ſurprizall or art to gain his brother; for the preſent nevertheleſſe he diſſembled it, eſpecially upon <hi>Joels</hi> relating the hiſtory of his life and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and recovery of his form, manifeſting the obligation he had to this good Lady was ſo great, he could do no leſſe than marry her daughter.</p>
               <p>Hereupon they reſolved to go together to the Palace, through the middle of the Army or Court, which is ranked in Pavillions, as a fair ſtrong Town in ſtreets and publick places.</p>
               <p>Then with accuſtomed ceremony they tendered their reverence to the Emperour, to whom they ſignified the agreement and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable accommodation betwixt them, wherewith he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pleaſed; and looking on the ſword by <hi>Joels</hi> ſide, he told him he knew it to be the ſword he heretofore ſent his Father, and if he would employ it in his ſervice, he ſhould loſe neither time nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Then he called for two battle-axes for horſemen of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temper, and perfection, enriched with precious ſtones, in ſcabbards of ſilver guilt, then drawing them out, told them he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired they would both keep them in remembrance of him, and that at the Palace gate ſtood two horſes ready ſadled, which he gave them, and exhorted them to live in peace and fraternall love. The <hi>Negus</hi> gave moreover to <hi>Joel,</hi> in requital of his Preſents, two Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants loaded with Matirals, a kind of ſilver money not ſtamp'd in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> for there they make no ſort of coin: one of which <hi>Joel</hi> gave to his brother, together with the burthen. Likewiſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs when <hi>Ozania</hi> or <hi>Eugenia</hi> came to receive her diſmiſſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her a chain of fair pearls, of an exceeding ſize, and a pair of ear-pendants, of rubies which to the eye were two coals of fire.</p>
               <p>Having parted with the Court they ſent all their baggage by land, to return the ſame way they came, and went them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Vangot,</hi> and thence upon <hi>Zambre,</hi> cut their voyage ſhorter by the half.</p>
               <p>At their arrivall <hi>Joel</hi> was welcomed with the joy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of all the Countrey, and <hi>Aman</hi> ſurrendred into his hands all that he poſſeſſed of his till that time, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe Seniories that were allotted him: And <hi>Joel</hi> had by <hi>Ozania</hi> two ſons, <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Aman,</hi> who ſucceeded after his death.</p>
               <p>Here ye have the Tragie-Comedie, I mean the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and afterwards happie adventures of Prince <hi>Joel,</hi> who during his Apes life ſuffered all ſorts of miſeries, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Victuals with a thouſand hazards and troubles, often

brought to events the laſt, with hunger, thirſt, cold and heat, wandring through forreſts and deſerts, often expoſed to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of weather, but more to the malice of men, who proclaim a moſt mortall war againſt theſe creatures, for ſpoyling gardens, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging their trees before the fruit be ripe, and committing many outrages on their poultry, connies, and domeſtick fowl, for which cauſe they purſue them with ſtones, bows, and guns: So as he was forced to uſe his beſt providence and dexterity to evade theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences: and told his Mother-in-law <hi>Iſania,</hi> he was often conſtrained to live on rats, moles, mice, ſnakes, worms, and other vermine, to prevent dying for hunger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſania</hi> enjoying now a perfect tranquillity, took great delight to hear the particulars of the afflicted life her Son led during his transformation, and captivity. This life being properly a moſt cruell ſlavery, when Magicians ſhall have power to transform a humane body, contrary to his conſent and will. And indeed he affirmed, it often brought him into ſtrange deſpairs, even to caſt himſelf from ſome precipice. So as one day being in this furious reſolution, another huge black Ape came to him, and leading him to a dark deep well, perſwaded him to leap into it, but terrified with the vacuity and darkneſſe, he retired; then a pure white bird came to him, who freed him from this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and led him to a place where he found a pocket full of bread to ſatisfie his hunger. Again he related, how following on a time a beaſt he ſaw at ſome diſtance, it brought him at length to an aſſembly of people of all ſexes and ages, dancing to muſick with their faces outwards: amongſt the reſt he ſaw a nurſe of his, who beſtowed a garment on him, for then he conceived he was returned to his priſtine ſhape of man. That in the midſt of all this he ſaw a Beare to whom all theſe people made adoration, and that the nurſe perſwaded him to do the like, aſſuring him this Lord was infinitely power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and could reſtore him to his eſtate and dominions, and give him all ſorts of content and pleaſure, upon condition he would do him homage as others did. But as a Chriſtian, he had a horrour of it.</p>
               <p>In apprehenſion he ſaw Tables brought in, and covered with all ſorts of dainties, whereof they all eat, and he amongſt the reſt, but thought the meat very ill dreſſed, and of an unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury taſte. In the end all vaniſhed, and he ſtaid behind like an Ape as before, and in a vaſt ſolitude, whence he had much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to get forth.</p>
               <p>Telling this ſtory, dame <hi>Iſania</hi> much admired to hear that <hi>Joels</hi> nurſe who was her kinſwoman ſhould frequent Magicians Sabbaths, and reſolved to ſearch the truth. Whereupon they went to viſit her, for ſhe lived not farre off, and found 'twas truth, as the poor wretch confeſſed her ſelfe;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98515:141"/>
and <hi>Joel</hi> was of ſuch abilities, that by argument and eloquence, he reduced her to the right way, leaving that life of abomination, and went to S. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> one of the moſt celebrated Churches of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the chief reſidence of their <hi>Abuma</hi> or Patriarch, of whom with penance and contrition, ſhe received abſolution, and was exorciſed together with a ſon of hers, whom ſhe had ſeduced to this accurſed ſodality.</p>
               <p>Her neighbours adde, that there were about her certain marks where her fleſh was inſenſible of pinching or piercing, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our witches here, which ſhews the devil is every where the ſame. In ſumme, their memorials in particular relate this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Joel</hi> for a truth, which I had alſo by relation from the people.</p>
               <p>'Tis no ſmall difficulty, how theſe transformations can be made by the work of the devil; for though ſacred hiſtory mention the like of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Emperour, that was done by the plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary power of the Almighty, and if the devil do the like,<note place="margin">See if this may be, in S <hi>Aug. l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 18. <hi>De civitate Dei.</hi>
                  </note> 'tis but by meer illuſion, or by applying Actives to Paſſives, and this no further then he hath permiſſion from his ſoveraign Maſter, who executes his juſt and ſecret judgements, how, and when he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>We have plenty of examples both ancient and modern of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropolychi,</hi> or men turned to Wolves, whether really, or in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance only by diſtracted fancies, which doubtleſſe is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way Magicians transform themſelves into ſeveral ſorts of beaſts: and theſe <hi>Anthropolychi</hi> have been known to come into Villages, and divers women and children have been murthered by them, and that their teeth were ſhort like a mans. I my ſelfe was preſent, when my aſſociate <hi>Caſſis</hi> apprehended himſelf tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to an horſe at <hi>Tranſiana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In reference to what I have ſaid, I remember at the great <hi>Caire,</hi> I ſaw a Jugler or Magician rather, by name <hi>Harafit,</hi> who had an Aſſe would do ſtrange and ſupernatural feats, and many opinion'd 'twas a young man ſo chang'd to get money, which they call <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabit,</hi> and the beaſt underſtood both the word and the matter very well.</p>
               <p>For my part I thought him to be ſome reaſonable creature, or at leaſt ſome beaſt poſſeſſed and agitated by a <hi>Demon</hi>; for amongſt other things he had judgement to diſtinguiſh the faireſt woman in the company, though they go all as 'twere maſked and covered with an Huke that hides their face, and a thouſand other tricks, far beyond what I ſaw of the famous horſe <hi>Morace</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> long agoe.</p>
               <p>Some would go further, and have it to be the Magicians own proper ſon: ſo as the Clark of our ſhip, another, and my ſelf, out of curioſity would needs go ſee this Mountebank at his ſtation at <hi>Brillac,</hi> on the other ſide <hi>Nile</hi>; where having wound him up with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98515:142"/>
good chear, and given him a handſome piece of money to unlock his ſecret, the Clark told him if he would transform a young Grecian they had redeemed out of ſlavery, they would give him an hundred <hi>Sequins,</hi> for they had a deſign to make a benefit by ſelling him to the King of <hi>France,</hi> whereto he conſented, and promiſed to effect it, ſo that he who was to own the Aſſe and the Grecian both, would renounce their Faith: and hereupon ſhewed him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Figures for that purpoſe, in every of which, there was one name of theſe ſeven principal <hi>Demons,</hi> and a book wherein there were moſt funeſtous and execrable things. But with horrour we were ſatisfied with the diſcovery of ſo much wickedneſſe, and left him.</p>
               <p>As concerning the <hi>Androlychi,</hi> I have not heard of any thing ſo ſtrange, as that the Governour of <hi>Bagaris</hi> related one day to me. He told me, that going with ſome of his company from <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac</hi> to <hi>Montpelier,</hi> they overtook an old man with a ſack on his ſhoulders, going a great pace towards the ſame town, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the company out of charity told him, if he would, one of his ſervants to eaſe him, ſhould carry his burthen for him, at firſt he ſeemed unwilling to be troubleſome, but at length accepted the offer, and a ſervant of the Commanders chamber called <hi>Nicholas</hi> took the burthen, and being late, every one doubled his pace, that they might get in in good time, telling the good old man, they would goe before, and he ſhould finde them at the <hi>White-horſe.</hi> The ſervant of the Chamber coming in with the firſt, had a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to ſee what was in the ſack, where he found a Wolfs ſkin, ſo properly accommodated for the purpoſe, that he had a ſtrong fancy to diſguiſe himſelfe in it: whereupon he got it on his back, and put his head within the head-piece of the ſkin, as 'twere to ſhew his Maſter a Maſkarade, but immediately a fury ſeized him, that in the Hall where they ſupped, he made ſtrait to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at table, and falling on them with teeth and nailes, made a dangerous rude havock, and hurt two or three of them, ſo as the ſervants and others fled to their ſwords, and ſo plyed the Wolf with wounds, that they laid him on the ground, and hurt in ſeveral places. But as they looked upon him, they were amazed when they ſaw under the ſkin a poor youth wallowing in blood. They were fain to lay him preſently on a bed, taking order for his wounds and hurts, whereof he was covered; and was long before he could be cured: but this cured him of the like curioſity againſt another time. The company by this means had but a bad ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſupper, and many of them were ſick either of hurt or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. For the old man Wolf, 'twas not known what became of him, but 'tis probable, that hearing of this tydie accident, he was cautious to appear.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Of the Deſert <hi>Beniermi,</hi> and the Townes <hi>Dangala, Machida, Georgia,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>IN this Navigation, which I have interrupted for this prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſtory, we met with a countryman upon a Mare, who went aboard a <hi>Bark,</hi> to croſſe the river to the Province of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fila:</hi> but the man never obſerved a Colt that followed him, and leapt into the water to come after his damme, which the man ſeeing, he beſought the Pilot to turn back and take him in, but the Pilot would not be perſwaded, ſo as he was conſtrained to leap into the water himſelf to ſave the Colt: But had not we by good fortune been at hand to help him, the poor man and his Colt had periſhed together, the violence of the water carrying them both away. Being in ſafety, he was ſo amazed and out of breath, that he was not able to ſpeak us thanks: But he told us afterwards his Maſter made him pay for the Colt, becauſe he had not tyed him faſt.</p>
               <p>After this, for four long houres we cut through a Deſert, they call <hi>Beniermi,</hi> where we ſaw ſeveral kindes of wild beaſts; amongſt the reſt two Lions lying in a ſhade, with their muzzles all bloody; they ſtirred not at all at the ſight of us, though ſome were afraid, they would have leapt into the <hi>Bark</hi> upon us. But others better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, aſſured us no, except they were diſturbed; for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and generous nature of the beaſt, who are only dangerous to thoſe that hurt them. Joyning upon theſe deſerts, we ſaw fair till'd fields, ſome ſow'd with Lupines and Beans, others with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Canes.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Miſen</hi> we reſted there one day, then about two miles further we had ſight of <hi>Cafa</hi> a gentile town, and paſſing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the country, we went on ſhore at a gallant town on the coaſt of <hi>Nubia,</hi> they call <hi>Hami,</hi> to take in Melons and Potatoes, the beſt of the world.</p>
               <p>And from thence ſteer'd towards <hi>Dangala</hi> a very good town; but bearing ſo much upon the land, our <hi>Almadie</hi> was ſo faſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd, we were forced to unload our goods, which hinder'd us at leaſt two hours, and made us lye at <hi>Biſen,</hi> four leagues ſhort of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala,</hi> whither we went on the morrow in the company of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual rain, thunder, and lightenings: which was the cauſe we could not go on the other ſide of <hi>Nile,</hi> to ſee <hi>Dafila</hi> the chief town of the Province of the ſame denomination, where one of the gallanteſt, and moſt valiant Princes of the <hi>Neguſian</hi> Empire reigns.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Dangala,</hi> 'tis ſubject to <hi>Barnagus,</hi> who at firſt had it in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98515:143"/>
exchange for <hi>Caſſina,</hi> and ſince hath both by help of money. 'Tis in <hi>Nubia</hi> the oppoſite of the Province of <hi>Dafila,</hi> which extends as far as <hi>Danfila.</hi> Thence in five dayes we came to <hi>Mara,</hi> a neat town, oppoſite to the Province of <hi>Ganfila,</hi> on the other ſide of <hi>Nile.</hi> The country is well peopled, and plentiful of all commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; amongſt the reſt there is a mine of the fineſt ſilver. Thence in two days to <hi>Bergan,</hi> and in one more to <hi>Tiruti,</hi> a town abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things, but very dirty. On the other ſide of <hi>Nile</hi> is <hi>Gourage</hi> in the kingdom of <hi>Tamatas.</hi> Then in two dayes ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen leagues to <hi>Daerue,</hi> where there is a mine of Lead and Antimony, whereof they make great profit, ſending their mettals every where, they mixe braſſe in their money and call it <hi>Cazec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We had the pleaſure there to ſee a morall repreſentation of the <hi>Magdabens</hi> converſion, which was full of delight and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thence we had a deſire to walk under the ſhades to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chida,</hi> a town they will have to be built by the Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> who was ſo called; and they told us we ſhould ſee in the Church a very antique ſtatue of this Queen; but being arrived, we ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ruines of a town, which nevertheleſſe ſhewed, that in times paſt they had been ſomething of noble. For there we ſaw the ruines of a Caſtle, which we muſt needs judge to have been a place of great ſtrength, for that all the avenues were of difficult acceſſe. The day following we went to <hi>Fuingi</hi> or <hi>Fungi,</hi> and thence in four dayes to <hi>Rifa,</hi> then to <hi>Sania, Aſmona, Canan, Aſna,</hi> where there is a Caſtle called <hi>Aſiar.</hi> Some will have it, that the ancient, and ſo much renowned town of <hi>Siena,</hi> was there ſcituated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under the Tropick on this ſide. Thence in four dayes to <hi>Banaa</hi>; and on the other ſidetowards the red ſea is <hi>Georgian,</hi> a town inhabited by <hi>Georgian</hi> Chriſtians, who have licence with fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing banners from the Turk, to viſit the Sepulcher at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> without paying Toles, or Impoſts, as others do. They recount a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle upon theſe people, when they were once perſecuted by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell King, Almighty God covered the enemies with a continual darkneſſe, whereby they were delivered: upon which ſubject the <hi>Arabian</hi> great Poet and Hiſtorian, wrote ſome verſes. But I have heard others ſay, 'tis the ſame that happened to the countrey of <hi>Georgiane</hi> or <hi>Albania</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> the greater, in a part thereof called <hi>Bonhainſon,</hi> where the Chriſtians were purſued by <hi>Saure</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> a Mahometan, and being reduced to ſave themſelves by flight, he invironed them with his forces, in which extremities they had recourſe to their prayers, and an obſcurity came over the King and all his, whereby the Chriſtians had means to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Some ſay that a darkneſſe ever ſince continued in that part of the countrey, and that no man dare come upon the ground, and that the cries of men, and neighing of horſes are continually to be heard, without knowing any ground for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:98515:143"/>Having ſtaid one day in the Town of <hi>Georgian,</hi> or <hi>Georgia,</hi> on the other ſide, we paſſed in two dayes to the town of <hi>Erir,</hi> thence to <hi>Coſia,</hi> then repaſſing <hi>Nile</hi> we came to <hi>Pemin,</hi> the firſt Town of high-<hi>Egypt:</hi> Here they are all <hi>Moores,</hi> but yet people of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and very courteous to us. Thence we went to complement the <hi>Sultan,</hi> or Governour of the Town of <hi>Almona,</hi> and to have his paſſe, becauſe we were to enter into a Countrey all Infidels, and ſubject to the Grand <hi>Sinior.</hi> The <hi>Sultan</hi> favoured us with many teſtimonies of affection, and ſent by a Frigot to the other ſide of <hi>Nile,</hi> to a garden in the Town of <hi>Tima</hi> for fruit for us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others Peaches of extraordinary ſize without ſtones, but not ſo ſweet nor good as ours in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thence in two daies we came to <hi>Grandole,</hi> a very Mercantile Town, and in two dayes more to <hi>Manucat,</hi> a great Town of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a thouſand fires; but about a league from thence there is one more large and fair, called <hi>Bazuelle,</hi> or <hi>Bazielle,</hi> which was heretofore eſteemed the Suburbs of <hi>Caire.</hi> Here are the moſt ſumptuous Moſquees of all <hi>Egypt,</hi> which they call <hi>Gemit Azore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Leon.

They recount many fabulous miracles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, one of the reſurrection of a dead perſon, pretended in the time of <hi>Soudan Saladin,</hi> who had a ſervant called <hi>Aliaze,</hi> married to a fair and rich young maid, but ſhe behav'd her ſelf ſo ill towards him, that her love was fixed on another object, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in deſpair he complained to the Cherif, or Prieſt of the <hi>Moſquee.</hi> This Cherif bade him be of comfort, and adviſed him for ſome dayes to conceale himſelf, to ſee how his wife would take it.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Cherif viſited his wife, and enquired moſt earneſtly of her huſband, telling her if he were dead or loſt, through her occaſion, ſhe was damn'd without hope: being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled hereat, ſhe told him ſhe had not ſeen him of fifteen or ſixteen dayes, and that ſhe was much afflicted for his abſence, but that ſhe would make a vow to God and the Prophet, if ſhe could have him again ſhe would be more dutifull to him. At the ſame time, by fortune, there was taken up the body of a young man who was drowned in <hi>Nile,</hi> ſo disfigured that he could not be known. The <hi>Cherif</hi> taking this opportunity, and having conferred with her huſband, they concluded to take his body, and cloathing it in a ſuit of his, and putting his ring on his finger, lay him in the <hi>Moſquee,</hi> covered with a cloth, and ſay 'twas the corps of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans huſband, which was done, and the woman hearing the news went preſently, and knowing the cloaths and the ring, fell into a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98515:144"/>
moſt paſſionate lamentation, whereupon the Prieſt to comfort her told her, that on condition ſhe would make a 9. dayes viſit in the <hi>Moſquee,</hi> the moſt bleſſed Prophet would reſtore her huſband to life, and told her ſomething of a certain viſion he had, while he ſaid the office of the dead. In brief, with ſubtlety and authority he ſo prevailed with her, that in the morning ſhe went to the <hi>Moſquee</hi> to make her prayers and ſacrifice, to this purpoſe, upon the Tomb where the <hi>Cherif</hi> the night before had hidden her huſband; and then the egregious Prieſt pronounc'd his conjurations over the dead, that in the name of the great God, their Prophet and Saint, he ſhould riſe and comfort his diſconſolate relict: which was no ſooner ſaid, but the good fellow began to ſtir, and cryed out, behold I am here: then the <hi>Cherif</hi> rejoycing opened the monument, and out marches the huſband, who embrac'd his wife, overcome with joy for ſo great a miracle, which was blown immediately through the world, and ever ſince this <hi>Moſquee</hi> hath been devoutly frequented where every one makes their vows, to obtain their wiſhes: and theſe are the goodly miracles of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Truebalm <hi>Pe Mar.</hi> in his <hi>Lega. babil.</hi> l. 3. who ſayes 'tis in the year 1502 this plant was loſt.</note> and Chriſtians <hi>Materea.</hi> This plant hath a leaf like <hi>Lentisk,</hi> or Maſtick tree, which they prune every year as a vine, as a Gardener told me, who kept it, 'tis but ſmall, and there is but little of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſay the Queen of <hi>Saba</hi> carried this plant to <hi>Salomon</hi> who cauſed it to be ſet in the gardens of <hi>Jericho,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was tranſplanted to this place by the <hi>Sarazins</hi>; but others ſay that 'twas firſt brought from <hi>Arabia</hi> the happie, where all the balm that grows there at this day, is of like vertue and quality.</p>
               <p>About the end of <hi>May</hi> they ſlit the bark, not with iron, but ſomething elſe, and the liquor diſtills out, which they receive in a glaſſe. They adde that this plant will proſper with none but Chriſtians, and that it dyes in the hands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>

The <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſay when the bleſſed virgin was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſhe reſted at this fountain, and here waſhed the linnens of her child <hi>Jeſus.</hi> A little on one ſide is an Iſland, with a fair Palace, where the <hi>Baſcha</hi> goes ſometimes for recreation, 'tis called <hi>Michial.</hi> Here lies the head of the Channell, or Aqueduct, on which there ſtands a <hi>Column,</hi> to foreknow the fertility or ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility of the year, according to the heighth of the inundation of <hi>Nile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Part of <hi>Caire</hi> which lies upon <hi>Nile</hi> is very large, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Boubacon,</hi> or <hi>Bebeſoe,</hi> and <hi>Boulac,</hi> here land the veſſels which come from <hi>Roſete,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and other parts.</p>
               <p>In ſum, this Town conſiſts of many more Towns, or Burroughs, or Suburbs, full of people, and I believe in this Town there are as many ſouls, as in all the reſt of <hi>Egypt</hi> throughout; and he had need of a good horſe that would ſurvey all theſe habitations, in two, nay in three dayes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſha</hi>'s Palace is the ſame where the <hi>Soudans</hi> was, and that while the Empire was in glory, was one of the moſt rich and magnificent in the Univerſe, as a <hi>French</hi> Authour deſcribes it who was there in thoſe times: There being many Courts, every one with a guard, Porches, Galleries, and Columns of <hi>Martle,</hi> guilt vaults, various-coloured pavements of <hi>Moſaick</hi> work, frets, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and ſculptures, pleaſant large gardens, fountains, viviaries, bird-cages, and other ſingularities: All ſorts of rich moveables, ſtones, gold and ſilver. The <hi>Calife</hi> or <hi>Soudan</hi> had a throne of maſſy gold, and rarely was ſeen to any except Embaſſadours.</p>
               <p>The Ladies for the greateſt part are attired in white, with coats, and a maſk of the ſame colour, a ſilk ſmock of diverſe colours, a little bonnet on their head, of ſome rich ſtuffe, with a band or wreath about it, and over all a large veſt or huke, which covers the whole body.</p>
               <p>Touching the Inundation of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> it advances mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, not doing any dammage: and when it comes they make a generall triumph; then they run at the veſt, a certain game of prize amongſt them, and prepare ditches expreſly to receive the water, certain perſons being ſubſtituted of purpoſe, who aſcend four or five dayes journey towards the Channell, to ſee if the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters flow with vigour and violence, and thence return with poſte-haſte, and acquaint the <hi>Baſha</hi> to what degree; and when there is notice that 'tis arrived within half a dayes journey, the <hi>Baſcha</hi> with the whole Nobility mounts on horſeback, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in their apparell, with the robe of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> born by a <hi>Marabou,</hi> in great triumph before them; and by the way, running the Maſſe, ſhooting with a Bow at a golden apple upon the end of a Pike. Firſt they ride three or four rings, then running at high ſpeed in a full career, they let fly at the apple, and he who do's beſt bears away the prize.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:98515:145"/>And ſo they ſolemnize the arrival of the flood, every one clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and prepares their ceſterns, to ſtore up water for the whole year; for they have neither draw-wells nor fountains, that ever I ſaw: and it never rains there, only every evening there falls a dew, ſuch as if one ſhould ſleep abroad, he ſhould be as wet, as if he came out of the River. The like is in <hi>Peru,</hi> where they never have rain. But inſtead thereof, they are viſited with a wind that fannes and moyſtens.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Paraguary,</hi> or the River <hi>de la Plata</hi> at <hi>Brazill,</hi> hath the like inundations as <hi>Nile,</hi> but with more violence and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and lodges full three moneths upon the land it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereas <hi>Nile</hi> comes quietly, and retires with the ſame ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, not ſtaying before any town above 15. or 20. dayes. They contrive to build their houſes upon hills, and riſing grounds, to ſecure themſelves from waters and humidity: In the countrey, the houſes for the greater part are built of loom, of beaſt-dung, and earth, and there are ſome which have no other then tents of ſtrong cloth of a reddiſh colour; but they who live near the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver River by reaſon of the impetuous ſtream of the water which overturns, and carries all before it, are conſtrained to forſake their houſes, and for a time betake themſelves to their <hi>Canoes,</hi> where they lead the Ducks life, till the flood retiring within its bounds, leaves their dwellings to their poſſeſſion again: But I am not certain if this happen by a conſtant annual courſe as in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The cuſtome of triumphs at the arrival of the inundation of <hi>Nile,</hi> we finde to have been amongſt the ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> amongſt others they celebrated the great feaſt of <hi>Niloa</hi> towards the Summer-Solſtice, holding the River for a God, whom they worſhipped under the names of <hi>Oſiris</hi> and <hi>Orus,</hi> giving him the appellations of the Saviour of high <hi>Egypt,</hi> Father and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the lower, who water'd and manur'd their ſoyle. Now for the Crocodile, there are great ſtore in this River, as there are in many other places of the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> call them <hi>Caymans,</hi> they have ſo luſtful a greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to Mans-fleſh, that they will venture for it with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able outrage and vigour. A man walking by the River ſide with a little child in his hand, a Crocodile leaps ſuddenly upon him, and tore the boy out of his armes, not being able to ſave him. If any one by chance fall in the water, there's an end of him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis exceeding dangerous to refreſh or bathe there without good caution; the very boats loaded with people have often pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by them. Theſe creatures generally make cleare work, their aſſaults being ſo forcible, that from ſome they crop armes and legges, others they devoure intirely: They hold a fierce and rude war with the Tigars, 'tis a creature without tongue, moving only the other chop, contrary to the nature of all other creatures;

the <hi>Egyptians</hi> made him a part of their Idolatry. Some obſerve that they were not pernicious to the countrey hertofore, as they have been particularly ſince the Mahometans uſurped it. Again, ſome ſay the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ountrey hath been much the more infeſted with theſe creatures, ſince a Governour of <hi>Egypt</hi> deprived them of a leaden Crocodile placed by enchantment, like a <hi>Taliſman,</hi> in a certain place.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Caire</hi> down towards the ſea, they are not ſo dangerous, as in the higher <hi>Egypt.</hi> Beſides <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> this River breeds <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popotumes,</hi> or <hi>Sea-horſer,</hi> with divers other Monſters and Fiſhes.</p>
               <p>About four leagues from <hi>Caire,</hi> and one and a halfe off <hi>Nile,</hi> ſtand the famous Pyramids of ſo prodigious a height, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtructure, erected heretofore by the ancient Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> either for oſtentation and monument of their greatneſſe and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, or for cuſtody of their treaſure, or for ſepulture of their bodies. This ſtructure is by ſo much the more ſtupendious, for that the ſtones of ſuch immenſity and hardneſſe were traſported ſo far with ſuch coſt and pains, as ſome ſay from <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia:</hi> and theſe bulks not rear'd to that height, with Cranes, Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, or other Engines as then not known, but by Cavaliers, and Platforms of earth, by ſtrength of arms, and extremity of labour, as 'tis related of the wonderful edifice of <hi>Jugas,</hi> of <hi>Perou</hi> at <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio</hi> and other places. 'Tis not without wonder to be conſider'd, that the greateſt of the three which, as they ſay, was erected by <hi>Chemmis</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the employment of 360. thouſand mens labour for twenty years together, is at this day perfect and entire, though three thouſand years ſince the raiſing of it. They ſay on every ſide of the ſquare near the <hi>Baſis,</hi> it is 200. fathomes over, and 800. foot high; 'tis hollow, and within there are walks, and a fair room where the Sepulcher may be. The other two are leſſe and Maſſie, one built by King <hi>Cophus,</hi> the other by <hi>Mycerine,</hi> or the Curtiſan <hi>Bhodope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The bulk of theſe ſtructures hath put them in the number of the ſeven wonders of the world, and ſome ſay the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were employed at the building of theſe enormious Fabricks. There is yet to be ſeen ſome remainder of a monſter, wonderfull both in form and quantity, which they call a Sphinx wrought in Numidian or Serpentine marble extraordinary hard, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane face, and the body of a Lyon, as the ancients repreſented this monſter. There is yet left a kind of <hi>Obeliske</hi> or Needle, the work likewiſe of the Ancients, which ſome attribute to King <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> others to <hi>Philadelphe</hi>; Howſoever thoſe great <hi>Obelisks</hi> which are at this day at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks.</note> were brought from thence; as the <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick</hi> letters engraved upon them teſtify; for 'twas the holy and ſacred Scripture of the ancient <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſide off thoſe Pyramids beyond <hi>Nile</hi> Eaſtward towards the red Sea, lyes the famous countrey called <hi>Ehebaida,</hi> and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98515:146"/>
where ſo many Chriſtian Hermits and Anchorites lead their lives, as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and others, adorned heretofore with ſo many Towns, filled with religious communities, where there were more Monaſteries and Churches, then other houſes, and no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner where one might not hear day and night the Almighties prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Amongſt the reſt 'tis ſaid of <hi>Oxininchus,</hi> that at the ſame time had in it ten thouſand religious men, and as many women, who with emulation kept a marvellous hoſpitality for poor tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers and ſtrangers. Here in <hi>Thebaida</hi> flouriſhed heretofore the famous town of <hi>Thebes,</hi> with a hundred Ports, nothing whereof remaines but ruines.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide Weſtward lye the Deſerts of <hi>Barea,</hi> towards <hi>Barbary</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> where was the celebrated Temple and Oracle of <hi>Ammon,</hi> viſited by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. In brief, all <hi>Egypt</hi> is ſurrounded with Deſerts, and Sands, except on the Sea coaſt. For on the Weſt they had deſerts of fifteen dayes over, on the Eaſt the <hi>Thebaidan</hi> deſerts for three or four dayes up to the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Gulph: Then on the other ſide the red ſea, the great deſert as far as <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were forty years, of many dayes travail over.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Caire</hi> to <hi>Delbequi,</hi> 'tis all Deſert, where <hi>Mummy</hi> is found,<note place="margin">Mummie.</note> or bodies dried in the Sand. Of it there is another ſort, which is of embalmed bodies found in ancient Sepulchers.</p>
               <p>Theſe Deſerts are above 18. or 20. dayes over, and they who travail them, ride upon Cammels in Wainſcot cabbins for the great duſt and heat, with ſmall holes for ayre and light, where they both eat and ſleep. For there is no greater danger then the winds in that place, bearing and removing mountains of ſand from one ſide to the other, under which Paſſengers are often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, and loſt (as heretofore whole Armies have been) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt poſſibility of aſſiſtance to one another in the convoy, which ſometimes conſiſts of ten or twelve thouſand perſons and more, every one ſtriving to ſave himſelfe, and go with the greateſt ſpeed they can without ſtay night or day, there being no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to know a track, though one ſhould have paſſed a thouſand times, by reaſon of the continual variation of the ſand, which lyes to day in one manner, to morrow in another; ſo as through this ſea of ſand they muſt uſe their Pilot and compaſſe, without hope of refreſhment during the journey, onely about fifteen leagues from <hi>Delbegut,</hi> where a fair fountain proceeds from a neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring river, which is thought to be an arm of <hi>Nile,</hi> the water whereof is warm like <hi>Niles,</hi> but ſomething better. Afterwards they muſt again paſſe over Deſerts and dangerous moveable mountains of ſand, which put me in mind of the gray Tents or <hi>Adonars</hi>; with the Moores of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocca,</hi> which you ſhall ſee in a numerous heap upon a field, and on the morrow no ſuch thing, but removed to another ſtation: for ſo it is with theſe

walking mountaines day by day ſtill in motion, differing from a mountain of ſand of exceſſive height; I ſaw ſince near the Town of <hi>Lima</hi> or of <hi>Rois</hi> in <hi>Poru,</hi> which exalting to an extraordinary height amongſt many other hills, never alters or diminiſhes for any wind or ſtorm that can aſſault it; a thing much admired by all men, and for this the <hi>Indians</hi> adore it as divine; but of this we ſhall with Gods leave ſpeak in another tract of a voyage to the Weſt-Indies. But returning to the ſands of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 'tis thence the greateſt part of <hi>Mummy</hi> or fleſh buried and roſted in the ſand is gotten, which the wind uncovering, the next paſſenger brings to town for trade, it being very medicinable. Here you ſee a dead man is often more ſerviceable to the living, then the living them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet ſome approve not of the phyſick: But howſoever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed fleſh is prefer'd before it, for the Aromatick drugs the <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſed for preſervation of dead bodies, wherein they were at great charge and ſtudy, whether for their hope of reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or for the opinion of ſome Philoſophers, that ſoules ſhould ſo long live after departure, as the bodies remain intire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt: for which cauſe they ſeaſoned and embalmed them with Bitumen, Salt, Frankincenſe, Myrrhe, and other Aromaticks; and bodies thus embalmed and preſerved for many ages, by the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> are called <hi>Mummies.</hi> To proceed, the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renowned for a very potent and wealthy kingdom, where ſome ſay heretofore have been reckoned 20. thouſand wall'd towns, to entertain the infinite multitude of Inhabitants ſhe had in thoſe dayes: but now there remaines but little of all this. The firſt Kings of the world were their Rulers, from whom they derive their lines of ſo many thouſand fabulous years. Their firſt and kings were called in the Scripture by the generall name of <hi>Pharoes,</hi> then the <hi>Perſians</hi> became their Maſters, afterwards the Greeks, then at laſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> till the <hi>Saracins</hi> got them under their <hi>Califes</hi> and <hi>Soudans,</hi> and the Turks for this laſt age. The ayre is good and temperate, the ſoyle fertile, and abounding in all commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but ſo plentiful of corn, that 'twas held the Granary of <hi>Rome</hi> in her chiefeſt glory: in medals of antiquity, <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſtill figur'd with ears of corn.</p>
               <p>The country about <hi>Caire</hi> they call <hi>Sabida,</hi> heretofore <hi>Sais,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> taken together <hi>Chibib,</hi> in <hi>Heibrew Mitfraim</hi> by the name of the ſon of <hi>Chus</hi> who firſt poſſeſſed it, thence the <hi>Arabians</hi> at this day call it <hi>Meſre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The region called <hi>Delta</hi> from the triangular form, is the fertile part of it, becauſe 'tis water'd, and cut through by ſeven branches or armes of <hi>Nile</hi>; This country is exceeding fertile throughout; but the reſt from <hi>Caire</hi> to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> is not ſo, but only along the <hi>Nile</hi> for three or four leagues on each ſide, where the river flows, the reſt is ſandy, parched and waſte, except ſome places where the river comes in channels, which they ſay were heretofore the work of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſon of <hi>Jacob.</hi>

               <p>WE ſtaid ſome dayes at Grand <hi>Caire,</hi> where in the advance of my voyage I ſtaid many moneths; but before I go away, I will tell you how we met there with a brother of my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Guillen Caſſis,</hi> whom he had ſo baſely abuſed at our coming from <hi>Meca,</hi> as I ſaid in another place, when he cheated him of ſeven Cammels, under colour to go to traffick in the red ſea and <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> and we paſſed into <hi>Arabia</hi> the happy, to <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Eaſt <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> where in all we were forth in our travailes ſix years and a halfe. But as ſoon as he perceived at a diſtance his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Marat,</hi> he got ſlily into a company, that his brother might not take notice of him; at length he paſſed by us, with a fixed eye, but ſaid nothing, no one thinking of him; for my part I knew him not, yet me thought I had ſeen him before, till at laſt I called him to mind, and told the whole ſtory to our company, who condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for an unworthy action. In fine, the good fellow by this means ſcap'd a bad encounter.</p>
               <p>Being departed from Grand <hi>Caire</hi> we went to embarke in our <hi>Almadies</hi> which ſtaid for us at <hi>Boulac,</hi> which is the Rendezvous of all Merchants, Chriſtians, and others, who are bound for <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi> Thence we came in a day and a half to <hi>Auas,</hi> where we met with my friend who had made all ſpeed for fear of his brother. From <hi>Auas</hi> we came in a day and a half to <hi>Rouſette,</hi> called by the natives <hi>Raſchill,</hi> a town by the ancients called <hi>Metilis,</hi> or <hi>Canapus,</hi> upon an arm of <hi>Nile</hi> called <hi>Heraclettick,</hi> which Hiſtorians call <hi>Rexi.</hi> At <hi>Rouſſetta</hi> we ſold our <hi>Almadies,</hi> and imbarked by night in a <hi>Germe,</hi> and the next day were in <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

               <p>Having ſtayed ſome dayes in <hi>Alxandria,</hi> we departed for <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Suria,</hi> without accompliſhing my vow to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for which I had gone ſo much ground, and there we went aboard the <hi>Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>Marſels,</hi> and were five monthes intire before we could arrive there, for that having touched upon <hi>Malta,</hi> we ſtayed ſome time to ſee the ſports of their <hi>Carnavalle,</hi> which ſtayed us awhile. By the way it happened that the Saylers having rifled a little veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Greek wine, drunk ſo freely, that one of them amongſt the reſt, climbing the Maſt to do his office, knowing his own condition tyed himſelf for fear of falling, and lay down in the ſcuttle, where he ſlept two dayes before he waked. In the mean time, the others calling for him to come to dinner, and not hearing any anſwer, they apprehended they had heard ſomething fall into the ſea the night before, which made a great noyſe, and that 'twas the poor Marriner, who was drowned in his drink, whereupon the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the ſhip rung the bell thrice; then, as the cuſtom is, threw a fire-brand into the ſea, and ſaid aloud, <hi>Gentlemen Mariners, pray to God for the ſoul of poor</hi> Veran (that was his name) becauſe <hi>through Gods mercy, he reſts with the ſoules of the faithful.</hi> Then every one kneeling down prayed for him, then preſently what goods he had were inventoried, and prized. But the day following, the Maſter of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98515:148"/>
the ſhip, whoſe name was <hi>Pier de Soulier</hi> for diſcovery of the land; like a careful Marriner, climbed the Maſte himſelf, but he was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, when he found there the ſuppoſed dead man faſt tyed, and yet in a profound ſleep; but upon the Maſters call, he awaked ſuddenly, which made the company very merry. That night we lay upon a dangerous ſea, and feared we were upon the <hi>Aſquequi,</hi> or <hi>Seques,</hi> which towards the land is a bad bottome,<note place="margin">Seques Sbelus <hi>heretofore</hi> Syrtes.</note> that which made us judge of it, was certaine Moſſe ſwimming upon the water, which hangs to the rocks, which made us very apprehenſive. In the evening a huge Whale followed us as the Pilot told us, who had diſcovered him, and at laſt minding to leave us, as he turned, bruſhed ſo rudely upon the ſhip, that it ſhook all over, as it had daſhed againſt a rock. At the inſtant every man affrighted, cryed out for mercy, ſuppoſing we were loſt, for we were in the middle of a vaſt ſea, where there was no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſafety. The Maſter preſently ran to the Hold, to ſee if the ſhip were founder'd; on the other ſide the Pilot from the Poupe diſcovered the monſtrous fiſh had left us, and was gone with a hideous noyſe, ſo as we were ſafe, and by Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe freed of a deſperate fear.</p>
               <p>After ſome dayes ſayling on, we came to touch at <hi>Malta,</hi> and being Shrovetide, we reſolved to ſtay awhile to ſee the celebration of this feaſt, and there we put off ſome pieces of fine cloth, which they call <hi>Calicut,</hi> but the miſchief was, that the Courtizans, of which they have there very ſubtle ones, had good ſhare of them, cheating us of ſome crowns under colour of treating us at our own coſt.</p>
               <p>Of this Iſland I will ſay no more, then that at this day 'tis the Reſidence of the Knights Hoſpitallers of S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the year 1134. in the time of <hi>Baldouin</hi> of <hi>Bourgos</hi> the third <hi>French</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the ſecurity of them who went to the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> and in the year 1309. their great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Villaret</hi> took by force of Armes the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> from the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who uſurpt it from the Greek Empire, and there eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht the Reſidence of his Order, and maintained it ſtoutly againſt the many attempts of the <hi>Soldans</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi>; but in the year 1522. Turk <hi>Soliman</hi> carried it from the great Maſter <hi>Philip Villers,</hi> and by the licenſe of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, this great Maſter with his order retired to <hi>Viterbo</hi> till better times; and divers places being propounded for their Reſidence, as <hi>Saſda</hi> in <hi>Candia, Serigo, Elba,</hi> and others: in concluſion they reſolved to petition <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth for <hi>Malta,</hi> to whom it belonged, as dependant on the kingdome of <hi>Sicily</hi>; againſt the <hi>French, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> who would have had no ſuch obligation to the Emperour, but at length they conſented, becauſe it had good Havens, and was near to <hi>Barbary</hi>; ſo they got <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Goza,</hi> in the year 1529. without other tribute or condition, then a ſolemne
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98515:149"/>
Maſſe annually, and a Falcon every yeare to the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> but withall that they ſhould have free tranſport of corne from <hi>Sicily.</hi> This in effect was more advantage to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> then the other Nations of Chriſtendome, the Iſle of <hi>Malta</hi> being a guard to all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Coaſts under his dominion.</p>
               <p>The Order at firſt was divided by ſeven Languages, three of <hi>France,</hi> which were <hi>France, Avernia,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> then of <hi>Italy, Germany, England,</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Afterwards an eighth was added, <hi>Spain</hi> being divided into <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> being left out, they took in <hi>Aragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe eight Languages, every one had two Electours for election of the Grand Maſter. Theſe Grand Maſters have for the greater part been <hi>French,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Order conſiſts of our <hi>French</hi> Nobility, but I ſhall ſpeak no more of it, being a matter ſo generally known.</p>
               <p>Having left <hi>Malta,</hi> we ſet ſayle for <hi>Marſells,</hi> where we landed within few dayes, ſetting a period to that long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which had coſt us ſo much time, paines and danger; God be glorified who guided us to ſo ſafe a Port, at the time of the great Commet, whoſe extent was thirty degrees, the taile pointing to the Weſt, embracing <hi>Sagittarius</hi> and <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne,</hi> and appeared not in the Sublunary Region, but the Celeſtial, ſo as 'twas ſeen throughout the Indies both Eaſt and Weſt. But I cannot omit to relate how, when I came to my Fathers houſe, who was then ſixty five yeares of age he knew me not, but thought me dead, and had made my funeral ſix years before: ſo as ſeeing me in the Greek habit, he took me for ſome ſtranger, and asking me who I was, I anſwered him in language barbarous enough, I was a Grecian, and 'twas but truth, I had almoſt forgot my native language, being very young when I left my countrey, and for that I had diſcontinued it ſo long time. Some vulgar Greek I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, which I learnt at <hi>Canea</hi> in <hi>Candia,</hi> where I ſtaid ſix or ſeven moneths after our firſt ſhipw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ack.</p>
               <p>Then my Father who ſpoke good Greek, having traffick'd a long time in that country, aſked me what was my buſineſſe, and telling him I came to dine with him, he told me I was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and bad me draw near the fire, as I did. Then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded who, and of whence I was, and telling him I was a <hi>Marſellian,</hi> the ſonne of one <hi>Raphael Blanc,</hi> he was amazed, and troubled, and calling my mother, told her a ſon of his was come from <hi>Sicily</hi> to viſit him, my father having had a former wife in <hi>Sicily,</hi> by whom he had two children, who lived there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their mothers means: whereupon they both afforded me great indulgements; but at length I declared my ſelf to them, and then there was amongſt us ſuch a tyde of tenderneſſes, there was not
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98515:149"/>
room for words, nor could we contain our tears of joy. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I related to them at leaſure the ſtrange and various adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of my voyage, ſhewing them divers curioſities I had brought along with me, amongſt others, <hi>Aſbeſte</hi> linnen, which is made clean with firing, being incombuſtible linnen, uſed by <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, and Lords, and are wrapt in it when their bodies are committed to the pile, as the bodies of <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours were in ancient time. I have often ſhewed the experience of it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality in <hi>Provence.</hi> I ſhewed them the herb <hi>Falacit,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this property, that laying it under a bed all thoſe loathſome <hi>Chemiſſes</hi> worms ſtock to it, and ſo are killed. I brought it in a box, but I was ill adviſed, I brought not the ſeed to plant in theſe parts. I ſhewed them divers other things of ſingularity, admired by many both of knowledge and quality. But before I conclude I ſhall tell you in order, to this re-acknowledgement of my Father and Mother, Brothers and Siſters, what long after happened to me at <hi>Palerma</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> after my Father was dead.</p>
               <p>For calling to mind he had often told me he had a Son and Daughter there, I made diligent enquiry for them: at firſt no one could tell any thing of them, for that they were called by their Mothers name, whoſe heirs they were; and my Brother who was called <hi>Nazaro Bianco,</hi> was called onely <hi>de Nazara</hi>; but at length I enquired by ſo many tokens that I found out his houſe, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither I was told he was ſick, which hindered me not, but I went confidently up into the Chamber, meeting a young maid upon the ſtairs, blood which cannot lye, told me that muſt needs be my Siſter: nevertheleſſe without further notice, deſiring to ſee her Brother, ſhe led me to his Chamber, and ſeating me near the bed where he lay, I obſerved in him the very pattern of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſking if he had not Brothers at <hi>Marſeills,</hi> he told me yea, and aſked if I knew them: whereupon many diſcourſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> paſſed, telling him divers news and recommendations.</p>
               <p>During our diſcourſe, this Siſter of mine looked ſtedfaſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, as ſhe were raviſhed to ſee and hear me, and I preſenting my hand to her, ſhe kiſſed hers, and took mine, a thing not uſuall in <hi>Italy,</hi> and leſſe in <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon my Brother having cauſed a little daughter of his to be brought in, I kiſſed her hand as I did my Siſters, and taking a ring off my finger of an orientall fauſet emerald, one of the beſt I ever ſaw, I preſented it to her, wherewith ſhe was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and in doubt whether ſhe ſhould take it or no; but tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her her Uncle ſent it her by me, with leave of her Mother who was preſent, ſhe accepted it; and at the ſame inſtant I gave a fair table Rubie to my Siſter. But as we were in the middle of theſe complements and diſcourſe of our friends, who ſhould come into the chamber with a <hi>French</hi> garb and alacrity, but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Baſtide,</hi> nephew to the grand Prior of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> and

other Cavaliers my friends, who knowing I was there came to ſeek me, and by their calling upon my name my Brother and Siſter knew me, and confeſſed they had ſome ſuſpicion of me when I gave the rings: my Siſter told me at the inſtant ſhe met me on the ſtairs, ſhe felt ſomething extraordinary, which made the colour riſe in her face. Then we fell to embraces and rejoyces, like the <hi>American</hi> women, who when they will bid their friends welcom, ſit on the ground and weep, and entertain them, embrace, and feaſt them weeping. So I ſtaid there ſome ſix weeks in jollity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation with my friends. I was willing to relate this paſſage, as well to ſhew the various encounters of mans life, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of bloud which will diſcover it ſelf be it never ſo concealed and unknown.</p>

               <p>BUt let us come back to my return to <hi>Marſeills,</hi> where I felt the cuſtom of change to be of no ſmall force, which was ſo prevalent with me, that I had ſcarce reſted ſix moneths there, but I grew weary, finding neither the air, cuſtoms, nor man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living agreeable, I was ſo moulded to change and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.</p>
               <p>As this inquietude poſſeſſed me, it happened fortunately that one <hi>Don Guillerm</hi> paſſed by <hi>Marſeills,</hi> ſent by <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour or Agent to <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Marocco,</hi> and being very much a friend to my Father, dining one day at our houſe, he heard me ſpeaking of my travails, and was pleaſed with my converſation; he aſked me if I would go along in his company: And I was in a humour ſo well diſpoſed that I accepted very willingly, ſo he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained me. This <hi>Don Guillerm</hi> was a Chirurgion born at <hi>Nice,</hi> who travailing to <hi>Marocca,</hi> was ſo happy as to cure the King of a peſtilence, with which he was viſited at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which brought him in great eſteem with the Prince; Inſomuch that he ſent him to treat of an alliance with King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him with preſents to <hi>Molouco</hi> and <hi>Abdelmelech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus agreed, we parted from <hi>Marſeills</hi> about ſixty in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98515:150"/>
company, and imbarked upon a well-arm'd veſſel, within ſix dayes we came by night near upon the ſtreight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> but the ſtream was ſo violent it held us back till day, and well-nigh caſt us on ſhore near the Tower called the Devils manſion, where no body ever lives: for they have a tradition that the maſter Maſon which built it, being not paid his price by him that ſet him on work, gave it to fiends who have kept it ever ſince.</p>
               <p>Being thus driven on ſhore, againſt the mount of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> as we endeavoured with ſtrength to ſhove her off, the veſſel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and the maſt and ſails lay in the water, which much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed us; but by happy fortune a Pilot of <hi>Marſeills, John Saffoulo,</hi> being aboard with us for his private affairs, ſeeing our danger, and that every one was fled to the other ſide the deck, fell to work and with an ax opening the ſide of the ſhip let in the water, ſo as the weight ſet her upright, and by Gods aſſiſtance we ſcaped this imminent danger, being driven by a gentle gale to a point where we caſt anchor.</p>
               <p>But notice hereof coming to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies, which lay at anchor not far thence, they ſent out preſently to take us and bring us to the Town of <hi>Gibraltar</hi>; while they were towing us along, we caſt into the Sea above two thouſand cannon bullets, and a great quantity of powder. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> hereupon accuſed us of treaſon, for carrying ammunition to their enemies, for they had found ſome barrels of powder which were left behind. Then coming aboard us, like right ravenous wolves they ranſack'd every where, ſeizing all the merchandizes, and opening the cheſts eat all that was good: amongſt the reſt ſearching a Phyſicians cheſt they found ſome purging lozanges, whereof ſome of them eat in great quantity, and found ſo ſudden an effect, they had ſcarce time to untie their breeches, whereof two or three died, ſaying, we had poyſoned them.</p>
               <p>Mean while they put Irons on our legs, and removed us into the Galley, with rude treatment and rough menaces, till at laſt ſentence paſſed upon us, by which the Embaſſadour, and ten of the chief Gentlemen were to looſe their heads, all the reſt to the Gallies for ever.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſadour hearing this ſad ſentence, appealed to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who confirmed the ſentence, ſaying no more than <hi>Loque es hecho es hecho.</hi> But by good fortune the <hi>Marſeillian</hi> Pilot that was with us, when he firſt ſaw the Galleys coming upon us, caſt himſelf privately into the Sea with ſome moneys, and ſo gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the land went to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and this in conſideration of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to whom he had promiſed his daughter in marriage. Being there, and underſtanding the King had ratified this ſentence of death; he addreſſed himſelf preſently to the moſt Serene <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta Donna Iſabella,</hi> and ſo handſomly laid before her the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences would enſue upon this execution, which was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98515:151"/>
to break the peace between the two kings; that ſhe moved with theſe reaſons, went immediately to the King her Father, to petition for grace, which was granted, and we releaſed, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of them who thought to make a good booty of us and our goods.</p>
               <p>Being now again Maſters of our lives, goods, and veſſel, after two months time, which was ſpent in theſe proceedings, we put to ſea again upon our courſe to <hi>Arache,</hi> a fort of importance in the kingdom of <hi>Fez,</hi> about 70. or 80. miles from <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> where there is a Port made by a River, as at <hi>Goa</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which is croſſed with a bar of ſand, ſo as there is no coming in but at high water, which is here every day, but at <hi>Goa</hi> you may expect a month. Coming on ſhore there we were very well entertained, and the Embaſſadour provided of horſes, and other neceſſaries to go to the King of <hi>Fez Abdelmelech,</hi> who was then in great vexation for that <hi>Mahomet</hi> his nephew, who diſputed with him for the kingdom, and whom he had defeated in many battails by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Turk,</hi> was newly ſcaped towards <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to crave his aid. Being come from <hi>Arache</hi> to <hi>Miguine</hi> ten leagues from <hi>Fez,</hi> ſeeing the Embaſſadour was to hold on his way to <hi>Morocca</hi> to the King, we reſolved four or five of us to go ſee <hi>Fez,</hi> the capital Town of the Countrey. Having walked through <hi>Meguine,</hi> beyond the Town we came to a Church-yard of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> where two of us making water, it happened to be near the Sepulcher of one of their <hi>Marabons,</hi> or <hi>Santons,</hi> and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſome of the <hi>Moores,</hi> they would have ſtopt us, but we defending our ſelves ſtoutly with fiſts and feet, I got out of their hands; but my heart failed when I ſaw fifty Archers of the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard about us, who paid me well for the blows I had given their fellows, for they beat me moſt outrageouſly, as they did the reſt of us, the very Children crying after me, <hi>Taraſti Nazarani,</hi> that is kill him, at every word calling me <hi>Quichequet,</hi> dog. At laſt I was brought before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> or Judge, to whom I kneeled, but he made me lye along on the ground, and gave me thirty laſhes on the back, with a whip of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>-ſinews, and as many bangs on the belly with an <hi>Indian</hi> cane, ſo that I was almoſt dead, with the blowes which had quite benum'd me; yet again for theſe threeſcore bangs I muſt pay as many miticales in gold, which are worth four franks a piece, after all they laid me in priſon, with another bath'd in blood at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Then they uſed all art poſſible to perſwade me to renounce my faith. Amongſt others came in one in ſcarlet, and under pretenſe of ſome compaſſion on my youth, ſpoke ſoftly in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> tongue, I ſhould be adviſed and have a care how I loſt my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Not content with this they ſent a young <hi>Spaniſh</hi> damſell to me cloathed in white, with a Huke which covered her all over, who after ſalutation, expreſſed her reſentment of my misfortune, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98515:151"/>
with ſome words of conſolation, told me ſhe was come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me how to ſave my ſelf from death, and to ſet her at liberty immediately. I bent my thoughts upon the woman, not as yet comprehending what ſhe meant, till ſhe explained further that I ſhould marry her, and renounce my faith for a time, and when the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> who was upon point to give battaile to the <hi>Marocco</hi> ſhould be victorious, we ſhould have means to eſcape amongſt the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe ingenuouſly, the words of this young maid made a ſtrong aſſault upon me, and made me take the matter into conſideration, but God gave me the grace to hold firme to my ſelf, and at laſt to ſatisfie her that neither for her beauty nor enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the world, would I ever renounce the faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> my God, ſo ſhe took her leave. But after this the Judges themſelves attended with the Executioner, with his heading-knife at his ſide, came to me, and ſpeaking to me, told me I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a hainous crime, but that there might be ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found, that we had all one God the Creatour of all things, and the benign common Father of all men, who had ſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Prophets for our inſtruction, and to ſhew us the way of ſalvation; but they having one more excellent than the reſt, they were obliged in all they could to augment the number of his Diſciples; ſo as to ſave my life there was no other way then by deniall of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> not that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed his law nefarious, for they knew he was likewiſe a great Prophet, the breath of the Almighty, and a great friend of <hi>Mahomet</hi>; but becauſe their law was the beſt and the moſt perfect.</p>
               <p>To this, God aſſiſting me with his extraordinary grace, I with courage anſwered, that rather then deviate voluntarily in the leaſt from my Religion, I would ſacrifice a thouſand lives if I were maſter of ſo many.</p>
               <p>Perceiving my conſtancy, they told me I was ill adviſed, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe to teſtifie their affection and conſideration of my youth, they would make me another offer which might conduce to the ſecuring of my life: whereupon there was a ſumptuous tapeſtry ſpread upon the floor, with rich bracelets and pendants of value, all this ſtirred me not; ſo as ſeeing they gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon me, the principall of them, the <hi>Ermin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ermin</hi> a Judge.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence of death, and at the inſtant the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ſeizing on me made me lay my head on a block of wood, and without further Ceremony with his weapon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in his hand prepared to give the blow: but as he was haſtening me to pull my doublet off that the collar might not hinder the blow; God inſpired one amongſt the reſt, that told them they committed an errour to cut me off being ſo young, for that 'twas againſt their Law to execute any one for
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98515:152"/>
that crime being under 17. years of age, and that they ought to inform themſelves preciſely of it: For in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> the ſevere law is, that whoſoever ſhall commit <hi>Formicat,</hi> that is, pollute a holy place, he ought not to be put to death, onely chaſtized with baſtinadoes, and abſolved.</p>
               <p>But this puniſhment was exceeding cruelly and fully inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me, for I ſtood the fury of a multitude, who in the inſtant came in, and aſking, <hi>Chate quei feuti houat Romi,</hi> that is, what hath this Chriſtian done, and being related, they ſaid, <hi>haley,</hi> that is, make room, then they all fell upon me, and laid on till they were weary, ſo much as a decrepid, horrid, ſqualid old man, who while he beſtowed his labour on me, told me, that as I had preſumed to piſſe upon the head of one that waited on their great Prophet, ſo after death the Saints ſhould ſhit upon my ſoule, which ſhould feed upon that ordure till the Judgement-day, and then be caſt into flames amongſt her fellowes. His opinion was approved of, but the execution ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>
               <p>Mean while my Companions were eſcaped ſeverall waies, and crept into caves, where one of them lived three dayes upon ſnailes, ſo as they could no waies help me. But my misfortune coming to the eares of ſome Chriſtian merchants, who lived in Town, they went immediately to ſupplicate the Judicature to have conſideration of my youth, that I was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman belonging to the Embaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the affront, and acquaint their Prince with it, whence incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences might accrew.</p>
               <p>They were not ſo moved with theſe reaſons, but ſome bribes muſt be given, ſo as the Merchants entring caution of a vaſt ſum with me, and obliging themſelves for my re-appearance when time ſhould be, I was ſet at liberty: Of all thoſe there was not one of my Countrey nor acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Being at large, I was quartered in a noble houſe, with a rich <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Merchant, who ſpared nothing for my recovery, out of this ſad eſtate.</p>
               <p>This Merchant, by name <hi>Andrieto Gaſparo,</hi> born in the Iſland of <hi>Corſa,</hi> had two Brothers at <hi>Marſeills,</hi> and knew my Father very well, to whom he gave ſpeedy intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of my misfortune, and received an anſwer with expreſſe order, to worke my delivery at what rate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Hereupon theſe worthy people adviſed together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſend two men to court on dromedaries, there called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cambal,</hi> which are beaſts of extraordinary velocity, that will go their hundred miles a day, with the principall Rider, and one to guide him, with their baggage and neceſſary proviſions for their journey.</p>
               <p>But by the way, the Riders had need be well ſwath'd back and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98515:152"/>
head for the extreme ſhakings they give the body, as likewiſe to have their ears well ſtopt, for being deafened with the hideous noyſe they make by the way. They diſpatched theſe two Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, one ſtrait to <hi>Marocca,</hi> whither 'twas reported the King was gone, the other <hi>Franciſco Maria</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> towards the Sea Coaſt to <hi>Alcaſſeur,</hi> where he met with <hi>Muley Moluco,</hi> to whom he was well known, and laying himſelf at his feet, related the proceedings to him. Whereupon the King cauſed the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>France</hi> who was there, to be called; in the end he reſolved to return this Meſſenger with all ſpeed, with order and command to the <hi>Ermin</hi> of <hi>Mequine,</hi> to diſcharge me without further cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Upon <hi>Eſtradiors</hi> return, he preſented theſe letters to <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and the reſt of the Judicature who received it with great ceremony and humilty, laying it upon their head, and ſo I had my freedome, and my life ſaved, with ſufficient marks to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and for the future be better adviſed at my coſt; for I felt the ſtripes longer after: and indeed this is the greateſt danger we ranne amongſt the Infidells. Beſides, it coſt me deere, for I was fain to preſent the Gentlemen of the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a barrell of Safron, and ſome Tapiſtry hangings for their curteſie, who afterwards in teſtimony of their Amity, ſent me to <hi>Fez</hi> a magnificent preſent of a fat ſheep, and ſome other comeſtible things, as biſquet, ſugar, cheeſe, and abundance of dates, and that was all I got.</p>
               <p>At my departure with theſe worthy Merchants, one of their wives called <hi>Cauſabonna,</hi> in return for a bladder of Muſk I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her, gave me ſix fine ſhirts, with caps, and handkerchers. At my return from <hi>Africa,</hi> going back for <hi>Arache</hi> this way, I failed not to viſit my good friends theſe Merchants, and was likewiſe to ſee the <hi>Ermin Mahomet Muſtapha,</hi> who by reaſon of my change of habit and countenance, at firſt knew me not; but afterwards gave me noble entertainment, for his heart was Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made us taſte his good wine, and eate with him, offering me gold, but I refuſed it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I muſt needs take them, ſaying they belonged to me; being ſome Duckets given him for the Mutton, and other things that were ſent to me, ſo as he made the account but even: which ſhews how juſt this man was.</p>
               <p>And he it was that in my ſuffering came to adviſe me to ſtand firm, and not renounce my faith, and religion. He had two wives of moſt perfect beauty, and he told me if any occaſion ſhould oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to draw him out of <hi>Barbary,</hi> he would embrace baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there being throughout theſe parts, no meanes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Chriſtian Religion, for I heard not one Maſſe ſo long as I was here, neither at <hi>Fez,</hi> nor other townes where there are abundance of Chriſtians. They will not allow of Prieſts, which is otherwiſe at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where there are above
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98515:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
twenty Churches, where they celebrate divine ſervice, both in <hi>Greek, Latine,</hi> and <hi>Abiſſinian,</hi> and is free exerciſe of Religion for all Chriſtians: and if the body of a Chriſtian be to be interred at any diſtance from thence, the Prieſts with the croſſe go publickly for it, and carry it whither they pleaſe, without the leaſt injury from any one, upon pain of being well puniſhed.</p>
               <p>During this progreſſe of affairs, King <hi>Mahomet</hi> had agitated ſo with <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that he was upon the march with a potent Army, and that many veſſels were already arrived at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zille, Oran, Tanger,</hi> and <hi>Cerote,</hi> forts on the <hi>African</hi> coaſt in the Chriſtians hands: whereof <hi>Muley Malouco</hi> being advertized, made diligent preparation, and firſt takes a march into the mountains againſt the <hi>Arabians,</hi> whom he diſtruſted to be of his nephews party. He took courſe to diſ-arm them totally, and diſabled them of ſixteen thouſand good horſes, for which he promiſed good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and mounted on them ſo many muſqueteers with red caps; thus ſecuring the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and blocking up all avenues that they might not come upon his back. By this means having raiſed an Army of ſixty thouſand horſe, he advanced to <hi>Alcaſſour,</hi> or <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſquinir,</hi> about fifteen leagues from <hi>Arache,</hi> with his Brother <hi>Muley Hamet. Don Sebaſtian</hi> on the other ſide appeared there with about ſixteen or eighteen thouſand horſe and foot, <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, Caſtillians, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 4. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the battaile was given, wherein the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> was ſlain, and his Army wholly defeated: <hi>Mahomet</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Arzille</hi> to ſave himſelf, was drowned, fording the River of <hi>Mucazen,</hi> which runs by <hi>Arache,</hi> though bravely mounted. Above twelve thouſand Chriſtians fell there, beſides many priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, amongſt whom were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>00. women, and 200. ſucking infants. I was my ſelf at this fight, with about threeſcore <hi>Marſeillians</hi> more, whereof few came off. <hi>Malouco</hi> dyed of ſickneſſe in his time of triumph, and his young Brother <hi>Muly Hamet</hi> ſucceeded, whoſe race continues to this day. I ſaw the body of the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> carried away in a cheſt, filled with unſlack'd lime to preſerve it, begged of King <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> by <hi>Andrietto Gaſparo Corſe,</hi> his great favourite, who ſent it to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> for which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent him a rich preſent in recompenſe, and interred it in the Church of <hi>Belen.</hi> 'Tis true, I underſtood ſince by ſome <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſlaves, that this was the body of a <hi>Swiſſe,</hi> and that the King being beaten from his Horſe eſcaped: and indeed ſome years after one appeared, who ſaid he was the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſhewed ſeverall teſtimonies, but howſoever he was executed in <hi>Spain</hi> as an Impoſtor, after ſo many who deſcribed this battle at large, and faithfully, I will content my ſelf to ſay onely what I ſaw. Thus then, the whole <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Cavalry being landed, drew up in two ſquadrons. <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Cordoua,</hi> Commander in chief of the one advanced towards <hi>Alcaſſar,</hi> where the <hi>Moores</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:98515:153"/>
attack'd them ſeverall times, and ſtanding obſtinately to their pikes broke their ranks, but the Chriſtians falling on with their piſtols, <hi>Azimut</hi> their Commander in chief was ſlain, then the reſt made no great reſiſtance, ſo as the <hi>Moores</hi> not uſed to this ſort of arms, fell into diſorder and fled, which put ſuch vanity in the Chriſtians, that they lay in the field, in hope to take <hi>Alcaſſar,</hi> five leagues from <hi>Arache,</hi> being both between two Rivers, a league diſtant one from another. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> to prevent ſurprizall by night, ſurrounded his Army with waggons, carts, baggage, utenſils barrels, and all the train of Artillery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Aluaro Perez</hi> led the Van, with five hundred horſe, and twelve hundred Landſquenets, guarded on the right with the River, on the left with pikes, barely armed with a corſlet, and a thouſand Muſqueteers in the head, who marched the faſter to get at ſome diſtance from the Army, to provoke the <hi>Moores</hi> to fall upon them with hope of being releived by ten thouſand <hi>Arabians</hi> under the command of <hi>Armabachi</hi> then with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> who ſuſpended to declare themſelves for hazarding their fortunes, wives, and children they knew not how, for they had intelligence how the King of <hi>Fez</hi> had drained their Countrey, and blocked up the avenues to hinder relief coming to his Nephew. Hereupon they made a ſtand, reſolving not to declare themſelves, advertiſing <hi>Soliman</hi> the ſon of <hi>Armabachi,</hi> that they would ſtand Neuters, till time ſhould adviſe them what to do, under the conduct of <hi>Amet Sarran,</hi> a prudent Commander, who had engaged to <hi>Malouco,</hi> that he would be ready at his command.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Courco Abrahin</hi> who led five thouſand <hi>Mooriſh</hi> horſe being young and gallant, ambitious to do ſomething of noble, ſent to <hi>Sarran,</hi> that if he would ſecond him he would give battaile, but <hi>Sarran</hi> anſwered 'twas no policy to attack an Army well rang'd and defended with Artillery, without more poſſibility: ſo that day he did nothing, onely four <hi>Moores</hi> well mounted made a bravado.</p>
               <p>I went along with one <hi>Hercules,</hi> a Cannoneer, and <hi>John Saſſello</hi> a <hi>Marſeillian,</hi> to view the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army, which was a noble proſpect, all we diſliked was the burthenſome number of women and children.</p>
               <p>The 13. of <hi>July, Aluarez</hi> about day break ſpied <hi>Courco Abrahin</hi> with his five thouſand <hi>Moores:</hi> and with a grand ſtratagem drew them under ſhot of all his Muſqueteers, and five field-pieces, that made a great ſlaughter. Theſe <hi>Moores</hi> were all defeated, and their Leader ſlain, to the great glory of <hi>Don Aluarez,</hi> and Captain <hi>Balliotin,</hi> Commander of the Lanſquenets, <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> view'd all the combat with exceeding delight, embraced <hi>Aluarez</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with victory, and gave him a rich Rubie in a Jewel, ſet round vvith diamonds, which he tied himſelf in his hat, and to <hi>Banaſtarin</hi> and to <hi>Baliotin</hi> Captains of the Lanſquenets, and Arquebuſiers, to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98515:154"/>
each a rich Diamond. The <hi>Mooriſh King</hi> gave likewiſe to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> his Cimeterre of an excellent temper, and a ſcabbard of great price. Of theſe five thouſand horſe, not above three hundred eſcaped; of Chriſtians, there dyed not above twenty, and fifty wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malouco</hi> hearing of this defeat was exceedingly troubled, and blam'd <hi>Sarran,</hi> that he came not in with relief. Hereupon he draws his Army towards the Sea ſide; but the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour adviſed him rather to take courſe with the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who had engaged to bring in to Mahomet fifty thouſand horſe, and to fall upon them before they got into a body. He accepted the Councell and marched againſt them, and put the country of <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſan</hi> and others to fire and ſword: The <hi>Arabians</hi> ſubmitted, and promiſed him all obedience, but he being cautious, and fearing their perfidiouſneſſe, took all their horſes, and left the men for the next harveſt, ſo with dexterity he prevented that danger.</p>
               <p>Thence he returned towards the Sea-coaſt, and began already to be ill diſpoſed, which proceeded from exceſſive conſtipation or Melancholy: from the beginning of his ſickneſſe he never came on horſe-back, but went ever in his Littar. He was a benigne and courteous Prince, affectionate to his friends, without ſtate or diſtance, ſpeaking affably to them, and rendring ſalutes with great civility. But on the other ſide he was cruell to his enemies, in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice rigorous, but chiefly to ſuch as injured the Sutlers, as to a boy who putting his hand into a pannier, ſtole three dates, the Sutler complaining, he cauſed three of his fingers to be cut off. Some who had intention to turn to Mahomet, he made them be ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a Cannon, and fire ſet to it.</p>
               <p>The fourth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at that time when the prodigious Planet menaced <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Marocca,</hi> the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> having made his prayers, and received a benediction from the Biſhop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimbria,</hi> mounted on a white horſe capariſon'd with gold and green, of about five and twenty years of age, with ſomething a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing noſe, a good ſtature, his lip a little hanging, went through all the Army, to animate and encourage the ſouldiers. Some ſay the Biſhop of <hi>Conimbria</hi> dreamed the night before, that the battel was loſt, and that they were all ſlaves, as it came to paſſe; and that upon this alone he ſent his treaſure, and all things he had of value to <hi>Arzille,</hi> which ſerved for his ranſom afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malouco</hi> the ſame day about eleven in the fore-noon, left his Littar and mounted on horſe-back, veſted in a rich robe of cloth of gold, wrought with a folliage, a Cimeterre at his ſide, his ſaddle ſet over with precious ſtones, and thus went from rank to rank, encouraging his men to combat. His Army marched in good order like a half-creſſent, drums of the <hi>Moriſco</hi> very ſmall, beat, and the Fifes founded a ſhriller ſound then the Trumpet. 'Twas thought the battels ſhould have been given on Sunday the third, but 'twas
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98515:154"/>
defer'd to the fourth, and <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> were adviſed to ſtay battel till the approach of night, becauſe the <hi>Arabians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to come over to them, and leave <hi>Malouco,</hi> which proved falſe, and they were ſo diſappointed. King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was armed, as the day before, in green Armes, upon a white horſe one of the beſt in <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Moores</hi> Army was rampar'd on the left hand with the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> thought himſelf ſure of the <hi>Arabians</hi> aſſiſtance, and ſpecially of <hi>Melouco's</hi> Van-guard, which was all of <hi>Arabians,</hi> and for this reaſon ſtayed till night, that they might not be perceived. 'Twas in a field of above two large leagues every way, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tree or ſtone. Before the Van-guard marched, the Light-horſe-men mounted on the <hi>Arabians</hi> horſes, compoſing the point of the Creſſent, and were wholly cut off with the Cannon. The <hi>Arabians</hi> ſeeing this rout, thought good to do the like; but not perceiving a man of the other Battalia's fall, they ſet a good face on it, by force <hi>Muley Hammet</hi> being at hand to inſtigate them. The battail at length grew hot, and the <hi>Arabians</hi> performed nothing of what they had promiſed: <hi>Molouco</hi> employed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining houres of his life in giving order for victory: The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> and the <hi>Moor</hi> remained on the ground as well as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louco,</hi> the one ſlain, the other drowned, and the third dead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity in his Littar, <hi>Hamet</hi> remaining only victorious, and heire of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> did wonders in his own perſon, but overpowred with number, he hung his handkercher on the point of a lance in token of yeilding, but the raſcally <hi>Moores</hi> ignorant of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, run upon him, and thoſe that ſtood with him, and put them all to the Sword. The ſlaughter was great, but chiefly of thoſe who went along with the baggage, who were as many or more then all the Army.</p>
               <p>There were ſome mingled themſelves amongſt the dead, to ſave their lives. 'Twas ſad to ſee 200. ſucking children, and above 800. women, boyes, and girles, who followed father and mother, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inhabit this country, who had loaded chains and cords to fetter the <hi>Moores,</hi> and ſerved for the Chriſtians themſelves, of whom there are 17. thouſand priſoners, the two hundred infants, and the eight hundred women not reckon'd. As to the kingdom of <hi>Fez</hi> or <hi>Marocca,</hi> heretofore <hi>Mauritania,</hi> or <hi>Tingitania,</hi> 'tis of vaſt extent, and amongſt others hath the two potent towns of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Marocca.</hi>

               <p>This River is divided into two channels, one towards the South, which waters <hi>Fez</hi> the new, the other towards the Weſt, water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fez</hi> the old, beſides divers fountains which creep through Subterranean channels.</p>
               <p>The houſes for the greateſt part are of brick, with Towres and Tarraſſes, where the women prune themſelves in the evening, for they ſeldom ſtirr abroad. There are <hi>Moſquees</hi> of fair building with their <hi>Marabouts</hi> for their ſervice; the Principall called <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimen</hi> is of as large circumference as the Town of <hi>Arles,</hi> with 31. principall gates, ſuſtained by 38. large Arches in length, and 20. in breadth, every night 900. lamps are lighted, and on feſtivall dayes, as in their <hi>Romadan,</hi> the feaſt of S. <hi>John,</hi> the Nativity of our Lord, more Lamps without number upon braſſe candleſticks, where after Mid-night they ſing Mattens. Sixty leagues from hence is <hi>Marocca</hi> chief of all other kingdomes under that Empire, as <hi>Hea, Ducalea, Guſula, Haſcora</hi> and <hi>Trelle:</hi> as <hi>Fez</hi> hath under it, <hi>Teſmenia, Aſgar, Flabat, Errif, Garet, Eſcaus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Town was built, or rather augmented by a Prince, called <hi>Manſor</hi> in the year 1024. ſcituate in a Plain invironed with Date-trees. He built there a Magnificent <hi>Moſquee</hi>; there is the high tower with three Spires, on which ſtand three balls of gold, of twenty thouſand <hi>Miticales,</hi> or two hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five pounds weight a piece, <hi>Muley Malouco</hi> would have had them for his warres, but the Inhabitants would not permit him, whereupon the <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> that came from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <hi>Malouco,</hi> made ſome Muſquet ſhot, and pierced them in divers places. He promiſed them that after a time he would ſet the like there again, but the others anſwered, if he ſhould dye, all was loſt; as his great Grand-father who ſold the foundation rents of the Hoſpitall of <hi>Fez,</hi> and dyed before he could reſtore them, ſo as 'twas loſt to the poor.</p>

                  <hi>Lybia</hi> is of great extent, and <hi>Numidia</hi> larger.

               <p>We leave the Deſert of <hi>Goſde</hi> on the right hand for the numbers of fierce beaſts that reſort thither: then to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of <hi>Gir,</hi> which on the North confines on <hi>Tuas, Tegerin</hi> and <hi>Dameſab,</hi> which hath the kingdome of <hi>Agades</hi> on the South, a countrey plentifull of Herbage, Fountaines, and Manna, which they uſe much in their Diet, and Potta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; they have ſuch abundance of it, it renders them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtrong and agile, they likewiſe, boyled with water,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98515:156"/>
make drink of it. They are ſubjects to the King of <hi>Tombur,</hi> and border upon <hi>Cano</hi> another kingdome tributary to <hi>Tombur.</hi> The people are all black as pitch. Near the Town of of <hi>Maſar</hi> in <hi>Arabia Salban,</hi> there was once a Gulph of the Sea. There was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a Temple dedicated to <hi>Venus,</hi> where maids did proſtitute themſelves for pleaſure or profit, they report: but a famous Courtiſan, beautiful and rich, by name <hi>Ameliga,</hi> being court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by divers Princes and great perſons, would accept of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them, only obliging them to give ſomething to the poor, uſing theſe words, <hi>Honour the Goddeſſe</hi> Ameliza <hi>to whom you offer this</hi>; which made her famous through all <hi>Africa,</hi> ſo as they came from very forrain parts to ſee her, and the King of <hi>Bodumal</hi> ſued to have her to wife, which ſhe refuſed: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others there was a <hi>Maraban</hi> who viſiting her, erected a magnificent Temple to her, which was immediately fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented with a concourſe of people, and everyone repair'd thither to obtain their deſire, provided they were able of member, otherwiſe 'twas not to be looked for. The People of <hi>Guiner, Tombur,</hi> and others were of this devotion. The Prieſts of the Temple received the word, and render'd them at certain houres.</p>
               <p>For the kingdome of <hi>Melli</hi> 'tis very wealthy, by reaſon 'tis cut through with the black river or <hi>Senega,</hi> or a branch of it, or rather a channell made by hand, ſo as 'tis very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Dates, Raiſins, Cotton, and other commodities; for 'tis ſaid this River flowes as <hi>Nile</hi> does, and at the ſame houres: They have abundance of <hi>Canoes,</hi> or boats of one piece, in which they travaile upon their little negotiations, paſſing from king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to kingdome, moved out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Jonas,</hi> who they ſay came on ſhore there. They make great benefit of Whales, and believe no Whale can paſſe that way without burſting.</p>
               <p>An ancient Gentleman of <hi>Siban</hi> told me, that in the yeare one thouſand five hundred ſeventy one, walking on the ſhore, he ſaw three great Whales, which being entered the Gulph, made a moſt horrid noyſe, and on the morrow one of them was caſt up with his belly ſlit, as it had been done with a knife, the other two were carried away with the ſtreame of the water. Whether this be a miracle or magick, I will not judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melli</hi> borders upon <hi>Gago</hi>; and <hi>Gago</hi> is the better countrey of the two, and though <hi>Melli</hi> have the better townes, yet the other is of much more eſteem for many things, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the quantity of gold, brought thither by the <hi>Moores</hi> from all parts, and this gold is very exquiſite, whereof they make moſt part of their pieces of a crown and halfe, which they call <hi>Miticales.</hi> But <hi>Melly</hi> hath the glory from all her
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98515:157"/>
neighbours for a fair Colledge of their Prophet <hi>Haly,</hi> where all the other kingdomes come to ſtudy the Sciences: there being many learned Doctors of their kind. Thither for this purpoſe repaires the youth of <hi>Cambre,</hi> the chief town of <hi>Tambur,</hi> as alſo from <hi>Gago</hi> and other place. <hi>Gago</hi> is a Town of great traffick where there is a great Mart for pepper, and ſlaves of all parts of Chriſtendom, whom they employ in Mines, there being ſome who for avarice bring their own children for this purpoſe. <hi>Gago</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Eaſtward on <hi>Cober,</hi> and the capital towns of theſe two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are 200. leagues diſtant. They are alſo under the inundation of <hi>Niger,</hi> which manures the countrey, and makes it plentifull in cattle, and proviſions: the reaſon the people apply themſelves more to huſbandry then ſtudy, and ſo are groſſe and ruſtick. Weſtward from thence lyes the great <hi>Cape Serrelyonne,</hi> on the Eaſt the kingdome of <hi>Agades,</hi> then <hi>Cano, Zegeg,</hi> which breeds ſuch ſtore of horſe, then <hi>Zanfara</hi> and <hi>Guangara</hi> Northward, whoſe King hath a Guard of 7000. men, foot and horſe, with bowes and Cimeterres. Then comes <hi>Borro</hi> which runs above five hundred miles Eaſtward, having on the South the Deſerts of <hi>Get,</hi> and on the North thoſe of <hi>Barea.</hi> They are a brutiſh people, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their wives in common. Towards the <hi>Piroc</hi> are the Deſerts of <hi>Goran,</hi> towards <hi>Ethiopia</hi>: there are people in abundance, and a party of <hi>Giloſes,</hi> who come thither by reaſon of a ſedition, and a party from <hi>Zenega</hi> who came thither by reaſon that a daughter of the king of <hi>Azangues</hi> being married to the King of <hi>Gambra,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was no maid, repudiated her, whereof aroſe great warres amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Temeſne</hi> ſay they were the Founders of <hi>Marocca,</hi> they uſe a finer language then others, which they call <hi>Aquela Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig,</hi> that is, the noble language, the other kingdomes of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> ſpeaking but a rude language in compariſon. Another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sigay,</hi> which goes in the kingdomes of <hi>Galatas, Tombut,</hi> and <hi>Guinée, Meli, Gago</hi> different from the reſt: another at <hi>Juber,</hi> which cannot be written, becauſe of the gutturall pronunciation, and goes as far as <hi>Cana</hi> and <hi>Caſena:</hi> Again at <hi>Hea, Gangara, Borne,</hi> they uſe other languages. At <hi>Sena, Terga, Gueziga,</hi> and <hi>Lenta,</hi> they expreſſe themſelves well, ſomething like the <hi>African,</hi> and pronounce in the throat, but diſtinctly. They are much contented to ſee a ſtranger learn their language.</p>
               <p>I was acquainted with a Phyſician learned in all theſe Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as likewiſe in <hi>Latine, Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> reaſonable well. One night being in bed in the ſame Chamber with him, and Captain <hi>Thomas Martin,</hi> on a ſuddain enters a <hi>Moor,</hi> mine Hoſt having brought him in, with a ſlave carrying a Torch, cover'd from head to foot with woollen cloth, who ſaluted us in <hi>French:</hi> ſeeing him ſo black I bleſſed my ſelf, taking him for a devill, whereat he laughed, bidding
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98515:157"/>
me I ſhould not be afraid, for there was no danger. He kiſſed his hand, and took mine with many kindneſſes and expreſſions, that he could not have ſlept if he had not ſeen me, entreating me to come to him on the morrow, to communicate to me a matter of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Aſking how he came ſo perfect in our tongue, he told me he was once ſervant to one <hi>Charbi</hi> at <hi>Marſeills,</hi> that he had had buſineſſe with my father, whom he named, and my brother: that he had been a ſlave 9 years, then redeemed himſelf. On the morrow he was with us at our firſt ſtirring, and we took a walk together, and then he invited us to dinner to his houſe, which was very noble. I demanded of him how a perſon of ſuch quality had remained ſo long in ſlavery: he told me that for five years his ranſom being a thouſand duckets was loſt. He had four horſes in his ſtable, his lodging chamber was gilt, and had many other very fair rooms. He had one wife only, and he would never marry other, but would live like a Chriſtian. His wife was fair in perfection. He gave me high commendations to his wife that ſhe might be courteous to me, and ſhe was therefore very civill to us: He ſhewed us all his houſe, and a fair Library of well-bound books, and ſhewed me how the <hi>Africans</hi> had been Lords of a great part of the world, ſhewing me a Book titled <hi>Albazer</hi> full of curioſities, and hiſtories of the renowned <hi>Africans,</hi> as <hi>Hannibal, Maſſiniſſa, Septimus Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> Emperour, and many other Kings, Princes, and Biſhops, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>I aſked him why he followed not the Law of ſo many holy Biſhops. He told me he was not ſo far divided, and that in their <hi>Alcoran Mahomet</hi> confeſſes that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was greater than he: that he met him in the ſixth heaven and humbled himſelf to him, beſeeching him to pray to God for him, which he never did to other Prophets, who all beg of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to pray to God for them. So as this man wanted nothing of a Chriſtian but Baptiſme; and told us that having paid his ranſom, if his Maſter <hi>Churbi</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul had not preſſed him to marry a young widow whom he dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lov'd, he had willingly become Chriſtian. He was a man very upright, wiſe, and vertuous, and if he would marry other wives, of the chiefeſt in Town he might have plenty. He told me as a ſecret that the Governour of <hi>Arzille,</hi> who was in heart of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> opinion, would have given his daughter in marriage, if he would have become Chriſtian, he had likewiſe a particular affection for Chriſtians. This is that <hi>Arzille</hi> which in the year 1421. was conquered by <hi>Cordoue</hi> the <hi>Moor,</hi> which <hi>Don Alphonſo,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> regained from him.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Marocca,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of what I have often ſeen in Mountains of <hi>Ziz,</hi> that is, how the people have a familiarity with ſerpents, and very infants will play with them. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> having it by precept of Law, to kill none of theſe pernicious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98515:158"/>
inſomuch as I was once reproved by one of them for throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtone at a toad.</p>
               <p>Being departed from <hi>Sequeline,</hi> we croſſed the Mountains of <hi>Ziz,</hi> which takes beginning at the ſkirts of <hi>Mezetazu,</hi> towards the Weſt, and terminates at <hi>Telde,</hi> towards <hi>Numidia.</hi> The <hi>Arabians</hi> call it <hi>Segelmeſſe,</hi> which are fifteen Mountains where theſe Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine people inhabit, which the people call <hi>Zanaga,</hi> who keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſerpents, and have their gardens full of toads. 'Tis true there are amongſt them Magicians of divers kinds, whereof ſome can charm theſe reptile Creatures, as in the <hi>Indies</hi> they charm the <hi>Caymanes</hi> and <hi>Tiburons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leon. Abr. <hi>l. 3.</hi>
                  </note> that theſe fiſh-monſters devour not them who fiſh for pearls, they call theſe Magicians <hi>Malurman.</hi> In theſe Mountains of <hi>Ziz</hi> there are other Magicians, who boaſt they can cure all diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Mahazin. Zaira.</note> them they call <hi>Mahazin,</hi> and are in great eſteem. Another ſort called <hi>Zairan</hi> conjure tempeſts, lightenings, hails, and other Meteors, which are hurtfull to fruits. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I there ſaw a Magician, who perceiving a horrid tempeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching in a thick black cloud, which would quite deſtroy their <hi>Seytume,</hi> or olives then in flower, he made a hole in the ground, and with certain words urined in it, which diverted the ſtorm to another part: yet they have another ſort they call <hi>Machabell,</hi> who ſay they can cure all diſeaſes in cattle. Others called <hi>Sadahachar,</hi> who have power over devils, and can compell them to any place they command them: They have alwaies one amongſt them, and they call them white devils. Others very ſkilfull in <hi>Geomancy,</hi> who can ſhew ſpirits in a bright baſon like a looking-glaſſe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents what is deſired: Others they have that cauſe beaſts or men to languiſh and die; but this laſt ſort is not onely amongſt Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, I have ſeen them likewiſe amongſt Chriſtians. For being once at <hi>Seville</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> I knew a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Limner excellent in his art, who languiſht by this means, betwitch'd by a famous ſtrumpet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Segnora Maria de Villara,</hi> who would have ſerved a Comrade of his in like ſort, with certain biskets wherewith ſhe entertained him, whereof one was charm'd and the other not; but he ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome villany, cunningly conveyed it to her own plate, and took another. Afterwards ſhe doubting nothing gave him one to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his wife, with a curious purſe. But he returning home made triall on a dog, who immediately fell to howling, and dyed. Mean while the Biſket which the Curtizan had taken unawares, began to work, whereupon perceiving her ſelf loſt, ſhe ſent for her friend, who acknowledged he had given her the morſel, ignorant what it was. Hereupon ſhe deſired him for a laſt ſervice, he would go to a certain place in a garden out of Town, and cut a cord which he ſhould find tied to a tree; which taking ſome friends with him he did, and found a toad tied by the leg at the end of the cord, and he had no ſooner cut it but the Curtizan died. I was
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98515:158"/>
in <hi>Sevill</hi> when this happened, and ſeeing the body of this woman going to buriall, he who was the principal actor told me the ſtory, for we lodg'd in the ſame houſe. And his wife upon this ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect durſt no longer wear the purſe ſhe ſent her.</p>
               <p>In order to this I will relate you two other examples of Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, which happened in our Countrey of <hi>Provence,</hi> one of a Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker at <hi>Aix.</hi> On the day he was married a witch tied a knot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a point, with certain words, and laid it on the Altar in time of Maſſe, and afterwards put it in a hole. For five or ſix years theſe people could never live together, till the witch being apprehended before her death, confeſſed where the point was, which was found together with croſſes, caracters, and ſacred words: The witch was burn'd alive, and the ſhoemakers wife afterwards became with child.</p>
               <p>The other of a <hi>Marſellian,</hi> who being in love with a maid, whom her friends would not conſent ſhould marry him, was adviſed to go to <hi>Baile de Luc,</hi> a grand Sorcerer, who made him make an offering to Sathan, then drawing a circle on the ground, he divided it in ſeven parts, and in each placed a character, ſignifying the name of a Devil, who ſhould appear to him in what form he would, and carry him whitherſoever he deſired. But the other not being over confident named the form of man, but the Sorcerer would have the form of a beaſt. In fine, the other for money procured him to let him have the caracter of a Demon with him to his own home, to make tryal of, and made choice of the name <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and about midnight went to do this work at his Miſtreſſes door, the Magician having told him 'twould work the more forcibly. He then laid the Caracter upon a ſtone and on his knees made his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to <hi>Leviathan</hi> to aſſiſt him in his enterprize.</p>
               <p>He ſaid this prayer five times, then on a ſudden the devill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a hideous and horrible form, which the poor man having not courage to endure, fell in a trance on the ground for three hours together. Afterwards returning to himſelf, he got up, took his ticket, and returned home ſad and vext at his want of courage. He caſt the Caracter in the fire, whence broke three ſuch claps of thunder, as if the houſe ſhould have ſunk to hell. The Father, Mother, and Siſters ran to ſee what the matter was, but he ſeemed to know nothing. The poor man being in this diſtreſſe, came to me, for he was my friend, and telling me the proceedings aſked my advice, with moſt deſperate ſpeeches, ſaying, that to gain his love he did not care to be damned. Whereupon I adviſed him in the beſt ſort I could, telling him that this way though he ſhould gain his Miſtreſſe, nothing but miſery could befall him; then I made him promiſe me to go together to a <hi>Capucin</hi> of my acquaintance to reconcile him, and receive his diabolical renunciation; but this miſerable man came not according to appointment, perſiſting in his accurſed reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:98515:159"/>Mean while the maid having knowledge of all, married honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably with another, and left the wretched man infamous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, to a Tragick death. Now to conclude this diſcourſe of <hi>Africa,</hi> I ſaw there certain beaſts, the like whereof I never ſaw in <hi>India</hi> Eaſt or Weſt, they call them <hi>Pachacou,</hi> like foxes, and are of ſo ſtrange and ravenous a nature, that if they wind a dead corps before it be interr'd, they will ſcrape and mine till they get to it, and eat it to the bones, ſome call them <hi>Chicali,</hi> they live onely on fleſh. And I remember that a poor boy, ſervant to one of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, being dead, we buried him in a ſandy ground, and as deep as we could, but the day following we found him drawn out of the earth, and knawed to the bones. Not imagining how this came to paſſe, we went next evening to watch, and found 'twas thoſe beaſts, who came in a troop to hunt after ſuch booty: We hit one of them ſo with a ſtone, that he lay for dead, and as we were view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, as a ſtrang thing, on a ſudden he leapt up and ran away, which made us think this Creature is exceeding crafty, that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble death ſo naturally. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call him <hi>Duburh,</hi> the <hi>Africans, Ilef.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A while after this battail, I went aboard at <hi>Lareche,</hi> and came to <hi>Calis,</hi> a hundred miles from thence, ſo to <hi>San Loucas,</hi> then to <hi>Seu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ille,</hi> 16. leag. from <hi>Calis,</hi> going thither by the <hi>Gadalquivir:</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome money I had a letter of exchange for from <hi>Fez,</hi> I went to <hi>Grenado,</hi> two dayes journey from <hi>Seuille,</hi> ſo down to <hi>Cordoua,</hi> and <hi>Guadix,</hi> and meeting with a waggon loaded with wool, I came to <hi>Cartagena,</hi> then following the coaſt to <hi>Malaga, Valencia, Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> and at laſt to <hi>Marſeills.</hi>

exceeding delicate. <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hath been the ſubject of ſo many ingenious pens, who have and daily do pourtray both the Town, and the Empire, the Court and State of the Grand Senior, his Officers, Religion, Cuſtoms, and other particulars of the Turks, that I ſhall enlarge my ſelfe no further, then to ſay 'tis admirable for pleaſant ſcituation, and beautiful aſpect at diſtance, though the intrinſick correſponds not; for the ſtreets lye extremely ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, out of the negligence or ruſticity of the Inhabitants, who think of nothing but gain, and avarice, without regard to decency either in their houſes, or ſtreets. The Grand Senior, <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> and ſuch, have magnificent Palaces painted with gold and azure, after the <hi>Perſian.</hi> Her Founder <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great diſmantled <hi>Rome</hi> and all the Province of the Empire to adorn this his new City, which in imitation of ancient <hi>Rome</hi> he ſeated on ſeven hills: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Juſtinian</hi> erected the magnificent Church of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or S. <hi>Sophia,</hi> of circular <hi>Modell,</hi> by which pattern the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins</hi> built their Temple, or <hi>Moſque</hi> at <hi>Meca,</hi> though there be much difference betwixt them, that at <hi>Meca,</hi> being only brick building, ſupported with abundance of Pillars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hath within nothing graceful, but the Princes <hi>Seraglioes,</hi> the <hi>Moſques,</hi> Hoſpitalls, and the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> Palaces built by the art and induſtry of their ſlaves, as heretofore at <hi>Rome:</hi> likewiſe theſe <hi>Baſhaws</hi> for the greateſt part are Renegado-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or Chriſtians children, of more elegancy then the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Turk, the moſt avaricious people of the world, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mony, afford not the leaſt civility imaginable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is ſcituate on a Promotory environed on all ſides, except the Weſt, with the Sea, with a Gulph or Channell on the North, and Port <hi>Pera,</hi> or <hi>Galata</hi> ſecured with a chain as <hi>Malta</hi> is. <hi>Pera</hi> is as 'twere a Suburbs beguirt with Walls, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Emperours time, who fortified it. Within the circumference there are four good Ports beſides this. On the Land ſide 'tis double wall'd, with good ditches equall'd, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard and rampar'd, no work of the Turks notwithſtanding, but the ancient Chriſtians, who poſſeſſed it, and ſince repaired by them. 'Tis of triangular form, one point towards the Weſt, the other two declining with falls and windings towards the ſea on the South ſide. From ſome houſes in <hi>Pera,</hi> one may take a view of the ſcite and precinct of it, and perceive how it opens it ſelf into three Angles, the one towards the Port of the Iſlands, a ſecond to the River Port, and the third points upon the Grand Siniors <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> which takes up the ſide of the hill, that emboſoms the Gulph towards <hi>Pera,</hi> the height whereof is a ſhelter to the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that ride on that ſide, and here the <hi>Sultans,</hi> and <hi>Sultaneſſes</hi> Gardens are. The <hi>Seraglio</hi> is of a noble and delightfull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, for it hath both land and ſea for proſpect, which from the Mount ſurveyes the champain. There are long ridings adjacent,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98515:160"/>
encloſed with high walls, and beautifyed with columns of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd marble, and tall trees ranked in walkes. Within the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> is the Temple of S. <hi>Sophia,</hi> ſince the demoliſhment of a number of goodly Churches, made their <hi>Moſque:</hi> having left none for the Greek Chriſtian ſervice, but thoſe of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> S. <hi>Theodoret,</hi> Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> S. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Saint <hi>John,</hi> and S. <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>; now in the Patriarcks hands where Chriſtians celebrate with permiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Turks practice a Religion in Part and countenance meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without regard to law either divine or humane:<note place="margin">The Turks Religion.</note> relying for their faith upon others, without further indagation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally that their Prophet were not miſtaken: Their principal care is the manage of their affaires, to be eſteemed wiſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pleaſures of the world. They eſteem Chriſtians far ſhort of them, yet notwithſtanding they allow Chriſt to be born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that he was a great Prophet, and the Breath of the mighty God. There have riſen amongſt them ſome Sectaries, who held him a greater Prophet then Mahomet: but ſome being ſo bold as to publiſh it, were dragg'd by the heels, had their brains beaten out, and were made food for dogs. The prohibition to diſpute of their law they obſerve exactly, for manifeſting the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and abſurdity of it, and for the diverſe interpretations of their <hi>Alcaron,</hi> which would intangle them in a thouſand confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They place their Paradiſe intirely in ſenſual pleaſure, as in guſtfull and delicate meat and drink, in fair women, and the like; and doubt not ſalvation, if they abſtain from wine and ſwines fleſh. Their <hi>Taliſmanſat</hi> and <hi>Cadileſchers,</hi> their Doctors preach them this wholeſome doctrine: telling them the Paradiſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Chriſtians where there is neither meat nor drink, is for poor and wretched creatures; in theirs they make good cheer, ſo carnal, and below ſpirit are theſe people. The Prieſts muſt be a little learned in the courſe of the Sun and Moon, for the knowledge of their Feaſts and New-Moons: they go daily upon the ſteeple of their <hi>Moſque,</hi> and proclaim the hours of prayer to God and their Prophet.</p>
               <p>They have Religious of ſeveral orders, ſome like men in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, counterfeiting the ideot, others diſſembling ſimplicity, others that moſt frantickly torment themſelves to death, women who ring themſelves with wire, as we do Mares, but of this I have ſaid ſufficiently in my Treatiſe of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The <hi>Mufti</hi> is their Grand Patriarck, who decides all differences in Religion and diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Prieſts, and the Grand Sinior himſelf cannot wave his ſentence, who owes him ſuch reſpect, that he riſes from his ſeat to receive him when he makes a viſit to him, and ſeats him by him. The determination of civill and criminal cauſes is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Soubaſſi</hi> or <hi>Gadileſcher Baſha, Armin,</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cair.</hi> This <hi>Mufti</hi> as of the line of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> weares a green

There are others who go in troops, and coming to a Village beg almes upon their knees, which Turks give them liberally, and they eat it in the place, nevertheſſe having done, for all this charity, all they can meet alone, they omit not to pillage and murther.</p>
               <p>During my ſtay at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there died <hi>Baſha Zabahim,</hi> a perſon of worthy repute according to his law: Being departed, his death was notified to all the people, who came in a multitude and wept for him, and according to cuſtome he was interred without the town. Perſons of ſuch quality at their deceaſe ever bequeath to pious uſes, as to the foundation of an Hoſpitall, or <hi>Moſque,</hi> or the like; officers clad in duſkiſh courſe rugs, give notice to the people to pray for the ſoule of this pious Lord: His neareſt kindred covered with fine white linnen from head to foot, go to the houſe and attend at the gate, no man entring in but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Such as are more remote, are only vail'd over the face with a fine cloth, which hangs down to the girdle. They are known by their wailings and lamentations, which they duplicate when they come together. Then come forth all the Domeſticks in gray Aſh-coloured cloth, next come twelve horſes, with clothes of the like drawing on the ground, the leaders clothed with the ſame. Theſe horſes ſeem to weep, and by intermiſſions to ſigh and ſobbe, which they are brought to by rubbing their noſtrils with a certain drugge, while the people thinking them to weep really, accompany them with tears and lamentations.</p>
               <p>Then follow four in gray with four banners trailing on the ground, then four more trailing Arms, Pikes, Javelins, Cimeters, Bowes, and Arrows, all with like lamentation; next comes the Corps contrary to us with the head foremoſt, clothed in a rich garment, born by ſix men well habited, ſix more holding up the <hi>Pall</hi> of the ſame colour; with the robes, with a black <hi>Turbant,</hi> upon which there is a green ribband of a finger breadth, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heaven promiſed by their Prophet, and upon the <hi>Turbant</hi> a bundle of feathers of great value.</p>
               <p>All his Allies and Friends follow after weeping covered with white, by the head of the Corps walk four <hi>Talimaſſans,</hi> reading prayers for the dead, theſe aſſiſted at his departure, and are obliged for ſome charity beſtowed on them to pray for him all the yeare; when they come to the croſſing of a ſtreet, the Corps ſtayes, and a <hi>Talimaſſan</hi> with a loud voyce cryes, <hi>Ala Ramani arban Muhis la ala ila ala ale Huma ala.</hi> Which meanes, God is mercifull, pray to God for him; and with that the Prieſts, with Tallow Tapers walk round the Corps, repeating the ſame words, and thus conduct him to

his Sepulcher, lin'd with thin boards and roof'd over: for nine dayes all his kindred viſit the tomb with lamentations, whither they bring proviſion for the Prieſts and poor; for whom there is almes aſſigned, and this, they ſay, maintains them till the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when the breath of God will judge in favour of the Prophet, who gives teſtimony of their good works before the divine Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</p>

The ſecond Tribunall or <hi>Diuan,</hi> is within the <hi>Seraglio</hi> hard by the other, where ſit the four <hi>Bachats,</hi> with the grand <hi>Seniors</hi> Secretary, three <hi>Cadeleſchers</hi> and the <hi>Beglierbeg,</hi> who is as high-Conſtable. Here are criminall cauſes determined, and all that concerns the Militia, and pay of <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> and Souldiers, attended by the <hi>Dragoman,</hi> one ſkilled in all languages, for the benefit of ſtrangers; for people of all ſorts come to theſe tryals, and 'tis allowed to any one to ſee Juſtice executed. The <hi>Dragoman</hi> takes perfect information, that no man may be ſurprized in his cauſe, and then makes report to the <hi>Diuan.</hi> The Judges are ever of a graceful preſence, holding for a principle, that a fair mind was never covered with a foule face, or very rarely. They afford a fair attention, and as diligent to a child as to the grand <hi>Senior.</hi> In the <hi>Diuan</hi> there is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate window where ſometimes the Grand <hi>Senior,</hi> ſtands to hear the Juſtice of the Court, which keeps him in awe and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>They have an equall and ſpeedy Juſtice adminiſtred by the States gratis, nor can they admit either of preſents or mediations. Bad cauſes are rewarded with good bangs, all done with weight and meaſure, for to the Judges 'tis death to proceed otherwiſe. In affairs of importance where the grand <hi>Senior</hi> ought to take cognizance, the <hi>Cadileſchir</hi> makes the report to him, and he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as he pleaſes. There are other Courts and Judicatories in ſeverall places of the Town, for multitude of the Inhabitants, who for the moſt frivolous things appeale to Juſtice. The <hi>Cadis, Armis,</hi> and <hi>Soubaſſi,</hi> are the Judges, who for tranſgreſſion are diſcharged of their office. The high Court of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> ſits all day, from morning to night, where they are provided of three meals a day; before they enter, at nine, and in the evening, no man being allowed to ſtir out, but the <hi>Viſier,</hi> keeper of the ſeale, who before he can ſeale any diſpatch, muſt acquaint the grand <hi>Senior.</hi> Three dayes a week theſe grand Seſſions are held, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, Sunday, and Monday, and ſometimes Tueſday, in occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of great affairs, or of ſtrangers: the other four dayes are

aſſigned to the Courts of the four <hi>Bachats,</hi> who diſpatch the reſt, and ſit in places appointed, whence on the Saturday they faile not to be at the grand Seſſions, where all attend, ſeated with croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed arms, and their feet cloſe together, till the grand <hi>Baſha</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; to whom they addreſſe themſelves with great reverence, then to their ſeats with rigorous ſilence. The <hi>Baſha</hi> with a liſt of papers in hand, looking round, obſerves him who prepares to plead, then with his hand gives him a ſign to ſpeak, and having heard the complaint, then hears the adverſe party, and with great prudence judges and gives ſentence.</p>
               <p>In caſe of murther they make particular inquiry of all acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and they ſcape not without a good fine that could, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the murther: For all that are preſent are bound under fine and penal puniſhments to apprehend the murtherer, and bring him to the <hi>Soubaſſi,</hi> the <hi>Cadi</hi>'s Lieutenant, who having heard the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gives judgement. I was at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> grand Son to the <hi>Sultan Soliman,</hi> where by one <hi>Bernard Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> a <hi>Marſeillian,</hi> I learnt many particulars of the Court: He was taken by the <hi>Turks</hi> in his youth, and preſented to the <hi>Soliman,</hi> who made him renegado, and his page. He made me an exact relation of the whole Court and <hi>Seraglio,</hi> out of which I collected ſome memorials that I loſt. I can humbly ſay, God made me an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to regain this man, who came back to <hi>Marſeills,</hi> while his Father and Mother were yet alive, where he was reconciled to the Church, but ſometime after going to ſea, was by the <hi>Turks</hi> retaken, and put to death. Of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> I remember he told me that within the ſecond gate upon the left hand is the Princes kitchin, not comparable to thoſe in our Royal Palaces; he reckon'd all the Officers to me, which I ſet not down. Beyond that is the great hall, or chamber of the <hi>Agas Capigis,</hi> or <hi>Cadun,</hi> the door-guards, a different office from the <hi>Chaous,</hi> who are exempt from guarding. Of this guard there are a great number, divided by thirty to a Company. The third gate opens into gardens, ſet with dates, and trees of other ſorts; at the bottom whereof is a fair Subterranean apartment, ſumptuouſly ſtored with riches, on the top ſtands a golden Mund, and on that a Creſſant. Here the Prince bathes in hot ſeaſons, and ſometimes eats; here he gives audience to Embaſſadours, conducted through divers gates and Courts, for oſtentation of the State and magnificence of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, the rich columns, Moſaick Tapeſtries, &amp;c. He gives audience to Embaſſadours onely twice; when they arrive, and when they depart, and then for a ſpeciall favour reaches them his right hand to kiſſe. In the middle of the chamber ſtands a great globe of Chryſtal,<note place="margin">A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98515:162"/>
Embaſſadours; for the ſecond room is for his wives and Ladies, where none enters but Eunuchs. <hi>Nadal</hi> that I ſpoke of as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, went in often with the Prince, and was fortunate in this that the <hi>Sultan</hi> excuſed him from caſtration, for fear of looſing of him, many looſing their lives by it, though when 'tis done they are caſt in a ſleep, by vertue of a ſtupifying water. He told me the Ladies would blandiſh him exceedingly, and that there was one who daily ſaid the roſary of the bleſſed virgin, and was daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Prince of <hi>Natolia.</hi> The <hi>Sultan</hi> keeps ten pages, as grooms of his chamber to dreſſe and undreſſe him, who ſerve not by quarter, but attend the Prince continually, as Pages of honour: They are cul'd out of many more, and ordinarily are choſen by their Phyſnomy, or good face. 'Tis the office of one of theſe to go every morning to the <hi>Chaſna,</hi> or Treaſurer for fourty duckets to put in the Grand <hi>Seniors</hi> pocket for his charity, and bounty; at night when he goes to bed, all the money left in his pockets the Pages of honour divide amongſt them, where they often find the ſum compleat, the grand <hi>Seniors</hi> affairs not allowing him leiſure to think of it. They fetch every day the like ſum for his ſports. Theſe Pages watch all night by the Prince, two and two by turns, and have <hi>Flambeaus</hi> burning, till Sun riſing that the Prince riſes: for then from a high ſteeple the <hi>Dalliman</hi> calls every one to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Prince aſſoon as he is ready goes to the Moſquee, and if he pleaſe, takes his Pages of honour to attend him; ſometimes to take the air he goes on horſe to a Moſquee more remote, and then is attended in handſom order. Furthermore the Porter or <hi>Capaigis,</hi>

The Querriſhip comprehends 300. goodly horſes, twelve whereof are reſerved for the Princes ſaddle alone, on which onely the pages of honour may ride: there are other ſtables for above ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, as 3000. palfreys, called there <hi>Deuagilar.</hi> There are a number of horſes beſides, and the Maſter of horſe they call <hi>Baſhaw Abrahor.</hi>

                     </gap>eemont,</hi> they were told at their lodging how there was a Chamber haunted with ſpirits, and ſtrangely moleſted with horrible rumblings: hereupon they were taken with a curioſity to lie in this chamber, whatſoever their hoſt could ſay to diſſwade them; their evenings diſcourſe was onely of apparitions, which one amongſt them abſolutely denied, ſaying 'twas all but fables, and phantaſticall imaginations: But lying all together in the ſame bed, about midnight the Count wakes, and by the light of a Flambeau they had left burning, he ſaw ſome Monks both black and white, reading their Breviaries by the blew light of a Taper, that made the whole chamber of the ſame colour: he could not underſtand a word they ſaid, though he obſerved them diligently: he was ſeiz'd with ſuch horrour he could not ſpeak to his bed-fellowes, onely jogged the next with his elbow, who ſlept as he were charm'd; and when he ſaw the Monks with grave ſteps draw nearer the bed, his fear redoubled, and though their ſwords lay hard by him, terrour onely poſſeſſed him. He thought the Monks muttering ſome words, turned off the cloaths, took one of his companions out of the bed, and burnt him to aſhes in a great fire; and in effect one of them was gone and never heard off more, and none but himſelf and one more left in the bed.</p>
               <p>I remember alſo that being at St. <hi>Bauma,</hi> while <hi>Godfrey</hi> the accurſed ſorcerer was there, as they carv'd him fiſh, being Lent, and laid it on his trencher, he ſeemed ſtill to eat, yet there was nothing leſſe on his trencher; and Father <hi>Michaelis</hi> exorcizing <hi>Magdalen de la Palu,</hi> aſked her what it meant? who anſwered he could not eat of all things; and that the Devils brought him human fleſh, of which he fed and left the reſt, And divers Sorcerers exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at <hi>Aix,</hi> have confeſſed that in their Sabbaths, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they feed on ſuch fare.</p>
               <p>This makes me doubt whether thoſe Goblins or Sorcerers, ſeen by the Count, carried not the poor Gentleman away for the like proviſion; for he was never ſeen more, and the other two remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frighted and aſtoniſhed almoſt to death.

Afterwards in the ſame voyage going from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> betwixt <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Abruzza,</hi> we lodged in a village called <hi>Chelana,</hi> where mine hoſt having ſeen us well accommodated in bed, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to another room, for fear of ſpirits that haunted that: and in good earneſt we had a very troubleſome night of it, not able to reſt for ratlings and jinglings, both upon the ſtairs and in the Chamber, without perceiving any thing, much ado to comfort one another, and 'twas to no purpoſe, we called mine hoſte; who in the morning excuſed himſelf the beſt he could, and all paſſed in laughter; but coming back that way we found the houſe pulled down, and a Church building in the place.</p>
               <p>Then returning into <hi>France,</hi> we paſſed by <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> where we ſupped with the <hi>Sieur de St. Andre,</hi> Governour of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> and telling him of theſe ſpirits, being a Proteſtant, he made a ſcoffe at it; but the beſt was, that in the night as he lay in bed, he was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with ſuch a noiſe, that leaping to his ſword, he cryed out, and raiſed us all; ſuppoſing thieves were robbing the houſe, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doors and windows all faſt, he was amazed, and made an oath he would never jeſt at ſpirits again.</p>

               <p>REturning to <hi>Marſeills</hi> in a time of ſickneſſe, I went to ſea again, in a veſſel bound for <hi>Braſile,</hi> under the command of Captain <hi>James Varin.</hi> Our ſufferings in this voyage were great, ſpecially in our return, when we were glad for food to eat all manner of leather, Munkeys, Parrots, and Rats, which paſſed for plovers. I was the moſt troubled with a young <hi>Marſellian</hi> I brought along with me, one <hi>William Vias,</hi> a neighbour, a moſt malicious unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fellow, who did me not the leaſt ſervice, though I laid in proviſion for him, and paid his paſſage.

               <p>Once he was ſoundly bang'd for ſaying he would kill the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and had my advice been followed, they ſhould have made a <hi>Fricaſſee</hi> of him, as I ſaw one ſerved at <hi>Braſile,</hi> as I ſhall relate in my ſecond voyage to the Weſt Indies.</p>
               <p>At our return, we came a ſhore at <hi>Haure,</hi> where I diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and came alone to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where I married the moſt perverſe woman in the world, ſo as when I thought to have ſpent the remainder of my life in repoſe, I was conſtrained
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98515:164"/>
to wander again for quietneſſe, and in effect made a voyage to <hi>Portugall,</hi> to barter ſome pearls.</p>
               <p>I laid in Merchandizes proper for <hi>Cadiz,</hi> as <hi>Camlots</hi> of the Eaſt, cloth, corall, and two hundred crowns in gold, upon let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of exchange to <hi>Hierome Viguer</hi> of <hi>Chativa,</hi> and an hundred piſtols, I depoſited with <hi>Noe Meneſtier,</hi> which I loſt; yet he an honeſt man; for this <hi>Viguier</hi> a Spaniard, uſed ſuch ſleights and delays, that I was conſtrained to quit all, by a misfortune which befell me. For waiting for my money at his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe one <hi>Emanuele,</hi> one evening coming out of a Church, there ſtood diſcourſing a companie of Cannons, who ſeeing me in a <hi>French</hi> dreſſe, according to that degenerous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> began to affront me, which I waved with patience; and telling them how injurious 'twas to abuſe a ſtranger thus meerly paſſing by them, they wanted not much to come from words to blows with me and my man: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I complained to the Duke of <hi>Gandia,</hi> who gave me no other ſatisfaction than to refer me to the Biſhop, from whom I returned with as little ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Thus diſcontented I left the Town, and removed to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> by the way I lighted upon one of theſe venerable Cannons travailing for <hi>Valencia,</hi> well mounted, and glaſſes before his eyes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from the wind; now I having this opportunity for my revenge, gave him ſuch a buffet that I broke his glaſſe, and ſent him ſenſeleſſe to the ground: then upon the ſpur doubled my pace to <hi>Guadix,</hi> where 'twas my hard fortune to looſe a bill of exchange I had for cloth I ſold at <hi>Valence.</hi> thence by <hi>Granado</hi> I went to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where ſome ſmall negotiations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpatched, I returned for <hi>Provence</hi>: But having ſome prick in conſcience for my treaty of the Cannon of <hi>Gandia,</hi> I went to a Prieſt to confeſſe my ſelf, who conſidering the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of my fault, turned me over to the Biſhop, who abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and for penance obliged me to make a pilgrimage to <hi>Rome</hi>: I performed it, and coming to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, to confeſſe me to one of the Penitentiaries, with long ſlaves, by ill luck he prooved a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and underſtanding I had beaten a Cannon of <hi>Gandia,</hi> was much concerned, howſoever gave me abſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Hiſtory.</note>At this time there was an Almner of the Popes, who had the diſpoſing of ten or twelve thouſand duckets to the poor year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as they ſay, reſerved a good ſhare for himſelf; ſo as in few yeares he became exceeding rich, but very avaritious: Whereupon ſome good fellows there, were reſolved to ſhew him a trick, and partake with him; for this purpoſe one of them opens a ſhop of ſmall commodities, with ſome curioſities and antick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of gold and ſilver.</p>
               <p>This Almner as he came from Church, went every day to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98515:164"/>
converſe with this new Merchant, who ſtill ſhewed him rarities, whereof ſometimes he bought, ſometimes not. At laſt when their familiaritie was confirmed, behold another of the pack, diſguiſed like a ſlave, an iron plate about his neck, and a red cap, ſtands to beg at St. <hi>Peters</hi> porch, and as the Alm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner came by, beſought a charity of him: the other ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of a good aſpect, aſked him what he was? who anſwered he was a poore Gentleman newly come out of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and having his conſcience burthened, deſired he would hear his confeſſion. So entring the Church, this Gallant told him a long ſtory, how he had been divers years captive to <hi>Dragut Rais</hi> that famous Pirate, that at length he made him groom of his Chamber, and truſted him with all his money and jewels, and that his Maſter being ſlain at the ſiege of <hi>Malta,</hi> he took a jewell of extraordinary value, and a ſum of duckets, and came with the Fleet to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he met with means to get into Chriſtendom, and return to his Countrey with his wealthy prize.</p>
               <p>The Almner was on fire, to have a ſight of the rich piece, and told him if it were a thing of that value, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his holineſſe to buy it: The ſlave then conjuring him to ſecrecy by the name of God, ſhewed him a fawcet Chryſtall, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially coloured with Dragons bloud, which made it of an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable luſtre; wherewith the Almner dazled, deſired him he might ſhew it to a Merchant a friend of his, of knowledge in ſuch things, ſo they went together to the Merchant, who viewing the jewell, made unuſuall admirations, as at an exceſſive treaſure, telling him 'twas worth many thouſand duckets; whereby his longing growing ſtronger, after many offers and refuſals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſlave and him, they at length bargained for two and twenty thouſand crowns, which he paid upon the naile: Whereupon the Merchant ſhuts up ſhop, packs away, and vaniſhes with the ſlave, never to be heard of.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the Almner was ſo ſwell'd with his purchaſe, that he could not contain himſelf, imagining by this means he might arrive at any office or dignity whatſoever, and fancied himſelf Pope already, with this Carbuncle in his <hi>Tiara</hi>: For ſome dayes he concealed it, not diſcovering the leaſt to his very neareſt friends. At length meeting with two Goldſmiths of his old acquaintance, he ſhewed it them, and would know their opinion of the value, or near the matter; who perceiving it a counterfeit carbuncle, laughed heartily, and ſaid 'twas a pretty Chryſtall, and might be worth ſome few realls, which ſo ſtroke the good man, that overcome with grief and vexation, he betook himſelf to his bed, whence he never roſe again. Thus was the good man abuſed by the knaviſh cheats.</p>
               <p>To ſecond this, I ſhall tell you of an exploite was put
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98515:165"/>
upon me in this very voyage. I intended for <hi>Naples,</hi> to buy ſome horſes, for which purpoſe I had a good handſom ſum of money I had taken for pearls I brought from <hi>Liſbone,</hi> and ſold to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Oraiſon,</hi> which I had put in two bags, whereof one I ever carried about me. One day paſſing through the market <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi> I obſerved a Goldſmith well furniſhed with jewels, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cheapned a good diamond of about four or five carrats weight, and a good luſter, by reaſon the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeills</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to buy him one if I met with a good bargain; we agreed for threeſcore and odd piſtols, which I laid down; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting and demanding more, I withdrew my money. Upon this comes in a man in good faſhion, his beard white, and a black vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet cap, and told me in private if I would buy a good diamond, or other jewels, he would ſhew me thoſe were good, and at a reaſonable rate. I took the man for ſome Senatour, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of quality, and followed him, though the Goldſmith pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me by the ſleeve, to come into his ſhop again. As we went along, my Gentleman entertained me with diſcourſe of ſeverall jewels he had at his Chamber, without Port <hi>Popolo,</hi> at laſt he had brought me to a place out of all wayes, near the <hi>Palle Malle,</hi> by the wall ſide; I began to ſuſpect ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief when I heard a Faquin by the way bid farewell, ſuch a one calling him by his name; and as I was thinking to take my leave of him, and go back again, I was ſeized upon by four or five Ruffians, who ſet a dagger to my breaſt, and made me deliver my purſe, and the bag I had about me, and my guide vaniſhed ſo as I could ſee him no more.</p>
               <p>In this miſerable condition I came back to <hi>Rome,</hi> full of ſhame and ſadneſſe, and though I ſpoke not a word of it, yet my misfortune was immediately divulged through all <hi>Rome,</hi> how I had been cheated by one in ſuch cloaths, who was known and famous for ſuch a one, he was not long after apprehended and meeting me I knew him not at all, having cut his hair and changed his cloathes, and ſtoutly denyed the fact. They ſhewed me ſome pieces of gold, which I claimed as my own, but that was all I could get.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding he was within few dayes after, with two of his Comrades hanged, convicted of divers other robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>Being upon return to <hi>Marſeills</hi> I made a digreſſion towards the river <hi>Genes,</hi> and <hi>Malta,</hi> and by reaſon the plague was at <hi>Martigues,</hi> I could not without difficulty be admitted into <hi>Ville Franche,</hi> to take a bill of health to croſſe the River <hi>Genes,</hi> where they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſevere upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>The day after I arrived, coming abroad two houres before day to take freſh ayr, I heard a doleful voyce coming, as I thought, from <hi>Capo Ferino,</hi> that cryed, Alas, kill me not, and take all I
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98515:165"/>
have; and after ſome profound groanes ceaſe. The day brought the matter to light, and it appears a poor man was murthered by ſome of <hi>Nice,</hi> perſons of quality, and free from ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>For theſe people with the Caſtle-Frigot went aboard a Bark, and having put all to the ſword, and pilladged, ſunk it: but God for his juſt judgement permitted him, who ſate at helme to leap into the water, and being ignorant of ſwimming, they ſay a <hi>Dolphin</hi> came betwixt his legges and carried him to ſhore, then knocking at the Caſtle Gate, he was brought wet as he was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governour, to whom he related, that ſome with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Frigot had boarded their veſſell, and uſed them as I told you. The Governour amazed at the matter, called for him who had charge of the Frigot, to know to whom he had delivered it, who told him that ſuch and ſuch had taken it without asking, becauſe he had ever allowed them the priviledge.</p>
               <p>The Governour put on his clothes and went to the ſhore, where he found his Frigot drawn on land, and a boy waſhing away ſome blood which was in it; for it ſeems one of the Bark en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to eſcape, they took him, killed him, and threw him into the ſea. The Governour quietly aſked what he was doing, he cunningly anſwered, they had in the night taken a great Fiſh, and that he was waſhing away the blood. In the inſtant came he who had taken away the Frigot, to give good morrow to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, whom the Marriner immediately knew, and cryed out, that was he who had done the fact; whereupon the Gentleman, with two others, were brought to the Caſtle, and upon triall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; two more eſcaped, but being taken afterwards, paid the ſame rates, confeſſing many more murthers, and veſſels ſunk; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, one wherein were 22. Religious, Jeſuits, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins, whom they wrapt all in a ſaile, and caſt into the ſea, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pilladged what they had.</p>
               <p>Thence we went to the Town of <hi>Genes</hi> in company of one <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> who had brought Hawkes to the King, and was going towards the Dutchy of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbina,</hi> and being at <hi>Vay</hi> about three or four miles from <hi>Savona,</hi> they would not ſuffer us on any conditions to paſſe further, and of neceſſity we muſt turn our courſe to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Mountferrat</hi> a country peſter'd with Bandits, and ſuch other; in which paſſage we were rob'd, and poor <hi>Alari</hi> loſt above two thouſand franks which he had in his <hi>Valice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We met with many difficulties in this paſſage, croſſing through narrow paſſages, fill'd up with ſnow by <hi>Alcare</hi> to <hi>Caſoanta, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, Placenta, Parma, Bolonia, Florence</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> where we arrived againſt the canonization of ſome Saints.</p>
               <p>I got Letters from <hi>Sieur Guileo Falio</hi> Embaſſadour of <hi>Malta</hi> for ſome of the money owing me by the Grand Maſter. Thence we came to <hi>Naples</hi> where ſuch a famine raigned, that the women in mutiny threw ſtones at the Governour in his Coach, the Cardinal
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98515:166"/>
and <hi>Sapata,</hi> whoſe heeles ſaved his life.</p>
               <p>Then we took a Frigot for <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and by edict we were to take no more bread aboard then for half a day; I brought halfe a crowns worth, which I hid under the Planks: we had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done if it had been found, and the ſouldiers were exact ſearchers; we ſuffer'd ſome hardſhip when we had no bread to our meat, yet ſo we paſſed two dayes intire: and putting in at the <hi>Pouilla,</hi> we could not amongſt all the Fiſher-men for any money buy a morſel, nor could have any thing amongſt them but fiſh, which we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards trucked with a youth for bread, he had in reſerve; coming to <hi>Aſilla,</hi> there we got bread; thence to <hi>Meſſina</hi> through the Straight, ſo dangerous for three or four leagues, where violence of the winde caſt us on the Rocks. I got as well as I could to land, but ſeeing ſome women left in the Bark, and ready to periſh, I perſwaded a young ſhoomaker to aſſiſt me, nnd in effect, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on our backs through the boyſterous waves, we got them ſafe to ſhore, for which afterwards they vouchſafed us not ſo much as thanks.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Meſſina</hi> I underſtood the <hi>Sieur de Mantis</hi> was with his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion at <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> being diſperſed from his Admirall, and ſeven or eight more that put to ſea together at <hi>Marſeills,</hi> and lighting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sanſon</hi> the famous Pirat, with his ſix ſhips they maintained a long fight, at length the S. <hi>Katharine</hi> torn with the Cannon ſunk, and had it not been for <hi>Monſieur de l'Iſle</hi> Captain of the Admiral, things had gone worſe, but night parted them. <hi>De Mantis,</hi> his ſhip repaired, intended to put to ſea to ſeek his company, but there was news brought that <hi>Sanſon</hi> with ſix tall ſhips waited his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth within Cannon ſhot of the Haven mouth. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the oddes, <hi>de Mantis</hi> reſolved to fight him ſingle. 'Twas the admiration of all that ſaw him hoyſe ſayle, looking on him as a frantick man, leading two or three hundred men to the Butchery, but this cenſure was changed into applauſe, when they beheld him environed with ſix Turkiſh ſhips, whoſe Cannons made the ſea ſeem on fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which engagement he cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and reſtored them a bloody requitall.</p>
               <p>His veſſel endured ſeven hundred Cannon ſhot, he loſt twelve men, and the Turks above three hundred, beſides what wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus victorious he returned to <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> where he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with Cannon from all the Forts, and received into the town with an eminent honour and endearments, for his boldneſſe to attack theſe ſix men of war well mann'd and commanded by an Engliſh Renegado, the moſt daring and deſperate Pirate on the ſea, who on the other ſide incenſed with his diſgrace, new mann'd his veſſels, and reinforced them with two Gallies, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Muſkettiers: The Grand Maſter <hi>de Vignacourt</hi> had intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of it, and <hi>de Mantis</hi> arriving at <hi>Malta,</hi> with his torne veſſel, he repaired it; and at the ſame time the ſhips of <hi>Marſeills</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:98515:166"/>
coming from <hi>Suria,</hi> put in there. <hi>Sanſon</hi> having put to ſea, rode in ſight of <hi>Cape Paſſaro,</hi> whereof the Grand Maſter gave notice to the <hi>Marſellian</hi> veſſels laden with Merchandiſes. <hi>Mantis</hi> with his Admirall deſign'd to fall upon the Pirats, whereupon I had ſome doubt if I were beſt go from <hi>Malta</hi> to <hi>Sicily,</hi> for 'twas ten dayes ſince I had my diſpatches from the grand Maſter, who amongſt other things had given me order to procure him three Gallies, built with all poſſible expedition: I was loth to imbark with <hi>de Mantis,</hi> for the hazard he was engag'd in, though of favour he promiſed me civill uſage, and I employed my beſt art, with the Maſter of a ſhip, to carry me to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> and thence to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> promiſing to load him with Gally timber for <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſo as he reſolved accordingly, and that we might paſſe unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Turks, we ſet not ſaile till towards the approach of night. The grand Maſter being advertiſed of our intention, ſent the Galley <hi>de la Religion,</hi> to call us in again, to my extream vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having attended ſo long for a paſſage; But after I with my goods was ſet a aſhore, the Maſter had liberty to go whither he pleaſed: The grand Maſter blam'd me exceedingly, for that the Turks lay then in the Channell, which was true, and in effect the veſſel was taken next day, ſo as I had the better luck to eſcape. Mean while the Gallion of <hi>Malta</hi> was making ready to execute the Kings command, and within fifteen dayes 'twas ready to be brought to the key, where <hi>de Mantis,</hi> with the <hi>Marſeillian</hi> veſſels ſtaid for it, to put out together for the coaſt of <hi>France</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the ſame time the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> were departing for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>de Mantis,</hi> being in the Kings ſhip, where he commanded for his Majeſty, ſaluted them not as they paſſed by, whereat the Knights were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, looking upon it as a point of honour, advertiſing the grand Maſter that he ought to fire all the Fort artillery upon him, and ſink him: But the prudent Lord managed the affaire with more moderation; and three dayes after the Galley being made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to launch, and being brought to the key, they aſked <hi>de Montis</hi> who lay before the Palace, if he would ſalute the Galley of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> when it came to the key; and anſwering reſolutely no, there paſſed tart words from both ſides, with menaces they would make him do it per-force; but he perſiſted, that he would loſe his life firſt, and that he had no ſuch Commiſſion; and when they demanded to ſee his Commiſſion, he refuſed it in plaine termes.</p>
               <p>But the grand Maſter deſirous to accommodate all this, found out this expedient: 'Tis an order of <hi>Malta,</hi> when the grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter comes upon the ſhore, all the veſſels in the Haven ſalute him, with three volleyes of Cannon: now he gave order that about ſeven next morning the Gallion ſhould fall down to the key, at which time he exactly contrived to appear upon the ſhore, under pretence of going that way to Maſſe at a ſumptuous Church he had
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98515:167"/>
built with a faire fountaine before it, that caſt up waters a Pike high.</p>
               <p>His coming was no ſooner diſcovered, but all the veſſels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with haſte to ſalute him, and <hi>de Mantis</hi> the foremoſt, as a thing not to be deny'd gave him all his Cannon as well of his own veſſel as of the Admiralls commanded by the <hi>Sieur d'Iſle,</hi> and at the inſtant, all the other veſſels did the like, ſo as nothing was to be ſeen but ſmoak and fire. At that very point the Gallion with her blazing Standart, a S. <hi>John</hi> upon her poop, enter'd the mouth of the Haven, and thought this diſcharge of Ordnance was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute for her, who returned them the like with her roaring Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and thus by the prudence of the great Maſter, the difference was compoſed.</p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Sanſon</hi> lay at ſea waiting for <hi>de Mantis,</hi> but having intelligence that the Gallion was of the company, he was better adviſed, and knowing himſelf too weak to cloſe with us, hoyſed ſayle and went his way, leaving a Galley to round us, and view our equipage, which came one morn before the Gallion, and made a turn in the head of the whole Fleet, the Gallion gave him two culverins, and <hi>de Mantis</hi> one, and with this ſalute they parted, and we came ſafe to <hi>Marſeills.</hi>

               <p>I ever carried with me a little memorial or diurnall, where I ſet down all the curioſities I met with, for which purpoſe I inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf of the ſcituation of the countrey, the quality of the Prince and government, of which I will make a brief relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:98515:167"/>
                  <hi>Guinea</hi> on the Weſt is bounded with the River <hi>Senega,</hi> which ingulfs into the Ocean at ſixteen degrees to the North, and the borders of <hi>Angela</hi> are at thirteen. <hi>Guinea</hi> is divided into the high and the low; the high <hi>Guinea</hi> inclines to the North, the lower lyes along the <hi>Senega,</hi> which they call <hi>Jeni,</hi> and reaches to the kingdome <hi>Manicongo,</hi> that begins at the firſt degree of the Line. Upon the coaſt of <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> are many Iſlands of one appellation, the principal is of S. <hi>James,</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> ſince the year 1446. where they have a well-fortified town, and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick ſtil'd <hi>Civitad:</hi> an Iſland of 60. miles in length, and 36. in breadth, a mountanous country, where they have never rain but in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> which comprehend their winter. The valleyes are fertile, and afford excellent Melons the year round, Dates and Sugar-canes in abundance, fleſh of all ſorts, Fowle and Veniſon, with beards of horſes and ſpecial good. 'Tis inhabited as that of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> by a conflux of all nations, and the ayre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwholeſome, they tranſport their infirm to an Iſland two leagues diſtant called <hi>Praya,</hi> under a fine climate; the ayr healthful, and a commodious Haven betwixt two fair Rivers, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two gulphs for harbours, one whereof is capable to containe many veſſels in ſecurity, having before the mouth of it a little Iſland, which guards it from the Maritime guſts, and the land lying high, defends it from windes by ſhore. The other Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders affect to land at this Port, for that the reſt are peſter'd with ſands; and chiefly, <hi>Borlouento</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> where there is ever ſome veſſel caſt away. This Iſle lyes cloſe upon the Iſle of <hi>Mago,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Barlouento,</hi> and near to <hi>Bona Viſta,</hi> Saint <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> Saint <hi>Vincent,</hi> Saint <hi>Lucie,</hi> and <hi>Fell,</hi> Iſlands plentifull of Cattle, and Veniſon, the inhabitants applying themſelves onely to the chaſe, powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſh to ſell to ſtrangers, as the ſkinnes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>A little Eaſtward lyes the Iſle <hi>del Fuego</hi> where they get as good wine as in the Canaries: next is the Iſle of <hi>Braua,</hi> full of Veniſon, and wilde Beeves, whereof the Hydes are much ſought after, as being thick and tough. But to <hi>Guinea,</hi> the kingdome of the <hi>Jalofes</hi> is the firſt, which beginnes North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the River <hi>Senega,</hi> hath the Ocean on the Weſt, the <hi>Jalofes</hi> called <hi>Fonlogageias,</hi> on the Eaſt, and the kingdom of <hi>Barbeſſin</hi> on the South: 'tis above a hundred and fifty leagues in length, of ſeveral commodities there is abundance; as gold and ſilver, which the natives conceale with all care from ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, though in dealing with them 'tis plain they have ſtore, for that by whiles they produce ſome unfined. <hi>Taboucaton</hi> is their chief town. They are Blacks, but of good ſhape, the women comely, round-faced, with eyes lively and attractive. The men are martial, dextrous in throwing a Javelin, which
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:98515:168"/>
they will throw with as exact arm as we ſhoot with our Gunnes. They ride on good horſes, clothe as the <hi>African,</hi> in ſhort bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; a large <hi>Harnus,</hi> like a ſheet of wollen covers them from head to foot, ſhod with Date-tree Sandals. Vpon the coaſt they have the good and well-fortified Haven <hi>Beziguche,</hi> whoſe entrance is ſkreen'd with a fair Iſland, much frequented with ſtrangers trading for the Indies. Here are many <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſetled amongſt them, ſome married, others who think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to heap up gold, living ſomething after the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</hi> Many of the <hi>Blacks</hi> go naked, painted with diſſolved gold, their bodies carved, and drawn with a various tincture, as azure, red and yellow, which hold their life-time. There are amongſt them maids adorned in the ſame manner, with great pendants in their ears, and their lips pierced like the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> they are generally libidinous, and given over to lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury. They who are thus engraved and inlay'd with paints, or juyce of hearbs, moſt commonly do it for want, and this curioſiry is their attire.</p>
               <p>Throughout the coaſt we find abundance of leather; wax, gold, ſilver ivory, and Amber-gris, which is the reaſon the <hi>Engliſh, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Flemings,</hi> viſit them ſo oft.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jalofes</hi> are eaſie of belief, and inclined to Chriſtianity; when they behold the Moon, they make ſtrong ejulations, with ſorts of adoration: They adore yet ſome other Idols, which nevertheleſſe fixe not their faith, the Mahometans on one ſide who impugne them with their law, on the other the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> preaching ours, and their own Prieſts charming them with their deluſions, and Idolatries. They make their ſacrifices in the woods, making large hollow trees their Temples, where they keep many Idols to which they ſacrifice pulſe, Mill, Rice; and the blood of beaſts, whoſe fleſh they eat.</p>
               <p>The countrey of <hi>Bracala</hi> confines upon the rapide River of <hi>Gambra,</hi> which in the mouth is five good leagues over, ſhips cannot enter it without a direct wind, with which they may advance three hundred leagues within the Countrey. This River cuts the great kingdome of <hi>Mandinga</hi> in the middle, peopled with Blacks, Idolaters, and abundance of Sorcerers, wicked, treacherous, and baſe people. When they hold a counſel ,tis in a cavern under ground to ſecure them from the prying of ſtrangers. They have ſtore of Braſil wood, as good as they of <hi>America,</hi> and upon the river many townes and villages where they mantain many veſſels of Warre to encounter with any whatſoever, but upon advantage. This countrey ends South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the <hi>Cape</hi> of S. <hi>Mary</hi> 30. leagues from the river <hi>Chougala,</hi> by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> called S. <hi>Dominick.</hi> There are two nations of the ſame quality, the <hi>Barbachins</hi> called <hi>Ariates,</hi> and <hi>Falupes</hi> who trade in nothing but fiſh and cattel. They have an excellent
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98515:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
way to take the ſea-oxe, the ſkins whereof they make great uſe of. They apply themſelves to till the ſoyle, and get Mill, Rice, Pulſe, and other graine.</p>
               <p>Out of this countrey comes the River <hi>Caſamanca,</hi> bounded Northward with the <hi>Jabundos,</hi> on the South, with the people of <hi>Bemum,</hi> who on the Eaſt have the <hi>Caſangas.</hi> Of late yeares the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have diſcovered a way by an Arme of the Sea to <hi>Caſangas,</hi> and for this purpoſe have erected a good Fort upon the cheek of it called S. <hi>Philips.</hi> This kingdome reaches North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Jaren,</hi> and together do homage to the <hi>Sultanſhip</hi> of <hi>Mandinga,</hi> rich in gold and ſilver, having excellent mines.</p>
               <p>The Prince keeps his Court in the Town of <hi>Senrigo,</hi> more Eaſtward by a hundred leagues, then the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Palmes</hi>; all the <hi>Blacks,</hi> as well of high as low <hi>Guinea,</hi> acknowledge this King, whereas the inhabitants along the Rivers, <hi>Faraca, Nigrate,</hi> and <hi>Budomel</hi> obey the King of <hi>Tombut,</hi> Lord of three kingdomes of <hi>Blacks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This countrey is called by the <hi>Protugueſe Mandimanca,</hi> where they adore the Moon, called by them the <hi>Bariamari,</hi> that is, the God of night or darkneſſe, and offer ſacrifices to it in the moſt obſcure woods, in hollow trees, at midnight; as they do likewiſe at <hi>Caſſanga,</hi> who have one <hi>China</hi> for their principal Idol, in whoſe honour they goe on proceſſion the twenty ninth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> about Midnight. One of their Prieſts or Magicians with them called <hi>Acacani,</hi> bearing a banner of ſilk, with a faggot of Vine branches, and divers bones of dead men. I believe they are bones of ſuch as have made voluntary ſacrifice of themſelves to this <hi>Demon,</hi> who appeares to them after divers manners; this Enſign weares a garment of woven twigges, at which there hang divers heads of little dogs, Munkeys, and other ſmall creatures. Proceſſion ended, they repoſe the Idols with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame tree, and burne moſt ſweet perfumes to it, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing Mill; then make their prayers and depart.</p>
               <p>In their dealings theſe people are lawleſſe, trading in ſlaves with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and others, which they rapine from all parts, and make their Market of them, to a miſerable ſlavery. The <hi>Caſſangarians</hi> neighbour upon another Nation called <hi>Leboura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> who live along the River Saint <hi>Domingo,</hi> by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives called <hi>Jarin,</hi> full of fiſh, but a dangerous Haven, for the Sands and Rocks which lye before it.</p>
               <p>Towards the North is <hi>Guinalla,</hi> another River; in the mouth whereof, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have built a Fort they call <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> and the Haven <hi>Guinalla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are <hi>Negroes,</hi> which they term <hi>Beafares,</hi> abominable thieves, making prey of one another, to ſell to the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> The King of <hi>Guinalla</hi> keeps a great State, hath a numerous guard of Archers, beſides fifty huge ſtrong dogges, all armed with
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98515:169"/>
ſkin of ſea-oxe dreſſed for the purpoſe, and made of proof, to every one a keeper. In Townes by night they have no other guards then ſuch dogges, who once turned looſe, ſpare no man, ſo as there is no ſtirring out of dores, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being worried. This they do to defend themſelves from ſuch as by night come to break their houſes, which are onely turfe covered with leaves, to carry away <hi>Negroes</hi> for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. The King hath a mutiplicity of wives, and believes that ſuch wives as dye with him for company, meet him in the other world, and become his wives again; but ſince they heard the true doctrine by ſome Fathers of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> who ſhew'd them their folly, they have not been ſo extravagant. Some of them were baptized, and went along with the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſide of <hi>Guinala</hi> comes out a branch which runnes to Port <hi>Begama,</hi> and a few leagues higher divides again in two, and upwards, delivers it ſelf to the Sea. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> hold this Port, which they call <hi>Balola,</hi> and the people on this branch are called <hi>Lanſados.</hi> Both theſe are good Havens joyntly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and the Natives. For from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dionall point of this River to <hi>Cape Vergas,</hi> there are three nations mingled with the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> the <hi>Malus, Ebagas,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from the South of that <hi>Cape</hi> begins a fair well-peopled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince they call <hi>Gatulia,</hi> and the <hi>Portugueſe Serellionna,</hi> that is a point throwing it ſelf into the ſea by the ſide of a great river of the ſame appellation, by reaſon of a hollow concavity roaring like a Lyon. This is a very pleaſant country, full of Groves of Braſill trees, and Vines which they have not knowledge to dreſſe, abundance of Midian Figges which they call <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> Sugar-canes grow without planting; Beſides, they have good conveniences, as Mills and Engines to make their Sugar; for they have Mines in all parts. There is Rice, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Cattle innumerable, Fiſh, Pepper in abundance, and more keen and pure then other; but there is prohibition upon life to carry any to <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal,</hi> for ſpoyling the ſale of that which comes from <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe there are Mines of Gold and Silver, Ivory, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-gris white and black; in brief, 'tis abſolutely a land of promiſe and delights. This Pepper the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enta de cola,</hi> one would take it for a Cheſtnut, it growes in a ſhell, though without prickles. Other ſtrangers who come to traffick for it, lade with it, but the <hi>Spaniard</hi> dares not take a grain.</p>
               <p>In this country there is variety, and abundance of Birds; a ſort of Ape they call a <hi>Baris,</hi> he is great and ſtrong, the inhabitants take them with nets, traps and other engines, entrapping the ſire and dam, with the young ones ſet in cages. They uſe them but
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98515:169"/>
rudely, and beat them till they cry like children; make them walk upon two feet, tying the foremoſt in their pole to a ſtick: beſides make them do many offices, as fetch water in a pitcher, waſh diſhes, blow the fire, draw wine, fetch meat from the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and any other domeſticall charre: But amongſt all they will ſtill be committing their petitlarcenies for meat and drink, but are well corrected for it. The ſport is, when they turn the ſpit, to ſee how he will ſmell the meat, and turning his great ſhaggy head with hanging hair, flyly watch if any body ſee him, and they muſt be very vigilant, or he ſhews them a trick for the roaſt. As it happened to a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who had invited certain Merchants; but when they came to take up dinner, Mr. Jack-turn-ſpit, had made uſe of one of the legs of a Turky-cock. His Maſter for the preſent beat him not, for the neceſſary uſe they had of him; who filled them wine and waſhed their glaſſes, and ſtill at laſt took his cup when it came to his turn, and with his rogueries made them very merry.</p>
               <p>To proceed, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> make a good time with theſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> who bring them unrefined gold for things inconſiderable, and to facilitate their traffick upon a point of the Sea called <hi>Corco,</hi> five degrees North, they have built a Fort near a Town, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Natives and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> together. The whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Serri Lionna</hi> is exceeding populous, and watered with fair Rivers, bounded with tall dates, and great orange trees. The firſt River from <hi>Capo Verga,</hi> the Countreymen call <hi>Piterones,</hi> the Spaniards <hi>di Pietro,</hi> dividing into many branches, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weave the land, and compoſe many Iſlands, by the <hi>Negroes</hi> called <hi>Cagaſian</hi>; where at an ebbing tide they find Amber-gris: for which cauſe the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> built a good Town there, co-inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Portugueſes</hi> and <hi>Negroes</hi>; where they live ſo ſtrangely, 'tis hard to know a Chriſtian from a Pagan, nor is it eaſie to judge who lives the better; there are at leaſt two thouſand, Chriſtians onely by name, living and dying like Pagans.</p>
               <p>After this River there are two more, <hi>Capor</hi> and <hi>Tanabaſira,</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from a high Mountain, called <hi>Machamala,</hi> where ſtands a great rock of Chryſtal, with divers Pyramids of the ſame, hanging from the top downwards; almoſt entirely in the air, two or three ſpans diſtant from the ground, which ſeems a great wonder, for touching it with the leaſt fillip, it ſounds like a bell. They ſay 'tis a congelation, made ſo by the heat of the Sun, which melting the foot of the Rock, left theſe points hanging in the air. 'Tis for a truth that certain Magicians on a feaſt, carried their Idols thither, whither they ran from all ſides to the ſacrifice, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand notwithſtanding loſt their lives, and the Prieſts in the firſt place; for making their ſacrifice and ſuffumigation at the foot of the Chryſtall rock, the roof at which theſe Pyramids hung, ſhook, ſo as they broke and cruſhed to pieces the greater part of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98515:170"/>
them. The Devil having not power to hinder the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie heate of the Sacrifices from diſſolving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelations, ſince which time no one comes near this Chryſtall grotte.</p>
               <p>Something farther North there are other great Rivers, which render this Province of <hi>Serrilyonna</hi> as a pack of Iſlands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly over againſt the mouth of one of them, there are two very pleaſant and good, the one called <hi>Toro,</hi> where are rocks called St. <hi>Anne,</hi> which bear pearl oyſters, yet they go not to fiſh for them, by reaſon of Sea-monſters, which have ſwallowed ſome who ventured.</p>
               <p>In one degree to the South, lye the Iſlands <hi>Dolos</hi> and <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente,</hi> inhabited with Dates, Sugar-canes, Citrons, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Cattell, covered with Rice, Millet, and long Pepper.</p>
               <p>To conclude, theſe Blacks are governed by a King, and have Judges who adminiſter juſtice to them, whom they call <hi>Foncos.</hi> At certain times the King in a various coloured robe, comes into a room hang'd with mat, ſet round with ſeats for Counſellours, whom they call <hi>Seitequi,</hi> and Advocates to plead for both parties. The Counſellors ſpeak their opinion, and the King gives ſentence, which is immediately executed.</p>
               <p>When the King of <hi>Guinalla</hi> dies, who governs many kingdoms, there go twelve <hi>Seitequi,</hi> in long gowns of divers colours, made of feathers, with twelve trumpetters before them, ſounding the more dolefully, by reaſon of a certain ſkin they make uſe of, for rendering the note more ſharp, and proclaim his death: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon every one comes out of his houſe; muſſled in a white cloath: while the allyes of the deceaſed aſſemble to elect another. They take the corps and waſh it, burn the bowels before their Idol, and preſerve the aſhes to be embalmed with his body. His Funerals are not celebrated till the next moon, when the people aſſemble from all parts of his dominion, bringing balm, incenſe, amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris, white and black, muſk, and other aromaticks, to burn and perfume his body; which then ſix principall perſons, in robes of white ſilke, bear to his Sepulcher, flutes and hoboyes ſounding mournfully, and attended with a concourſe of people cloathed in white cloth, ſadly ſinging and lamenting. The Princes who are in election are mounted on horſes capariſoned with white, and themſelves cloathed with the like. The corps laid in the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment well cloſed and cimented, they return to the Palace to feaſt and make good cheer. On the morrow is the election of a new King, and as they ſay, 'tis made according to divine inſpiration, without favour or affection. Then four <hi>Bacharin,</hi> or twelve <hi>Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tequi</hi> go to his houſe, bind him and lay him upon a <hi>Palanquin,</hi> four carry him to the Palace, where the chief <hi>Bachir</hi> unbinds him, gives him three rude laſhes with a whip, he being on his knees
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:98515:170"/>
makes a ſpeech of remonſtrance to him; then takes him by the beard or ear, and ſayes to him, If I deliver you this Scepter will you bring ſuch a ſhame upon me, as to be a Tyrant to your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? whereto he anſwers <hi>nec Bachir,</hi> that is, no my Lord. The other then ſtriking harder ſayes, do you promiſe this by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, he anſwers <hi>Nec Bachis Ameleichina,</hi> which is, before the Almighty God, I promiſe it. Then they veſt him in Royall robes, put a triple Scepter in his right hand, a lance in his left; then that perſon caſts himſelf at his feet, and craves his pardon; this done, he goes in triumph through the Town, where all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and bring him preſents.</p>

This coaſt is of 200. leagues in right line, lying on the ſame bound, and buts upon the River St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> where Captain <hi>Velaſco</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> landed, who found it to be a good air, the Countrey well peopled, and full ſtocked with cattle: in the middle of the River he went upon an Iſland ſo covered with pidgeons, they could not paſſe for treading on them. He ſayes the people called <hi>Piperons</hi> were giants of ten foot high, but kind and affable. This Captain <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſco</hi> thought this gulf had been an arm of the Sea, and ſailed upwards above 200. leagues, meeting with divers habitations, where they live meerly upon veniſon and fiſh, butter and cheeſe.

inſtead of bread have another ſubſtance which is very taſtefull, 'tis a root whereof being dryed they make meale, then taking odoriferous flowers, they boile them together in earthen pots, ſcum them, and put thereto a good quantity of milke and ſalt, then binding this cloſe in goat-ſkins, they lay it for two or three daies in the ſun, and it becomes firm as <hi>Parmaſan</hi> cheeſe, which they eat for excellent bread.</p>

The <hi>Canaries,</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>Fortunate,</hi> had that appellation from ſome terrible and ſanguinary dogs which were there, going in packs like ſheep, and at this day there is abundance of them exceeding fierce and dangerous. Of theſe Iſlands there is the grand <hi>Canari, Tenerif, Palma, Gomora, du Fez, Fortaventura,</hi> and others leſſe, to about 28. degrees.</p>
               <p>They afford divers curioſities, amongſt which Mount <hi>Pic</hi> in <hi>Tenerif</hi>; which I eſteem to be one of the higheſt on the earth, <hi>Libanus</hi> it ſelf is not ſo high by halfe, much leſſe Mount <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> for it may be diſcovered at 120. miles diſtance, and is the firſt land the Marriners diſcover at ſea, when they come from <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not to be aſcended but two moneths in the year, <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> for the extreme colds, and becauſe 'tis commonly covered with ſnow, which cooles the ayre to ſuch a degree, that one cannot breath upon it without iminent danger of life. From the top of this, the reſt of the Iſlands are all diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and amongſt them one which ſeems rather an illuſion then a reality: For one plainly views the Iſle, and go to the place you find nothing. They have three names for it, the <hi>Fortunate,</hi> the <hi>Inchanted,</hi> and the <hi>Not to be found</hi>: and there is no more to be learned of it, only the common people ſay 'tis an Iſland inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſtians,<note place="margin">The fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſland</note> and that God prohibits they ſhould be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for my part I have ſeen it as I have the others, and I believe 'tis conceal'd with clouds which are exhal'd from the abundance of freſh water there, which render it ſo obſcure to be found out.</p>

               <p>In the Iſland of Iron is that miraculous tree, the leaves whereof diſtill water, which ſuffices the inhabitants for drink. The tree is alwaies hooded with a thin cloud, of colour between gray and white, and never extenuates for wind nor tempeſt, nor ſuffers any motion, whence is deduced all the liquor, which the tree emits ſo plentifully into ceſterns placed for the purpoſe, that it waters both the Inhabitants and the heards of the whole Iſland, there being no other water at all, ſo as without this 'twould lye waſte and deſert, and by this is rendered inhabitable and fruitfull.</p>
               <p>Having taken in proviſions at the Canaries, we continued our courſe towards the <hi>Deſſeada,</hi> croſſing the great pacifick gulph, which may be ſaid one of the calmeſt Seas of the world; for during the fourty dayes we were upon it, we perceived not the leaſt alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but an air or gentle gale blew equally and conſtantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing; ſo as veſſels are there almoſt alwaies driven by the Poupe, without ſcarce ever uſing ſaile for above two thouſand four hundred and ninety two miles to <hi>Deſſeada</hi>; which takes name from the deſire they have to get thither, there being no other land betwixt that and the Canaries, paſſing the gulph, the voyage ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up ſometimes thirty two dayes, ſometimes thirty five, as it happens.</p>

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:98515:173"/>
they affect their bow more than their club. They have ſome Prieſts in their Gentiliſm, whom they call <hi>Chaouris,</hi> who ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize certain ceremonies and feaſts. There being a neceſſity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in freſh water, ſome of the ſhip of Cape <hi>Moulini,</hi> would needs go on ſhore, and but that ſome of the Company diſſwaded him, the Captain himſelf had gone with them, howſoever he ſent the Maſters mate, with twenty reſolute men and twelve Muſqueteers. Our Captain <hi>Noguena</hi> ſeeing this raſh enterprize, knowing the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Countrey, immediately ſent a ſhore thirty of his men, whereof twenty were muſqueteers to aſſiſt them: but they were no ſooner at the fountain, but they perceived two hundred <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages</hi> making towards them, and had they not by the perſwaſions of ſome caſt up a bulwark, the ſucceſſe had proved worſe with them. The muſquetteers playing on them, the <hi>Sauages</hi> with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour began to run, having loſt four or five of their men, whereupon ours thought they had been freed of them, but were amazed when they perceived them rallyed, and advancing from another ſide came on with ſuch fury, that had it not been for good conduct ours had had the worſt of it; for our Muſqueteers were ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed they knew not how to give fire, and for all ours could do, they left ſeven or eight of our men behind them; for with main ſtrength they bore down our Barricado, but by Gods aſſiſtance ours repulſed them ſo vigorouſly, that ſome of theirs remained on the place, and we were relieved very ſeaſonably.</p>
               <p>They had a reſolution to fetch off their fellowes, but ſeeing they could not, retreated, and left us in peace; one that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alive was quite amazed, and made us good laughing, with his mows and monkey faces. He was ſtark naked, round viſaged, and flat-noſed like a dog. We aſked in whom he believed, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in <hi>Toquilla</hi> and <hi>Toupan,</hi> that is the Sun and the thunder. He was inſtructed in the Faith, and afterwards baptized.

               <p>They have a tree called <hi>Sarboul,</hi> growing naturally in the woods bears fruit all the year, 'tis firm as a <hi>Meloun,</hi> and looks like thoſe golden apples which in <hi>Spain</hi> they call <hi>Berengenas.</hi> A kind of flower they alſo make of fiſh, as they do in <hi>Braſile,</hi> drying it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sun, 'tis ſharp and grates the throat of thoſe that are not uſed to it.

Betwixt theſe two Iſlands were we overtaken with one of theſe ſtormes, which aſſaulted us with ſuch fury, as if all the Infernals had been broke looſe, for it bore away ſailes and yards, tore the cordage with other moſt prodigious effects; it roſe all in an inſtant, and before we could think of it, caſt away a veſſel of our Company laden with Souldiers, going to relieve <hi>Truxillo,</hi> infeſted by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We ſaved divers of them by a bridge of planks caſt into the Sea, and faſtened to the Ship with a ſtrong cable. The firſt time we ſaved twenty ſix men and a woman, whoſe coats had kept her floating on the water: But the ſecond time we caſt it forth when there were more upon it, cloſe by the Ship ſide the cable broke, and all theſe poor people ſo near recovery periſhed; and we had not ſtrength to make another we were ſo num'd and ſtrark, with the cold this wind brings along with it, ſo as 'twas lamentable to behold theſe poor people periſh for want of help; and no aſſiſtance could be had from the other veſſel, being in the evening ſo driven from us that we could hear no more of it. All

the night we heard the ſad cryes of people, calling for help, which we knew not how to give them, and when day came, we ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either of ſhip or perſon.</p>
               <p>Some of them died as ſoon as they got aboard our ſhip. Amongſt the reſt they had a Capuchin Father worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for his conſtancy and reſolution,<note place="margin">A violent tempeſt.</note> who in the very ſea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, and called upon them to dye well, and recommend themſelves into the hands of God, heard their confeſſions, and gave them abſolution, and at laſt died amongſt them encouraging and giving conſolations to the very laſt. This tempeſt conſiſts not of a ſingle wind, but of all the four together, which ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber a veſſel, that it cannot ſtir neither forward nor backward. The day brought us ſome comfort, but we were ſtill perſecuted with the tempeſt, and waves that flew upon us with ſuch violence, that at every blow we thought we ſhould have periſhed, as I believe we had, had we not reſolved to caſt all over-board. Then without further diſpute, or more words, ſeven or eight of us taking a draught of wine, a little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invigourate us in our extreme feebleneſſe, we betooke to caſt our fraught over-board, Cloth, Tapeſtry, Camlets, Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes, Corrall, Hunney, Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſuch celerity, that in an houre we caſt more over-board then was laded in a day; and twas happy we did ſo, for immediately we perceiv'd the Veſſell to be more luſty; and I and my partners had the happineſſe to ſee the goods we laded to beare our charges, caſt into the ſea in the firſt place, which as little troubled us, as if they had been none of ours, being ſatisfy'd with the fruition of our lives; after all we were conſtrain'd to cut down the maine Maſt, one of the ſayles was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furl'd, which made a ſtrange noiſe, and exceedingly annoy'd the Veſſell; wherefore the Captain commanded the ſaylers to go up and furle it, but at that time he was ill heard, and worſe obey'd;<note place="margin">Aroucane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Tempeſt continu'd, and the Veſſell being light, could not uphold the Maſt againſt the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous force of the ſtorme and the waves, which took ſome of our men over-board: whereupon we down with the main Maſt, but in the fall the cordage broke, and is tumbled into the ſea, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome men along with it, the veſſel reeling quite down on one ſide with the weight of the maſt was immediately filled with water, and recoyling to the other ſide, very many were loſt, without poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to relieve them, the reſt of us left deſolate to ſorrow and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.

The veſſel being aſſaulted by ſo many ſeveral winds, cannot move any way except ſome one wind be mightier than the reſt: For theſe veſſels are not by half ſo able as ours are.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe winds cauſe ſo unſufferable a frigidity, that one cannot endure to look into the air, cut like a razor, and make ones limbs ſtiffe and immoveable as a piece of wood. For my part my face was hard and ſtrark as any ſtone. I am of opinion the Devill comes in it, for I believe that naturally no wind can break a ſtrong cable, as 'twere a thread. At laſt as it pleaſed our good God the tempeſt ceaſed, and the ordinary <hi>Breezes</hi> return. By good fortune we had one ſayle left in reſerve, which we uſed to our advantage in the beſt manner we could, ſcarce finding rope ſufficient for it, the tempeſt had ſo broken our cordage, ſo we then ſayled on. 'Tis true the ſea was yet ſo turbulent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious, that we were as fearful as ever; for this kind of ſtorm is more dangerous in the end then the begining; and we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the waves, like two engaged armies plying one another with continual aſſaults, without intermiſſion. But in fine, it became a little calmer, and we came in view of <hi>Cape</hi> S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> a point of the Iſle of <hi>Cuba</hi> diſcoverable a long way off; till we arrived there the ſtorm left us not: nor do I know that I had ſo famous an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in all my voyages in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> though in my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> three leagues off <hi>Candia</hi> our ſhip ſunk, in the depth of Winter, and about mid-night: which was nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to theſe diabolical <hi>

Now tis neceſſary to underſtand there commonly blowes a winde they call <hi>Brizes,</hi> which carries Veſſells by the <hi>Poope,</hi> from the eaſt to the <hi>Indies,</hi> which winde riſes in 28 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Artick</hi> altitude, towards the <hi>Torrid,</hi> following the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſe and rapid motion of the Heavens in that Hemiſphere, more like a gentle blaſt, or a breathing of the ayre, then a winde, ſo quietly it beares veſſells along, without any alteration, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry violence; as in other Parts among the Tropicks, where the ſtrongeſt carries it his way, and where diverſe Raigne according to the diverſe times and ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>The other windes are <hi>Tramontone,</hi> or north, ſouth, eaſt, weſt, ſouth-eaſt, north-weſt, north-eaſt, ſouth-weſt. The <hi>Brizes</hi> come eaſt-ward, and ſerve very well from the <hi>Canaries</hi> to <hi>Cuba</hi>: from <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>Canaries</hi> the voyage is more difficult, by reaſon of the diverſe windes, which blow in the Gulfe <hi>de Las Yequas</hi>; and betwixt that and the Continent are other windes, which blow oppoſite, and often force to lye along in the Haven in expectation of a faire gale.</p>
               <p>But as theſe <hi>Brize</hi> windes in going, afford a delightfull accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, ſo in returne they prove our vexation: for we muſt go without the Tropicks to fetch the ſouth-weſt, otherwiſe we
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:98515:178"/>
have the <hi>Brizes</hi> in our teeth, which force us to beare up higher for others, and be perpetually tacking about to the roade of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta</hi>: In ſo much that one may ſooner go twice, then return once from the Indies; the return is ſo labourous, I meane for them who come from new <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Seuille</hi>; for from <hi>Peru</hi> they have the ſame Navigation, as the ſhips that go by the <hi>Brizes</hi> from the <hi>Canaries</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and by the ſouth ſea. Coming from <hi>Peru,</hi> they have the winde in the Poope as farr as <hi>Lima,</hi> in twelve degrees, which carries them to 17, to the <hi>Port Guatulio</hi> in new <hi>Spain.</hi> Then they muſt go fetch the ſouth-weſt in the elevation of 27 degrees above: nor is there any certainty of it, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theſe windes raigne there; ſometimes the north-weſt, and <hi>Tramontane</hi> invade the Regions: They call them nevertheleſſe <hi>Brizes,</hi> as coming from the motion of the ſame Hemiſphere; ſometimes they bring along with them ſo exceeding a frigidity, that though the ſea ever naturally yeild a certain warmth of it ſelfe, I never felt ſo much cold as in theſe parts; and but for the Wines we laid in at our return, we had ſuffered much more.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Admirable windes.</note>'Tis then certain, that they who go to the Indies muſt make uſe of theſe proſperous windes, and to gaine them muſt keep in the loweſt elevation poſſible, for the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they come to the Equinoctiall, the more certaine and conſtant are theſe <hi>Brize</hi> windes, as nearer to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <hi>AMerica</hi> for the greateſt part is not inhabited, by reaſon of the huge barren and cold mountains, and little plain for a long way, abundance of ſandy and barren forreſts, as in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> where there is neither habitation nor commodity of living; huge trees bearing nouriſhment neither for man nor beaſt; onely in ſome parts there are trees yeild ſome refreſhment to paſſengers, with a leaf like the vine and fruit like the Quince, but more ſoft, and in taſte like the apples of <hi>Italy,</hi> called <hi>Mele Roſe,</hi> but ſweeter.

                  <note place="margin">Three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of <hi>America.</hi>
                  </note>Of the three Regions <hi>America</hi> may be divided into, there are the two outmoſt, the high and the low, and the interiour. The lower is along the Sea coaſt, hot and moiſt, having few or no rains in many places unpeopled, by reaſon of the deep ſands, marſhes, and ſtanding waters, which make the Countrey unwholſome. But the plains from <hi>Peru</hi> to <hi>Chila</hi> are more temperate, by reaſon of the freſh and fruitfull vales, whereof there are ſtore.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the land of <hi>Hamen,</hi> cold and dry, well peopled, plentifull in herbage, and rich in mines.</p>
               <p>The interiour is the beſt, and 'twas the <hi>Spaniards</hi> kind fortune or rather Providence, that landed them there at firſt: for had it been any where elſe, they had never or with more difficulty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their deſign, for the ſcarcity of commodities to live upon after their diet, very different from that of the Natives. But at the very firſt they fell upon the beſt parts, as the Iſles of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> and <hi>Cuba</hi>: and on the continent on the one ſide new <hi>Spain,</hi> on the other <hi>Peru,</hi> and many other, all good Countries, full, and temperate, which yeilded them ſuch plenty of commodities for livelihood, and rich mettals. For this middle diviſion abounds
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:98515:179"/>
corn, fruit, cattle, paſtures, and forreſts, the air wholſome, and the Countrey pleaſant and commodious.</p>
               <p>They have cattle in great abundance, as ſheep, goats, beeves, horſes, and others. They preſerve a ſtock of wild beeves for their hides, wherewith they lade ſhips for <hi>Europe</hi>; and make a good traffick of them to ſupply our vanity for coaches boots, and other uſes of leather. The ſoyle in ſome parts is proper enough for vines, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will admit no plantation of them, for taking away the profit of the wine brought from <hi>Spain,</hi> for which they carry back good gold and ſilver. But notwithſtanding their prohibitions in New-<hi>Spain,</hi> they have planted them for eaſe of their burthenſome tributes; for they made no conſcience to impoſe fifty or ſixty crowns upon a tun of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wine; which they get at a better rate upon the place, where they proſper excellently well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mexico,</hi> or New-<hi>Spain,</hi> where one ſtill aſcends unperceivably, is a good and fruitful Countrey, rather better than <hi>Peru</hi> towards <hi>Cuſco</hi> and <hi>Gouamanga,</hi> and <hi>Aroquipa,</hi> which is likewiſe very fertile; but this is without compariſon, and would be yet better if the Mountaines were nearer, to mitigate the exceſſive heat. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> women affect it ſo much that they will come two thouſand leagues by ſea, leaving their Native Countrey to ſettle here, and this in no ſmall number: For in the Fleet that went one thouſand five hundred ninety two, they reckon that in thirty veſſels that were caſt away, there periſhed above 800. women, and many ſmall infants: Some were going with their huſbands, others with their friends, and others of their own inclination; and not a year but they tranſport a great number. And 'tis no wonder they expoſe themſelves to this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, living exceeding miſerably in <hi>Spain,</hi> where there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſingle women that work or worſe for their living.</p>

                  <hi>America,</hi> the new world is divided into two principall parts, North and South, both as 'twere Peninſula's, faſtened to by the ſtreight or neck of land, of <hi>Nombre di dios</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> and betwixt them is comprized the great Archipelagus of all thoſe Iſlands, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillias, Luccaes, Barlouente, Sotauente</hi> and others, whereof we ſpoke already, towards the great <hi>Mexican</hi> gulph.</p>

               <p>Upon a Sunday, coming on ſhore to celebrate Maſſe, there came innumerable Savages to admire our Sevice and Ceremonies, as a thing altogether new to them. They preſented the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſheep, Kids and goats, and they might have taken off the common what Cows and Cattel they would.</p>
               <p>A people otherwiſe not very Military, but exceeding ſimple, and uſe Barkes, like the <hi>Braſilian Canoes.</hi> The Captaine, in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, gave to the cheife of them a handſome ſword and dagger, who by ſignes let him underſtand, he had nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne him but 50 Cows, and 200 ſheep, deſiring him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

them for accomodation for his company.</p>
               <p>Part of them he took, and gave him a Coate of <hi>Azure</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feta, which he highly eſteemed and admir'd, and went confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently abord them with a ſcore of his men; and at ſeverall times came little boats loaded with fruit, which this Lord had provided to preſent the Captain with; at his departure he fired ſome Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which ſtrangely amazed theſe poor people, who thought the World at an end; they go cloath'd with skins, commodiouſly ſew'd together.</p>
               <p>In the Land of <hi>Labrador,</hi> and beyond Northward, are abundance of Mountains and Forreſts, where there are numbers of wilde beaſts, and amongſt others huge beares, and great Griffins all white, which are nothing like thoſe of the Eaſt, or <hi>Africa,</hi> which are gray, only a little red under the belly, but both of them have but two feet, and not foure as they are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

               <p>A little higher lies the frozen ſea,<note place="margin">The fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Sea.</note> which ſome ſay is not a ſea frozen, but land covered with ice.

               <p>They have not any Townes, but Villages, where on little hills they live in timber houſes, covered with hides of Beifes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſts. The people are Whites, kinde and affable. This Coaſt extends to the ſpace of 400 leagues, there is a large river they call <hi>de tres Hermanos,</hi> which ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> were about to croſſe, but could not for ſnows. Some imagine here is a ſtreight, that goes into the Orientall ſea, others that tis an Arme of the ſea only.</p>
               <p>Some take this for the river <hi>Rio Neuado,</hi> which on one ſide coaſts this Countrey for 200 leagues; on the other ſide, to the Bay of <hi>Maluas,</hi> and by the Gulph <hi>Meroſco</hi> lyes the Iſle of Devills, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led becauſe they hold it to be haunted with ſpirits, as many of the eaſtern Iſlands are, as I obſerved in another place.</p>

No man hath more than one wife, except the King, who may have two. They compoſe their year of 12. moons, all their commerce is in exchange. They have excellent remedies for all diſeaſes, by means of their patriot herbs, wherein they have good knowledge, amongſt others they have one called <hi>Guachi,</hi> againſt choler. The <hi>Spaniard Ayllon</hi> recounted many other particulars of <hi>Chicora,</hi> that 'twas of great extent, and contained many Provinces.</p>

                     </gap>n,</hi> who took poſſeſſion of the Coaſt and Continent for King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, which hath continued from time to time to this day.</p>
               <p>The Countrey hath not any Mines of gold, as they know of, but white Corall it yeilds, called <hi>Eſurqui,</hi> and ſome Jaſper and caſſidone ſtones, with abundance of Beavers, wherein conſiſts their traffick.</p>
               <p>They have diſcovered a tree, called <hi>Aneda,</hi> or <hi>Zuaboya,</hi> much like our nut-tree, the decoction whereof is a ſoveraine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remedy for a diſeaſe, common in this Country, which infects them like a plague, from head to foot, with a violent contraction of the ſinews, ſtinking breath, and mouth running with purtefica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as at <hi>Scurbut,</hi> and at laſt ſeizes on the vitall ſpirits, and with extreme torments finiſhes their lives: but Providence hath furniſhed them with this remedy <hi>Aneda,</hi> as <hi>Carter</hi> in his Voyages obſerves.</p>
               <p>All theſe Countreys of <hi>Bacaleos, Caneda, Hochelaga,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under the name of <hi>New-found-Lands,</hi> or new <hi>France,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented theſe many yeares by the <hi>French</hi> for fiſhing of Cods. For in the exact deſcription, I refer myſelfe to Hiſtories, and publiſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; only I will repeat what ſeverall, who have travailed it, have told me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canada</hi> extends it ſelfe by a point ſouth-weſt, within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Goulmaran,</hi> coming up to the River <hi>Diquero,</hi> where there is a ſpacious Town of the ſame name, otherwiſe called <hi>Sougoubal,</hi> where the King keepes his Court; towards the ſea it joynes with <hi>Baraleol,</hi> and the New-found-Lands; the Natives of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtature, favoured like them of new <hi>Mexico,</hi> heavy like a gilt <hi>Morian,</hi> they are of a cruell nature, warring upon their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and there are of them that eat Mans fleſh: they inhabit up as farr as the great river <hi>Hochelaga,</hi> and uſe boats made of the barke of a tree, at the getting of this barke, they uſe particular ceremonies, and prayers to their Idols, to protect them in warr in which they are aſſiſted with Virgins dedicated to the Gods, as our Religious.</p>
               <p>Some amongſt them are of more humanity and aſſaſibility, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting themſelves only to fiſhing, which they will willingly do for ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>The King derives himſelfe from the firſt ſtock which peopled
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:98515:182"/>
world after the deluge, whereof they have ſome light.</p>
               <p>They bear great reverence to the Sun for the light and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit they receive. They feed on bread made of fiſh, and the like as in <hi>Florida</hi>; live in common, and diverſe families under a roof. Men have ſeveral wives, whom they marry with little ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and leave them when they pleaſe. Their King they call the great <hi>Sagamos</hi> or <hi>Sahagama,</hi> that is the great King, whom they carry upon a <hi>Sindela</hi> of cotton, mixt with feathers, very curious and artificiall: women wait at his table, nor will he truſt men with any thing of his diet; as he paſſes by, all bow with great reſpect, none is capable of ſucceſſion but the eldeſt Son, all the other Children are ſubjects; for which cauſe the other wives, rather chooſe abortion, then to live to ſee it.</p>
               <p>After the Kings deceaſe; they live perpetual widows, and in ſigne of mourning immediately put on the <hi>Singaye,</hi> make inciſions in their face, then laying gum on a fire, hold over their faces that ſmoak may colour the ſcarifications, with this gum, and oyle of date-ſtones, the meaner ſort make their face black and orange-tawny, their hair hangs looſe about their ſhoulders, having nothing about their head but the <hi>Singaye,</hi> which they wear as the <hi>Moors</hi> do their hair, appearing both under and over it. This is made of feathers of a bird they call <hi>Tanaps:</hi> the <hi>Americans</hi> eſteem this bird ominous, when they meet it. The vulgar women wear other plumes with cotton, but they neither marry the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>The men wear apparel of Deer-ſkins uſefully contrived, one arm uncovered, and ſo they wear their garment like a ſcarf, their breeches like the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but not ſo long. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is exceeding cold, and lyable to earth-quakes, for which they ſacrifice to their Idols, whereof they have one in figure, half a man, and half a ſerpent, which they call <hi>Andouagni,</hi> and adorn him in a rich habit, and their Country diamonds, which are not ſo good as others.</p>
               <p>They have mines, but none very good, fruits of many ſorts, and amongſt others a tree called <hi>Coltan,</hi> which yeilds an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent liquor that they make drink of, their King drinking nothing elſe. Vines grow there in abundance, naturally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour, exceedingly loaded with grapes, but they have not the ſkill to make wine of them, except they have been lately ſhewed: they have pumpions and gourds which they eat roaſted, oyle out of Date-ſtones, very ſweet and ſoveraign in diſeaſes. One tree there is which takes away any feaver in few hours. They are great hunters, and wear engines like raquets on their feet, whereby they go the lighter on the ſnow in purſuit of their chace. Of late years the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have changed the appellations the <hi>French</hi> gave theſe Countries, of New-<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> to New-<hi>England,</hi> New-<hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:98515:182"/>
and New <hi>Brittanny</hi> above, before called <hi>Labrador,</hi> and <hi>Eſtotiland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goulmaran</hi> is the name of a river and a country, where the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages chief food is fiſh, of which they have abundance, and drying it in the ſun make flower, which they eat without other baking: they eat the fleſh of their enemies; they houſe in caverns or cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins of ſtraw, without either apparel or houſhold-ſtuffe more then <hi>Gourds</hi> which the ſoyle produces in abundance: great ſtore of cattle which fatten themſelves without further care; they live in common, and admit no ſtrangers to inhabit amongſt them. Their mortal enemies are the <hi>Siniga</hi> neighbouring Mountaneers, covered at halfes with beaſt ſkins; and theſe nations as profeſſed enemies, eat one another. For arms, they have ſtaves, bows, and ſlings, wherein they are very effectual, being ſtrong and good wreſtlers. They lead into the field troops of fierce and ſtrong dogs, and fling them the head, hands, and feet of an enemy for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; they only ſpare their wives to whom they yield all honour, and marry with them. There is not amongſt them any ſort of Science, Learning, or Character: they believe the ſoul immortal, and that the Sun created the world, whom they call <hi>Courcourant</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Moon <hi>Beleida:</hi> live like brothers, without any Law of property, every man hath his wife, and with her is ſatisfied; no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of ſin amongſt them, vice nor vertue: all equal, onely a particular reverence to one chief as their King, whom they call <hi>Caraybalan:</hi> They ſhave their head and beard with a root called <hi>Meite,</hi> which dryed at the Sun, they make into powder, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it plaiſter-wiſe all night. Maids deflowr'd before Matrimony, never marry, though the fact is no diſhonour to them.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Singay</hi> by the advantage of their mountains, often fall upon them; they have a ſort of trunks through which they will blow their poyſoned arrowes with ſtrange vigour, and wound incurably. They are of admirable Footmanſhip, and will fly like Grayhounds before a purſuing enemy, and on ſuch occaſions their dogges ſtand them in good ſtead. They ſcatter about the fields certain poyſoned paſte for the enemies dogges, and leſt their own ſhould be taken with it, they hold them up tyed: he that hath two with him thinks himſelf ſecure. When the dogge winds any thing, if the Maſter cryes <hi>Taip,</hi> the dogge ſtayes till his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath viewed his prey: they carry burthens like horſes. Their houſes are of ſtraw, and their burrowes are fortified with Timber-Palizadoes, which they poyſon againſt the invading enemy. Of the ſame ſtraw they cover their houſes, they make bridges, and never make bridge of ſtone; which ſtraw-bridges are of good firmneſſe. They have ſome houſes made of earth, mingled with chopt ſtraw. The <hi>Charaybalan</hi> or King, walks through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with no attendance but dogges, and allowes no man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him. Theſe dogges are his guard, being very fierce;<note place="margin">Military dogs.</note> and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:98515:183"/>
when they find any thing, they firſt look on their Maſters face, to underſtand if they ſhould eat it or not, and ſtand for good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: the enemy hath ſtrong apprehenſion of them. Theſe dogges have great tayles like Bulles, and it hath been knowne that they have aſſaulted and defeated a good body of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo as the race of them is prized at a high rate.</p>

               <p>This is a country of wide circuit towards 34. degrees, having on the Eaſt the Channel of <hi>Bahama</hi> the <hi>Lucays</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> on the Weſt <hi>Mexico</hi> and the gulph <hi>Panuco,</hi> on the South it looks upon <hi>Cuba</hi> or <hi>Jucatan,</hi> and on that ſide extends above 200. leagues to the 24. degree: on the North lyes <hi>Canada,</hi> New <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Auanares,</hi> towards this point or tongue of land, in form of an <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> 'tis dangerous ſayling for the oppoſite winds and currents of water. The natives are ſtrong and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, eat their enemies of war, but their friends and confederates never, not for any extremity. The men eradicate their beards to appear more lovely and pleaſing to the women: pierce their noſe and ears, and hang in rings and jewels: they marry not till 40 years of age, and the woman 25. holding that the children will be more robuſtious. Women before matrimony obſerve not chaſtity, and without diſhonour: but after marriage they will forfeit life as ſoon as their fidelity.</p>
               <p>North they border on the <hi>Aunares,</hi> and beyond them the <hi>Abar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daos,</hi> a cruell and wicked people, continually in warre, and uſe a thouſand ſubtleties to enſnare their enemies, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by night, firſt laying their Engines or Caltrops, then give the Alarme, and ſeem to flye; ſo the enemies purſuing, are often taken in theſe trappes; as they likewiſe take wilde beaſts: as they on the other ſide make conceal'd pits for them to fall in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:98515:183"/>There are alſo the <hi>Jagares,</hi> a people ſo ſwift, they boaſt they can take a Deere in plain running, and indeed the Deere there are not ſo wilde. For they feed in fields, in Heards like Cows, whereof they make their ordinary ſuſtenance. <hi>Ponce de Leon</hi> ſayes he ſent one of theſe people with a letter, and ſome proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his company, and in few houres he went and came thirty 1.</p>
               <p>They are cloathed with skins of beaſts, but cheifly Deere, which they dreſſe very artificially.</p>
               <p>Then there are the <hi>Apalchen</hi> and <hi>Chahamo,</hi> people intirely barbarous and brutiſh, who adore and ſacrifice to devills, that appeare to them in diverſe formes. The whole Countrey abounds in all Commodities; as fleſh of all ſorts, and fiſh, and they ſay there are Mines of Gold and Silver, whereof they make no great account. They have a King, whom foure of the Principall amongſt them beare in the skin of a <hi>Saliabe,</hi> a beaſt like a Hart: appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with skins, and ſet with feathers; they adore the Sun, and believe the immortality of the ſoule: and that ſome go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and others to the bowells of the earth.

               <p>For Armes they uſe Bows, and poyſoned Arrowes, as doth the greater part of <hi>America.</hi> They are much given to Hunt and Fiſh. For more of the deſcription of the Country, and the manners of the people, I refer my ſelfe to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>I will only make mention of one miracle in the Countrey, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the <hi>Licentiados, Ayllon, Figuerra,</hi> and other <hi>Spaniards</hi> of Quality; 'tis a fountain of Youth, whereof the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunke, not only mitigates all maladies, but makes the old young again, reſtoring decayed ſtrength and vigour, whereof they ſaw the experience in an old decrepid man, quite worne out, who became vigorous and luſty, that married and got chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

               <p>Certain Indians fiſhing, ſaw the miſerable condition of this poor man, and advertiſed his comerades in the Fort, who incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt their Captaine for this and other rigours killed him, and fetched back the ſouldier halfe dead with hunger: then choſe another Captaine, and conſtrained by neceſſity to return into <hi>France</hi>; by help of the Indians, they built a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bark, nailed with wooden pinnes, and fitted with Sayles of ſuch linnen as they had, victualled with the round corne of the countrey, they call <hi>Mays,</hi> and powdered fleſh but were driven to ſuch exigent by the way, they were fain to caſt lots, who ſhould be ſo unhappy, as to be food for the reſt.</p>

               <p>FRom <hi>Florida</hi> by degrees we arrive at New <hi>Spaine,</hi> or the kingdom of <hi>Mexico.</hi> A countrey extending in length and breadth from the River <hi>Tanaſco</hi> or <hi>Griſalue</hi> towards the Weſt, or <hi>Jucatan,</hi> to the Province of <hi>Caliacan,</hi> and the river Saint <hi>Michael</hi> bounded on the North with new <hi>Granada,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of new <hi>Mexico.</hi> On the South lyes the great gulph of the pacifick ſea of <hi>Mexico.</hi> On the Eaſt the River <hi>Panuco,</hi> and the ſkirts of <hi>Florida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The kingdome of <hi>Mexico</hi> is otherwiſe called <hi>Culbuca,</hi> and <hi>Anauas</hi> by the Inhabitants, it holds dominion from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuco</hi> to <hi>Dariene,</hi> which divides it from <hi>Peru.</hi> The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Provinces are <hi>Guatemala, Xaliſco, Chalcos, Taica, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choachan, Tlaſcalan, Acapulco, Culiacan, Tezuco, Teſcuco, Huaca-chalque, Huacachala, Claortomaca, Maxalcinco, Giſteca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>New <hi>Spaine</hi> is one of the moſt excellent Provinces of the New World, fully inhabited, pure ayre, abounding in corne, and all ſorts of graine, Cattle, Mines of Gold, and chiefely of Silver, wanting nothing but oyle and wine.</p>
               <p>The principal and capital town is <hi>Temiſtican</hi> or <hi>Temoxtitlan,</hi>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:98515:185"/>
or <hi>Temuiſtican,</hi> upon a Lake of thirty Leagues in circute, is contained threeſcore thouſand Houſes, at the time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took it, under the famous <hi>Ferdinand Cortez.</hi> The lake is of two waters, ſalt and freſh, by reaſon of the rivers that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. There are many other great Townes, but leſs then <hi>Mexico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before they received Chriſtianity, they were all great Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and given to ſtrange ſuperſtitions, many whereof they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill. Their Sacrifices were formidable, Fathers not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling to make their own children victims.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mexicans</hi> are an ingenuous people, and of experience in all ſorts of workes, particularly in Tapeſtry of feathers, where they have things artificially drawne to the life. The Soyle abounds in all ſorts of fruits, and commodities for livelihood, as well naturall as adventitious: even vines, whereof they have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, notwithſtanding the prohibition to plant any.</p>
               <p>True, in many parts the grapes come not to perfect maturity; by reaſon of the abundant rains in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> when the grapes begin to ripen, ſo as they ſoake raine, and corrupt, wherefore they are forced to eat them halfe green. Some have try'd to make wine, but it proves ſharp, and more like wine of quinces, then grapes.</p>
               <p>They have planted olive-trees, which come to good growth, and full of leaves, but without fruit. All ſorts elſe grow well and plentifully. The wine they drink comes all from <hi>Spaine,</hi> and is very deare, for it coſt five of us three crowns a day for our parts, and a good bargaine, the plenty of mony making all things deare, for a bed 12 realls a night.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Peru</hi> tis yet dearer, though they get very good wine and figs, as likewiſe in the Iſles of <hi>Barlouento,</hi> and <hi>Cuba.</hi> There are many Forreſts by the <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>Arcaboucos,</hi> ſtore of <hi>Ebony Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Country is not very populous, many more women then men, by reaſon warr and labour conſumes them.</p>
               <p>The extent of theſe Regions is admirable, nay infinite, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the few Inhabitants, and leſs agriculture; for this late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>Mexico</hi> contains above 15 Provinces, of above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand leagues in circuite, where there are as faire Towns and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as in <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p>The Inhabitants of old <hi>Mexico,</hi> do intirely apply themſelves to the Trades and wayes of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> being grown good Weavers, and make all ſorts of ſilke ſtuffs: in like manner they are docile and judicious, and ſuch as are become Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, follow the Doctrine moſt religiouſly.</p>

                  </note>The <hi>Mexicans</hi> derive themſelves originally from other parts, the Ancient Inhabitants were barbarous, and eat nothing but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon, which they called <hi>Chichimeques,</hi> and <hi>Otomies</hi>; then the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatalks</hi> came from the North, from Provinces, which ſince are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to New <hi>Mexica,</hi> who peopled, cultivated, and civiliz'd the ſoyle and Nation: But withall they introduced their ſtrange Idolatries, and horrible ſacrifices of men and infants, whereof they perpetrate abundance every yeare: Whereby 'tis very probable that not only this, but all the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys are inhabited with people deriv'd from the North, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Aſians</hi> and <hi>Europians</hi> may have paſſed by little and little by the Streights, either of Sea, or Land, as we have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Mexicans</hi> being well ſetled, choſe a King to Govern them, who was one <hi>Acamipixtſi,</hi> a <hi>Mexican</hi> Lord, who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a daughter of the King of <hi>Cublivacan,</hi> an ancient people of the Country: ſince which time they have ever had Kings, not by ſucceſſion, but Election, continued to the ninth and laſt King <hi>Montezuma,</hi> taken by <hi>Cortez</hi>: under which Kings they had diverſe Warrs, and tooke in many neighbors, augmenting it to a great ſtate.</p>
               <p>The King was not Elected by the Commons, but by 4 Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall of the Court, and had the Crowne from the hands of the <hi>Teſcaio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the King Elect, before he receives his Crown, is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to go fight the Enemy, and bring ſuch a number of Priſoners to their Sanguinary ſacrifices. If he faile in the firſt expedition, they excuſe it, but if the ſecond time, they poyſon him, and chooſe another. If he returne victorious, they conduct him with great ceremony to the Temple, where they make the great ſacrifice, with proceſſions, and muſick, through the Town. He was crowned with a Crown like a Miter, and every one made
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:98515:186"/>
oath to ſerve him to the laſt drop of bloud; then was conducted with great magnificence to the Pallace-Royal, the Electors called <hi>Laceocal,</hi> marching firſt, that is, Princes of the Lance, then the <hi>Lacaterret,</hi> or Thunder-bolts of men, who are the gallanteſt of the Cavaliers, then <hi>Hazeuocal,</hi> that is, bloud-ſhedders, and the <hi>Lilbancalqui,</hi> Knights of the black lance. Theſe four orders were his Majeſties privy Council: in the Town they had other Councils for adminiſtration of Juſtice. When the King went to the Temple, an hundred men marched before him with great bows taller than themſelves; then 100. more with long ſtaves with a hardbroad keen ſtone in the end, with which he will cut off a horſe-head; I have ſeen one cut a ſheep in two with it, thoſe they call <hi>a la a tilpeo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings Pallace is ſumptuous and magnificent, a Parke by it ſtored with wilde beaſts of all ſorts, ponds full of fiſh, with boates of rich worke, and cages for Birds. The Pallace is compoſed of ſeparate apartments, and ſeverall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations for the Courtiers, every one according to his dignitie and degree.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mexican</hi> Kings had high eſteem for men of valour, and rewarded them very amply, by which means they were ſo well ſerved in their wars, and got ſo many victories. Their weapons were clubs with keen ſtones, lances, pikes, a ſort of javelins, at the throwing whereof they were exceeding dextrous, bows, arrows, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle targets, and a head-piece with a plume of feathers; coats of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Bears, Tigers, and other beaſts-ſkins, great runners, and wraſtlers.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Montezuma</hi> in his Militia had an order of Knights, that from the Crown had their hair tyed with carnation ribbons, rich feathers, and a ſcarf of the ſame colour, who for every gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant atchievement they have done, have ſo many waves faſtened, and hanging over their ſhoulders. This King was of that order, as he is to be ſeen repreſented in his ſtatue at <hi>Chapultapes.</hi> This ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit was very ſtately, enriched with plumes of all colours, and makes the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deck themſelves with feathers in imitation, and adorn their horſes with them: another order of Knights there was called <hi>Agourlas,</hi> clad in another manner, and with other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; then there were the <hi>Ataroncos,</hi> the Tigers, the Blacks armed from head to foot in fight, the others half armed: Their cloaths of <hi>Combi,</hi> cotton and other things, theſe had licenſe to eat in gold and ſilver veſſels, a thing not allowed to others; who were apparelled with courſer cloathes, called <hi>Nequen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe firſt Knights lodge in the Kings Palace, and have their apartments amply accommodated, whom I cannot compare better than to the Mayl'd Knights at <hi>Malta,</hi> diſtinguiſhed in divers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, by the Titles of Princes, Eagles, Tigers, and Blacks. The reſt of his Valiant Militia lodged in other diviſions apart, aſſigned

them by the Council, and upon pain of death could not change their lodging. This Militia was ſo well ordered and diſciplined that they ſtroke, terrour in the neighbouring people. And what was moſt to be admired, that they could keep ſo many different Nations in concord, for the perfection of the Country drew people from all parts thither.<note place="margin">People of <hi>Mexica.</hi>
                  </note> There is one ſort of people amongſt them called <hi>Chalcas,</hi> that is, men of the ſtreight, which argues them to be a people come from the ſtreight: others called <hi>Souchimilcos,</hi> that is field men; others <hi>Tapaneras,</hi> men of the bridge; others <hi>Alcapouſalcas, Couluas,</hi> crookback'd: <hi>Tſaluicas,</hi> mountain-men.

               <p>The <hi>Mexicans</hi> had a moſt truculent cuſtom, to ſacrifice their priſoners of war, and enemies, to their gods, and in want of them their own natural children. The Prieſts or <hi>Papas</hi> performed the ſacrifice opening the breaſt of the miſerable victim, and with the heart ſprinkled the Idol to appeaſe it, and watered the ſtairs and the temple with his blood. In <hi>Peru</hi> they made the like ſacrifice of children, from four to ten years old, with ſuch madneſſe that they would ſlaughter 200. at a time, and this for the health and proſperity of their <hi>Ingas</hi> or Kings, and the like of maids drawn out of their Monaſteries.</p>

When a little needle in the middle of the wheel comes to point at the period of fifty years, then are they ſtroken with a ſtrong apprehenſion, believing the world is to be ended, and for three or four dayes before lament, and make Sacrifices to appeaſe the angry gods; but when it arrives at the point, they leave their Sacrifices, break all their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils, as they were to die at the inſtant, lay themſelves on the ground with extream contuſion for their bad lives, and terrour of approaching torments: and having ſpent a day and night thus dolefully, upon appearance of the next day, which they never thought to ſee, they go ſtrait to viſit the wheel, which now hath entered a new circulation; then repleat with joy they render a thouſand benedictions to the gods for the grace received, whereof they thought themſelves unworthy, with engagements of reformation for the future.

               <p>The moſt famous of theſe Mountaines for height and compaſſe are the <hi>Guatamala,</hi> diſcernable at vaſt diſtance on the South ſea. A <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prieſt out of avarice would needs ſound this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſuppoſing the bottom to be full of gold: This Prieſt was called <hi>Moſſen</hi> born at <hi>Antequera</hi> who came to the Indies with <hi>Pirarow</hi> at the time of <hi>Ferdinand Cortez</hi> conqueſt: he had a ſiſter living with him, who had a fair daughter, whom the Captain married to <hi>Lazart d' Almadia,</hi> Clark of the ſhip, promiſing 1000. duckets in marriage: But the Clark being jealous of his Captain, left his wife in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Captain being come on ſhore with grief for his Miſtreſſe abſence dyed, to whom by his laſt will he ratified the 1000. duckets: Mean while the Clark took com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the veſſel, and arrived in New <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> where the Prieſt was very welcome, Prieſts being there very acceptable, and was accommodated in the town of <hi>Sanda,</hi> where he lived in great eſteem for ſincerity and devotion, ſo in few years he grew very wealthy. But not content with this, upon ſuggeſtion that the flaming Mountain, not farre thence was a Mine of gold, he thought to get ineſtimable riches out of it:<note place="margin">A Hiſtory of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Prieſt</note> for this purpoſe he cauſed a ſtrong iron chain to be made, to the meaſure of the height of the Mountain, which he had taken by <hi>Artizans,</hi> then by

ſtrength of men began to cut a way for portage of his neceſſaries; which could not be done but at great expence: a mans labour there being worth two crowns a day, nevertheleſſe avarice made him paſſe it eaſily: But this beginning was a mean matter, for he muſt continue the labourers, being yet not advanced far by reaſon of the height of the Mountain, and firmneſſe of the rock, which he muſt cut through: nor though many looked upon the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize as extravagant and inconſiderate, yet the Prieſt every day got nearer to the mouth of the Furnace, with expence of time, labour, and difficulty. After four moneths ſpace; the ponderous chains and chaldrons, with great coſt and paine were drawne up. The good man boaſted, he doubted not now to come ſhortly to his ends, and that he had a revelation of it in his ſleep: at length all theſe iron Engines were ſet in order, and the work-men to the number of 50. began to let down a Chaldron well faſtened to a ſtrong chain of iron with other Engines ſecured, and the Prieſt himſelf ſet his hand to the work: But as they thought to draw up the Chaldron full of rich melted mettle, the ſtrength of the fire conſumed all, and they hardly eſcaped without burning their hands and feet, ſo violent a heat burſt out upon them. The Prieſt halfe mad cry'd out, the Devil had broken his chain with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand curſes, ready to throw himſelf headlong into the Precipice, covered over with ſoot and cindars, and frying with heat, fright, and toyle, that he looked like a right fury; running like a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to and fro; the reſt in little better condition, the greateſt part being lam'd and conſum'd with labour, and the violence of heat which had even melted them. The good man at laſt was brought to his lodging in extreme torment, where they laid him to bed in ſo much grief and diſcomfort, that he was the pitty of the world. Waking in the night he was ſurprized with ſuch a rage, that he gave himſelf ſeveral ſtabbes in the throat with his knife, and in the morning his ſiſter coming to viſit him, found him ſteep'd in blood and gaſtly, half dead, whereupon ſhe cryed out for help, and friends came immediately in, and a Chirurgion applyed the country balſom ſo fortunately to his wounds, that he was well within few dayes; nevertheleſſe for extreme griefe and ſullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he could eat nothing, at laſt he languiſhed to death, having conſum'd all he had gotten, beſides what his ſiſter had, and other friends whom he quite ruined.</p>

He gain'd the Kingdom with great toyle and induſtry, defeated, and took the King <hi>Montezuma</hi>; afterwards being driven out by the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> with a neighbouring people their enemies he returned, and brought them abſolutely under the yoke. The <hi>Indians</hi> called him <hi>Malnixa,</hi> as a God deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from heaven. Amongſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves he had great enemies, as <hi>Garary, Eſtrada, Olid,</hi> and <hi>Navez,</hi> whom he routed, and compleated his conqueſt. The Emperour made him Marqueſſe <hi>del Valla.</hi> He was indued with all the qualities of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> vertuous and vitious. He was bold, valiant, ſuddain in execution, clear ſpirited, ſubtle, patient, and reſolute; but ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, out of meaſure cruell, and libidinous. He dyed in <hi>Spain,</hi> at the age of 63. in the year 1546. He conquered in <hi>Mexica</hi> from 12. to 15. degrees. The town of <hi>Mexica</hi> is in 19. degrees: about the 8. of <hi>May,</hi> and the 16. of <hi>July</hi> the Sun is perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The countrey is temperate, but rather hot then cold, clothes there not being tedious or troubleſome, nor nakedneſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or broyling.</p>
               <p>The Mines are not ſo wealthy as in <hi>Peru</hi>: but more profitable by reaſon of the leſſe charge and danger. Beſides gold, ſilver, iron, and braſſe; they bring from thence ſugar, cochenell, cotton, plumage, honey, wax, balm, amber, ſalt, medicinable drugges, &amp;c. and few veſſels return light, which is not in <hi>Peru, Spain</hi> being enriched as well from one as the other. For though there is ſo much treaſure to be exhauſted, yet there is not ſo much danger. The faith hath made a farther progreſſe, the countrey is better peopled, the natives better ordered, more regular, better Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets

of cattle, horſes, ſugars, and meat, wherein <hi>Peru</hi> cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, which doubtleſſe would be better if it had more rain.</p>
               <p>The natives wondring why the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were inquiſitive of gold and ſilver, at firſt they made them believe 'twas to cure them of a pain at their heart, whereto they were ſubject, but in time they found it did hold them there indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cortez</hi> to bring theſe people in obedience to his King, told them he was Emperour of all the Chriſtians, the greateſt Lord on earth, who had under him more Kingdomes and Provinces then other Kings had ſubjects.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spaniſh</hi> vanity.</note> That his government was founded on Juſtice, and proceeded immediately from God, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with all vertues, and that the Monarchy of the whole Univerſe, was by right his inheritance, and other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> boaſts and vanities.</p>
               <p>Concerning the particulars of this great country, beſides what I have ſaid already. In the Province of <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent root of the ſame name with the countrey, by others called <hi>Jeheurais,</hi> of the ſame vertue to purge, as <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> but more light and white, and purges with leſſe violence, which is a great traffick in <hi>Spain,</hi> where 'tis worth three or four realls the pound, and there almoſt nothing. 'Tis taken by the weight of a Crown pulveriz'd in an egge, wine, or broth. I have ſeen greater effects of it then <hi>Rhubarb.</hi> It may be kept four or five years or longer with care, but there is ſuch abundance, they matter it not.</p>
               <p>By information of the natives, ſome of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of diſeaſes by this root, and ſo it became famous. 'Tis called <hi>Indian Rhubarb.</hi> Amongſt other trees in <hi>Mexico</hi> or the land of <hi>Caperous,</hi> there is the famous tree of <hi>Muguey,</hi> whereof they tell as many wonders, and ſeveral uſes, as of the Eaſtern <hi>Cocos,</hi> for it yields water, wine, vinegar, oyle, honey, wax, thread, and needles;<note place="margin">A tree yielding all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</note> ſo as this is ſufficient to keep a man. After drawing freſh water, the fruit will be like ſweet ſmall nuts. The water a little boyled becomes good wine; more boyled, like burnt wine, which coagulate again excellent honey, whereof they make Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupes: The firſt water ſet in the Sun makes good vinegar: From the leaves iſſues ſweet milk, and out of the leaves you may draw thread, ſtrong enough to make cloth. I brought with me two ſhirts of it, and ſome of the fruit, as perfect into Europe, as it grew on the tree, for the rind is very thick, and that preſerves it. cloth made of this yarne, will ever have ſome dark gray ſtreaks in it. About the leaves grow little prickles, ſo ſtrong and hard, they uſe them for needles, and ſew with no other. There are many who live on this tree alone, which puts forth leaves upon leaves continually, and in ſuch abundance, that the tree is covered over from the root to the top, which makes it unſhapely. To make it pregnant, they lay cindars to the root: the wood is of ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it endures twice as long in the fire as any other, and when
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:98515:191"/>
they will keep fire a long time, they uſe a piece of this wood.</p>
               <p>Balm comes from a tree ſomething like a Pomegranate tree, and it produces ſeveral ſorts of ſeveral vertues. The firſt is <hi>Opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balſamo,</hi> excellent for wounds and the plague, of gold co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour like Ambar: another ſort is ſomething white: another ſort is preſs'd out the leaves and ſprigges burnt; of ſuch vertue, 'twill draw any iron out of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>I brought ſome into <hi>France,</hi> wherewith I did moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cures of wounds, and old ulcers which had eaten to the very bone.</p>
               <p>In a word, 'tis moſt ſoveraigne for wounds, paines in the ſides, contagions, and holding a little in the mouth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves from bad ayrs.</p>
               <p>They much eſteeme another tree called <hi>Cacao,</hi> as the fruit is of great uſe and traffick, which paſſes with them as money to buy all commodities. The fruit is like an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, a little leſſe: They are never without <hi>Cacoas</hi> in their pockets, to buy what they want, for alms, or to eat;<note place="margin">Fruit uſed for mony.</note> and 'twill keep a long time. The Province of <hi>Guatima</hi> produces them in abundance, where they make a precious drink of it, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly mixt cools, or heats: it makes good wine. They make Cakes of it good for the ſtomack, and ptiſick, 'tis like an Almond tree, the leaves a little broader, and of a thicker body. To make it proſper, they plant another by the ſide of it: 'tis very tender, and ſuffers equally by cold and heat.</p>
               <p>This latter tree they call <hi>Cacaos</hi> mother, becauſe it preſerves it from the injuries of the weather. Whoſoever hath this tree, they eſteem him happy and pious, in opinion, if he were not ſuch, their God would not have ſent him this tree: and when ſuch a tree dyes, they believe the Maſter hath committed ſome hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime.</p>
               <p>In like manner they have their <hi>Coca</hi> in high eſteem at <hi>Peru,</hi> which being chewed and held in the mouth, marvellouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the ſpirit. 'Tis of very delicate taſte, whereof they make great traffick to <hi>Potoſſi.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Betwixt <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> 'tis 17. or 18. leagues of Marſhes, Mountains, and craggy aſperous rocks, full of fierce wild beaſts of all kinds, and a multitude of Apes that make a very troubleſome noyſe. They tranſport their Merchandiſe from ſea to ſea, either by land with convoyes, or by the river <hi>Chagra</hi> to about five leagues from <hi>Panama,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Panama.</note> and then by land with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy. They have often thought of cutting this <hi>Iſthmus</hi> in the ſtreighteſt place, but the difficulty of the Rocks and Mountains by the way, beſides the doubt if the ſeas are levell, as at the Egyptian <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> hindred the proceeding.</p>

                  <hi>Popayan</hi> is about two hundred leagues in length, and forty in breadth, lying upon new <hi>Granada</hi> towards the Eaſt. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces are <hi>Antioch, Tataho, Anſerma, Arma, Pacoura, Catapa, Quinhaya, Calix,</hi> and <hi>Paſto.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſerma</hi> 70. leagues from <hi>Antioch</hi> is called by the Indians <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi>; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing the Inhabitants hold ſalt in their hand, and call it <hi>Anſer,</hi> thought the town had been ſo called, and continued that name: there is a paſſage over the river Saint <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> at that town. <hi>Arma</hi> is of note for rich Mines: <hi>Parmoura</hi> hath alſo ſilver Mines: the Province of <hi>Arbi</hi> extends to the Mountains of <hi>Cordilleras,</hi> which runs a thouſand leagues Southward: on that ſide which ſtretches to the ſea, they never have raines by reaſon the South, and South-Weſt winds blowing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, drive the clouds away, whereby this part is barren without tree, fruit, or graſſe. but the other ſide onely a league diſtant, by reaſon of the rains, abounds in fruits and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>

               <p>The laſt Province of <hi>Peru</hi> neighbouring to <hi>Chila</hi> is called <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> in which as the Town of <hi>Plata,</hi> the Capital,<note place="margin">Plata.</note> where the famous mines of <hi>Porco</hi> and <hi>Potoſſi</hi> are. <hi>Potoſſi</hi> of four or five houſes, built at firſt to fine their mettal, by degrees is grown a fair Town in 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Next to <hi>Charcas</hi> is the Province of <hi>Chila,</hi> which they hold to be 500. leagues over to the Streight.</p>
               <p>'Tis an admiration to obſerve the quality of <hi>Peru,</hi> on this ſide. For here there is but one wind, not that which in the Torrid u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally blowes Eaſtward, as we ſaid, but this is South and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt; without which 'twere not to be inhabited for the dryneſſe of the place, but this wind renders it very healthfull: for 'tis to be obſerved that in this Countrey it never rains, ſnows,<note place="margin">A wind of the uſe of rain.</note> or thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor any thing that may refreſh it, but this wind alone effects it. On both ſides of the Countrey are the high Mountains <hi>Cordil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leras,</hi> productive of fair trees, and there, as in other places they have variety of weather, hot, cold, rain, ſnow: and on both ſides the mountains are bare and cold in extremity. This Countrey is long and narrow, compoſed of plains, mountains, and valleys: The plains are by the Sea-coaſt; on the other ſide the Mountains are reaſonable good, but ſome hungry enough. The plain may be of thirty or fourty miles broad, from Weſt to Eaſt, and holds the length from North to South. And 'tis ſtrange that in ſome parts they never have any rain, and in others more than they wiſh for, being but fourty or fifty Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>In the plains then it never rains, all they ever have is a dew, which is ſo ſlender it never wets at all. Their houſes are covered
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:98515:194"/>
with ſtraw or reeds. In the mountains they feed on thoſe wild-goats that have the <hi>Beſar</hi> ſtone.</p>
               <p>They have likewiſe ſtore of ſheep, and cows, which they call <hi>Guanacos</hi> and <hi>Pacos,</hi> abundance of Apes and Munkeys, making moſt exotick faces upon paſſengers,<note place="margin">Munkeys.</note> ſome you ſhall ſee chattering their teeth, others ſcratching their bellies, here one running with three or four young ones under her armes, there another upon a tree that ſtirs nor at all; but the miſchief is, if we carry them out of their own air they die immediately. Beſides there are infinite Parrots upon the trees that never ſhun the paſſengers; but the young ones for fear thruſt the head under the Mothers wing; and if we take one of theſe without the Mother they dye imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
               <p>Some valleys are better than others, as thoſe of <hi>Yneay Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaylas,</hi> and thoſe that run up to <hi>Cuſco,</hi> the Town-Royall, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great and populous, now ruined by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>Cordilleras,</hi> mountains of a thouſand leagues long, where they divide and ſeparate, compoſe the large <hi>Campania</hi> of <hi>Collao.</hi> The Countrey towards <hi>Titicata</hi> is barren, without either bread or wine, but the inhabitants live upon a root called <hi>Papas,</hi> which they dry, and make a courſe bread of it, called <hi>Choignos</hi>; the Countrey nevertheleſſe populous for the heards of cattle, goats, and ſheep it breeds. There is abundance of veniſon, partridges, and other ſorts of game.</p>
               <p>The vales of <hi>Charcas</hi> yield good ground, and the Mountains are rich in Mines. The reaſon they have no rain in ſome parts, is want of matter for exhalation, there being nothing but ſand, and neither Rivers nor Fountains. There are ſome draw-wells of exceſſive depth,<note place="margin">Temper of <hi>Peru.</hi>
                  </note> it being impoſſible to derive water from other parts, for the interpoſition of the mountains. Beſides there blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no wind but one, without any other to oppoſe it, that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender no vapours. Where the Mountains are not ſo very high, there they have ſometimes rains, as at <hi>Arica, Arequipa,</hi> and ſome other places. Notwithſtanding, the other parts where it rains not, by means of the wind are fertilized even to wonder, and graſſe grows through the ſand which feeds the Cattle exceedingly, as it doth near <hi>Lima,</hi> where graſſe grows on a Mountain entirely ſand.</p>
               <p>In <hi>May,</hi> when we firſt begin to feel heats in <hi>Europe,</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi> they are extream cold, where the <hi>Toumacaui</hi> reigns, as at <hi>Potoſſi</hi> and through all the Countrey of <hi>Charca,</hi> as 'twere the heart of <hi>Peru</hi>; a wind more cold and piercing than any in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and at <hi>Potoſſi</hi> is indurable, though the Mountain be higher than <hi>Noſtre Dame de la garde,</hi> at <hi>Marſeills,</hi> or Mount <hi>Martre</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi>: there is a leſſe Mountain at the ſide of it, called <hi>Guayna Potoſſi,</hi> or young <hi>Potoſſi,</hi> both of a colour, red without any verdure.

                  </note> The Mines were firſt diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Indians,</hi> amongſt whom one acquainted his maſter <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roel</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who became Lord of it, paying the fifth to his King, about 1545.</p>
               <p>One of the wonders of <hi>Peru,</hi> nay of the whole earth, is the Mountain <hi>Perlaca,</hi> where the air is ſo cold, thin, and piercing, that it cauſes paſſengers to vomit, to that extremity they bring up bloud and kils them with intolerable gripings: and if the travailers make not all poſſible ſpeed 'tis no ſcaping: for in this ſhort paſſage of four or five dangerous leagues, men looſe their ſenſes, and often their horſes or what they ride on will ſtand immoveable, without ſenſe either of ſpur or whip, ſo as they are conſtrained to run on foot, and drive their beaſts before them.</p>
               <p>Some cover their eyes, others ſtop their ears, and their noſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muffle and lap their head and whole body. Others put their head in a bag of herbs, and aromatick drugs, others carry cordials to eat, others eat not of all day, that they may not have ſo much matter to vomit; but oftentimes this ſerves not the turn, when one is in this pernicious place, where there is nothing to be heard but laments and vomitings, and notwithſtanding that the Sun ſhine never ſo clear, this vapour hath ſtill its force: ſome go other wayes a ſide off, but they ſtill find the ſame inconvenience, and the danger ſometimes more great: all the wayes are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bad, and the worſt by the Sea ſide.</p>
               <p>The whole extent of this quarter is not above five and twenty leagues, without people, beaſts, trees, or graſſe, ſo deſert is the place, and beyond the Countrey extends 500. leagues: At the foot of theſe Mountains there are ſome raſcally Innes, they call <hi>Tambos,</hi> where one finds but wretched entertainment. This is the high-road from <hi>Peru</hi> to <hi>Chila</hi>: At the foot of the Mountain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea, one would think the paſſage more benign, but there reigns a wind chiefly in <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which cools and penetrates with extremity, ſo as fingers and toes freeze and fall off with cold, the greateſt part periſh in paſſing, and the wind renders them incorruptible.</p>
               <p>Of burning mountains we have ſpoken ſufficiently in <hi>Mexico,</hi> ſome there are in <hi>Peru</hi> towards <hi>Arequipa,</hi> which throw forth ſtones; others onely ſmoak, others flaming pumice ſtones, ſome vomiting flames and cinders, others ſcalding winds.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</note> there is a hill five and twenty leagues high, anſwerable to another on the top of a Mountain; where when it thunders it makes an Echo that ſhakes the whole Countrey: a formidable thing to thoſe that are not uſed to it. Near <hi>Guatimala</hi> in 1586. for ſix moneths this hill caſts out flames and cinders, followed with earthquakes, that they have thought the Countrey had been ruined. All <hi>Mexico</hi>

and <hi>Peru</hi> are ſubject to theſe earth-quakes, and chiefly on the Sea-coaſts, from <hi>Chila</hi> to <hi>Quito,</hi> For above 200. leagues, the Sea-men with aſtoniſhment beheld flames riſing from theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and afterwards learnt that the Town of <hi>Guatimala</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely ſwallowed in the earth-quake. In 1587. it reached 200. leagues diſtance, and at St. <hi>Croix,</hi> the Refectorian of the Dominicans was beaten dead, and twenty of the religious killed under the vaults. The Inhabitants of <hi>Guatimala</hi> having notice made a timely retreat. There are of theſe Mountaines near <hi>Lima,</hi> and another at <hi>Arequipa,</hi> to which you muſt aſcend two dayes in ſand.</p>
               <p>Moſt parts of this <hi>India</hi> are ſubject to theſe furnaces, and earth-quakes, and chiefly near the Sea. Near <hi>Leon de Nicaragae</hi> there is a terrible one, where ſometimes by night the flames may be diſcerned 25. leagues, in diſcourſe whereof <hi>Benzoni</hi> relates the ſame of a <hi>Jacobin,</hi> as <hi>Acoſta</hi> of a Prieſt at <hi>Guati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala.</hi>

From this Lake they draw a Channell that ſets certain Leather-Engines at worke, uſefull for the Mines, without any waſte of the water. <hi>Titicaca</hi> in <hi>Collao</hi> is famous for largeneſſe, and bearing veſſels of burthen: fiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in it, whereof the Inhabitants round about take great quantity, very ſweet, good, and commodious for paſſengers, to whom they freely give part of their fiſh, taking them with certain hand Engines. If a Prieſt come that way they will preſent him a thouſand civilities, and he is happy with whom he will lodge. One is in perfect ſecurity amongſt them, not underſtanding what theft meanes, and you may truſt them with all the treaſure of the world, while you live like good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Throughout the Countrey there are abundance of other Lakes, as that of <hi>Eupama</hi> in <hi>Braſile,</hi> whence ſo many Rivers iſſue; and amongſt others the great <hi>Paraguay,</hi> or <hi>Plata,</hi> which make inundations like <hi>Nile,</hi> but not ſo moderately, for <hi>Nile</hi> comes without any injury, but on the contrary with all commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: whereas <hi>Plata</hi> breaks with fury into the Countrey for three months together, courſing from the <hi>Cordilleras</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi> to the South Sea. They have a way to paſſe rivers upon floats of gourds or pumpions faſtened together, which they uſe for all ſort of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in ſome places they have bridges of ſtraw. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have built ſtone bridges, which the <hi>Indians</hi> much admire, and at firſt had no confidence to truſt themſelves upon bridges in the air.</p>
               <p>Now for their Fountains, near the cape St. <hi>Helen</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> there is a Fountain of liquor burns like oyl: 'tis a certain Bitumen, or Gum, which they call <hi>Copey,</hi> or <hi>Copal,</hi> that never decreaſes, how much ſoever is taken out. Marriners uſe to liquor their cordage with it. The like is in the Iſle of <hi>Lobos,</hi> in <hi>Mexico,</hi> which the Marriners can ſmell three miles at Sea, and more, if the wind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In <hi>Cuſco</hi> there are Fountaines, the water whereof immediately
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:98515:196"/>
congeals into white ſalt, in which <hi>Peru</hi> abounds. In <hi>Guan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caueſica</hi> there are hot ſprings that condenſe to ſtone, whereof they build their houſes; but the water drunk is mortall: wherefore they ſtop up all high-wayes to it, for it cauſes a preſent heavineſſe, and then they die immediately. They have many other fountains hot and cold cloſe together, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cure the French diſeaſe, though never ſo confirmed, by reaſon of the <hi>Saſſaparilla</hi> that grows in them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Peru</hi> there is a ſheam red as bloud, for that called <hi>Rio Vermeio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Caramel</hi> they have another Fountain cures all feavers, and purges like Rhubarb; the water is brackiſh and ſalt at the firſt taſte, but afterwards one feels nothing, but may drink his fill without dammage: it drives through the body all that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, then paſſes clear. I thought I ſhould have vomited my bowels up, but afterwards I found my ſelf ſound and cheerfull, and cured of a Rhume in my teeth I had been troubled with for a long time. I drunk three flagons a day, and ſtill it provoked me to drink more: They come to it from all parts, and for all diſeaſes, even for wounds. And the place is made ſo neceſſary one may bath in it. 'Tis onely hurtfull to hot livers.</p>
               <p>Round about it are tents of ſtraw, and beds of cotton, and ſheep-ſkins, where you ſhall have all accomodation for a ſmall matter, and they will officiouſly fetch and furniſh you with any thing you want, amongſt others they bring us a fowle called <hi>Magnota,</hi> more delicate than a patridge, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is white and black, and eats like a capon, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of turtles. But of Lakes, where is there any ſo admirable as that whereon the Towne of <hi>Mexica</hi> is ſeated? whereof one part by reaſon of Salt-peter at the bottome is ſalt as the Sea, the other by reaſon of the Rivers that fall into it freſh as any Fountaine, each diviſion being ten leagues in length, and five in breadth, and three dayes journey in circuite, with a delightfull Mountain in the middle, and a bath hot as that at <hi>Baleru.</hi> In the middle of the Lake is the Charnell of green Tombs, ever covered with herbs and flowers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have laid moſt of the Town dry, being before in the manner of <hi>Venice,</hi> and have made conduits that convey water throughout the Towne, and chiefly round the walls. Out of avarice the new Conquerours admit not the <hi>Indians</hi> to fiſh on the Lake without licenſe, who now, contrary to Articles, enjoy not their ancient liberties, neither in this nor other things.</p>
               <p>There are three Cauſwayes lead to the Town, of halfe a league long. They account upon 4000. houſes of <hi>Spaniards,</hi>

               <p>After a tedious Navigation, and many turns and compaſſes for above ſeventeen hundred leagues upon this River, he came to the confuſion of it in the North Sea, fourty leagues over, following the Coaſt he arrived at <hi>Cubaga,</hi> or the Iſle of Pearles, which is above four hundred leagues, whence <hi>Orellano</hi> with 14. of his men being recruited, came to S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made an ample relation to the Emperour, where <hi>Ouiede</hi> took his inſtructions, and inſerted it in his Hiſtory.</p>

There is a gate, and goods locks to every Mine, they work by turnes, otherwiſe they could never endure it, the ayre is ſo ſtrong and pernicious.</p>
               <p>The ſilver Mine may be 150. ells deep, toylſome to the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, eſpecially the ſlaves, whoſe backs are loaded with ſilver, and their legges with iron. When a Mine yields five for a hundred, 'tis ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Great art is required to direct the Mine, ſometimes they can neither find men nor Mine, being all for want of good direction, overwhelmed: wherefore Geometry is very neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Silver generally lyes betwixt two rocks or mountains, the one very ſoft, the other as hard, and ever in the very middle. There are ſeveral ſorts of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fineſt is called <hi>Caſilla</hi> by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> by the Indians <hi>Tacana,</hi> of Ambar colour, the other more black; and there is of other colours. I took all to be the ſame, perceiving nothing of ſilver in any ſtone, but the workmen know it perfectly. The oare they carry to little furnaces to be fin'd. When the ſtone is good, a hundred weight yields fifty pieces of eight, ſome not above thirty, nay five; but the richeſt of all, two hundred and above. There is not a Mine but hath belonging to it at leaſt four thouſand of theſe little furnaces, ſome five or ſix thouſand, as that at <hi>Caratecas</hi> and <hi>Potoſſi.</hi> You would think you ſaw an Army of the bellows-blowers.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver.</note>They have one Mine of Quick-ſilver, the heat whereof emits a moſt pernicious vapour that deſtroyes them all; makes them loſe their teeth, and often their ſenſes and underſtanding. Staying by it but a quarter of an hour, I was almoſt ſtupified to a ſtone, and the reſt likewiſe that were with me, and had ſped worſe, if notice had not been given us. They get an earth they call <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> which melted yields quick-ſilver, with which they uſe to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the ſilver, and have it likewiſe from <hi>Spain,</hi> where there is a Mine near <hi>Sevill,</hi> for this at <hi>Cacatera</hi> will not ſuffice. The ſilver being fin'd and made money, they carry it upon ſheep to the Sea-ſide, to ſhip it for <hi>Spain.</hi> The fining of it is troubleſome, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it muſt paſſe the fire ſeven or eight times.</p>
               <p>They bring to <hi>Spain</hi> every year 12. or 13. millions more or leſſe, whereof the fifth comes to the King, the reſt to the Maſters. There was one in few years got two hundred thouſand crownes and more for his ſhare; and when he dyed, had not a ſheet to bury
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:98515:199"/>
him in. Of gold there is ſeveral ſorts, the <hi>Popitas,</hi> or gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, or grains of gold, abſolute gold, pure and neat, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture, wanting neither furnace nor melting, ready for the ſtamp, being perfect by nature.</p>
               <p>The maſſieſt I ever ſaw was but of three pounds, yet 'twas preſented to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King for twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Out of the Mounts of <hi>Libani</hi> in <hi>Cuba,</hi> there was one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken weighing 3310. weighs, each weigh worth fourteen or fifteen realls, which with infinite other riches was caſt away at ſea, going for <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no ſilver comes pure from the Mine except ſome ſmall bit which they call <hi>Capa di plata,</hi> pure ſilver.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of gold inſerted in ſtone of the Mine, hard to be extracted; in breaking which ſtone, one diſcerns little luſtre of gold, in ſome leſſe, in ſome none at all.</p>
               <p>The moſt delicate gold I ever ſaw, was a ſtone tranfixt as 'twere with prickles of gold, like a Hedge-hogge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent both within and without, this gold is the beſt and fineſt of all.</p>
               <p>Another ſort is in ſees or powder, found in rivers, 'tis pure, and needs paſſe but one fire.</p>
               <p>Such are found in the rivers of the Iſles of <hi>Barlouento,</hi> and in the <hi>Paſaguey,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The beſt gold is of <hi>Chila, Quito,</hi> and <hi>Granado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mine of <hi>Carauana,</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and <hi>Vuldiuia</hi> in <hi>Chila,</hi> which is the moſt perfect, is of twenty three <hi>Carats,</hi> and a halfe, as likewiſe at <hi>Varaquae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Silver abounds in the rich mines of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Charcas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next the Mine of <hi>Porto</hi> not farre off; likewiſe very rich, but of little benefit for want of workmen, by reaſon of the unſound ayre, and extreme cold, and water which drownes it, but in <hi>Potoſi</hi> 'tis not ſo.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Jugas</hi> King of <hi>Peru,</hi> the Mine of <hi>Porto</hi> was open and wrought in, but not that of <hi>Potoſſi</hi> which was not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, till the <hi>Spaniards</hi> time.</p>
               <p>This is the richer, and yields moſt.</p>
               <p>At the firſt they drew forth every week above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Weighs,</hi> or <hi>Caſtillans,</hi> whereof the gain came to forty thouſand.</p>

               <p>There is a ſort they call ſtars, another demi-ſtars, others <hi>Cade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netas Pedreria,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Allofat,</hi> or minute-pearls, and ſeed-pearls, and thoſe of greater price, <hi>Quilates,</hi> or <hi>Carats.</hi> For this fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they chooſe the beſt winded men, and ſuch as can contain longeſt under water.<note place="margin">Men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> At <hi>Barlouento, Cula,</hi> and <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> I have ſeen them ſtay three quarters of an hour under water, and I was told they have had ſome have continued the whole houre.

               <p>The <hi>Incas</hi> make no uſe of pearls, unwilling out of benignity to expoſe their ſubjects to ſo much danger; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are nothing ſo ſcrupulous, they make their poor ſlaves dive ten or twelve fathom deep, to tear oyſters from the rock: and to fortify their lungs for retention of breath, they keep them faſting, and hold them to a diet.</p>
               <p>One was brought to the King, bigge as a Pidgeons egge, valued at 14000. duckets; by ſome at a hundred thouſand, and 'twas called a <hi>Peregrina.</hi> The <hi>Negro</hi> that extracted it from the oyſter had his liberty for it, and the Maſter was made <hi>Arguazilmaior</hi> of <hi>Parama.</hi>

               <p>This firſt inſtituted adoration of the Sun amongſt them, with their Temples and Sacrifices. Their Prieſts or Sages are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Amantas,</hi> who believe the immortality of the ſoule, after death reſt for the good, and torment for the wicked, with reſurrection of bodies.</p>
               <p>Theſe Kings, or <hi>Incas,</hi> enacted good lawes, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees extended the Empire to the ſtate the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found

They likewiſe underſtood the Solſtices, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them of eight days in the Eaſt at <hi>Cuſco,</hi> and another number in the Weſt: they reckoned the moneths by Moons, allowing twelve in the year, adding though groſſely, the eleven dayes over-plus, at the points of <hi>Solſtice</hi>; obſerved the Equinoctials, whence in <hi>September</hi> they made the principal feaſt of the Sun.</p>
               <p>The Equinoctial they found by the ſhadow of a pillar, and the Eclipſes in like manner, during which time, they think the Sun angry with them, and the moon ſick. The king took the Rainbow for his Arms and device. They kept all accounts by knots upon ſtrings of various colours: and they had ſome harmony of Muſick in ſongs and Inſtruments of Canes faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, four and four, in the nature of Organs, whereon they could expreſſe their paſſions of love, content, or ſorrow. They had alſo ſome Poetry and verſe, in meaſure with Meetre, and called their Poets <hi>Harauee,</hi> that is, Inventors.</p>
               <p>Their Temples were of ſtone magnificently built, ſumptuous for gold and ſilver. The ſtatue of the Sun was maſſy gold, which a <hi>Spaniard</hi> took and gam'd away in a night, whereupon one ſaid by way of je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In their golden garden were all ſorts of hearbs and plants, trees, flowers, fruits, animals of maſſy gold, and ſilver to the life; In ſhort, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> found there unſpeakable wealth, yet all was nothing in compariſon of that the Natives concealed, or caſt into the Sea or Lakes, which could never be recovered. There were Monaſteries of maids dedicated to the Sun, bound to perpetual virginity, and never beholding other perſon, the ſuperiours called them <hi>Mamacunes.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This King was capable of the true Religion, for he would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Sun could not be the Soveraign God, but that there muſt be one more powerful that commanded his perpetual circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; becauſe were the Sun his own maſter he would ſometimes reſt for his pleaſure, not for neceſſity; whereas the Soveraign God ought to enjoy the moſt perfect tranquillity without pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, which was not ſeen in the Sun.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Huiana</hi> now in peace at his palace of <hi>Tamipampa,</hi> in 1515. had intelligence of certain ſtrangers, not altogether unknown, that coaſted the ſhore of his Dominions: Firſt <hi>Nunez Balboa</hi> diſcovered it in 1513. afterwards <hi>Pizarra</hi> and his Company, who firſt gained it in 1531.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Huiana</hi> had by all his wives above 300. children, yet but one legitimate, called <hi>Hilaſcar,</hi> by his wife who was his Siſter, and one other by his dear Concubine, called <hi>Acabalipa</hi>; to whom he left the kingdom of <hi>Quito,</hi> and <hi>Huaſcat</hi> reigned ſoveraign at <hi>Cuſco</hi>: But <hi>Acabalipa</hi> to throw off his homage to his Brother, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded him with a bloudy war, defeated him, and took him, and put to death all the <hi>Incas,</hi> and Princes of the blood-Royal,<note place="margin">Cruelty revenged.</note> that he might reign ſole King, though according to the Sanctions of

He gave death to above two hundred of his Brothers, then to as many of his alliance as he could lay hands on: as well men as women, with cruell torments; and extended his tyranny upon the very ſervants, and officers royal, with fire, violations, and other vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies.</p>
               <p>In the Province of <hi>Canares</hi> alone, he put to death ſixty thouſand men, becauſe they had held with his Brother, and covered the land with carcaſes, and horrible deſolations. In recompenſe this villain was juſtly puniſhed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> more wicked than himſelf, and they afterwards by themſelves not finding any that could exceed them again in villany.</p>
               <p>In the year 1526. <hi>Franciſco Pizarra,</hi> and <hi>Diego Almagro,</hi> being at <hi>Panarma,</hi> having lived a long time in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and aſſiſted at the conqueſt of <hi>

               <p>Thus was this mighty and opulent Empire conquered by a handfull of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> divine providence in inſcrutible councels, making the avarice, cruelty, and other vices of theſe Victors inſtrumentall, to bring theſe people to the knowledge of the true God.</p>
               <p>Now is the time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> glut their avarice, and cruelty, perpetrate all inſolencies and truculencies imaginable, which have been ſo fully repreſented, obſerved, and exaggerated by their own hiſtories and Authours, I ſhall not need to paint them in any other colours: but they all or the greateſt part paid dear for it, when by inteſtine diſcord, envy, and amutinies amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they butchered one another, and ſo revenged the nefarious treatment of the poor <hi>Indians</hi>; and thoſe who overſtood this ſelf-deſtruction were juſtly executed by the command of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who commiſſioned certain Licenciados <hi>Vacca de Gaſtro,</hi> and <hi>Gaſca,</hi> to pronounce ſevere juſtice upon theſe ſeditious Mutineers: there the <hi>Pizarras, Almagros,</hi> and others, all peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>The fifth Viceroy eſtabliſhed in <hi>Peru,</hi> was <hi>Blaſius Nuez,</hi> 1544. <hi>Lima,</hi> or the Town of Kings, was founded at this time, firſt by <hi>Pizarra,</hi> in 1533. afterwards the reſidence of the Viceroys, the ſeat of Parliament, Inquiſition, Univerſity, and the Metropolitan Church of the whole Countrey.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſtrait of <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi>
                  </note>FRom <hi>Chila</hi> the next is the ſtreight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> of about 100. leagues in length, and not much more in breadth, or any waies, which is not to be ſurvey'd till you are well within the land: The tides are ſtrong and dangerous, principally from the South ſea, by reaſon of the narrow entrance in the mouth, and a multitude of rocks and mountains before the mouth of it, which render the paſſage hard to find, and being but a little out at ſea one can perceive nothing of it, ſo as you muſt go caſt about with the cock-boat, though otherwiſe you know the way and the true heighth, which is about 52. degrees. There is one very high Mountain hard upon the mouth, called <hi>la campana,</hi> being in form like a bell. The ſhalloweſt place is fifteen or twenty fathoms, and a very good bottom.</p>
               <p>The South ſea enters thirty leagues within, amongſt very high Mountains covered with ſnow, the North ſea enters it ſeventy leagues on the other ſide, where they find bottoms in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as on the contrary, on the South ſide the depth is ſuch no ſhip can ride at anchor. On the North ſide there are expatiate plains and champians upon the firm land, and divers Rivers that fall into this ſtreight, ſhaded with odoriferous trees, which ſhews the goodneſſe of the ſoyle. It containes ſome Iſlands not to be ventured on without diſcretion.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants on the South ſide are exceeding little, on the North of Gyants ſtature, whom in <hi>Magellan</hi> they call <hi>Paragous,</hi> for their great feet:<note place="margin">Paragows.</note> they clothe with ſkins of ſheep and other beaſts for the rigidneſſe of the Climate. Theſe are a people without civility,<note place="margin">

They live upon fleſh dried in the Sun, enemies to none, but give themſelves wholly to chaſe and fiſhing.</p>
               <p>This Streight is vexed with forcible tides from both ſides, which like two Cells encounter with a moſt obſtreperous fragour, where the danger is great, and chiefly in winter, when the winds rage there with more violence: for the Streight is never free from winds, no not in ſummer: divers veſſels periſh in croſſing the Rocks, which ſeem an Archipelagus of Iſlands, both thoſe on the South-ſea-ſide, and thoſe which come from <hi>Lima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The immenſe depth on the South ſide renders the ſea more navigable, and on the North the length of the fall breaks the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:98515:203"/>
force of the waves, ſo as there is no great danger but in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt, and in ſome places of not above a muſket ſhot.</p>
               <p>In the winter the Sea is higher than in Summer, and the paſſage wider, notwithſtanding the ſailing is nothing more ſecure by reaſon of the croſſe winds and colds. Some are of opinion that the Tides do not meet at the ſame time, but as it flowes on one ſide it ebbs on the other, by a locall remotion of the ſea: but they are deceived, for 'tis certain that the floud comes in and goes out on both ſides at the ſame time, like as the boyling of a pot riſing from the center diſperſes to all parts, and cooling, ceaſes all together: this hath been proved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that at the ſame time the floud came thirty leagues form the South, and ſeventy from the North, the Sea ſwelling from both parts, as the Pilots obſerved, following the courſe of the Moon, the Tides augmenting or diminiſhing according to her ſtate, the Tide and Ebbe coming ſooner or later by three quarters of an hour daily conformable to the courſe of that plannet: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> call the high-tide at the new-moon <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beza de aguas,</hi> the tide at the full <hi>Aguas viuas,</hi> the low tides in the wane, <hi>Aguas muertas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſo admirable motion of the Sea ſeems rather a combat, or like the boiling of water in a pot over a fire, then a locall remoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which nevertheleſſe I refer to Naturaliſts.</p>
               <p>The ſtreight begins Northward at the <hi>Cape</hi> of eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Virgins, as <hi>Magellan</hi> called it, and ends Southward at <hi>Cape Victoria</hi>: in the middle ſtood the Towne and Fortreſſe of St. <hi>Philip,</hi> which afterwards, the Inhabitants periſhing with hunger and cold was called the Port of Famine.</p>
               <p>The firſt that paſſed this ſtreight was <hi>Ferdinand Magallanes</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who had both heard and ſeen ſomething of it in their cards. 'Twas in 1519. when he went to find a road to the <hi>Moluccas</hi> that way, for <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth.</p>
               <p>Afterwards one <hi>Pedro Sarmicates</hi> paſſed the ſtreight from North to South; from South to North few paſſe, for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and difficulty to find the way. Since that the famous <hi>Argonautes</hi> who went round the world by Sea, as Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in one thouſand five hundred ſeventy nine, <hi>Candiſh</hi> in one thouſand five hundred eighty five, <hi>Oliuier de Nort</hi> in one thouſand five hundred ninety nine, and of freſher memory <hi>Spilberg, le Maire, Hermita,</hi> and others. But <hi>le Maire</hi> in 1618. a little further, in ſome fifty ſix or fifty ſeven degrees, towards the South, found the new Streight, called by his own name much ſhorter, and much eaſier than the other, not being above eight leagues in length, and the breadth wide and facile: the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came thither afterwards, and gave it the name Saint <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the North-ſide the ſtreight of <hi>Magellan</hi> are abundance

of wingleſſe birds,<note place="margin">Wingleſs birds.</note> that live in holes in the ground, fat and good meat, they called <hi>Pinguins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> found many good Harbours in the Streight, where good freſh waters came; but they are not eaſy to enter, for the ſtrong and turbulent windes that raigne there. The Land on both ſides lies exceeding high, and banked with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible Mountains, particularly on the South and Eaſt, where they are ever covered with ſnow.</p>
               <p>The breadth in ſome places is of two, three, or foure leagues, in the narroweſt of one, or of two musket ſhots. 'Tis exceſſive cold, and never without ſnow and ice, the trees notwithſtanding ever green, and laden with fruit.</p>
               <p>From this Streight by <hi>Cape Foendo,</hi> and the White <hi>Cape,</hi> they aſcend again into the ſilver river, where begins <hi>Braſile</hi> in 35 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees beyond the line, reaching to the River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> under the Line. This ſilver river, or <hi>Paravai Parana,</hi> and <hi>Paraguay,</hi> diſgorging altogether like <hi>Cordillera, de ſerra, Muada</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Charcas</hi> over-flow the whole Countrey, ſo as the Inhabitants for that time live in Canoes, faſtned to Trees, till the floud be retired within the banks. At the mouth tis about 35. leagues over, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within the Land fifty; being ſtreightened towards the Mouth by reaſon of the Mountains, and compaſſing a number of Iſlands: this River riſes near the Town of <hi>Plata,</hi> towards <hi>Potoſſi,</hi> whence it takes name. Others derive it from the great lake called <hi>Eupania,</hi> where the other Rivers take birth, as <hi>Marag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> but it ſhould rather be <hi>Parana,</hi> which afterwards falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſilver River.</p>
               <p>The firſt that came within the mouth of this River, was <hi>Americus Veſputius,</hi> ſent by the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> to diſcover <hi>Braſile,</hi> in the yeare fifteen hundered and one, and ſuppoſing it a paſſage from the South ſea to the <hi>Moluccas,</hi> ſatisfied himſelfe, and returned without looking farther.</p>
               <p>After that, in the yeare fifteen hundered and twelve, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent one <hi>John Solis,</hi> who named it <hi>Solis.</hi> In fifteen hundered twenty five <hi>Sebaſtian Ganor</hi> made a farther advance up the River, and by reaſon of the ſilver he found amongſt the people, or rather becauſe the head of it lies near the Town <hi>Plata,</hi> towards <hi>Potoſſi,</hi> called it the ſilver River, or <hi>Plata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants along the River are of large ſtature, long-lived, light, and nimble of foot, uſe bows and ſlings in warr, and ſpeak the <hi>Patagonick</hi> Language, or the <hi>Chicaan</hi>: of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have aſcended this River as farr as <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> and <hi>Colao.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other river I mentioned is above fifty leagues in the mouth, and riſes amongſt the Mountains of <hi>Cuntiſuya,</hi> near <hi>Cuſco,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> call it <hi>Apurimac,</hi> principall, and <hi>Capacmaya,</hi>

                  <hi>BRaſile</hi> is a large Province of <hi>America</hi> appertaining to the Crown of <hi>Portugall,</hi> extending from 25. degrees to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond from North to South, ſome ten degrees in breadth from Eaſt to Weſt, from fort <hi>Para</hi> in the mouth of the great River of <hi>Amazons</hi> to <hi>Plata.</hi>

For the Country, the benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſweetneſſe of the air, and water, and the fertility of ſoyle is a miracle in ſuch a Climate and temperature: which renders the Inhabitants of ſo healthfull and long life: and though the Climate be under the Torrid, there come freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales from the Sea that moderate it, ſo as it becomes a delicate habitation, having every morning ſome miſts and dews, which the Sun afterwards diſſolves into air. Here you meet with nothing but fair open fields, pleaſant hills, fertile mountains, freſh valleys, green meadows, abundance of woods, rivers, and fountains of excellent waters, with infinite plenty of all ſorts of trees, plants, fruits, grain, cattle, ſugar, balm.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:98515:206"/>
very dexterous in killing it with their bow, wherein they ſhoot exactly.</p>
               <p>Divers of ours being taken, have naturalized amongſt them, whether for that they had not means to eſcape, or voluntarily, having wife and children with them, of whom ours have learned much of their manners and language: but the miſery is, divers of them have fallen to frequent their Superſtitions and Idolatries: when we did inculcate to them to leave that unfortunate and bruitiſh life, they anſwered us with nothing but ſighs and tears, though they knew us for <hi>French-men,</hi> nor would have diſcovered themſelves ſuch to us, had not one of us found it out by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how attentively they harkened to our language, and as we told them they were Chriſtians, one amongſt them anſwered no, which ſhewed they underſtood us, and in effect one of them was a <hi>Rocheler,</hi> the other of Saint <hi>Malo,</hi> who were taken in one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred ſeventy one, going towards the <hi>Cape</hi> of Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> to look water: Five of them the Savages eat and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved three for their youth; they are exceeding greedy of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh, and hold it the moſt delicate of all other.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe theſe people live in great innocency in little round Cabbins, without moveable or utenſil, except ſome ſilly veſſel of earth or wood, and a cotton bed like a fiſhing-net hanging in the ayre: they are very credulous, and underſtanding their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage a ſmall matter might convert them.</p>
               <p>Generally they believe the immortality of the ſoule, and that after death they go to dance with their Fathers behind the mountains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all their delight is in dancing, and dance perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, if they have the leaſt leiſure; as they eat at all hours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſervation of any order: Sometimes riſe at midnight to eat, and never drink till they have quite ended: ſome believe that the ſoules of ſuch as have lived well, according to their law of nature, tranſmigrate into beautiful bodies, and others on the contrary for puniſhment into deformed and ſqualid ones, which in a manner is the <hi>Metempſycoſy</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whereof we ſpoke in the Eaſt Indies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sourons</hi> and <hi>Carmels</hi> who live upon the River of <hi>Plata,</hi> towards <hi>Paraguay</hi> have but one wife, whom they petition her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for, who never denies her to brave and martial men, all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and honour lying in that: at their marriages the Prieſts <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raibes</hi> or pages, perform ſome ceremonies, cauſing them to change ſhooes: of houſhold ſtuffe, they have nothing but a couch, a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton bed, and an <hi>Eſtere</hi> of ſtraw, or ſea-reeds. The father gives her in a baſket cotton girdles, and other ribbands to bind her hair, and feathers for her huſhand.</p>
               <p>All is in common except their wives, who keep a ſevere fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to their huſbands, never tranſgreſſing, if otherwiſe they are puniſhed without remiſſion, or fly the countrey, in other crimes
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:98515:206"/>
they are not ſo rigorous: maids and widows uſe all freedom; and if a huſband find his wife a maid, he eſteemes himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely married, and that ſhe muſt needs be contemptible, for that no man hath medled with her.</p>
               <p>Contention betwixt man and wife ſeldom or never happens, and when it does, they hold it to proceed from the diſpleaſure of their Gods, and make ſacrifices to appeaſe them.</p>
               <p>The women being delivered, they ſwathe the child with a cotton fillet without other clothes, and when they foul them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make them clean with ſand, and lay them on their faces on the ground to ſleep, where they lye without further danger.</p>
               <p>They have certain experienced hearbs which they lay about them being near child-bed, which are very beneficial to them; and rejoyce much at the birth of a child, eſpecially a Male-child; and the joy is general, all crying out, That is, the Infant ſhall take revenge of their enemies.</p>
               <p>They eat upon the ground, or elſe on a ſort of reeds,<note place="margin">Cuſtomes of the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians,</hi>
                  </note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they likewiſe cover their Cabbins; they ſleep commonly in the open ayre without the leaſt inconvenience, ſo ſweet and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate is their climate.</p>
               <p>Letters nor characters they have none, but are very ignorant, <hi>Mandioc</hi> a root is their chiefeſt diet, whereof they make flower, and eat it without baking, likewiſe boyled with water, it makes them drink in taſte like turned milke: they make flower alſo of fiſh dryed in the Sun, are great hunters, and good archers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Braſil</hi> or <hi>Araboutan</hi> is their principal traffick, which both men and women go a long way for, and bring it on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to truck for glaſſe toyes, little knives and looking-glaſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Braſil</hi> is a tree of more then ordinary height, with ſmall leaves, and infructiferous. many kindes of it, yellow, white, and carnation.</p>
               <p>They make their chaffer with Merchants, without language, ſetting their wood an end on one ſide, and what they would buy on the other, and ſo bargaining by ſignes, every one takes away his own.</p>
               <p>In ſome places they make drink of a root called <hi>Piroua,</hi> which hath a ſent that flyes into the head of thoſe that are not uſed to it; it refreſhes like <hi>Tiſan,</hi> of Orange colour, when 'tis boyled.</p>
               <p>Being at <hi>Caramel,</hi> they feaſted us exceedingly, with the beſt dainties they had, and on all occaſions invited us to eat with them, admiring our wayes, and highly taken with our civilities: amongſt other things it ſeemed ſtrange to them, why we ſo oft took off our hats, but informing them it was to do honour, they were ſatisfied: they invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to marry there, and live with them, offering us their

               <p>They aſſault their enemies in their habitations, which are ſurrounded with a ſort of pointed Palizadoes to gore the aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants: the others ſtorme it in the weakeſt place, and being ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtious and ſtrong backed, ever ſtrive to come to hand-fight.</p>

               <p>Savages though they are, there appeares ſomething of good natural reaſon in them, which by inſtruction and addreſſe might be improved, As when we reproach them with their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they retort that we are the ſtupid and unreaſonable to conceale what God hath ſo liberally given us, and have we nothing to doe with our money, but to caſt it away upon clothes, things of no uſe, being borne without them.</p>

And telling him, that wood was of value in our countrey, and uſefull to our livelyhood: And how, ſaid he, is your countrey ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it yields you not ſufficient for life, and ſuſtenance?</p>
               <p>I anſwered, the countrey had a good ſufficiency in it to maintain us; but we deſired to get wealth for the felicity of our ſelves and poſterity.</p>
               <p>And what ſayes he, will theſe riches advance you in Gods favour, will they preſerve from death, or can you carry them with you? and replying, 'twas for none of all this, but that we took a felicity to leave it to our children: Well, ſaid he, if the ſoyle were ſufficient to maintain you and your Fathers before you, why ſhould it not do the ſame for your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and poſterity.</p>
               <p>They alledge the ſame reaſon, when we blame them for not cultivating their land, ſaying ſince it kept their fathers, 'twill not faile to maintain them and their children. So theſe ſilly people live free from all paſſion, avarice, ambition, envie, and labour of body or ſpirit.</p>
               <p>If they get any thing that is good, they call in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and make merry together, with perfect friendſhip, candor, and freedome, without quarrels or calumnies, go freely to one another, and eat what they finde, with a good will.</p>
               <p>They have a drink of the root <hi>Cavain,</hi> which the <hi>Carmels</hi> call <hi>Piroa,</hi> made thus, they boyle the root with water, and when they uſe it, they ſtirre it together and drink it warm, this taſtes like turned milk, but in ſome places for a dainty,

               <p>The Iſle of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> hath fifty leagues of ſound land, was diſcovered on Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> day, that gave name of it.

               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:98515:211"/>That which diſpleaſes is, they pour it into great caldrons, and it is like honey, then they make it in loaves hardly dry, you never ſeeing any ſo ſolid from thence as from <hi>Madero,</hi> nor is it worth ſo much though they uſe all poſſible art to refine it: They purify it with cindars. At the plantations far from water the Blacks fetch water to ſet the mills at work. The ſugar being drawn they give the canes to the ſwine, which fattens them, and makes the fleſh of excellent taſte, and wholſome; from mid-May to mid-Auguſt they have Eaſtern winds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they dry their Sugars, without which they could never do it; for all other windes are adverſaries to them, becauſe of the raines they ſtirr up in the other months.</p>
               <p>The Iſland is unhealthfull by reaſon of the corrupted ayr: their houſes are good, built and covered with timber, out of the abundance of huge high trees.</p>
               <p>All nations heretofore went thither by reaſon of franck traffick; but now they muſt pay tribute, all but the <hi>French,</hi> who enjoy the ſame immunities as the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have many ſlaves from <hi>Guinea,</hi> brought by the <hi>Corſairs</hi> to be ſold.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Ribaut Diepois</hi> took a veſſell with diverſe whole families, men, women, and children, whom he ſet free on land, but cauſed two Blacks to hang the Maſter and five Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners. 'Tis a cruell inhumanity to carry the Father away by violence into perpetuall ſlavery, while his poor family is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to miſery and ſtarving. They marry the ſlaves amongſt themſelves, for breed, like a race of horſes; who continue ſlaves by inheritance: whereas in the Eaſt at ten yeares end they are made free-men: they have but one day in the weeke free to themſelves, which they employ induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, in making themſelves fine to be acceptable to their Miſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> following the humour of their Nation, have a vanity to have their ſlaves grow rich, and walke with gravity like them, and will give them a hundred or two hundred Crownes, to buy <hi>Turks</hi> for their gain and eaſe. They bring the greater part to be baptized, and marry together, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding them of a livelyhood. They celebrate certain feaſts like the <hi>Basks,</hi> with drums beaten by hand, and ſongs to them, and have their meetings under the ſhade of trees. The ſlaves yearly chooſe one amongſt them for their Prince, to command and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern at their meetings, who ſeats himſelf in the middle, and then they give him one of theſe drums, and with both hands above his head he makes a moſt harmonious muſick, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with flutes, and other inſtruments, looking on their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes with a thouſand munkey tricks, while they dance and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:98515:212"/>
trip <hi>Moreſco Sarabrands</hi> to them again. They go together to fetch their Prince at his Maſters, who firſt makes them a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then bringing forth the Prince decked with flowers, a ſcepter in one hand, and a noſegay in the other, they carry him on their ſhoulders in a <hi>Palanquin,</hi> to the place of dancing, where their Miſtreſſes meet them. The Prince firſt dances with his Miſtreſſe, &amp; then the others follow. The Prince <hi>de la' amour,</hi> called the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadit,</hi> ſalutes his Lady, and then with gravity preſents her the Poſie, which ſhe receives, and dances with amorous ſmiles and ſimpers. Afterwards they all attend the Prince to his Maſters houſe, where the nuptials are conſummated, provided they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Sieur de la Courb</hi> was there, there was a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Lady, widow of a Merchant, called <hi>Bornauente,</hi> rich, fair, and young, to whom the chiefeſt of the Iſland ſued for marriage, and ſhe would give ear to none, becauſe ſhe would not put her ſelf under ſubjection. She kept divers ſlaves, and there arriving a veſſel laden with ſlaves, ſhe bought ſome, and one amongſt the reſt of ſo handſome garb and addreſſe, ſhe judged him to be of good extraction, whereupon aſked whence he was? he told her he was of <hi>Danieta,</hi> the Son of a wealthy Nobleman, who had intelligence of his capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and would ſhortly free him, that he was taken fiſhing in a ſmall boat; and enquiring further of his religion, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he was an Idolater.</p>
               <p>But the Lady taken with his gracefull behaviour, uſed him with all poſſible kindneſſe, and one day her luſt bearing her away, ſhe reſolved to call him to her Chamber, and receive a ſatisfaction from him; for which purpoſe having ſent for him, in expectation ſhe lay down upon her bed, fell faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, and in a dream thought ſomething came that rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulled the ſheet from under her: waking affrighted, ſhe called her maid, and related the viſion to her; the maid wiſhed her to lay by ſuch troubles, and commend her ſelfe cordially to Almighty God: On the morrow ſhe roſe early and went to her Confeſſor, to whom ſhe related the whole, and he gave her for penance to ſell this ſlave, and never to ſee him more; promiſing he would be her chapman, and buy him to be his boatman, when he went to take the aire.</p>
               <p>The Lady made her advantage of his proffer, and doubting the ſlave to be ſome Demon or Magician ſent him to the Prieſt, who bought him to his ſad misfortune; for rowing along by the ſhore to take the air, there came a ſudden guſt from the land that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the boat: Now the Prieſt ſwimming well made to ſhore, but the ſlave with a pole daſhed his brains out, and himſelf was never heard of after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:98515:212"/>In this Iſland the Rats do great miſchief, eating their Sugar loaves, whatſoever they can do to prevent it. Here upon a Mountain there are certain trees that diſtill water continually, as in the Iſle of Iron in the <hi>Canaries</hi>; theſe trees are ever hooded with a thick cloud, which moyſtens them in ſuch ſort that they yield ſufficient to water all their fields of Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, whereas that in the Iſle of Iron diſtills but at certain hours.</p>
