            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Yet lotterie is vſed by caſting Dice, and by shuffling and cutting the Cards before the wit is exerciſed. But how doth this follow?

that <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> ſpeaking of a Lot in the ſecond acception, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it to be vncertaine.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is true that if in game, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy <hi>(truly ſo termed)</hi> be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Lot, a matter then of mere indifferency is put to hazard. But more hereof in my 3. reply. In meane while, conſider whether this 2. shape be more particularly for the preſent buſineſſe, ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the queſtion, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and Note, that in both theis shapes, onely Lightnes, and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of matters putt to Lottery are preſſed as cauſes moſt iuſtifying a Lot, yea ſo, as that in the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his former shaped argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propoſition, he poſitively affirmeth that we shall finde a Lott not fitt to be vſed in a weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If ſo, then Weightneſſe, and Neceſſity of matters controverted make Lottery leſſe lawfull, if not altogether vnlawfull. But thereof alſo more in that reply. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to his 3. reaſon <hi>pag. 131.</hi> Which is this.</p>

               <note place="margin">M.

If <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> deny a Lott to be holy, except it have a more remote holy vſe, I ſay He may as well deny an Oath to be holy for that cauſe.

If any creature have any power to be a Lot, yet that power is not to be vſed vnto Lottery, but in caſes (whereof gameing is none) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God alloweth ſuch vſe thereof. To the inforcing of the concluſion by a ſuppoſed confirmation of the Aſſumption, I ſay, It is a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the queſtion. For though a dog having a naturall power to hunt, be not exiled from recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet ought a <hi>Lot-creature</hi> to be, for reaſons given, and to be given, or rather defended hereafter.

Is not this fainting? Let vs now proceed to that, which <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, touching both the doing of every act, and the doing of it in this, and that manner.

What fearefull shifting from the Word is here? But why doth he ioyne the doing it ſelfe of an Act. with the manner thereof? I'le tell you, even to make a way to his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. For, if he ſticke cloſe to that which he teacheth in ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate wordes, to witt, that an act it ſelſe is lawfull in it ſelfe, if, in the Word, it be, either commaunded; or permitted expreſſely, or by iuſt conſequence, he foreſeeth, that it will be anſwered to the fore-part of his aſſumption, that every Lott is not lawfull in it ſelfe. Therefore he would trouble the Reader's head with a ſuppoſed direction therein of naturall reaſon, and that ſufficient, (I ſay) <hi>Suppoſed;</hi> For he sheweth no direction therein of naturall reaſon either ſufficient, or inſufficient. But let vs with feare, and trembling, conſider <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> his moſt ſtraunge poſition

Neither doth the Word abridge vs of the helpe, and vſe of naturall reaſon for direction in ſuch actions.

Now then, Let vs try the force of the Aſſumption's confirmation. It
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:770:41"/>
is true that Recreation in generall, indefinitely vnderſtood, is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God's Word. But I beleive <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> will not affirme all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations taken vp by men, to be ſo warranted. Yes (ſaith <hi>Mr. Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker)</hi> we may recreate our ſelves with any thing, that is not againſt the generales rules, becauſe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching things, wherewith we may recreate, there is nothing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>Of this evaſion <hi>[Not againſt]</hi> I neede not ſpeake at this inſtant. But touching things not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſo much inculcated, I aske whether things muſt be determined particularly, or by name; or elſe, if not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, they are lawfull. If ſo, why doth <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of divers particulars,) as of a key, and a booke, of a paire of sheares, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſo earneſtly aske, Are they any where found revealed in the Word of God? Where he is of another minde, than here, arguing thus. Not found there commaunded, or permitted; therefore vnlawfull. If it be ſaid, Not ſo found there, to finde out a theife. I then ſay; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are Lottes ſo found there for Recreation. But if by <hi>Not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> be meant, Thinges wherewith we recreare are not determined in the Word either expreſſly, or by iuſt conſequence, then, whoſoever ſaith ſo, if he be wiſe, will adde <hi>[So farre as I doe remember, and know.]</hi> For who can remember all the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy Scriptures, and know all iuſt conſequences, that may be made from them?

At laſt let vs reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly conſider the generall rules ſo often ſpoken of, and we shall finde, that <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> should have done well not to have pleaſed <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines</hi> by pleading <hi>Not against,</hi> but to have given the Word due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by ſaying with <hi>Mr. Calvin.</hi> [The vſe of things is to be limited <hi>according</hi> to the generall rules.] For theis rules require <hi>Decency, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and therefore they are not obeyed by the vſe of things not <hi>vndecent,</hi> not <hi>inexpedient,</hi> and not <hi>impious.</hi> For it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that in <hi>1.

which the vſer of a Lott expecteth.

Is there then no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene an ordinary, and extraordinary Lott? The onely difference is the <hi>ſubiect-matter</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reabout the Lott is imployed. The <hi>ſubiect-matter</hi> of an ordinary Lott, is, by God's allowance, A Controverſy to be ended: The <hi>ſubiect-matter</hi> of an extraordinary Lott is any other matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about a Lott is imployed by God's ſpeciall direction; otherwiſe it is

vnlawfull, as be luſorious, and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory Lotts. In regard of which difference onely, <hi>Mr. Gatakers</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique holdeth good, as thus. From the vſe of a Lott about an other matter than ending a Controverſy and that by God's ſpeciall direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it followeth not, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vſe a Lott about any other matter, than ending a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, as gaming, without God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall direction. But <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> maketh an other difference to witt, An immediate, and ſpeciall Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in an extraordinary Lott, which is not in an ordinary Lott. He doth ſo; and therefore in his Logique, he cunningly ioyneth a ſuppoſed extraordinary Event to a ſuppoſed extraordinary Act, &amp; declineth the proofe of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary act, which rather he should have done, becauſe mine argument ſtandeth vpon the Vſe

of Lottes. Neither doth he found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proove an immediate, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Providence, or extraordinary event, to be in an extraordinary, and not in an ordinary Lott.

Doth not then this place make good mine Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But for all this <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> will not have it ſo; For as he tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this place, he ſaith It impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus much, [That there is a Providence in all things, even the leaſt, and moſt caſuall] and this he would confirme by theis my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, viz: [The diſpoſingꝭ of the chaunce is ſecret, that it might be chaunce indeed, &amp; wholy of God, who directed all things.] Doe theis wordes iuſtifie <hi>Mr. Gatakers</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this place? Yes; For they ſay plainely, God directed all things, and, they ſay withall; The diſpoſing of the chaunce (that is of the things purpoſedly diſpoſed by a man vnto a variable event) vnto a certaine event, is ſecret, that it may be chaunce indeed, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:770:49"/>
is, an event not by the will of man, but wholy of God. So that my wordes imply this argument. God directeth all things, Therefore much more, in our diſcerning, a Lot, the whole diſpoſing whereof is of him. This is farre from ſaying that this place importeth onely, That there is a Providence in all things. Neither doth <hi>Mr. Gatakers</hi> tranſlation inferre this imported interpretation. For this diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>[But]</hi> doth ſo oppoſe every iudgment, or diſpoſing of it (as he expoundeth <hi>Iudgment)</hi> to a Lot caſt into the lappe, as that <hi>Every diſpoſing,</hi> is all one with <hi>The whole diſpoſing.</hi> This place ſo troubleth <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> that from it he would have no more gathered, than that the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le event (as of all things, ſo) of a Lot, is of the Lord. Yet ſo, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by meanes in the moſt of them, and not implying and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:770:49"/>
Providence vniverſally in them. I neede not examine the meanes, or immediate Providence of all the inſtances quoted in the margent For here it is <hi>impliedly</hi> graunted (for he faith not <hi>All,</hi> but the <hi>most</hi> of them) that in ſome things God worketh not by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that there is an immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Providence <hi>Particularly,</hi> for he denieth ſuch a Providence onely, as being <hi>univerſally.</hi> Howſoever it be in other things, I thinke it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all, that will ſee, that God, without meanes, and therefore <hi>immediately,</hi> doth wholy diſpoſe the Lot caſt into the lappe vnto this, or that event, what pleaſeth him, whereas man diſpoſeth the things onely vnto a variable event. As at cardes, man shuffleth them of purpoſe to diſpoſe them vnto a variable event: But, by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Providence of God, they are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:770:50"/>
ſo shuffled, as that this, or that event followeth. Therefore <hi>(with Mr. Gataker favour)</hi> any reaſonable man may iudge it not ſenſeleſſe to ſay (which he doubteth of <hi>pa. 147.)</hi> that in childrens playes, at <hi>Even, and Odde,</hi> or at <hi>Heades, &amp; Points,</hi> there is an immediate Providence, In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the will of the childe, and guiding his coniecture. Thus we ſee this place doth confirme mine aſſumption, and the proofe annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mr. Gatakers</hi> interpretation not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. But he giveth 2. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt an immediate provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ordinary Lottes, which<note place="margin">1.</note> are alſo to be conſidered. The <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> is this. That which agreeth to a thing, as it is ſuch, agreeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to ȧll things, that are ſuch. Therefore if there be an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Providence in a Lot, as it is caſuall, then there is an immediate providence in all thinges, that are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:770:50"/>
caſuall: But the latter is not true; <hi>ergo</hi> not the former, <hi>pag. 143.</hi> Why not the latter? if the is Poſitions be true. That which ſeemes Chaunce to us, is a certaine Word of God (ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> But <hi>Mr. Gatak.</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth<note place="margin">Sermo quidam</note> it, Is <hi>as</hi> a word of God) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting vs with his Will, <hi>pag. 17.</hi> and In caſuall events there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing guiding them, but God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>pag. 22.</hi> But ſuppoſe that there is not an immediate Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all things, that be caſuall, what is that to the purpoſe? For all things caſuall are not <hi>ſuch,</hi> with a Lott, wherein things are of purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe diſpoſed by man vnto an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine event, which things, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by man, are wholy diſpoſed by God vnto a certaine event, this or that; ſo it is not in all other things, that be caſuall. Therefore all other caſuall things, and Lotts are not <hi>ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Neither is it ſaid an
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:770:51"/>
immediate Providence is in a Lot, as it is caſuall, but as the Lot being made caſuall is wholy diſpoſed by God to this, or that event. So that from <hi>Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gatakers axiome</hi> this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be framed. An imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Providence, in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Lot, is acknowledged by <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> as it is a Lot (ſay I) wholy diſpoſed by God; Therefore an immediate Providence is in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Lot (as it is a Lot) wholy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by God. For there is no difference betweene theis ſorts of Lotts, (as they be Lotts) and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. For <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> hath she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed that <hi>Prov. 16. 33.</hi> ſpeaketh as well of one ſort of Lotts, as of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The other argument is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the <hi>kill-kow.</hi> If in every Lott there be neceſſarily an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worke, and Providence of God, then is it in the naturall of man to make God worke imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:770:51"/>
at his pleaſure: But to ſay, that it is in man's power naturally to ſett God on working, immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, at his pleaſure, is abſurd. There is not therefore an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worke, and Providence of God neceſſarily in every Lott. <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> like an Oratour, ſeemeth deſirous to draw his adverſary into hatred by thei wordes <hi>[Neceſſarily, Naturall power, Sett God on wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, At pleaſure, To ſay, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd] Verba dum ſint, ſurdo canit.</hi> But hoping better, I aunſwering his Logique, deny the Aſſumption. For it is as much in man's naturall power to ſet God on worke imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, in an ordinary, as in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Lot. For both God, and man doe reſpectively as much in the one Lott, as in the other. But an extraordinary Lot is by the ſpeciall direction of God: True; So is an ordinary Lott by God's
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:770:52"/>
ſpeciall adviſe to ende a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. If then every Lot be a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our glorious God on wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, there ought to be prayer, if not by wordes; yet in heart in the vſe as well of ordinary, as extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lotts. If ſo, then Lotts are not to be vſed in ſport. Here then will I proceed to the defence of my ſecond argument, which is this, <hi>pag. 150.</hi>

            <p>

               <note place="margin">Aunſw.</note> The Aſſumption of the maine Argument is not true, but onely in extraordinary Lottes, vſed not with out ſpeciall direction. Yea rather, if a Lot be ſuch as is here ſaid, it is not lawful to vſe Lottes in any caſe whatſoever. Becauſe thereby we require a worke of God's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power, and Providence, and ſo tempt God. And to ſpeake as the truth is. By this courſe, and force of this diſcourſe, the onely lawfull vſe of a Lot is condemned, &amp; an vnlawfull vſe of it is allowed in the roome of it. Againe: An Oath, and a Lot are not alike. The compariſon therefore laide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them will not holde. For neither is the right of ought in an ordinary Lot, put to the ſpeciall providence, and imediate worke of God, as the truth of the thing teſtified is in an Oath, put to his Teſtimony: Neither is there in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:770:53"/>
every Lot any ſuch ſolemne invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God, as there is in an Oath ever, either expreſſed, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. For the definition of each thing conteineth the whole nature of the thing defined. Now a Lot may be defined without mention of Prayer, as appeareth in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition thereof in the Dialogue: But ſo cannot an Oath. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prayer is not of the eſſence of a Lot. Neither doe the places, <hi>1. Sam. 14. 41. Acts 1. 24.</hi> (whereof the former was a faithleſſe prayer) proove it. They proove onely, that prayer was ſometimes vſed before an extraordinary Lot, for an immediate Providence to direct the event of it. Which is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in ordinary Lotts. For in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth tithes, <hi>Levit. 27. 32.</hi> it was not lawfull to pray God to give a right Lot. In election of offices ſacred, or civill prayer
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:770:54"/>
ought to be vſed, yet it followeth not therefore, that Prayer is part of the choiſe, or that therefore the Election, in the nature thereof, doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe a ſpeciall providence, and determining pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. Laſtly, A Lott is not in it ſelfe an holy thing alwayes, and neceſſarily, as hath beene shewed, nor indeed was ever any ſo ſave extraordinarily. Therefore there is difference betweene Lotts and Oathes. Indeed, Whoſoever shall contemne an extraordinary Lot, he shall abuſe an holy thing, and Gods Name.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Reply 2.</note> To this long anſwer I might make a short reply. For whereas <hi>Mr. Gatakers</hi> maine ground is this. There is no immediate providence of God in an ordinary, as is in an extraordinrry Lot, and therevpon he buildeth theis anſweres, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore there is no tempting of God
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:770:54"/>
by vſing Lotts in ſport: Therefore no prayer expreſſed, or to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood is required in ordinary Lotts: and Therefore an ordinary Lot is not an holy thing in it ſelfe; I might, (referring my ſelfe to the defence of my former argument,) breifely reply, and ſay. There is an immediate providence in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Lot. Therefore God is tempted by vſing Lotts in ſporte: Therefore Prayer expreſſed, or to be vnderſtood, is required of them who vſe an ordinary Lot: and Therefore an ordinary Lot is an holy thing: But ſomething more in replying, will have more ſavour in reading. Therefore I firſt mervaile that <hi>M. G.</hi> forgetteth himſelfe in concluding. That all Lotts be vnlawfull, if there be an immediate providence in all Lotts. What? Were extraordinary Lotts vnlawfull too? Nay; He
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:770:55"/>
vnderſtandeth an exception of them becauſe they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by God. So I ſay, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Lotts were adviſed by God to end controverſies. Therefore vſing them, in that caſe, is no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God. I mervaile alſo, why <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> should ſo confidently affirme, that, by this courſe, that is, by maintaining an immediate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in all Lotts, an vnlawfull vſe of a Lott is allowed in the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the onely lawfull vſe. But I referre the diſcuſſing thereof to the defence of my <hi>3.</hi> argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Againe, It is to be obſerved, that he ſett's downe a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene an Oath, and a Lott, which I ſett not downe, whereby the minde of the reader may be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For I ſay not, As the <hi>Truth</hi> of a thing is, by an Oath, put to Gods Teſtimony: ſo in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lot the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ght</hi> of a thing is put
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:770:55"/>
to Gods immediate Providence. This is that I ſay, As an Oath, in the nature thereof, ſuppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth the <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying preſence</hi> of God: ſo a Lot, in the nature thereof, ſuppoſeth the <hi>determining preſence</hi> of God. My reaſon is, Ending a controverſy (I ſay not, Deciding a Right, for, before dividing the land of Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe by Lot, no tribe, or family could chalenge more Right to one por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to another) Ending (I ſay) a Controverſy is, by a Lot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to God's determining the ſame by his whole, or immediate diſpoſing the vncertaine Lot) to a certaine event. It is alſo to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that in the <hi>2.</hi> compariſon betweene an Oath, and a Lot, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Prayer, he ſaith, Neither is there in every Lot any ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne invocation. Therefore in ſome Lot, that is, an extraordinary Lot, becauſe of an immediate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:770:56"/>
to direct the event of it. For the ſame cauſe (ſay I) is prayer to be expreſſed, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the vſe of an ordinary Lot too. But (ſaith <hi>Mr. Gataker)</hi> Prayer is of the eſſence of an Oath, and not of a Lott. I have ſaid nothing to the contrary; So that he might have ſpared his definition of a Lot: But becauſe he taketh a definition (ſuch as it is) out of my Dialogue, I will ſay ſomewhat thereto. The Definition (ſo called) is from <hi>Lyrd,</hi> viz. <hi>To vſe Lotts is by a variable event of ſome ſenſible thing to determine ſome doubtfull, or vncertaine matter.</hi> How is this matter to be determined indeed? Even by God's whole, or immediate diſpoſing the Lot. Hath God the principall hand in the determination? and Is not then Prayer to be expreſſed, or vnderſtood in a Lot, that is, in the managing by the vſers thereof?
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:770:56"/>
Now then let vs conſider the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces produced to proove it. The former (ſaith <hi>Mr. Gataker)</hi> was faithleſſe, I ſay ſo too, Becauſe that Lot was without any warrant. This (notwithſtanding Prayer in this, and the other place) doth shew that God's people beleiving that God doth ſignifie his iudgment by the whole, or immediate diſpoſing of that Lot, did therefore thinke themſelves bound to pray. But both theis Lotts were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, wherein was an immediate providence of God. Therefore they might well beleive they should pray. True; So all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians may, yea and muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive they ought to pray in the vſing ordinary Lotts, becauſe of God's immediate Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence exerciſed therein. Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was vnlawfull in ſetting out Tithe. If ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not becauſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:770:57"/>
it was an ordinary Lot (If a Lot) but becauſe the Lord expreſly ſaid <hi>Of all that goeth vnder the rodde the tenth shall be holy.</hi> The inſtance of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of offices is beſides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe- For it is not argued thus. Becauſe Gods people prayed when they vſed a Lot, therefore there is an immediate Providence of God in a Lot: But thus. There is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Providence of God in a Lot, therefore Gods people prayed when they vſed a Lot. If then there be an immediate Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of God in a Lot, and in regard thereof, Prayer is to be expreſſed, or vnderſtood in lawfull vſe of a Lot, then <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Playing,</hi> (though they <hi>rime</hi> well together, yet) <hi>runne</hi> not well together in the lawfull vſe of a Lot.

This <hi>(I thinke)</hi> will not be denied: But it is denied That the vſe of a Lot is reſtrained to end

controverſies, much leſſe great quarrelles onely, and ſundry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are given of vſing Lotts to other endes than to end contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. But all thoſe Lotts were extraordinary. Therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the beginning of this anſwere where he would finde fault with mine argvment, he ſaith, That the vſe of Lotts in play is ever to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide ſome queſtion, or controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, though a light one (it is like) yet a queſtion, or controverſy truely ſo tearmed, otherwiſe it were no Lot. If he meane a Lot in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, then (with his favour) he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth himſelfe in ſaying Lotts, by him quoted were not to end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies: If he ſpeake of a Lot in play, as being an ordinary Lot, then he faileth in iudgment, In denying that the vſe of ordinary Lotts (whereof is the queſtion) is reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to end controverſies, and The
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:770:62"/>
inſtances which he giveth being extraordinary Lotts, are not to the point. Beſides: The ſubiect-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an extraordinary Lot being by God's ſpeciall direction, if it be lawfull, there may (happily) be no preſent controverſy. Whereas, the ſubiect-matter of an ordinary Lot, being ſomething queſtioned betweene man, &amp; man, there may be a great controverſy. I ſay, May be, For if it be well obſerved, in an ordinary Lot there is not alwayes a preſent controverſy to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: But alwayes ſome queſtion to be decided to prevent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. As may appeare by <hi>Mr. Gatakers</hi> owne wordes, partly here, where he ſaith [That there muſt be ſome queſtion, or controverſy, or elſe it is no Lot,] but more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where he ſaith: That the Lot v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſouldiers about Chriſt his garments, which he truly calleth

For God, who would have no controverſies, whould have alſo ſuch things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved which may cauſe, or iuſtly occaſion controverſies. Therefore Chriſt expounding the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.<note place="margin">Math. 5. 21. 22.</note> Thou shallt not kill, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth wordes of provocation.

Surely, If <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> had acknowledged God's ſpeciall preſence by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Providence in a Lot, as being a Lot ordained by God, to end controverſies, he would not have ſo written, but deemed weighty matters beſt agreeing with the nature of a Lot. It is true that a matter of leſſe weight in it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:770:64"/>
ſelfe may be the ſubiect-matter of a controverſy, as a controverſy may be among men, as well meane, as might, yin their ſtate, as <hi>Mr. Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> here ſaith <hi>pa. 137.</hi> For by migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men (as in <hi>Gen. 6. 4.</hi> ſo) in <hi>Prov. 18. 18.</hi> are meant Men ſtrong in their affections, ſo as the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfy cannot be well ended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Lot, whether the ſubiect-matter of the Controverſy be of more, or leſſe weight in it ſelfe; ſo as there is a neceſſity that one or both parties be ſatisfied. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there may be a great quarrell about a matter of leſſe weight. Neither doe I ſay, that onely great quarrells are to be ended, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a Lot, as <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth not, but ſome may. For (as he ſaith truly, <hi>pag. 173.)</hi> God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in <hi>Prov. 18. 18.</hi> of contentions in generall. Here then we may enter into further conſideration
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:770:65"/>
of that which <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> writeth, <hi>pag. 135.</hi> to wit. That, by the force of our diſcourſe againſt playing with a Lot, the onely lawfull vſe is condemned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and an vnlawfull vſe is allowed in the roome thereof. What is that Onely lawfull vſe of a Lot? I can finde none other than The putting of that to a Lot which he calleth <hi>(pag. 130.)</hi> A matter of mere indifferency, that is, Such as is not materiall, whether a man doe, or omitt: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there may be a lawfull vſe of a Lot about ſuch a matter queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to determine, or prevent a Controverſy, yet I wonder that <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> deemeth it that onely lawfull. Doth not he graunt, <hi>pag. 91.</hi> That Prayer ſpecially applyed to a Lot may be conceived in weighty matters, as in the choiſe of a Magiſtrate, which is not a matter of mere indifferency, that is, ſuch
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:770:65"/>
as is not materiall whether it be done or omitted. Did God ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially appoint Lotts to be vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout onely matters of weight? and muſt man ſo farre ſwerve from Gods example as to ſtrive onely about matters of ſuch indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and then to putt onely ſuch, controverted, to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Lot? So that I doubt not but that with found iudgment, and a cleare conſcience not accuſing me of not duely reſpecting the ſpeciall Providence, of God by his immediate diſpoſing of a Lot, I may affirme. That the more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the ſubiect-matter of a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy is, the more iuſtifiable is the Controverſy: and Be that matter of more or leſſe weight, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the neceſſity of ending a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy is, the more iuſtifiable is the vſe of a Lot. Is not then play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Lot an <hi>irreligious</hi> abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:770:66"/>
of Gods Ordinance? But (faith <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> glad of any thing to pleade for playing with a Lot.) The vſe of a Lot in play is ever to decide ſome queſtion, or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy truely ſo tearmed. If ſo, Then he might have called it a ſerious Lot, according to his doctrine, the lightneſſe of the ſubiect-matter controverted, notwithſtanding. But whereabout is that ſuppoſed Controverſy? <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> in his written anſwere to my Dialogue, before mentioned, ſayth. The Controverſy tendeth to Victory, which till it be decided, there is a Controverſy though a <hi>light one,</hi> yet a Controverſy, truely ſo tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But is that truely or worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be called A Victory, which falleth out by hap-hazard (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>M. Gatakers</hi> eſteeming a Lot) without any deſert? But (ſay I) Is it not a tempting of God to put
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:770:66"/>
him, by his immediate Providence in diſpoſing the Lot, to <hi>humour</hi> (I ſay not, <hi>honour)</hi> ſome of the vaine glorious fooles with ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Victory, who make a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded controverſy there-about, whereas (before they intended to play with a Lot) there was none in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? Is this a Controverſy truly ſo tearmed? I need ſay no more, and therefore proceed to the laſt argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (whereof, but part is mine) It is this, <hi>pag. 173.</hi>

               <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> in his booke sheweth many inſtances of Lotts vſed both by <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and all in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious matters. Which intimateth to me, that they, by the light not onely of the Word, but of nature too, diſcerned, that Lotts are to be vſed onely in ſerious matters. O let vs take heed how we put out ſo great light. But let vs conſider his anſwere, which is onely to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, though I have already confuted many principall parts thereof. In my <hi>Dialogue</hi> to shew
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:770:68"/>
that the Spirit ſometime reaſoneth from a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> to a matter of <hi>right,</hi> negatively, I quote theis Scriptures, <hi>Iohn 8. 39. 40. 1. Cor. 11. 16.</hi> The wordes of the former be theis, <hi>Yee goe about to kill me, a man that hath tolde you the truth; This did not Abraham.</hi> The argument is this <hi>Abraham</hi> did not kill any that tolde him the truth, Therefore yee ought not goe about to kill me, if yee would be ſonnes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> This is <hi>Christ</hi> his Logicke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I dare finde no fault: Neither doth <hi>Mr. Gataker.</hi> For he ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, becauſe the <hi>Printer</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for <hi>verſ. 40.</hi> the <hi>48. verſ.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> maketh paſtime, but I will let paſſe time now to take further knowledge of it. Of the other quotation the wordes be theis. <hi>We have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of God.</hi> The conſequent implied is. <hi>Therefore nomen ought</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:770:68"/>
               <hi>not to pray vncovered.</hi> Herevnto <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> anſwereth indeed, but ſo, that he doth not deny that <hi>Paul</hi> argueth negatively from a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> to a matter of <hi>Right.</hi> Which is all that I intended by the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not, to imagine this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Churches of God, and faithfull men doe not vſe Lotts in gaming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore ſuch gaming is vnlawfull. So that I neede not herein reply vpon <hi>Mr. Gataker,</hi> I onely wonder that he ſaith. The vſe of Lotts in games hath beene common in the Churches of God. What! In the publicke Aſſemblies? as was the fault of women their heads vncovered in the Church at <hi>Corinth?</hi> But <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> in this anſwer ſpeaketh of things <hi>merely</hi> naturall, or civill, as ſweetning with ſugar, &amp;c. I will not now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to proove that in the Word there is matter of iuſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:770:69"/>
either generall, or implied (which is a part of the propoſition) to allow as well ſweetning with ſugar, &amp;c. as Recreation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and therefore they may be lawfull though they be not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Word. But ſuppoſe <hi>M. Gatakers</hi> axiome holdeth in them, what is that to Lotts, wherein is the Name of God by his immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te providence, and the vſe whereof is limited to ende ſerious contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies? In regard whereof doubt I not but an argument concerning the vſe of them, may holde from the <hi>Negative</hi> in matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> as well as in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> or of the point of Gods worship for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. For I preſume that as <hi>Abraham</hi> would not, if he had had occaſion, as he did not, kill a man that tolde him the truth: ſo that all who feared God, and knew the nature, and vſe of a Lot, would not,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:770:69"/>
as they did not, vſe a Lot in game. <hi>Secondly.</hi> Why may not there be for<note place="margin">2.</note> a thing permitted, ſome precept in the Word, generall, or implied? The permiſſion of any thing muſt be in the Word, either expreſſe or by iuſt conſequence, and then the thing ſo permitted is indifferent. But <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> reconſileth theis two axiomes <hi>[Every action is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,] &amp; [No action is indifferent,]</hi> thus, Every naked and bare action ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conceived, is indifferent: But, No action cladde with his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances, is indifferent, <hi>pag. 94.</hi> So that, he concludeth it to be moſt true, That no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar morall action, or No action of the reaſonable creature, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from reaſon, can poſſibly be ſo indifferent, but it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, be either conformable to the rules of Gods holy word, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformable therevnto, <hi>pag. 95.</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:770:70"/>
Theis things, eſpecially theis wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des (Rules of Gods Word, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,) I may ſay, that howſoever a naked indifferent thing be by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, yet a clothed indifferent thing, if lawfull, is by precept, or rule, as well as <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> ſaith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation in generall, is both by permiſſion, and by precept, if not expreſly, yet by iuſt conſequence <hi>pag. 138.</hi> Doth then <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> make permiſſion a iuſt exception againſt the Propoſition? Touching his proofe that Permiſſion is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient<note place="margin">1.</note> warrant: I <hi>first</hi> would know what ordinance of God that is, which hath not ſome limited, or appointed vſe thereof. I am ſure, and have shewed, that Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> touching a Lot, hath. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I greive to obſerve what a gappe <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> hath, by this doctrine, opened to <hi>Licentiouſneſſe.</hi> What! may man diſpoſed to finne, imploy
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:770:70"/>
any creature, whoſe vfe God hath not limited, to what vſe he will? No; For here is to be vnderſtood that exception which is expreſſed in the next part of the reaſon tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching circumſtances, viz [Any vſe, but that which is prohibited] How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I could <hi>demurre</hi> the revpon, eſpecially if an expreſſe prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be vnderſtood, yet herein I will be ſilent having enough graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me. For the vſe of Lotts <hi>in game</hi> is prohibited by iuſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as I have demonſtrated. For the better vnderſtanding of the <hi>2.</hi> part of the reaſon, (haſting to an end) I onely deſire an anſwere to this queſtion. Is any vſe of a Lot lawfull where the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Time, Place,</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> be not determined? If <hi>Mr. Gataker</hi> except an extraordinary vſe, I may as well except the luſorious vſe of Lotts, In anſwere to the exemplification
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:770:71"/>
of this reaſon, graunting that an argument holdeth from the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for the ſubſtance of Gods Worshippe, I yet make this <hi>Quaere.</hi> Whether, onely becauſe God hath determined it? For in thoſe places of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> God doth blame his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple onely for vſing a worship <hi>[which he commaunded not],</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout any intimation that he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed his owne worship. To the ſame purpoſe writeth <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> againſt traditions of men, and will-worship, not for <hi>Mr. Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> cauſe, but becauſe in ſo wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hipping they held not the <hi>Head, ver. 19.</hi> which is <hi>Christ,</hi> King of his Church teaching, and governing the ſame in all things. But in <hi>Deut. Mr. Gatakers</hi> cauſe is implied. It is true, that there God forbiddeth his people to inquire how other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſerved their Gods, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to his word to obſerve
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:770:71"/>
the ſame, without putting anything to, or taking out from the ſame. Surely, I should not gather from hence <hi>Mr. Gatakers</hi> cauſe, as being the onely cauſe; Becauſe I feare it would incourage <hi>Papists</hi> in their ſuperſtitious rites, and ceremonies called <hi>Circumstances,</hi> though, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, parts of the ſubſtance of Gods outward worship. For they are to ready to take holde thereof and ſay God hath determined no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing touching theis ſuppoſed Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, &amp; they are not againſt the word of God, therefore they are permitted, and ſo warranted. But I should gather from that, and the other places (I thinke <hi>directly,</hi> and not <hi>auckwardly)</hi> this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Becauſe all things in, &amp; vnto the ſervice of God ought to be <hi>preciſely</hi> according to Gods Will revealed in his word, therefore whatſoever is not commaunded
