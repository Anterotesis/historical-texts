         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe fourteene yeres I haue ſpared neither pains,

of <hi>Norumbega,</hi> where with some thirty ſeauen

fiue, againſt the fury of the Saluages, I began that
plantation now in <hi>Virginia;</hi> which beginning (here
and there) coſt mee neare fiue yeares worke, and
more then fiue hundred pound of my owne eſtate;
beſide all the dangers, miſeries and incomberances,
and loſse of other imployments I endured <hi>gratìs.</hi>
From which bleſſed Virgin, where I stayed till I left
fiue hundred Engliſh, better prouided then euer I

               <p>This Virgins siſter (called <hi>New-England, An.</hi> 1616
at my humble ſuite, by our moſt gracious Prince
<hi>Charles</hi>) hath bene neare as chargeable to mee and
my friends; from all which, although I neuer got
ſhilling, but it coſt mee a pound, yet I thinke my
<pb facs="tcp:11422:7"/>
selfe happy to see their proſperities.</p>
               <p>If it yet trouble a multitude to proceede vppon
theſe certainties, what thinke you I vndertooke,
when nothing was knowne, but that there was a
vaſt Land? I neuer had power and meanes to do
any thing (though more hath beene ſpent in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
delayes then would haue done the buſineſſe)
but in such a penurious and miſerable maner, as
if I had gone a begging to builde an Vniuerſity;
where, had men bin as forward to aduenture their
purſes, as to crop the fruites of my Labours, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
ere this, had been bettered by theſe deſignes.
Thus betwixt the ſpurte of Deſire, and the bridle
of Reaſon, I am neare ridden to death in a ring of
Deſpaire; the reines are in your hands, therefore
I entreate you to eaſe mee: and thoſe blame mee
(beleeue) this little may haue taught me, not to be
ſo forward againe at euery motion, vnleſſe I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nothing but to carry newes. For now they
dare aduenture a ſhippe, that, when I went firſt,
would not aduenture a groat, ſo they may be at
home againe by Michaelmaſſe; but to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>By this all men may perceiue the ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this voyage in fiue or ſixe moneths,
the plenty of fiſh is moſt certainely approoued;
and it is certaine from <hi>Cannada</hi> and <hi>New England</hi>
hath come neare twenty thouſand Beuer skinnes,
within theſe fiue yeares. Now, had each of thoſe
ſhippes tranſported but sixe, or three pigs, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
goates and hens, fruits, plants and ſeeds as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by this time there might haue beene victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
for a thouſand men. But the deſire of preſent
<pb facs="tcp:11422:8"/>
gaine (in many) is ſo violent, and the indeuours of
many vndertakers ſo negligent, euery one so regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his priuate, that it is hard to effect any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good, and impoſſible to bring them into a
body, rule, or order, vnleſſe both Authoritie and
Mony aſſiſt experiences: it is not a worke for euery
one to plant a Colonie (but when a houſe is built,
it is no hard matter to dwell in it.) This requireth
all the beſt pars of art, iudgement, courage, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
conſtancy, diligence and experience to doe
but neare well: and there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Saying and Doing. But to conclude, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
will go forward if you plant it or no; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may tranſport a colony for no great charge,
that in a ſhort time, might prouide ſuch fraughts,
to buy of vs their dwelling, as I would hope no
ſhip could goe or come emptie from <hi>New England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The charge of this is onely ſalt, nettes, hookes,
lines, kniues, Iriſh rugges, courſe cloth, beads, hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets,
glaſſe and ſuch traſh, onely for fiſhing and
trade with the Saluages, beſides our owne neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
prouiſions, whoſe indeuours will quickely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſray
all this charge; and the Saluages haue intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me to inhabit where I will. Now all thoſe ſhips
haue bin fiſhed within a ſquare of two leagues, &amp;
not one ſhip of all theſe, would yet aduenture fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where queſtionleſſe 500. ſaile may haue their
fraught, better then in <hi>Iſland, Newfoundland,</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and be in their markets before the other can
haue their fiſh in their ſhips. Becauſe <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
fiſhing beginneth in mid-February, the other
not till mid-Maie, the progreſſion heereof tends
<pb facs="tcp:11422:8"/>
much to the aduancement of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas:</hi>
and will be a good friend in time of need to
the Inhabitants in <hi>New-found-land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The returnes made by the Weſterne ſhippes are
commonly divided into 3. parts; one for the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the ſhippe, another for the maiſter and his
company, the third for the victulers; which courſe
being ſtill permitted, will be no hinderance to the
plantation, goe there neuer ſo many, but a meanes
of tranſporting that yearely for little or nothing,
which otherwiſe will coſt many a hundred of
pounds.</p>
               <p>If a Ship can gaine, twenty, thirty, fifty in the
hundred, nay neare three hundred for 100. in ſeuen
moneths, as you ſee they haue doone, ſpending
twice so much time in going and coming as in stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there; were I there planted, ſeeing the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the fiſhings in their ſeaſons, ſerueth the moſt
part of the yeare; and with a little labour we might
make all the ſalt we neede vſe. I can conceiue no
reaſon to diſtruſt, but the doubling and trebling
their gaines that are at all the former charge, and
can fiſh but two months in a yeare: and if thoſe do
giue twenty, thirty, or forty ſhillings for an acre of
land, or ſhip Carpenters, Forgers of yron &amp;c. that
buy all things at a deare rate, grow rich, when they
may haue as good of all needfull neceſſaries for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
(in my opinion) should not grow poore; and
no commoditie in <hi>Europe</hi> doth more decay then
