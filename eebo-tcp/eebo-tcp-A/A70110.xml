            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſent to your Lordſhip a Relation of the laſt Battell fought
in <hi>Keynton</hi> Field, which I ſhewed to the Generall and Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Generall of the Horſe, and divers Colonels and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and they conceive it to be right and according to the
truth: For the ill writing of it, I deſire that your Lordſhip
would excuſe me, for I had not time to write it over again; yet I ſuppoſe
it may be read, and your Lordſhip may cauſe it to be written faire, if your
Lordſhip thinke it worth ſo much. For that which your Lordſhip writeth
concerning my brother <hi>John,</hi> it is a moſt falſe and malicious ſlander which
that fellow hath raiſed upon him, that he ſhould be the firſt man that fled
on the left wing, when as none of your Lordſhips ſonnes were in the left
wing, and my brother <hi>John</hi> was not at all in the field while the fight was;
for by occaſion that I intreated him on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, when we
marched towards <hi>Keynton</hi> (little dreaming of a Battell the next day) to go
to <hi>Eveſham</hi> (which was but three miles from the quarter where our Troops
lay, before they marched with the Army to <hi>Keynton</hi>) for to take ſome Arms
that were come thither the night before, for ſuch of our men as wanted
Arms, and ſo to come after to the Rendevouz at <hi>Keynton.</hi> He could not
come thither on Saturday with thoſe men of both Troops which went backe
with him to <hi>Eveſham</hi> for their Arms, but the next day he came thither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
three or foure of the clock; at which time our left wing being defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
many of the Run-aways met with him as he was coming to the Army;
and happily among the reſt, this fellow that raiſed this report; for that
<hi>Viuers</hi> which your Lordſhip mentioneth, was not Captain <hi>Viuers</hi> (for he
was in <hi>Banbury</hi>) but a brother of his that was in one of Colonell <hi>Goodwins</hi>
Troops, and as I heard my brother ſay, he ſaw him there; and I heard my
Lord Generall ſay, that <hi>Vivers</hi> was one of the firſt that ran away: Now it
ſeemes that thoſe men that ran away ſo timely, ſeeing my brother before
them, reported as if he had fled from the Army, which is ſo contrary to the
truth, that he tooke a great deale of pains to make his own men and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62006:2"/>
               <hi>Vivers</hi> men which were with him to ſtand, and to ſtop the Run-aways
that came from the Army, and this he did, and made two or three ſtands,
and at length gathered a pretty body upon a hill together, and with them
(there being Captain <hi>Keightlyes</hi> and Captain <hi>Cromwells</hi> Troope, at length
came to them alſo) be marched towards the Town; and hearing the enemy
was there (as indeed they were there with the greateſt part of their horſe)
they made a ſtand, and ſending ſorth their Scouts to give them intelligence
where the enemy and where our Forces were, at length they came to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Colonell <hi>Hampdens</hi> Brigadoe that was coming another way to the
Town, and ſo joyning themſelves unto them, they came to the Army toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
My Lord Generall is very ſenſible of the wrong that this fellow hath
done my brother, and will inquire after him to have him puniſhed, as he
hath written to my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> concerning him, to let you know ſo much.
Maſter <hi>Bond</hi> whom he citeth for one of his authors, denies that ere he ſpake
to my brother at all, or that he ſaw any ſuch thing of flying, as that baſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
reporteth, and this your Lordſhip ſhall have under his hand. It had
been a ſtrange thing if my brother that ſhewed ſo much courage at <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
ſhould have been ſo faint-hearted upon this occaſion: But I ſtrange that
men will give credit to every idle fellow; if they will, they may heare that
my Lord Generall, and all the Officers every one of them ran away. But my
Lord, as your Lordſhip hath great cauſe to be thankfull, together with us,
to God, that in all theſe late actions of danger, hath preſerved the perſons
and lives of all your three Sons, ſo alſo for preſerving their honors, and the
honor of Religion; that in this cauſe they have never flinſht, but have
all of them in their ſeverall places and conditions been as forward to hazard
their perſons into the midſt of theirs and Gods enemies as any whoſoever.
And of the truth of this (though we do not vapour ſo much as ſome do)
there are enough, and thoſe very honorable witneſſes that can and will affirm

            <head>A moſt true Relation of the Battell
fought by his Excellency and his Forces againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the bloudy Cavalliers.</head>
            <p>THe two and twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> being <hi>Saturday,</hi> his Excellency
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> came with twelve Regiments of Foot, and two
and forty Troops of Horſe, and a part of the Ammunition and
Artillery, to <hi>Keynton,</hi> a little Market-Town, almoſt in the mid-way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Stratford</hi> upon the Avon, and <hi>Banbury,</hi> there being three Regiments
of foot, and nine or ten Troops of horſe, with ſeven Pieces of Cannon,
and good ſtore of Ammunition coming after, together with ſix Companies
of Dragooners: The Dragooners, and two of the Regiments of Foot, with
the Cannon, and nine or ten Troops of horſe, came to <hi>Keynton</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi>
night, a little before the day went down: The Regiment, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord
<hi>Rochfords,</hi> came not into the Army till <hi>Monday</hi> in the afternoon. The Kings
Army was lodged on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, about <hi>Cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> ſome 6 or
7 miles from <hi>Kenyton;</hi> And having, no doubt, got intelligence that part
of our Army, and Artillery, with a great part of our Ammunition was
behinde us, they thought they could not have a better opportunity to fight
with our Army, eſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cially if they could get the advantage of the hill before
us, it being a very high and ſteep aſſent, which if they were put to the
worſt might ſerve them for a Retreat, as it did, it being that which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them, their Carriages, and the Colours of their Regiments of foot
that ran away; for of thoſe that fought it out, we took moſt of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
onely thoſe two Regiments that ſtood it out till night, and went
off with their horſe in an orderly way. The enemy having reſolved to
give us Battell, and no whit doubting of the Victory, they being more then
we were, both in horſe and foot (a conſiderable Brigado of our Army being
behinde) and having a great opinion of the reſolution of their Souldiers,
wherein they were partly deceived, and partly not, as it hapned alſo on
our ſide: They returned back towards <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> and made all poſſible ſpeed
to gain the hill before us (which they did, by reaſon that his Excellency
had not timely intelligence of their deſigne, otherwiſe we were much neerer
the hill, and might have been poſſeſſed of it before them) And by that
time our Army was drawn out of the Town about a mile and half towards
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62006:3"/>
the hill, the Dragooners, and ſome of the enemies Foot were coming down
the hill; Their horſe having gotten down moſt of them on their right
hand, and placed themſelves in a fair Meadow, at the bottom of the hill;
Their Cannon and Ammunition, with the Rere of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir foot, were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
long ere they came down. And if we had charged them before their
Cannon and all their Foot were come down, we might have had a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
but they got all down in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the Meadow at the foot of the hill,
and there drew up their Army very handſomely, their horſe being on their
right Wing for the moſt part, and their Dragooners, and ſome few Troops
of horſe on their left Wing; ſome of their priſoners ſaid they had four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of horſe on that wing alſo; but I could never ſpeak with any of our
Army, that either ſaw any ſuch number of horſe, or could tell what they
did, unleſſe they went directly to <hi>Keynton,</hi> to plunder the Carriages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
charging our Army at all.</p>
            <p>For our Army, it was drawn up upon a little riſing ground, and being
amongſt the horſe, I could not well diſcern how the foot were drawn up;
onely I know they were moſt of them a good ſpace behinde the horſe, when
we began to charge: but for the horſe, there were three Regiments on the
right Wing of our Army, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord Generalls Regiment, commanded
by Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton;</hi> Sir <hi>William Belfores</hi> Regiment, Lievtenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the horſe; and the Lord <hi>Fieldings</hi> Regiment, which ſtood behinde
the other two, in the way of reſerve.</p>
            <p>On the right Wing of our Army, was Sir <hi>James Ramſey,</hi> with ſome 24
Troops, for many of our Troops were not in the Field that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

being thus placed one againſt another with no great oddes of winde

which did very little hurt amongſt us, and very much amongſt them, their
foot advancing for the moſt part againſt our right Wing, and their horſe
againſt the left Wing of our army. Their horſe had the better of our horſe
that were on our left Wing, and routing them, drove them back upon our
foot, and amongſt the reſt, upon Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regiment, which was
in the Rere, and they brake through it, yet they ran not away, nor ſeemed
to be at all diſmayed at it; but four other Regiments ran away, and fought
not at all, and many of them caſt away their Colours, and ſo the enemy
took them np, having ſcarce got ſo much as one Colour or Cornet of thoſe
Regiments or Troops that fought, whereas all the Colours that we got
from them, and the Kings Standard, which we had a long time in our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
were taken out of the midſt of their beſt Regiments that fought it out
very reſolutely: Our left Wing being thus put to the worſt, the day was

very deſperate on our ſide; and had not God clearly fought for us, we had
loſt it; for had the enemies horſe when they had routed the left Wing, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon the Rere of our right Wing, in all probability the army had been
wholly defeated: But they made directly to the Town, and there falling
upon our Carriages, moſt barbarouſly maſſacred a number of poor Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners
and Carters that had no arms to defend themſelves, and ſo fell to
pillaging and purſuing thoſe that ran away, ſo long, till they met with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
<hi>Hampden,</hi> who with the other Brigado of the Army (which came with
the Artillery and Ammunition which was behinde) was by this time come
neer to <hi>Keynton,</hi> and the enemies Troops falling upon him as they purſued
our men that ran away, he gave them a ſtop, and diſcharging five pieces of
Cannon againſt them, he ſlew ſome of them; whereupon they returned in
ſome fear and diſorder: But when they came back into the Field, they found
all their Infantry, excepting two Regiments, cut in pieces or defeated and
run away; for it pleaſed God to put ſuch courage into four or five of our
Regiments of foot, and two Regiments of horſe, the Lord Generalls, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Belfores,</hi> that they defeated
all their Regiments of foot, except two. Sir <hi>William Belfores</hi> Regiment of
horſe charged a Regiment of the enemies foot, before any foot
came up to aſſiſt him, and breaking into it, cut moſt of it off;
and after, by the aſſiſtance of ſome of our foot, he defeated another Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo we got up to the greateſt part of the enemies Ordnance, and
took them, cutting off the Geers of the horſes that drew them, and killing
the Gunners under the Carriages, but were forced to leave them without
any to guard them, by reaſon we were fain to make good the day againſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverall
Regiments of foot that ſtill fought with a great deal of reſolution;
eſpecially that which was of the Kings Guard, where his Standard was, cloſe
by which Sir <hi>William Belfores</hi> Regiment rode when they came from taking
the Ordnance; and they taking us to be their friends, and we them ſome of
our Company, ſhook hands with ſome of them, which was the cauſe that
after riding up towards the Lord Generals Regiment of horſe, they gave fire
upon S. <hi>William Belfores</hi> Regiment, and diſcerning each other to be firends,
we joyned Companies; and ſo with half the Lord Generalls Regiment,
which his Excellency himſelf led up, charging the Kings Regiment, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
it, took the Standard, took the Generall of the Kings Army, the Earl
of <hi>Lindley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and his ſon, and Colonell <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> who was Lievtenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
of that Regiment, and killed Sir <hi>Edward Varney</hi> upon the place (who
carryed the Standard) Colonell <hi>John Munroe,</hi> and divers others: In this
charge, and generally throughout the day, the Lord Generalls Troop, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
moſt of Gentlemen, carried themſelves moſt valiantly; and had all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62006:4"/>
our Troops, or our left Wing been made of the ſame metall, the enemy had
not made ſo eaſie an impreſſion into them. And what is ſaid of my Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls
Troop, may moſt truely, and to his high praiſe, be ſaid of himſelf;
and alſo that noble Earl, the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Generall of the horſe, for both
of them rode all day, being in the heads of the ſeverall Troops and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to give them directions, and to bring them on upon the enemy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
their perſons as far and further then any particular Souldier in the
Army. By this time all the enemies foot being diſperſed and gone, excepting
two Regiments, they retiring themſelves, found their Ordnance behinde them
without any Guard, and there they made a ſtand, and made uſe of their
Cannon, ſhooting divers ſhot at us; at which time our Regiment of foot
began to want Powder, otherwiſe we had charged them both with horſe and
foot, which in all probability would have utterly ruined their Infantry, for
thoſe two Regiments were the onely ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke which they had now left in the
hedge: But partly through want of Ammunition, and partly being tyred
with fighting all the day (the whole brunt of the Battell having been ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by two Regiments of horſe, and four or five of foot) we made no great
haſte to charge them, ſo that the enemies horſe that had been pillaging at
<hi>Keynton</hi> had leiſure to come about, ſome on one hand of us, and ſome on the
other, and ſo joyned with their foot: Yet as they came back on our left
hand, Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> with his Troop, went out to charge ſome 4 or 5
Troops of them, which went away from him as faſt as they could upon the
ſpur to the reſt of their Company, and their foot that ſtood by their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
moſt of the enemies horſe being gathered to their foot, moſt of our
horſe alſo gathered to our foot, and ſo we ſtood horſe and foot one againſt
the other till it was night. Our Army being thus poſſeſſed of the ground
that the enemy choſe to fight upon, ſtood there all night; the enemy having
withdrawn their Army to the top of the hill for more ſecurity to themſelves,
where they made great fires all the night long, whilſt we in the mean time
drew backe ſome of our owne Ordnance, which they had once in their
poſſeſſion, and ſome of theirs which they had left behinde.</p>
            <p>The next morning, a little before it was light, we drew back our Army
towards the Town to our other Brigadoe and Artillary and Ammunition
that was come and lodged there, and the enemy drew out their horſe in the
morning upon the ſide of the hill, where ſtaying till towards night, whil'ſt
their foot was retyring behinde the hill and marching avvay, at length a
little before night, their horſe alſo marched avvay; and about an houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
our horſe alſo marched tovvards their Quarters, the Foot and ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
horſe ſtaying all night in their Quarters, in and before <hi>Keynton;</hi> and the next
day the vvhole Army both horſe and foot marched tovvards <hi>Warwicke</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62006:5"/>
themſelves; inſtead of vvhich, if they had marched tovvards <hi>Banbury,</hi>
they vvould have found more victuals, and had in all probabilities diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all the foot of the Kings Army, and taken his Canon and Carriages,
and ſent his horſe farther off to plunder, vvhereas novv becauſe vve did not
follovv them though they quitted the field to us which we fought on, and
left their quarter before us the next day, yet they begin to queſtion who
had the day: It is true, there were Colours and Canon taken on both ſides,
without any great difference in the numbers, but for the number and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of men ſlaine and hurt, it is verily believed, they loſt foure times as many
at the leaſt as vve did, and in ſaying foure times as many, I am confident I
ſpeake much belovv the truth. There vvere ſlain on their ſide the Earle of
<hi>Lindſey</hi> Generall of their Army, the Lord <hi>Aubigney</hi> brother to the Duke of
<hi>Richmond,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Verny</hi> Colonell, <hi>John Mourſe</hi> and divers other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Commanders, and very many hurt. Of our ſide vvere ſlaine
the Lord <hi>St. John,</hi> Colonell <hi>Charles Eſſex,</hi> Lievtenant-Colonell <hi>Ramſey,</hi>
and none other of note, either killed or dangerouſly hurt that I can heare of;
they acknovvledge that they loſt 1200 men, but it is thought they loſt
2000: and vvhereas they report vve loſt divers thouſands, vvhere one
man judgeth that vve loſt 400, ten men are of opinion that vve loſt not
200 Souldiers, beſides the poore Waggoners and Carters.</p>
            <p>Theſe Perſons undervvritten vvere all of the Right vving and never ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from their Troops, but they and their Troops fought till the
laſt minute.
