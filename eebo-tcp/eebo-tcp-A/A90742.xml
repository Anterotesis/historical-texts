            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A plain word of Truth to all the</hi> Officers <hi>and</hi> Souldiers <hi>of the</hi> ARMY.</head>
            <p>THE Cauſe of God is once more revived, which was almoſt loſt by the Cunning and Self-ends of ſome: you muſt ere long die as the late Protector; then will your Poſterities be the greateſt Vaſſals and Slaves that ever were, for your fighting, &amp;c. and will never be forgotten; Becauſe you have done ſo many irregular acts, and ſo little good for your Countrey, which hath alwaies been your pretence; but in ſtead of doing Good and Juſtice to the good People, you have all along Exalted your ſelves; until you are an ill ſavour in the noſtrils of almoſt all ſorts of Men.</p>
            <p>There is no way left under Heaven for your Redeeming the Peace and Safety of theſe Nations (as now the Caſe ſtands) but an abſolute Commonwealth; that ſo the good People of <hi>England</hi> may taſte of that Good, for which ſo much Bloud and Treaſure hath been expended; for which there hath been ſo great a conteſt as the like was never read of before. Gods ſignal hand was againſt the King and his Party; his Providential hand againſt the late Protector for his, &amp;c. at the time when he would have further ſetled himſelf and been King.</p>
            <p>The like will be againſt you, if you go on any longer, and build again the Name or Thing God hath ſo eminently born witneſs againſt, from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Your Adverſaries are many; and you increaſe them every day (by your Jugling:) ſpeak plain Engliſh, and be honeſt if you can; and truſt God in the Work of God; and lay aſide every thing, or the thing that beſets you: is he a Wiſe man, or like his Father? if he were, it were then another Caſe: is he altogether Uncapable, or A—then you will be as much troubled on the other hand. Know what God the Lord of Hoaſts hath done before your Eyes, and truſt him in his work if you can; you will never live to ſee a fairer opportunity, then is at this time: for all good men in City, Town, and Countrey, will be of one piece for you; but if you put them to their ſhifts, and miſery, and bloud come, you will have it charged on your heads: whatever calamity or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery befal the good People of <hi>England,</hi> you will be the Contractors of, as well as the preventers of that Good which otherwiſe they might enjoy.</p>
            <p>According to the courſe of Nature, you cannot live long: and if <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> dye, or be taken out of the way, when this day is over, which will be ere long, (unleſs there be a going on without hypocriſie or deceipt in the <hi>Good Old Cauſe)</hi> then, as well as now, your Adverſaries to the Cauſe will cry <hi>Ah ha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They will never forget the taking away their God and King.</p>
            <p>The Cavaliers muſt have a Vice-Gerent on Earth, as they call it.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterians Principle leads them to the ſame thing under another Name or Title; that ſo they may have their will on all Men that differ from them; for they think they can never do enough for God; as if God were altogether unable to do his own work, in heaven and earth. The King would frequently ſwear, By God, the Presbyters are the Men that firſt began the War, and would have no other men live but themſelves: and that they were not ſociable, and would ſet all the Nation in bloud again, if they had not their end.</p>
            <p>And ſee how the Cavaliers and Presbyters have of late combined againſt the Commonwealth. The Cavalier is known enough to all; but the Presb. and his Conjunction is forgotten: though the ſame Game be now playing, and men will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Love</hi> the Miniſter, who was eminently for the Parliament, afterwards joyned with the King, and carried on his deſigns, to the involving this and the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation in Bloud. Their Conjunction with the King and Cavaliers was ſuch, that they did flatter themſelves; and ſaid, They would have the Cavaliers help, and then lay them by. The ſame was in the Cavaliers toward them; and that was moſt likely to carry it.</p>
            <p>The Plot was bloudy, and deep laid; for there were above 300. Miniſters, ſo called, in Conjunction with Mr. <hi>Love</hi> in that Plot; and abundance of conſiderable men more; a Liſt of which was given to the late Protector; as alſo, of what Moneys had been raiſed and promiſed to buy Arms, and raiſe an Army; which was partly modeled.</p>
            <p>What Game hath lately been playing, leſs then a reſurrection of this Plot? and they will never leave, till they have deſtroyed this Army (whom they hate to the death) what ever their pretences are, &amp;c. for croſſing their <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Covenant, and taking away their King; which they cannot live without, or ſome ſuch like fine thing.</p>
