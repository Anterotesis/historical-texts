            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
BRIEF ACCOUNT
OF THE
AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>IF the Reader be desirous to know who the Author
of these Discourses was, he may be pleased to take
this short, but true account, which I have from
those who were well acquainted with him. He was second
Son of Sir <hi>Carew Raleigh,</hi> a Gentleman of an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Family in <hi>Devonshire;</hi> descended, as appears by
a Geneology I have in my hands, from <hi>John de Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
a great man in the time of <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
who Knighted him in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of his Reign.
His Mother was the Relict of Sir <hi>John Thynne</hi> of
<hi>Longleate</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and Daughter of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Wroughton,</hi> Vice-Admiral under Sir <hi>John
Dudley</hi> (afterwards Duke of <hi>Northumberland)</hi> in
the expedition: against the <hi>Scots, 1544.</hi> in the latter
end of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
            <p>Concerning both which persons I shall forbear to say
any thing; because, if it be an honour to be related to
<pb facs="tcp:46181:4"/>
those that are Great and Worthy, there is nothing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of this kind, in my opinion, that can be said of him,
than that he was Nephew to the famous Sir <hi>Walter
Raleigh:</hi> whom a late Author<note n="*" place="margin">Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>Oxon</hi> L. ii. p. 109.</note> hath honoured with
this Character, that <hi>He was greater than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of times past, and the imitation of those
to come:</hi> whose History, I may add, which (as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon,</hi>
in his Preface to <hi>Polybius,</hi> sayes a History
ought to be) is a kind of practical Philosophy, will make
his name immortal among us.</p>
            <p>The place and time of his Birth I cannot certainly
learn, nor where he was bred; till he came to <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
School: where he made such proficiency, that
he was ripe, I am informed, very early for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
And being sent to <hi>Oxford</hi> was made a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Commoner in <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledg; a famous Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of many great men. Among whom we should have
found, no doubt, this Doctor placed, in the late <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi>
of that University; had these Discourses come
out soon enough, to have given the Author of that work,
occasion to make a better inquiry after him, than it is in
my power to do. Who can learn nothing further of him
there, than that he was admired for his Disputations in
the Schools even when he was an Under-graduate;
and having taken his Degrees of Batchelour and Master
of Arts, was made Junior of the publick Act: which
he performed with exceeding great applause. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb facs="tcp:46181:4"/>
the quickness of his witt, and ready elocution; he
was master of a very strong reason: which won him the
familiarity and friendship of those great men, who were
the envy of the last Age, and the wonder of this, the
Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi>
The last of which was wont to say (and no
man was a better Judge of it than himself) that
Dr. <hi>Raleigh</hi> was the best Disputant, that ever he met withal.</p>
            <p>And indeed there is a very great acuteness easily to be
observed in his writings: which would have appeared
more if he had not been led by the common vice of those
times, to imitate too far a very eminent man, rather
than follow his own excellent Genius. A fault that
ought to be carefully avoided by those that study Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
in every kind of which, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. x. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. C. 2.</note>
there is something which is common to all Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<hi>id autem imitemur, quod commune est,</hi>
and that alone is the thing which ought to be imitated.</p>
            <p>But in that way which he took, his Fame grew so
great, that several of the Nobility were desirous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him into their Families: And at last <hi>William</hi>
Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> gained him for his Chaplain. With
whom he had not lived above two years, before he became
his kind Patron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bestowing on him a very good Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
in a plentiful Country, at <hi>Chedzoy</hi> in <hi>Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire.</hi>
Where being setled he took to Wife a Daughter
<pb facs="tcp:46181:5"/>
of Sir <hi>Ralph Gibbs,</hi> Sister to the Reverend <hi>Dr.
Charles Gibbs,</hi> one of the present Prebendaries of
St. <hi>Peters Westminster.</hi> By whose affectionate care
and diligence these Papers were retrived and preserved
from perishing: as a great many others are like to do;
unless they, into whose hands they are faln, will be so kind
and just as to send them to him, or to the Bookseller, or
undertake themselves to give a faithful account of them to
the world.</p>
            <p>Who will be glad, no doubt, to see more of the fruits
of so happy a brain, especially those of his Maturer
years. When he grew Famous at Court, as he had been
before in the University and Country; and was made
Chaplain in Ordinary to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr.
Before whom some of these Sermons were Preached;
particularly that upon <hi>Matth. vi. 33.</hi> which it appears
by the Conclusion, was the last Sermon His Majesty
heard before he began his Journey into <hi>Scotland.</hi> From
whence being returned, he bestowed upon the Doctor,
the Deanery of Wells: intending to confer farther fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on him, had not the unnatural 
War which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after broke out, put an untimely end to both their lives.</p>
            <p>Never, I think, was any Nation so distracted, and
perfectly beside it self, as this of ours in those miserable
times; when they could not see the happiness they enjoyed
in so excellent a Prince as God had set over us, and in
<pb facs="tcp:46181:5"/>
such Pious and Learned Divines as he had about him:
against whom they perpetually declaimed in the most abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Language, deprived them of all their Estates, and
at last barbarously Murdered some of them, together
with their Royal Master. Such, I am sure, was the
fate of this Doctor; who being sequestered, and hurried
from one Prison to another, and still there immured,
where several Prisoners dyed of the Plague, was at last
shut up in his own House at <hi>Wells,</hi> which they had
turned into a Gaol: and after he had escaped the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in many places, was vilainously Murdered by him,
who was appointed to be his Keeper. The manner of it, was thus:</p>
            <p>The Committee of that County coming to sit at <hi>Wells,</hi>
the Doctor desired to be permitted to speak with them;
hoping to gain so much liberty as to go to <hi>Chedzoy</hi> to
his Wife and Children, in order to settle some affairs
which nearly concerned them. In which reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
meeting with a denial, though a Gentleman of a
thousand pound a year offered to be bound for his return,
at the time they should appoint him, he could not but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate the matter with them: and happened to say,
among other things, it was very hard that he should be
refused a courtesy from them which several other persons
obtained without them; who had liberty to go home,
some for a week, some for a month, when they pleased.
Which in stead of mollifying the Committee towards him,
<pb facs="tcp:46181:6"/>
only sharpned their anger towards the Gaoler; whom
they chid for his remissness, and threatned to turn out
of his place, if he took upon him any more to grant this
licence to any Prisoner. This rebuke stuck in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
stomach; and the next morning entering into the
Doctors Chamber, when he was writing to his Wife, to
let her understand he could not procure leave to come and
see her; he clapt his hand upon the Paper, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a sight of it. To which the Doctor fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that he should with all his heart, if he had any
authority from the Committee to require it: otherwise he
might be satisfied with his protestation that it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a Letter to his Wife, to acquaint her
with the denial the Committee had given him, as he
knew well enough already. Whereupon the Keeper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to endeavour to take it from him by force; but the
Doctor being too strong for him, wrested it out of his
hands. Which being done, the fellow stept back, drew his
Sword, ran it immediately into the good Mans Belly; and
gave him an incurable Wound: of which though after a
few days, he dyed, his Murderer notwithstanding was
suffered to live. And as the Author of a Book called
<hi>Ruina Angliae</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Better known per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ps by the name of <hi>Mercurius Rusticus,</hi> an. 1647.</note> informes us, the Committee were so
little affected with the business, that afterwards <hi>they
turned the Doctors Wife and Children out of
doors; and forced his Son to fly the Country,
for that he would have prosecuted the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:46181:6"/>
his Fathers Murderer.</hi> Whether that be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
true or no, I am not able to say; but this may be
relied on (coming from an undoubted hand) that though
his Wife Prosecuted him two Assizes together, she could
not get him brought to a Tryal: But she falling sick
before the third came, and not able to attend it; then
the fellow appeared and was acquitted; there being no
body ready to make good the charge against him.</p>
            <p>Thus fell this Excellent person; in whose writings I
beseech all the Authors and Abetters of the late Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who still survive, to see what kind of men they
persecuted in their blind rage: that it may be a warning
to them for ever, and they may give their Posterity a
charge, to beware how they let loose the like furious pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in time to come. By which, as an unknown
Writer speaks concerning another of those Sufferers
(Dr. <hi>Stuart) they either robbed themselves of
those holy men, and means, which God in his
mercy had given them: or else exchanged <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Gold for Counters, the Cherubins of
the Temple for the Calves of Bethel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a monument, I have been told, designed,
if not promised, for the preservation of his Memory.
But I think now this Book is all he is like to have;
and it is the best perhaps that can be made for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
made by himself. Who was a Master-workman
even in his Youth; when several of these pieces, it is
<pb facs="tcp:46181:7"/>
evident, were composed: And had been a far greater,
if he had not faln, as I said, into a way, wherein his
Masterly wit was so much confined, that at last he broke
out of it. As appears by his Discourse of Oaths, which
is strong and nervous, clear and judicious, as well as
full of spirit and life: and may be sufficient to show
what he could have done, if he had set himself to it,
in other Arguments, and handled them in the same
manner, that the rest of his Friends before named did
those wherein they were engaged.</p>
            <p>To which Friends of his, I should have added two
other Eminent persons; one of which is dead also, the
late Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> Lord High Chancellour of
<hi>England;</hi> the other yet living, the Right Reverend
Father in God the present Lord Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi>
Who was a great lover of this Doctor, and still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
I am confident, so kind a remembrance of him,
that, if he had not wholly sequestered himself to the
thoughts of another world, he might be easily perswaded
to bestow such a Character of him, as no man now alive

DISCOURSE
OF
OATHS.</head>
            <head>SERMON I.
Upon JER. iv. 2.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in Truth,
in Judgment and in Righteousness.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THough all Sins be dangerous unto the
Soul of man, and none so small as may
be neglected, since a man may be choaked
under a heap of Sand, as well as crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to death by the fall of a Tower;
yet the greater a sin is, and the more general it is grown,
the greater danger and more inevitable destruction doth
attend it. And therefore it doth require our chief
labour and diligence both to avoid such in our selves,
and to give the best notice we can unto others of the
peril. By negligence the least Leak may drown the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46181:10"/>
Ship: but the Pilot's special care is of the Rock, on
which if his Vessel fall, it certainly splits.</p>
            <p>Now of all the Sins whereunto the Corruption of
man is subject, I think there is scarce any so great and
so common, so great in it self, and so common in the
world, so injurious unto the Majesty of God, and so
frequent amongst the Sons of men, as the sin of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
The vain and irreverent using, rather abusing of
that Sacred Name in our ordinary speech, which if
well considered we should tremble but to think on.
A sin which the Wise man tells us, will bring a Curse
upon the house, where it is used; and it is no less likely
to bring a Curse upon a whole Land and Nation
where it is universal. So that this impiety of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it brings with it a greater and more general
danger: so it calls for from all, especially from all us
whom it most concerns, a great and universal care:
All endeavours should run forth to the quenching of a common fire.</p>
            <p>It is indeed often galled and sharply taxed from
such places as these, obviously and by the way: But
the point contains much, and will require a set dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of that and nothing else: for we cannot be
too industrious against a publick mischief. For which
reason I have now made it the subject of my discourse,
as it is of this Verse: Wherein you have the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and full doctrine of an Oath, and how prepared,
it may be wholesome, which otherwise used is deadly
poison. For an Oath is not simply and utterly unlawful,
my Text says, <hi>Thou shalt swear,</hi> but then it must be
qualifyed with the due form and matter and manner:
The form must be [<hi>As the Lord liveth,</hi>] that is, in the
Name of the living Lord: The matter [<hi>Truth and
Righteousness:</hi>] the manner or modification [<hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:]
Thou shalt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46181:10"/>
But before you may fully apprehend the division of
the Text, it will be requisite that I shew you some
divisions of an Oath, for there are divers sorts.</p>
            <p>There is a bare and simple Oath: and there is an Oath,
mixt with a Curse and execration. The bare and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Oath, is only a plain and naked contestation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we call God to witness of what we say: The exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratory,
is, when we bind over and oblige either our
selves, or something dear unto us, unto some notorious
punishment, if so be that be not true which we say, as
when one swears by his Life, Soul, Salvation, and the like.</p>
            <p>Again there is an Oath wherein there is a manifest
and express assumption of the Name of God, which
needs no instance, we know it too well, by daily and
fearful example; And there is an Oath wherein God is
called to record, tacitly and implicitly, under the Name
of those Creatures wherein his Glory doth especially
shine and appear: So he that sweareth by heaven,
sweareth both by heaven and by him that dwelleth
therein. And lastly, which is specially material, There
is an Oath Assertory, and an Oath Obligatory. Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
when we affirm or deny any thing, past or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
Obligatory, when we promise or threaten some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to come. Which being observed, you may easily
make a fit Application of the three terms in my Text;
Truth, Judgment and Righteousness: Truth unto an
assertory Oath: Righteousness, unto a promissory:
Judgment and discretion unto both; For which cause
it is placed in the midst between both. For an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertory
oath, must be True, lest we swear falsly: A
Promissory, Righteous, lest we swear to do unjustly;
and both with discretion and judgment, lest we swear
lightly and rashly. <hi>Thou shalt swear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So then we may in some case swear; but the Oath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46181:11"/>
must have the right form, it must be made in the name
of the Lord: And the due matter, in Truth if As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertory,
in Righteousness if Promissory: And then in
a discreet manner, with premeditation and judgment
in both. Wherein you see, how we may swear, and
how we may not swear: In Truth, Judgment and
Righteousness we may swear: but falsly, unjustly, and
rashly and vainly we may not swear. Of these points
in their order, beginning with the first, The Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of an Oath, and that in case a man may swear;
<hi>Thou shalt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. There are not wanting some and those even
amongst the Fathers themselves, who have censured all
Oaths (though permitted by the Law, yet) as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Gospel, which contains they say a
Doctrine of more than legal perfection: of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
were St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and it is the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the Anabaptist unto this day. Others have
thought that an Oath may be lawful under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
but then only before a Magistrate, and when
it is required by such as have authority thereunto. But
the common and more general opinion both of the
Antient Fathers and Modern Divines is, that it is not
simply unlawful for a private man to swear, and in a
private action, when some urgent cause, either the
honour and Glory of God, or some great good and
benefit of our Neighbour doth call for it at our hands;
since it is not the use of an Oath, but the abuse that
makes it evil: for that it is both lawful and good in
it self, in its own nature and kind, is evident, if we
consider either the original from whence it springs, or
the end for which it was ordained. The original
is from Faith, and a faith of the knowledge, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience
and power of God, for it is grounded upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46181:11"/>
a persuasion, that God understands and knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we speak the Truth, and is able to take revenge
of us it we speak otherwise: an oath being nothing
else but the calling of God for a witness of our speech,
and a Judge against us if we speak untruly, for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Confirmation of such things as have no other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
witnesses or proofs. And the End is no less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
than the Original Religious; for it is ordained
to no other purpose but to give an assurance of the
Truth in question, and so to determine dissentions
and controversies among men, as the Author to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> testifies, <hi>for an Oath,</hi> saith he, <hi>is an end of
all strife, Heb.</hi> vi. 16. For which reasons, especially
the first, it is, that an Oath wherein God is confessed
and acknowledged as an immutable and infallible Truth
in himself, so a Judge and revenger of falsehood in
others, as being the only searcher of the heart, that
alone can bring to light the secrets that lie hid in the
Closets thereof; for this cause I say, it is, that an Oath
if rightly performed, both is, and in Scripture is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
accounted, as a part of the very service and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God. And therefore in the vi. of <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.
it is set down, side by side, with the fear and service
of the Lord, wherewith it is made but one Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord and serve him, and
swear by his Name.</hi> So <hi>Esay</hi> prophesying of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Assyrians and Egyptians unto the same
Covenant and worship of God with <hi>Israel,</hi> expresseth
it in these terms, <hi>They shall all speak the language of
Canaan, and swear in the Name of the Lord,</hi> as if the
swearing in his Name were a sufficient professing of
the Religion he commands, <hi>Esa.</hi> xix. 18. yea the very
Heathen themselves did acknowledge it an honour due
only unto the Gods.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:46181:12"/>
               <l>—Praesens Divus habebitur</l>
               <l>Augustus, &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <p>we honour thee <hi>Augustus</hi> when thou art present as a
God, erecting Altars whereon we swear by thy Name.
So that an Oath is not only good in it self, but a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Act of Religion, and therefore cannot be evil
unless irreligiously used. And though this religious
use be more evident and solemn in Oaths that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
yet it may be no less truly though not so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
in others, that are private, if performed with a
due respect unto God, and out of a Charity to our
Neighbour; which is then done, when reverent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto God in him that makes the Oath, and the
utility of him whose infirmity requires it, do meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
And though the other have a stronger founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by precept, yet this wants not evidence in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and frequency of example; for if the Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abimeleck</hi> were publick as is
pretended and is likely, yet that between <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Laban</hi> was certainly private. <hi>Boas</hi> was a private man,
and yet he confirms the promise of Marriage unto
<hi>Ruth</hi> with an Oath,<hi>Ruth</hi> iii. 13. <hi>Obadiah</hi> was a private man, yet a just man and one that feared the Lord, as
the Text hath it, yet he spared not to strengthen his
speech even unto the great Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> with an
Oath, <hi>As thy Soul liveth,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>King.</hi> xviii. 10. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the 2 <hi>King.</hi> v. 16. the holy Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
swears: in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. and in divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the holy Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> swears: In the x. <hi>Apoc.</hi>
an Angel of heaven swears: yea and in many places
God himself swears, and yet none of them required
unto it by a Superior that had authority over them.
And it hath as well evidence in Scripture as example.
For there is no sufficient reason why that testimony of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46181:12"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> unto the <hi>Hebrews</hi> should be restrained unto
publick Oaths: And it cannot be, but that my Text
must extend it self unto such as are private, and if it
did not, yet that in the xv. <hi>Psalm</hi> is without question,
where he that swears unto his Neighbour and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
him not, is said to be the man that shall dwell in
the Tabernacle of God, which no man can doubt to
be spoken of a private oath.</p>
            <p>But leaving those that acknowledge publick Oaths
and deny private, let us come unto those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
both, both publick and private; the use whereof
they confess was tolerated under the Law, which now
they conceive as wholly abolished by the coming of
the Gospel. The foundation and only strength of
which opinion is grounded wholly upon that speech of
our Saviour, <hi>Matth. v. You have heard it hath been
said by them of old, Thou shalt not forswear thy self,
but shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oath. But I
say unto you, swear not at all, neither by Heaven, for
it is Gods throne: neither by the Earth, for it is his
footstool,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But let your communication be yea,
yea, nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these
cometh of Evil;</hi> from whence they infer a double
Argument; the one from the Inhibition, the other
from the reason of it. The inhibition is general (<hi>Non
jurabis omnino) swear not at all:</hi> and the reason is
as universal, laying the stain of evil upon all others
equally without difference or distinction of any, <hi>for
whatsoever is more than yea and nay, cometh of evil;</hi>
The place seems to be very strong for them, and sure
is not without some difficulty; from which that we
may the easilier free it, we must speak something of
both: But first of the Inhibition, and then of the reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:46181:13"/>
And first we are to consider that there are many
passages of Scripture set down in general and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
terms, which notwithstanding have not simply and
absolutely an universal sence, but universal in a certain
kind. What can be more generally pronounced than
that in the <hi>Psalms? God looked down from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sons of men to see if there were any that
would seek after him, and behold they were all gone
astray, they were altogether become abominable, there
was none that did good, no not one.</hi> And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
in the same <hi>Psalm</hi> we find another sort
of people clean opposite unto these, whom God terms
his own people, <hi>because they faithfully served him,</hi>
a people therefore whom those wicked ones could
not endure but sought to destroy and utterly devour,
<hi>eating up my people as it were bread.</hi> So that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
passage cannot be understood simply of all the
Sons of men whatsoever, but only of all in a certain
kind, of all the Sons of men who were only the
sons of men, and not by the spirit of Regeneration
become also the Sons of God. In which sence the
Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the beginning of his Epistle to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> ere he seeks to infer the necessity of the
Gospel, doth apply it to shew that all men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
evil and deprived of the glory of God, and
therefore stand in need of the Grace of Christ that
they might attain unto it. In like manner it is said
in another place, <hi>Omne Animal in Arca Noae,</hi> that
every Creature was in <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
cannot be verified of every Creature, but of
one of all sorts and kinds of Creatures, and not of
those absolutely neither, but of all kinds that could
not live in the waters, for there were no Fishes there.
It were easy to give you instance in many more, but
these may suffice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46181:13"/>
Now that in this place, this Inhibition here is of the
like nature, though absolute in terms, yet not in sence,
restraining Oaths, but yet not all without limitation or
distinction, is manifest both by the letter of the Scripture
and the example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> that writ it, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
practice of all Churches since. The Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is that before cited in the 6. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where
St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only approve and allow of an Oath
now under the Gospel, but sets it down as a principal
remedy for the establishing of peace, and dissolving of
quarrels and discords amongst men, if so be that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> were the Author of that Epistle as is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
held, (though it be not greatly material whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were or no; for it skills not much who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was
the Pen, where it is confest by all that the Holy Ghost
was the Writer.) And if he were not the Author of
the Doctrine, yet he doth elsewhere frequently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it by his own practice and example, often confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his speeches even in his holy writings, sometimes with
a bare and simple Oath, as <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 9. <hi>God is my witness,
whom I serve in the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes even with
an execratory mixed with imprecations, as (<hi>Testem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voco
Deum in Animam meam) I call God for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
upon my Soul, 2 Cor.</hi> i, 23. and in divers other
places. Now who can imagine that blessed Apostle either
so ignorant or so evil, as not to understand the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Christ, or else so often to disobey them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in those holy pages and sacred instructions of the
whole Church, wherein he was but the quill or at
most the Scribe unto the blessed Spirit that did dictate
and indite them? Whereunto if we add the consent
of all famous Churches from that Apostles time unto
this very day, not only approving, but in divers cases
even requiring of an Oath, it will be more than abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46181:14"/>
manifest, that that speech of our Saviour is not
so absolutely Universal as to be received without all
limitation and restraint; only the difficulty is, unto
what kind of Oaths it ought to be restrained. For
even they that consent unto a limitation, as the most
of the Fathers do, yet they do not consent in the
specialty whereunto it is to be limited. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that our Saviour doth here prohibit not those
Oaths that are made in the Name of God, but such
only as are sworn by some of his creatures: for which
cause, after the inhibition [<hi>Swear not at all</hi>] he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
infers, <hi>neither by heaven, for it is his Throne,
neither by the Earth, for it is his Footstool;</hi> of this
opinion was St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> yea and St. <hi>Hierom;</hi> Consider
saith he, (upon this place) that our Saviour doth not
here forbid men to swear by the Lord, but by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Earth, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and his head. But this
Commentary seems to fail, because the assuming of a
Creatures Name in an Oath is not utterly unlawful,
(as you shall hear when we come to it) as also for
that the words of our Saviour tying up our speech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>yea, yea, nay, nay;</hi> and afterwards that <hi>whatsoever
is more proceeth from evill,</hi> doth clearly exclude
all forms of Oaths promiscuously as well those in the
name of the Creator, as those by the name of a Creature.</p>
            <p>Others are of opinion, that the words are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
unto all false Oaths, taking <hi>jurare</hi> for <hi>peje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare,</hi>
swearing for forswearing; To whom if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that according unto this exposition, nothing is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by our Saviour about that which was said unto
them of old, if <hi>swear not at all,</hi> be no more than
<hi>thou shalt not forswear thy self:</hi> They answer, yes
that there is, because the Lord in the latter part doth
forbid all kind of forswearing, even that by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46181:14"/>
specified in heaven, earth, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the
head, which the Jews did not conceive to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of all, for they had a Tradition which they suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Pharisees, that there were certain Creatures,
by whom if they made their Oath, they did not stand
bound to perform it. It is true indeed that such a Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they had which made a distinction of Creatures in
this kind, as of the Temple, and the gold of the Temple,
the Altar and the gift on the Altar, affirming that to
swear by the one was nothing, but he that sware by
the other was a debtor; which our Saviour in the 23
of this Evangelist doth both mention and refel, and
not without indignation. But it seems not to be his
intent here, both because, <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> and
<hi>nay,</hi> doth debar all swearing as well as forswearing;
as also for that our Saviour doth purposely alter the
first word, forswearing, into swearing, to shew and
signify that he understands an Oath as it differs from
Perjury. And yet St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself (<hi>lib.de Sermon. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
Cap.</hi> 17.) did sometimes give this Interpretation.
Others again (as St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Christianus Duth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi>
that lived long before him) upon this place desire
to have it esteemed rather for a Counsel than a Mandate,
a Counsel of extraordinary perfection rather than a
Mandate of necessary duty, wherein he that fails doth
not sin, though he that observes it doth the better.
But neither may this satisfy, for it is clear that our
Saviour doth prohibit something which the Scribes
and Pharisees thought to be lawful: Neither is it likely
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> whom we find often swearing in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
would neglect the Counsel of Christ, when
he ought to give example of perfection unto others.
But St. <hi>James</hi> puts it out of all question, who repeating
those very words of our Saviour, he so repeats them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46181:15"/>
as a Mandate and Commandment, as he makes dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
a punishment of the breach: for, where Christ
says, <hi>let your speech be yea yea,</hi> and <hi>nay nay, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is more cometh of evil,</hi> he to shew that this
evil is sin, and a sin that deserveth death, doth para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
it thus, <hi>let your speech be yea, yea, and nay, nay,
lest you fall into Condemnation:</hi> No counsel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>James</hi> v. But not to hold you any longer with
several and erroneous opinions, They seem to make
the best interpretation, that restrain this prohibition
unto the idle, trivial and customary Oaths of common
speech, which the Lord did forbid, as well as unjust and
false Oaths in weighty matters; though the Scribes
and Pharisees and subtile Glosses had corrupted it; for
they had a Tradition, as appears by <hi>Philo</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Book, that in lesser and smaller matters
they were not to swear by the name of the immortal
God but by some of his Creatures, supposing that
though they sware never so idly by them, yet they
were free from any breach of the Law, since they
took not the name of their God in vain, which that
did forbid. And therefore so long as they sware truly,
they cared not for swearing lightly and frequently, so
it was not by the Lord himself, but by some of his
works. Our Saviour therefore, seeking in this place
not to inlarge the Law, but to free it from those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations
and corrupt comments of the Pharisees,
shews them that they were to refrain as well from
swearing rashly and undoubtedly idly, as falsly: As also
that they are no less guilty of the vain abuse of his
name, who swear by it obliquely and covertly under the
Creatures, than those that assume it directly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a proper appellation, since there is not any work
or workmanship of his whereon he hath not in some
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46181:15"/>
sort as it were ingraven himself and his Name; All of
them from his Throne unto his Footstool being either
pledges of his favour, or illustrations of his power and
glory, if not both; so that Oaths made by them do
reach home even unto himself, whose they are, and
whose greatest Attributes of Glory and Goodness they
do plainly set forth. And therefore the sense is, Swear
not usually and vainly at all, that is, with no kind of
Oath, neither by heaven nor Earth nor any thing else
whether Creature or Creator, for the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> at
all) doth not so much relate unto <hi>swear not</hi> that goes
before, as unto those several forms of swearing that
follow after, and therefore doth not exclude all Cases
wherein an Oath may be required, but all forms which
for difference and distinction the Pharisees had inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as shewing that no forms or titles may justify an
Oath that in it self is vain and unnecessary. And this
is the exposition of Mr. <hi>Calvin (lib. 2. Inst. c. 8.)
Peter Martyr</hi> and divers learned men besides, and it
agrees well with that interpetation of St. <hi>Austin</hi> (in
his Book <hi>de Mendacio</hi>) where he says, We are not so
much forbidden by this place, to swear, as to love,
affect and delight in the use of swearing; And indeed
that which our Saviour adds, <hi>Let your Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be yea, yea, and nay, nay,</hi> plainly shews that he
relates unto the frequent and affected Oaths of daily
and familiar discourse. And thus much of the Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
which rightly understood, you see, concludes
nothing for the objectors.</p>
            <p>Now one word of the reason of it, (<hi>for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is more than these,</hi> to wit <hi>yea and nay, cometh
of Evil</hi>) And I think this will conclude as little.
St. <hi>Austin (de Serm. Domini)</hi> doth interpret this Evil
from whence an Oath doth proceed, to be the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46181:16"/>
and incredulity of Others, which though it be
not a sin yet it is evil, and as the effect of sin, so the
cause of swearing; for no man should need an Oath,
if another would believe his word. And after the
same manner doth <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 3d. expound it,
<hi>de Jurejurando. A malo est, sed non tam culpae quàm
poenae, nec exhibentium sed exigentium Juramentum;</hi>
It is from Evil, saith he, but the evil not of offence
but of punishment, neither the evil of him that exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
the Oath, but of him that exacts it. Others again,
otherwise, <hi>A malo, hoc est, à mendacio,</hi> from evil say
they, that is from evil deceit and lying; for if the lips
of men were not subject to falshood, no man would
require an Oath for the assurance of the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chrysost. Euthymius, Theophylact,</hi> do render<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
, not from evil, but from the evil one, the evil
one by an <hi>Antonomasie,</hi> that is the Devil, because as
some render the reason, the Devil first brought in sin, and
sin first occasioned an Oath, since in the state of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
where there could be no suspicion, there
needed also no confirmation of any mans speech. But all
these Interpretations though they are true in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet they are not pertinent to the place: First
because they concern all Oaths, for there is none so
good and lawful but in these senses proceed from evil,
2. Because they place the evil from whence the Oath
doth proceed, not in him that swears, but in him to
whom the Oath is made; whereas our Saviour doth
not restrain all Oaths promiseuously, (as is proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready)
but only some, because they proceed from evil,
which could be no sufficient reason of the restraint:
neither, if confest, that evil be an offence, and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
not of another but of the swearer himself; for
if such a general and occasionary original from evil
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46181:16"/>
were sufficient ground for a prohibition, we might as
well be forbidden to believe in Christ, or repent from
dead works; since if sin had not entred into the
world, there had never been any use either of such
faith or repentance. And therefore I rather like
<hi>Abulensis</hi> Commentary, <hi>A malo est Juramentum, id
est malum est,</hi> the Oath here forbidden is so from
Evil and the evil one, as it is evil it self; and so evil
as it deserves condemnation, saith St. <hi>James;</hi> for Christ
here speaks only of irreverent and unnecessary Oaths,
<hi>Quae &amp; mala sunt, &amp; à malo Peccatore &amp; ore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiscuntur,</hi>
which are both evil, and proceed from
the evil mouth of an evil sinner, (saith <hi>Barradius.</hi>)
Neither doth this any way prejudice our cause, for
<hi>whatsoever,</hi> the Term of Universality here in the Reason
will help them as little, as the [<hi>not at all</hi>] hath done
in the precept, which is not at all, for they must be
both conversant about the same matter, and therefore
as that doth restrain, so this doth condemn only vain
and superfluous swearing; so that the whole sence is
only this:</p>
            <p>Swear not idly and vainly in any form whatsoever;
for whatsoever is more than yea and nay in your daily
and ordinary communication proceedeth from evil:
So that both do leave room for the moderate and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
use of an Oath when any urgent and necessary
cause, as the benefit of our Neighbour, the Church or
Commonwealth do require it; so that the Gospel
you see doth not thwart with the Law, and <hi>swear
not at all,</hi> in the one, if rightly understood, doth not
hinder but that there may be necessary Causes, wherein
we may say <hi>Thou shalt swear,</hi> with the other, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of idle Oaths no way destroying this precept
of such as are serious and requisite: but as they are great
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46181:17"/>
sins, so these may be holy services, and a man may
as well offend against Charity in omitting these, as sin
against God in committing the other. And therefore
it still remains firm and unshaken, <hi>Jurabis, Thou shalt
swear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Well then, sometimes it may be Lawful for us to swear;
but yet as we may not swear in all cases, so neither
under all forms, But <hi>thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth,</hi>
that is, only in the Name of the living Lord; And the
reason of it is evident, by that which hath been said
already; for since an Oath is an Act of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as containing in it a tacit acknowledgment of
the infallibility and verity, omnisciency and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of him whom we make the witness and the Judge
of the otherwise unknown Truth and falshood of our
speeches, it must needs be an honour due only unto the
alseeing and ever-living God, to whom alone those At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
are proper; And cannot but be direct and
gross Idolatry to communicate it unto any thing else.
And so God himself doth ever interpret it as a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
defection from himself; <hi>Filii tui dereliquerunt
me,</hi> Your sons have forsaken me, saith God in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and they swear in the Name of those that are
not Gods, <hi>Jer. v. 7.</hi> The greatness of which crime he
doth elsewhere aggravate, by declaring the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Perdam eos,</hi> I will destroy them that swear in
the name of the Lord and of <hi>Malcham, Zephany</hi> i. 5.
But this point, the swearing in the name of false Gods,
is so gross in it self and so frequently forbid in the
scripture, as we shall not need to discourse any farther
of it. Only I will note two things out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
and so pass from thence unto swearing by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The first is, that it is not simply unlawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an Oath of him that swears in the name of false
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46181:17"/>
Gods, if just necessity doth exact it, and he acknowledge
not the true God of whom it is exacted; as when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
King confirms a League or Peace or any other business
of high importance with a Prince that is an Infidel: This
St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth expressly affirm in his 154 Epistle, where
he doth not doubt neither but it might be confirmed by
examples out of the Scripture, as by those Covenants
which <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> made with <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi>
who were Idolaters, and that by an Oath on either side
given and received; though I see not how these may justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the point, for though <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> were I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters,
yet they acknowledged the true God, and in
those Covenants seem to swear by his Name; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I rather think that of <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> with the
<hi>Romans</hi> might be more pertinent to the matter. The
second is, That they which swear falsly by false Gods, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
both are and are taken and punished too
for Perjurers by the true God, whether it be done by
those that do not acknowledge him, or others that do;
for even some Christians of the Primitive times when they
meant to deceive the unbelievers with whom they lived,
that they might the better do it and with the less sin,
would swear by their Gods, as taking it for nothing to
swear falsly by those Idols which they knew to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
whom St. <hi>Austin,</hi> Epist. 154. doth finely refell,
shewing that instead of lessening the sin they double the
crime, <hi>bis ulique peccat,</hi> for such a one, saith he, sins twice,
<hi>Quia &amp; juravit per quos non debuit, &amp; contra pollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
fecit fidem quod non debuit:</hi> first in swearing by
that which he ought not to worship, and then in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his faith which he ought to have kept; And God
will assuredly punish both, <hi>Non audit te Lapis loquentem,
sed punit te Deus fallentem,</hi> for the stone doth not hear
thee by whom thou swearest, yet that God will take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of thee who sees thy deceit, (saith the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46181:18"/>
And he seems to have learnt both out of the Wisdom
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who says the same of gross Idolaters that swear
by the Idols which they worship; for saith the Author
of that Book, <hi>In as much as their trust is in Idols that
have no life, though they swear falsly, yet they look not
to be hurt: but for both causes shall they be justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
both because they thought not well of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
head unto Idols, and also unjustly sware in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
despising holiness.</hi> Wisdom xiv. 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>But I leave the false Gods, and come unto Works and
Creatures of the living God; for though there be no
doubt, but the Oaths made in the name of them are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Idolatrous, yet it is much questioned whether a
man may lawfully swear by these; and there want not
great and learned men that affirm and maintain it too, and
I assure my self very rightly: for he should assume too
much boldness and reserve too little Charity to himself
that durst censure and condemn others for irreligious,
even all those holy men of God whom we find in the
Scripture to have sworn by his Creatures; both before,
under, and after the Law. Before the Law <hi>Jacob</hi> sware
by the fear of his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> which if it may be taken
<hi>objectivè,</hi> for the God whom he feared, yet that of <hi>Joseph</hi>
cannot, who swore by the life of <hi>Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Law examples are many, <hi>As thy soul liveth,</hi> saith devout
<hi>Anna</hi> unto <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest: So said <hi>Obadiah</hi> unto <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet; and so <hi>Elisha</hi> the same unto the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and that three times in one Chapter for failing:
<hi>And I protest by your or our r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>I die daily,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> under the Gospel, I <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. and many good Christians even unto this day swear by
the Evangel, body of Christ, their own faith, soul and the
like; and it were hard to condemn them all, as some do,
which had they but observed that distinction of <hi>Aquinas</hi>
and other Schoolmen, they would not have done; for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46181:18"/>
an Oath, saith he, made in the Name of a Creature may
have a threefold respect. The first is, when a Creature is
called for a witness, simply considered as it is in it self,
without any further relation unto the Creator, and this
is ever sinful and Idolatrous, as attibuting a Divinity unto
that which hath it not. The second is, when the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is called upon, not as considered in it self, but with a
respect and reference unto that God whose goodness or
glory is manifested in it, which though it be in all Creatures,
yet it is more conspicuous and eminent in some; and this
may be done without any sin: for though the Creature
be only named, yet thus taken, it is not the Creature,
but that God whose favour or power we honour in it,
that is called for the witness, as the Master of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
doth interpret it, nay as our Saviour himself doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound:
who for this very reason in the xxiii. of <hi>Matthew</hi>
doth plainly affirm, that whosoever <hi>sweareth by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
sweareth both by it and by him that dwelleth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and whosoever sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the
Throne of God and by him that sitteth thereon;</hi> And
after the self same manner, that Oath by the soul of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>(as thy soul liveth)</hi> so frequent amongst the holy
men under the Law is to be received, for they sware not
by the soul alone but by that God whose image and likness
it is; for so it is to be understood, As thy soul liveth by the
power and providence of him that first made it to his
likeness and doth still preseve it by his mercy. The
Third and last is, when a man names a Creature in an
Oath, not as swearing by it but as exposing it by way
of imprecation unto the judgment of that God who is the
true witness of his speech, which is the execratory Oath
touched in the beginning; so when a man swears by his
own Soul, it is not meant as if that were called to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of that he speaks, but as pledging and pawning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God the welfare and Salvation of it upon the truth of
his speech.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:46181:19"/>
And therefore he that swears by his Soul, doth in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brevation
say no other than what St. <hi>Paul</hi> did in plain
and full terms, <hi>I call God to record upon my Soul,</hi> for
that is the meaning of it, and both the meaning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
are strong proofs that it cannot be simply under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
Now that other of <hi>Joseph (by the life of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh)</hi>
may be understood both these ways; for either he
calls that God to witness whose judgment by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was executed upon Earth; or else by
way of imprecation, he doth upon the truth of the speech
appignorate unto God the health and safety of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
as a thing of all other most dear unto him. The Master
of the Sentences is for the first, and others for the latter;
both may be good, but this in the Text the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
So then there may be divers forms wherein the
Creature is named, and yet the Oath made only by the
Creator; for he doth still swear by him, that swears by
any excellent work or mercy of his, with reference to
him; in which sort, he that says <hi>(as thy Soul liveth)</hi>
doth at the same time and in the same words swear as my
Text requires, <hi>At the Lord liveth,</hi> for the full sense and
meaning is, <hi>as the Lord liveth</hi> by whom thy Soul hath
life. And though peradventure it may be better when
just occasion doth require an Oath, to make it clearly
and expressly <hi>in the Name of the Lord;</hi> yet the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of our Saviour and the examples of so many
holy men, do forbid us utterly to condemn all such as
do but implicitely call him to record under his Creatures.
And sure if they want not other necessary conditions of an
Oath, they will hardly be believed for this, the form will
free it self, if they want not the right manner and matter,
if they be performed in truth, judgment and righteousness,
the qualities and inseparable companions of a lawful
Oath, which now come to be considered in their order,
and first of the first, <hi>Jurabis in Veritate, Thou shalt swear
The Lord liveth in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:46181:19"/>
From the Form we come unto the Matter, and having
seen in whose Name an Oath is to be made, we are now
to consider with what Conditions it is to be qualified;
And they are but three, in all whereof Truth hath the
first place; and most deservedly, since nothing is so oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the very nature and essence of an Oath as falshood:
for the Person whose name in an Oath is assumed, is the
God of truth; the end for which an Oath it self was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
is the confirmation of truth; and the perjurer by
dishonouring that and frustrating this abuseth both often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the hurt and damage of his Neighbour, but ever
unto the great prejudice of his Creator. And therefore the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> (saith <hi>Diodorus Siculus,)</hi> did ever punish the
perjurer with death, whereof they esteemed him twice
worthy, <hi>ut &amp; qui pietatem in deos violaret, &amp; fidem
inter homines tolleret, maximum Societatis vinculum,</hi>
as one that did both violate his piety to God, and his
faith to men, the greatest bond of Society.</p>
            <p>But to omit these injurious effects of a false Oath unto
man as depriving him sometimes of his Credit, good name,
and reputation, and sometimes even of his Goods and Life
too; do but only see and consider how impious it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, and how infinitely he sins that shall call him,
who is not only true, but truth it self, to testify his fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
and so, as far as in him is, make him a Lyar like
himself; for as <hi>Estius says,</hi> in <hi>lib. 2. sent. dist.</hi> 39. 5, 6.
<hi>Qui falsum jurat, quantum in se est Deum facit vel men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacem
vel ignorantem,</hi> he that swears falsly, as much as in
him lies makes God either ignorant or a liar. Falshood is
ever vile and odious in it self, but when it is fastened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, when we teach our own Inventions (those spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
brats and bastards of our own Brain,) to call him
Father, it must needs be detestable. For we cloath him with
the Attribute of the Devil who is properly a liar and the
Father of lies, <hi>Job.</hi> viii. And therefore even we our selves,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46181:20"/>
though we be all liars, yet we cannot endure to hear it,
and when we do, nothing can satisfie but his blood that
tells us so, though never so truly; How then, may we
think, and with what indignation will God receive it,
when they are so unjustly pinned and stuck upon him,
who hates a lie more than we can love our selves? And
with what severity may we imagin he will revenge it?
what reward will he give unto such a false Tongue, but
sharp Arrows and hot burning Coles at the least, even
those Arrows in <hi>Job,</hi> the Arrows of Gods wrath, the
venom whereof drink up the spirits of him in whom they
stick: and those Coles or rather Flames of St. <hi>John,</hi> for
<hi>all liars saith he, shall have their part in the lake that
burneth with fire and brimstone, Rev.</hi> xxi. 8. And if all
Liars have a part, then how great a portion will be assigned
to the Perjurers? for if God will not hold him guiltless that
useth his holy Name but vainly, how shall his guilt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
and his Sin become exceeding sinful that doth abuse it
falsly? and if he will destroy those that do but speak out
their lies (as it is in the v. <hi>Psalm) Thou shalt destroy those
that speak Leasing,</hi> how great shall their destruction be
that fear not to swear them out and uphold them by the
holiness of his name? Certainly so great, as I think the
depth and bottom of Hell doth not know any greater;
for I assure my self that neither the Idolatrous Gentile,
nor the unbelieving A theist shall lie lower in that Pit of
everlasting horror than the contemptuous Perjurer; for
the one doth worship no God, the other a false God, but
this makes a false witness of the true God: his Sin is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
the others Idolatry, but this man's is not without
blasphemy, which is worse than either; for it may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
be esteemed a less Crime to acknowledge any thing
for God, yea or not to acknowledge any God at all, than
to be contemptuous and injurious unto the God which
we acknowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46181:20"/>
And as their Sin is greater, so shall be their punishment
in that last and fearful day when God whom at their pleasure
they have here made a false witness of their lies, shall then
come to shew himself a just judge and severe Revenger,
that will vindicate his own truth; At what time, none of
all our cunning Inventions, no counterfeit and new-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Oaths so frequent in these times, nor no devices of
former Ages, neither the subtleness of the Scribes and
Pharisees that had forms of purpose to forswear by; no nor
yet (which exceeds the cunning of the Scribes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the Pharisees, though later,) the equivocation of
a Priest and mental reservation of a Jesuit shall ever be
able to excuse and free them; for as the formers Tongue
doubles with an Oath, so the laters mind doubles with his
Tong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, when God requires Truth in both especially in
the inward parts, <hi>(he that speaketh the truth from his
heart, saith D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vid, Psalm</hi> xv) and therefore will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
take vengeance of both for their falshood. Rightly
then is Truth the first property of a lawful Oath, but of
an Oath Assertory that doth deny something present or
past: but because it is so evident in it self, I leave it and
come to the Oath that is Obligatory, that doth promise to
do or omit something to come, whose material property
is Righteousness. Which though it be the third and last as
they are here set down, yet the order of method requires
that it should not be last handled, as being peculiar only
unto an Obligatory Oath as the first is to an Assertory,
when the second is common unto both, between which
it lies, and therefore will be best considered after both.</p>
            <p>First therefore of Righteousness, wherein I will be as brief
as in the former, it being manifest and clear in it self as that
was. For it is plain and evident to every mans eye, that
Justice or Righteousness is as proper to a Promise, as Truth
to an Assertion; and he that with an Oath doth vow to do
evil, is as resolute a sinner, as he that in an Oath affirms a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46181:21"/>
falshood; the one abuseth Gods truth for the stablishing
of a lie, the other his holiness to the acting of mischief:
and 'tis hard to say whether is worst, both being no less
injurious to God than pernicious unto men. For he that
swears to do unjustly, doth but call God to witness that
he will injure his brother whom he hath commanded to
love as himself, and so in effect he only swears by God that
he is resolved that he will disobey God; an Oath most
impiously made and yet is more impious to be acted, since
the more religiously a man doth observe it, the more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
he is: for that which begins with unrighteousness
and ends in villany, must needs be ill made, but worse if
it be executed. And therefore we ought to be throughly
perswaded and assured of the lawfulness, honesty, and
goodness of that promise which we bind with an Oath,
lest we be enforced either to offend God and injure our
Neighbour, or else to violate our Oath and forswear our
selves, which in this case is rather to be chosen, the breach
of such an Oath being ever a less sin, and scarce any sin
in comparison of the observance; for though a promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory
Oath be obligatory, as they say, yet it doth not
always oblige and bind men unto the performance.
There are three cases wherein a man is evidently free,
and in two of them, even when the thing promised and
sworn is just and lawful. The first is, when he to whom the
Oath is made, remits the obligation; for though the one
bind himself, yet the others release unties the bonds and
sets him at liberty; from which tie the Oath though in it
self obligatory, doth yet through anothers courtesy cease to
oblige; neither is it then thought to be termed a false Oath
if not performed, be the thing never so just, as neither a
bare promise in this case to be accounted false, since either
are to be understood <hi>quatenus ab eo cui fit, acceptatur,</hi>
according to his acceptance unto whom it is made, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it the very <hi>essentia,</hi> reason of a promise did either
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46181:21"/>
not subsist, or else doth presently expire. The second is,
when the thing promised, though lawful, be yet impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
whether it were impossible then when it was sworn,
or else became so afterwards; and the reason is, <hi>Quia ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
tenetur ad impossibilia;</hi> because as the vulgar <hi>Axiome</hi>
hath it, <hi>No man can be bound unto impossibilities;</hi> But
yet this case is not absolute and without restraint, for
though he that swears knew not of the impossibility, yet
if it be such as he should or might have known it, his
Oath is not without Sin; but if he knew it to be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
before, or else through his own default it became
so afterwards, it is then not only sinful, but perjurious.
As for example, If a man should swear to pay a certain
sum of Money at such a time, which notwithstanding
either because he used not his Industry to procure it; or
for that he riotously plaid or mispent it, he cannot then
possibly do; the Impossibility here will not free him
from the guilt of Perjury, because it was his own neglect
that wilfully made it so. The same fault that made his
performance impossible, doth at the same time make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
perjurious. The third and last which was before
mentioned is, when the thing that is sworn is unjust and
evil in it self, or most likely to be pernicious unto others;
and the reason why in this case we stand not bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
is manifest, <hi>(quia nihil est quod hominem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligare
possit ad peccandum)</hi> because there is nothing
can oblige or bind a man to sin wilfully against God. A
worthy example of this we have in <hi>David,</hi> who though
he had rashly sworn the destruction of churlish <hi>Nabal</hi>
and all his family, yet afterwards being better advised
he refused to perform his Oath, which he saw without
great danger could not be performed, as himself confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
even blessing God who withheld him from it. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus
Deus, Blessed be the Lord that hath kept his
servant from doing evil, 1 Sam.</hi> xxv. The contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46181:22"/>
whereunto, you may behold in <hi>Herod,</hi> who what
he had rashly sworn would needs more rashly fulfil, choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather to destroy a holy Prophet of God, than not
to observe his own inconsiderate Oath; <hi>In Vovendo stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
In Reddendo impius,</hi> becoming, as foolish in vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so more impious in performing. Rightly therefore <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
In malis promissis rescinde sidem,</hi> in evil promises
rather break faith than violate honesty. Which is the
opinion also of St. <hi>Austin</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> reverend <hi>Bede</hi>
and many more of the Fathers, yea and some Councils,
which for brevity sake in so clear a case, may well be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And these three ways it is true that the obligation
of a promissory Oath is naturally dissoved, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in all other cases, when the thing sworn is just and
good in it self, and possible unto him that swears it, and
accepted and required by him to whom it is sworn, though
it be unto his own damage, and then too though won
from him by fraud or enforced by violence, it is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
religiously and inevitably to be observed. The
example unto this purpose of <hi>Joshua</hi> and the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi>
is most remarkable; for though <hi>Joshua</hi> had a Commission
from the Lord to root out and destroy all the Nations that
bordered upon the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to give their
Cities and possessions unto the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sworn a League with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> a neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who counterfeiting themselves a strange People that
came from far, deceived him, and by this subtilty obtained
Peace, he feared for all that ever to violate the Oath
which himself and the Princes of the Congregation had
made with them. And though all the people murmured
at the League, for the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> had fair Cities, yet he
never sought unto the high Priest for Absolution or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
those high Mysteries of Iniquity were not then
known; neither yet did he plead that Treacherous Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om,
That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46181:22"/>
Infidels, which were by the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> against
all Faith both Humane and Divine shamefully decided,
and with the blood of Innocents more barbarously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
Such subtilties were too acute for the dull sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and honesty of those better times; But without
all shifts and devices both himself and all the Princes that
had taken the Oath, resolutely answer the mutinous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
<hi>We have sworn unto them by the Lord God of
Israel, now therefore we may not touch them, Josh.</hi> ix. 19.
And that you may perceive how precious in Gods sight such
sacred Attestations be that are made in his holy Name, do
but consider with what severity and bitter revenge the
Lord persecuted the breach, though long time after in
the days of <hi>Saul,</hi> even of this very Oath, which though
it was at the first obtained by the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> with fraud
and imposture, and confirmed by <hi>Joshua</hi> besides, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to, his Commission, and that without ever consulting
the Lord, (as the Text doth especially mention) and at
length violated by <hi>Saul</hi> not without a good and zealous
intent, for <hi>Saul</hi> fought to slay them (saith the story) in
his zeal unto the house of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> yet for all that
because the thing was not unjust in it self, so highly did the
breach displease and offend the Lord, that for this very
cause, even after the death of <hi>Saul</hi> in the days of <hi>David,</hi>
he sent three years famine upon the whole Land, for
which no attonement might be made until this sin were
particularly revenged, and seven of <hi>Sauls</hi> Sons hung up
before the Lord in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and then the famine ceased, as
you may read 2. of <hi>Sam.</hi>xxi. In which Chapter there is one
thing more observable unto this purpose, for it leaves us
a double example, recording at once unto posterity, as
<hi>Sauls</hi> impious breach of this Oath with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> so
<hi>Davids</hi> religious observance of his Oath with <hi>Jonathan;</hi>
for when he delivered up the posterity of <hi>Saul</hi> unto the
revenge of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> he spared <hi>Mephibosheth the</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:46181:23"/>
Grandchild of <hi>Saul</hi> and Son of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> because (saith
the Text) of the Lords Oath that was between them
between David and <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul,</hi> v. 7. of
the same Chapter, for <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had sworn,
as you know, a league of friendship, and though <hi>Jonathan</hi>
were dead and gone, yet faithful <hi>David</hi> (far unlike the
falseness of this world) remembers it in his posterity, and
fails not to shew that love and kindness to the Son which
he had formerly vowed and sworn unto the Father. And
whence it is also more remarkable that this Oath is not
termed <hi>Davids</hi> Oath or <hi>Jonathans</hi> Oath, but the Lords
Oath, the Lords Oath that was between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi>
to shew and signify that the Lord is interested in
the performance of an Oath wherein his name is assumed,
and that his truth is dishonoured in the breach, unless the
falshood be revenged by his justice, whereof he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fail, either here or hereafter; sometimes (yea and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
here, but ever and for ever hereafter; And therefore
either make no Oaths, or else perform the Oaths which
you make; either make them in Righteousness, or make
them not at all: and being righteously made, be sure they
be not unrighteously broken, for there is, as righteousness
in the making, so also a righteousness in the observance,
and if either be wanting, God will not fail to shew his
righteousness in the avenging of both. And so I leave
Righteousness and come to Judgment, <hi>Jurabis in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio,</hi>
Thou shalt swear as in truth and righteousness, so
also in judgment.</p>
            <p>For though we may sometimes affirm a truth, and
sometimes confirm a lawful and just promise with an
Oath, yet notwithstanding we may not swear promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
every Truth, nor yet bind every such promise with
the attestation of God whose name is holy, and in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and trivial occasions cannot be used without profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And therefore besides Truth and Righteousness
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46181:23"/>
in the thing sworn, there is required also judgement and
discretion in the swearer, that he may discern between
cases and causes of moment, and not unadvisedly temerate
this sacred name, when neither the weight of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
nor our brothers weakness doth make it necessary;
for as St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath it, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Serm. Dom. Qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligit
non in bonis, sed necessariis jurationem esse
habendam, refraenet se quantum potest, nè ea utatur ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si
necessitate.</hi> He that knows that an Oath is not food
but physick, not to be desired for it self but to be used
for anothers necessity, let him refrain from swearing till
that necessity doth require it, and when that is, the next
immediate words will shew us, <hi>cum videt pigros esse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
ad credendum quod iis utile est credere, nisi ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione
firmetur,</hi> when he sees men otherwise unwilling
to believe what he knows is behoofeful for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
But Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> who doth also allow of a necessary
Oath, lest we should enlarge the cases of this necessity
at our own pleasure, gives a fuller rule to prevent it, <hi>Non
alia praetendi potest necessit as quàm ubi vel religioni
velcharitati est serviendum;</hi> We may never pretend ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
(saith he) but when we may do some good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to Religion or Charity, that is, to God or our
Neighbour: So that as the two former properties do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
us from untrue and unrighteous, so this latter from
unnecessary swearing: They forbid us that we swear not
falsly and unjustly, and this that we swear not rashly and
vainly, the one thing specially intended. And when the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
licentiousness of these times doth require a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
labour in reproof, as being a sin that like a deluge
hath overrun the whole World, and covered the face
of the whole Earth as a flood, which is so much the more
intolerable (saith <hi>Calvin) quod assuetudine ipsa pro de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licto
imput ari desiit,</hi> That the frequent use and custom
hath taken away the sense and apprehension of the sin;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46181:24"/>
and though there be little hope in this case of redress, for
(as <hi>Seneca</hi> says well) <hi>desinet esse remedio locus, ubi quae
fuerunt vitia mores sunt,</hi> there is no place left for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
when those things which were made to be vices, are
now become fashions and manners; yet not despairing
of Gods goodness and mercy unto any, both for our own
sakes and yours, we are at least to shew you the peril
and danger of so great a sin, and leave the success unto
him.</p>
            <p>And sure there were danger enough in it, though it
were no sin, and did we never transgress so long as we
swear frequently, for as St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath it, Use runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
facility, into custom, and from the custom of swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we easily fall into the detestable sin of Perjury and
forswearing. And indeed it is almost impossible that he
which swears daily and hourly and almost perpetually,
should not sometimes swear deceitfully and falsly. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I think there is any, if he impartially examine
and observe himself, that doth familiarly use the one, but
he will find that he hath often and easily slipt into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for the Conscience that dares to play with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
name of God and continually to use it with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and contempt, it is likely will not stick now
and then to abuse it by perjury. And therefore the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of the same Father is good, <hi>Epist.</hi> 89;. <hi>ad Hil.</hi> 2. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from swearing as much as is possible, <hi>melius quippe
nec verum juratur, quam jurandi consuetudine in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurium
saepe caditur &amp; semper perjurio propinquatur,</hi>
For it were better not to swear any truth than that by a
custom of swearing we should often forswear our selves,
and ever endanger it. Excellently therefore to the same
purpose he concludes in another place, <hi>Falsa juratio exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosa
est: Vera juratio periculo sa: at nulla juratio
secura,</hi> False swearing is damnable and exitious: true
swearing is dangerous: but no swearing is secure; which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46181:24"/>
is the reason that under the name of swearing is included
oftentimes perjury and forswearing; the Scripture for
this cause knitting and linking them both together as in
the sin, so in the punishment: Since no Man can be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto that but he will be found also often guilty of
this. And therefore there were danger enough (as I
said) in this unadvised custom, if it were no sin: but how
much more then when it doth not only lead and conduce
unto sin and the greatest almost of sins, but also is little
less sinful in self, I am sure is more expresly forbidden in
the Commandment, which says not, <hi>Thou shalt not swear
falsly,</hi> though that be included, but <hi>thou shalt not take
the name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> that is, lightly
and idly: and <hi>David</hi> gives the reason, for saith he, <hi>holy
and reverend is his name.</hi> Now that which is holy, if
it be brought into common use, it is prophaned; And
that which is reverend, if it be irrespectfully handled, is
contemned. So that it is not only a bare sin but a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
a trebble sin and terrible, compounded of irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
profanation, and presumptuous contempt; The
least whereof were enough to plunge a rebellious Soul in
the depth of eternal sorrow, whereof he is now thrice
worthy as being guilty of all three. For what indignity
must it needs be unto the Divine Majesty, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable,
with idle and empty, supervacuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Oaths every moment, and in causes of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
irreligiously and contemptuously to toss and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
if not tear in pieces that sacred name, which should
never be thought on but with trembling, nor ever be
uttered without religious adoration? That Name vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
above all names, so excellent and admirable in all
the world, <hi>how excellent is thy name in all the world</hi>
(saith <hi>David</hi>) by way of question, and none can answer
it; That Name which the Jews thought so sacred, as
they never durst utter it, nor was lawful for any but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46181:25"/>
the high Priest ever to carry it about him, <hi>Exod,</hi> xxviii.
so much as written, who was commanded to wear it on
his forehead in a leaf of Gold, the very sight whereof made
the greatest Monarch of the World, (even proud <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>)
that would needs be a God himself, yet to stoop and do
his reverence: Lastly, that Name which the very Devils in
Hell and spirits of darkness cannot hear without horror;
no nor Powers and Principalities, Cherubin and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,
the blessed Angels of God ever mention without glory
and great worship? What dishonour must it needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be at length thus shamefully contemned by
dust and ashes: thus hourly and idly to be belched out
from the foul mouth of a sinful man without all esteem
or respect, yea or so much as ever thinking of it? Rather
consider those glorifyed Spirits and tremble; I saw God,
saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> Chap. vi. sitting on his Throne,
high and exalted, and the Cherubins and Seraphins stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round about it, crying and calling unto one another,
and saying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabbath,
Heaven and Earth are full of thy Glory.</hi> Behold, saith
<hi>Chrysostom,</hi> with what fear and horror, with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
of praise and glory they make mention of his
holy name I may say thrice holy, that is most sacred, Name!
And shall the Sons of men presume contemptuously to
violate that which the Angels themselves when they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do with Reverence adore? Why, if we say (saith
the same Father) of one of our selves, if of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vertue and worth, <hi>Os lava,</hi> wash or wipe your
mouth before you name him; And if a servant will not
mention his Lord, nor a subject his Prince without Titles
of Respect and Honour, with what fear and reverence
should the name of the Lord of Lords and King of Kings,
the God both of men and Angels be warily pronounced?
Our mouths here had more need of fire than water, not
to be washed, but with <hi>Isaias</hi> Cole from the Altar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46181:25"/>
with a religious zeal, when we dare to mention
it. Judge therefore in your selves how great is his Sin
that can assume boldness not only with unhallowed and
polluted lips to mention, but even with idle, nay rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
and wanton Oaths, fearfully to prophane and lacerate
that Name which some mens Reverence never durst utter,
and no Angels without terms of praise and glory will ever
pronounce? Now if our light, trival and customary
Oaths are so derogatory unto the honour of God, what
then may we think of intemperate, passionate and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick
Oaths, the Oaths of Gamesters and others wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto other sports, who if a Die or Dog run not
to their liking, or a Kite fly where they would not
have him, fall instantly into such a fit of hideous Oaths,
as if with <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife they were resolved presently to
<hi>curse God and die:</hi> If the former were profanations,
these sure are direct blasphemies, when men enraged with
their trifling misfortunes pour forth floods of direful
Oaths, as the desire to wreak their anger upon that God
whose providence they know doth guide them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot reach unto his Essence, they will at
least this way avenge themselves on his Name. For you
shall see such Tear-Gods sometimes swear a whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologue
of Oaths over and over, still swear them and
still say nothing else, as having no other end in their swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but to swear, for they swear not to affirm a truth or
confirm a promise, yet they swear and to no other purpose
but to offend God by swearing. Their Tongue, as the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
speaks, <hi>walketh through the Earth, and they set their
mouth against heaven,</hi> and yet as if neither Heaven nor
Earth could afford them Oaths enow to swear by, they
set their invention on work for strange, uncouth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of blasphemies, which not without rancor of mind
they dart at God himself, and spit with more than Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean
Liberty in the very face of the Almighty. <hi>The
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46181:26"/>
Tongue,</hi> saith St. <hi>James, is but a little member, yet it
hath in it a world of wickedness, it sets the world on
fire, and its self is set on fire of Hell.</hi> Which though it
were spoken of the malicious and slanderous Tongue, yet
it may be no less true also of the blasphemous, for this,
if any, is certainly set on fire of Hell, and flames with a sin
hot enough, and likely enough to set fire on the whole
world in the last day, when for that world of wickedness
it shall find a world of sorrow and torment; and as it
was fired from Hell before, so it shall now be fired in Hell,
where (like <hi>Moses</hi> bush) it shall ever burn and never
be consumed; for this later fire, none shall ever escape,
but such as with a River of penitent Tears do quench
the former before they come there. But omitting such
high and horrid blasphemies, the hellish impiety whereof
every one must needs perceive, and none that have any
goodness remaining can choose but abhor:</p>
            <p>We will a little insist only on those lesser Prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the vain and frequent Oaths of common speech,
which though men can be content to account a sin, yet
they would willingly esteem it such as may easily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.
It is only a Custom that is grown upon me, I like
it not, but I cannot leave it; the plea of the world as
common as the swearing; and if it might stand for an
excuse, it were easily excused indeed: But consider it
well and you will find it such an excuse as only seems to
make the sin more inexcusable: since that very reason
which they give to lessen the Crime, is the principal thing
that augments the offence: for sin never becomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
measure sinful, until it grow into Custom, that
heaps it up infinitely and so makes it immensurable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it rule and reign in our mortal bodies, which alone
can stile us, not only sinful but the slaves and vassals of
sin, and then we are sinners indeed. There is no man,
not the best of us without sin, yet all are not sinners; it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46181:26"/>
is not the falling into sin, but the habit and serving of sin
that gives the denomination: A man may sin and be the
servant of God, for what servant of Gods doth not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
sin? but to serve sin and be the servant of God, is
impossible; And therefore of all things else, the habit
and custome of sin, especially mortal and presumptuous
sin, is most dangerous, as being incompatible with the
state of Grace and reconciliation with God, who never
gives remission of the sin, unless we abhor and utterly
renounce the custom; for which cause the Swearer (and
no man hath the name of a swearer but from the habit of
swearing) is set down in the same Catalogue with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer,
the Drunkard and other heinous sinners, which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us <hi>shall never enter into the kingdom of
God.</hi> And therefore let no man flatter himself and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his own Soul; it is a custom that we must leave one
time or other, or God will eternally leave us. The
which that we may be the better induced to do, I beseech
you, do but consider besides the greatness of the sin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewn, to how little or rather no purpose it is
committed, and with what severity it will be punished
both here and hereafter; for so highly to offend God,
and no way in the world to pleasure our selves, is the
utmost of folly, and treads on the very heels of madness.
Why, he that burns in Hell for his Mistris had once yet
some delight for that torment he shall ever suffer; All
other sins have their strong provocations in our corrupt
nature whereunto they give some content: but this idle and
wanton sin is without all instigation of the depraved
flesh, and can give satisfaction to no one appetite of our
frail condition, unless death and everlasting sorrow dwell
in our desires. And as it can give no pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
because it hath no affection in nature to fulfil and
content: so neither (that you may perceive it to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vain) can it plead any other benefit, there being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46181:27"/>
no just pretence or reason or end for it, why it is used.
And if neither pleasure nor profit be in it, the malice of
the Devil is in it, if to gain nothing here we will run
headlong into eternal destruction hereafter. If there be
any end of it in the world or benefit that we may reap
by it, it can be no other than the gaining of credit to our
speech, and to be believed of others when we speak,
which is indeed the true and proper end of an Oath,
but an end which the trivial and customary swearer of
Oaths in reason cannot expect, and if he deal with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and wise men, shall never obtain, though they
urge it often and think it their best plea to stop the
mouth of reproof for this sin, Why, they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me? whereby notwithstanding instead of excusing
they do but condemn themselves, and yet gain not their
purpose with others. For first, if they mark it, what doth
it argue but that they do not usually speak truth, that
cannot be believed without an Oath? <hi>Qui jurat, suspectus
est de perfidia,</hi> The very use of swearing is a manifest
sign that he is suspected of perfidy, saith <hi>Philo.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rightly St.<hi>Basil, Turpe &amp; omnino stultum</hi> &amp;c. he
doth no less basely than foolishly accuse himself as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of credit and belief, that perpetually flies unto the
safeguard and sanctuary of an Oath; for which cause the
<hi>Esseni,</hi> saith <hi>Josephus,</hi> did avoid and abhor swearing no
less than perjury, as conceiving that he was before-hand
condemned for lying, that could not be credited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
swearing. And as they condemn themselves, so they
obtain by this custom as little credit from others. For
that which doth breed a suspicion in their persons, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well beget an assurance of their Oaths. And indeed
what trust or confidence may be reposed in an usual and
ordinary swearer? whom the very custom of swearing
doth condemn of persidy, how can he choose but sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of perjury? Since he that cares not how often he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46181:27"/>
swears, it is likely will sometimes care as little what he
swears: So that as the word of a faithful and honest Man
is as good as his Oath; so the Oath of a false and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man is no better than his word: And therefore he
only gains thus much by swearing that the more often
he swears the less he is to be believed, since the best way
of gaining credit is to accustom our selves not to swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but not to swear; for he that lives justly and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and speaks the truth calmly, shall be believed upon his
word, when the other's Oaths shall not that swears fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
though he swear never so earnestly. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
heard it pleaded, with <hi>Chrysostome, hom</hi> 26. Unless
I swear he will not believe; true, nor when thou swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
neither: but thou, saith he, art the cause of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
that dost so lightly and easily swear; for if thou
didst not so, and it were manifestly known that thou
wert no swearer, believe me that only say it, <hi>Quod iis
qui mille devorant juramenta, majorem ipse fidem solo
nutu invenires,</hi> Thy only beck and nod should find more
esteem and credit than a thousand Oaths poured forth
by another. And in like manner, I have beheld, saith
<hi>Philo</hi> the learned Jew, the impiety of some with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
impudence heaping and hudling up the religious
names of God not to be heard without horror, as if they
thought by the number and multitude of their impious
Oaths to evince and even extort belief from the hearer:
<hi>Fatui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>qui non intelligunt consuetudinem crebrò jurandi
argumentum esse perfidiae non fidei.</hi> Fools, saith he, that
do not understand that the custom of often swearing is
an argument not of fidelity but perfidiousness. And
therefore though they swear until they burst, they shall
never the sooner gain any credit; only this they gain,
that by their often swearing they have bereaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of all means of gaining belief, firm and assured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
even when they swear the truth; for it is not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46181:28"/>
and millions of Oaths, but the truth and sincerity of
a mans behaviour that shall win him reputation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
<hi>Non juramentum sed vitae testimonium,</hi> It is not
our Oaths (saith <hi>Chrysostome Homil. 7.</hi>) but the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our lives that can give assurance to our words.
And therefore excellently (St. <hi>Austin de Serm. Dom.64.)
Christianus verum loquatur, ne<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> jurationibus crebris
sed morum probitate commendet veritatem,</hi> Let a
Christian only speak the truth, and let not his Oaths
but the probity of his manners commend or confirm the
truth of his speech. For the Christians are termed <hi>the
faithful</hi> (saith <hi>Josephus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Bello c.</hi> 7.) though but
half a Christian himself. And therefore <hi>tanta Sanctitate
ornata sit fides ut sine jurejurando facial fidem,</hi> Their
faith ought to be adorned with so much sanctity as it
should be able without the assistance of Oaths to beget
faith and credit in another: which if the sincerity of their
life cannot do, the frequency of their Oaths will much
less obtain, whereby instead of gaining credit with others
they do only further discredit themselves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since it doth breed a just suspicion rather than any
certain belief; what end there is of this vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
custom, what profit or colourable pretence it may
have to shrowd it self under, I cannot understand any,
unless peradventure some men esteem it as a mark of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
and gentry, which they have little reason to do
since the vilest Beggar wears the fashion as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and though he have not two pence a year Starling
can swear after the Revenues of a great Lord that hath
thousands. Or it may be, some take it as an ornament of
speech; or others an argument of valour; and sure he
is very hardy that fears neither God nor Hell, which if
it be valour let every good Man be a Coward: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
unto ungracious hearts, it may be thought a grace
in their tongue, yet unto a good mind that desires to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46181:28"/>
worship God, and think on him with reverence, it is a
sound that's worse than the turning of Brass grates, and
horror to his ears, if it be not the greatest torture and
torment unto his righteous Soul. And is it not now most
strange that we should be so desperately wicked against
God, or so wretchedly careless of our selves, as thus
wantonly to offend him, and prodigiously to spend our
own Souls in a sin that hath neither pleasure nor profit,
no just end, nor yet so much as a fair pretence to give it
colour? But the less colour and pretence a sin hath, the
greater still it is, and with the greater punishment it shall
ever be rewarded, and this of all others shall be sure not
to be forgotten; for it is not for nought and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that in those brief precepts of the Law written with
the very finger of God, all other sins are barely inhibited,
Murder, Adultery and the rest of our crimes meerly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
without any special mention of punishment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the offenders; only this sin, as if it displeased him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the rest, is not without a peculiar commination
of revenge annexed, <hi>for the Lord will not hold him
guiltless, that taketh his name in vain.</hi> Whether it be
the vanity and needlesness of this wanton and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sin, that hath neither pleasure nor profit nor pretence,
doth exceed all other; or whether it be the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
neglect of men in suffering this sin of all others to
escape unpunished, that moved the Lord more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to assure us that he will take it into his own hands
and see it rewarded himself: whether this, or that or
both or neither it is not certain, neither is it much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
to inquire, since it is enough that this is certain,
that something there is in it odious above other sins, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
he would never have been so careful above all
others in particular to register the revenge of this. And
as this doth assure, that it is a sin which shall certainly be
punished: so there want not other places to shew us
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46181:29"/>
what the punishment shall be. St. <hi>Paul</hi> delivers it nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
by exclusion from the Kingdom of Heaven:
St. <hi>James</hi> affirmatively but indefinitely by condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>lest ye fall into condemnation.</hi> But St. <hi>John</hi> doth
affirm and fully define whither and to what they are
condemned, even unto the inconceiveable sorrows of
Hell. <hi>They shall be cast into the lake that burns with
fire and brimstone; Apoc.</hi> And if you put all together,
you have all the punishment, and it is no less than all
which a Sinner may receive, the punishment of loss, and
the punishment of sense, the loss of all good in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
from Heaven, and the suffering of all evil in the
torments of Hell. This exprest in Scripture, <hi>by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
fire;</hi> that, <hi>by a gnawing and never dying
worm;</hi> Divines contending which is worst when either
is insufferably bad, but both joined together make a
double death and destruction which none can conceive;
And therefore the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> 23. 12. doth well term
it a sin that is arrayed and apparelled with death, <hi>there is
a word</hi> (saith he) <hi>and it is clothed about with death:
God grant it be not found in the heritage of Jacob;</hi> and
that you may know what the word is, which he means,
he presently infers, <hi>use not thy mouth to intemperate
swearing,</hi> for there is the word, the word of sin clothed
about with death, and I pray God it may not be found
in the heritage of <hi>Jacob,</hi> neither in our <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage,
his Son or Subject, neither himself nor any of his
Kingdom. And this were punishment enough it should
seem, were there no other; yet this is not all, for this
general and universal destruction of the world to come,
is common to all sins and sinners: but the special threat
and commination in that precept against this sin, seems to
relate unto some special revenge that God will take of
it even in the life of this world here, before they depart
unto the sorrows of another: for neither in that or this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46181:29"/>
shall they ever be held guiltless, but receive a just reward
and recompence in both. Concerning this later what and
how grievous it is, you may read in the 23. of <hi>Eccles.</hi>
before cited; It is briefly thus, and I beseech you mark
it, <hi>Vir multùm jurans,</hi> a man that useth much swearing,
<hi>shall be filled with iniquity, and a plague or curse shall
never depart from his house.</hi> How terrible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is this! himself shall be filled with iniquity, and the
curse of God shall be upon his house, nay which is worse,
<hi>Shall never depart from his house;</hi> his Spirit will forsake
the one, that being given up unto a reprobate sense, he
may fill up the measure of his sins, and fat himself against
the day of slaughter, <hi>be shall be filled with iniquity;</hi>
and his blessing will leave the other unto the waste and
spoil of a consuming malediction, until ruine eat it up
and wholly root it out, the <hi>curse shall never depart from
his house.</hi> Gods judgments for other sins are great, yet
they seem to extend themselves but to the third or fourth
Generation at the farthest; how deadly then is this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and how heavy the revenge, that staies not there, but
runs through all Generations? Shall never depart from the
house, until the house it self depart, and be no more? A bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
curse indeed, that wasts and spoils wheresoever it comes,
but utterly ruines the House where it remains, nay leaves
not so much as any ruines to remain, neither Stone nor
Timber, for it eats up both, as you may read in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Zechariah,</hi> where you shall find the curse written
in a Role, a large curse as it should seem, for the Role
hath room enough for more curses than ever the Spirit of
God hath registred; for it was twenty Cubits long and
ten Cubits broad, a great and flying Role, which when
that Prophet beheld in a Vision, the Angel which gave the
interpretation, said, <hi>This is the curse, that goeth forth
over the face of the whole earth:</hi> according unto which
<hi>the swearer shall be cut off,</hi> for <hi>it shall enter into his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46181:30"/>
house, and remain in the midst of his house, and shall
consume it, with the timber thereof, and the stones
thereof,</hi> Zech. 5. 4. A strange remaining wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
not so much as Timber and Stone shall remain, and
a heavy malediction when a Man shall be emptied of all
his goods, and filled only with his own Sins, <hi>He shall be
filled with iniquity</hi>! How many deaths and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do attend and inviron this accursed Sin! the death of
his estate and substance which shall be consumed, the
death of Sin, or rather of Grace through Sin! where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he shall be filled; and the everlasting death of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Soul in a lake of burning brimstone wherein he
shall be perpetually tormented: So true is that of <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides</hi>
before mentioned, but never enough repeated, it
is a word cloathed about with death: and we can never
enough repeat his prayer, God grant it be not found in
the heritage of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider these things now, and then say It is a Custom
and I cannot leave it; shall it excuse the Malefactor, if
he say to the Judge, I take no pleasure in Theft, only my
fingers have been inured to it from my youth, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now forsake the habit? and yet the Thief (who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
hath his Curse written also in the other side
of <hi>Zecharies</hi> flying Role) may be the better excused of
the two, for though he take no pleasure, yet there may
be profit in the sin; But the Custom whether without or
upon pretence shall never excuse either, till both forsake
the Custom. It is this only through which we shall be
held guiltless, and by which alone we may remove this
Curse of God both from our selves and our houses.
And why can it not be done? what should hinder that
we may not forsake it? where lies the labour or wherein
doth the difficulty consist that it should be so invincible?
Why, what saith <hi>Chrysostom</hi> (Homil. 17. on <hi>Mat.) Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
pecuniarum opus est impensa? Nunquid aerumnis
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46181:30"/>
&amp; sudore perficitur?</hi> is it a business that requires the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of any great sums of our money, or else of our
spirits in sweat and painful labour to atchieve it? <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tummodo
Velle sufficit, &amp; totum quod jubetur imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est:</hi> No such thing! only will, that is, bend thy
mind and thy will to it, and the thing required is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fulfilled; As use hath bred a custom, so disuse must
destroy it, and a contrary use beget a contrary Custom;
And sure the Will of man cannot think of a Custom so
easy to be disused as this; all others are deeply rooted in
natural Affections, and therefore hard to be plucked up;
but this hath no hold in Nature, not one Appetite in the
infirmity of man, that gapes and waters after it, it can
neither quench the Thirst, nor kill the Hunger of any
desire whereunto our Corruption is subject; but is only
an external, a naked and a bare Custom which only use
hath begotten, and doth still nourisn, and disuse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great difficulty can again starve and strangle,
<hi>Tantummodo velle sufficit,</hi> only set thy will to it, and the
business is ended; for as St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath it, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Conses.</hi>
In the ways of God, <hi>Ire &amp; pervenire,</hi> is nothing, but
<hi>Velle ire,</hi> to walk is only to will, and whosoever wills,
cannot but walk, but then it must be <hi>velle fortiter &amp;
integre,</hi> no cold and faint desire, but a strong, a total and
a resolute will. The sluggard may be willing to rise, and
yet for all that lie still in his warm Bed; but it is not a
Will that he hath but only a Velleity or willingness, for
when he will, he riseth, yea when he wills he cannot
possibly choose but rise, for the body doth naturally
obey the mind so easily and readily, <hi>ut vix à servitio
discernatur imperium,</hi> that the wit of man (saith St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi>)
can hardly discern between the command of the
one and the execution of the other; And therefore to
will is to do, and he that doth not do, did never will;
he that doth not do what is possible for him to do, did
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46181:31"/>
never will, since if he will such things, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for him not to do. So that rightly in this <hi>Velle suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit,</hi>
there is nothing required but thy Will, yet thy full
and total Will, not a saint and lazy Velleity, but a resolved
Will, that is ever accompanied with watchful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
endeavour, which the Tongue of all other doth espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
require of us, (as the same Father elsewhere speaks)
<hi>Lingua facilitatem habet motûs, in udo posita est, facile
labitur in lubrico,</hi> The Tongue hath a great facility in
motion, and is seated in a moist and slippery place, where
it is easy to slide of it self, but much more through
Custom; And therefore <hi>quanto illa cilius movetur,
tanto tu adversus illam fixus esto,</hi> The more movable the
Tongue is, the more immovable and fixt must be thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and Care; and the longer the Custom, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thine intention to break it. For vigilance will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
it, and the fear of God will beget vigilance, and
the meditation that thou art a Christian, that must render
an account of all at the last day, is able to instil the
fear of God into thy heart, saith the same St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
who doth also incourage us not only by his exhortation,
but even by his own example, who seems to have been as
deeply engaged in this evil habit as another; but how freed
he himself? <hi>Timendo Deum Jurationem abstulimus de ore
nostro,</hi> The fear of God (saith he) stripped it from my
Tongue, <hi>Luctatus sum, &amp;c.</hi> For I wrestled with the
evil use and wrestling I called upon God, and Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
delivered me from the Custom: And now, <hi>nihil
mihi facilius quam non jurare,</hi> there is nothing so easy
to me as not to swear.</p>
            <p>Beloved, let us imitate the holy Father and we shall also
as easily vanquish, he hath beaten out a straight and plain
path to victory, and we need only to tread in his steps;
And therefore with him, Let us cast up our eyes upon
that sacred and dreadful Majesty which we offend, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46181:31"/>
then fear, and fearing wrestle, and wrestling call, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
we shall certainly receive assistance, undoubtedly
to conquer yea and to insult over it conquered, with a
<hi>Nihil mihi facilius,</hi> nothing is now so easy unto me as
not to swear. And sure the fear of God is ever the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Wisdom, especially here, where the sin is the
direct opposite to it, as being a presumptuous irreverence
in the very face and against the very honour of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
which cannot possibly consist with his fear, which
is the surest bank and bulwork against all ungodliness.
And therefore, when that like a Flood-hatch is plucked
up and cast aside, no marvel if dishonour be presently
poured forth upon God, and men become filled and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown
with Iniquity: And as little marvel that the Lord
for both respects, as well for our benefit and good as
for the fear and reverence of his own Name, injoineth this
as the very first thing we should beg of him in our
prayers, <hi>Sanctificetur Nomen tuum, hallowed be thy
Name:</hi> and as the first thing inhibited with a special
note of revenge (<hi>for he will not hold him guiltless that
taketh his Name in vain;</hi>) and as a prime instruction of
the first Sermon that ever he preached, <hi>I say unto you
swear not at all.</hi> That which he was so careful as to
make the Instruction of his first Sermon, the first petition
in his prayer, and the first revenge in the Decalogue, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be thought a matter of light importance: but must
needs argue it a sin no less odious unto himself than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
unto man; for which reason, St. <hi>James</hi> seems
worthily to inlarge our Saviour's instruction, <hi>swear not at
all</hi> with an <hi>Ante omnia, above all things, my brethren,
swear not at all.</hi> To whose exhortation, we may all
yet well add another, <hi>Ante omnia,</hi> of Prayer above all
things. O Lord plant thy fear in our hearts that we swear
not at all; If the awful fear of thy Majesty may not
deter us, at least let the dreadful fear of thy Judgments
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46181:32"/>
terrify us from this presumptuous sin, that it get not the
dominion over us: So shall we be innocent from the
great offence, and freed from the great malediction,
Thy curse upon our selves, and houses whilest we live,
and destruction of Body and Soul in everlasting sorrow
when we die. Which the Lord of his infinite mercy
avert; and instead thereof grant unto us, so to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
his holy Name now, as we may be admitted with
Saints and Angels everlastingly to magnify and adore it,
in thy Eternal Kingdom hereafter. Whereunto God of

            <epigraph>
               <q>Let us hear the Conclusion of the whole matter: Fear
God, and keep his Commandments. For this is the
whole Duty of Man. For God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS whole Book is nothing else, but a Search
and Enquiry of King <hi>Solomon</hi> into that grand
and famous Question <hi>de Summo Bono,</hi> what
may be the chief Wisdom and happiness of Man
in this Mortality. And this Verse with that other which
follows, as they close up the Book, so they contain the
Conclusion of the point, a full discovery and resolution
of that which in the former Chapters was but fearched af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and enquired into: whereunto his answer is short and
plain, but thus, <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments.</hi>
This only the whole matter of his Conclusion; and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46181:33"/>
that we may take it for full satisfaction to the Question,
he assures us, that it is the Conclusion too of the whole
matter, <hi>Let us hear, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Conclusion then we may be bold to term it, for so
it is, and so it terms it self: A Conclusion that hath two
parts: <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments.</hi> And
both backt with two Reasons, (He will not beg the
Conclusion, but prove it) <hi>For this is the duty, the
whole duty,</hi> not of the Priest or some of the People, but
universally <hi>of Man.</hi> Every Mans Duty, and the whole
Duty of every Man: That is the first Reason. There is
a second in the next Verse, and I may mention it, though
at this time not meddle with it, drawn from the day
of Gods Retribution: For there is a day approaching
wherein he will make a severe enquiry into this Duty,
censure the Breakers Terribly, and honour the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Eternally. <hi>For God will bring every work into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>So that you see he doth not beg the Conclusion, if he
beg any thing, it is Audience and Attention, which
indeed he doth in a Solemn Preface for the purpose,
<hi>Let us hear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this too he seeks to win with reasons of weight,
as well as beg: For it is a Conclusion, and that no trivial,
no narrow one neither, but material and universally
material, worth the hearing.</p>
            <p>These down-right points grate something close upon
the Soul; and men it seems do not much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the
hearing of them, and therefore he is driven to Pray and
Preface for Audience, before he delivers them, and to
back them strongly too, when they are delivered, for
Acceptance: That so his distasteful Conclusion lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both, between the Preface and Proof, might be
fortifyed behind and before, in the Van and in the Reare,
be led in and carryed out with Reasons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46181:33"/>
that might procure and gain it entertainment.
So then we have these Three, the Preface, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
and the Proof. The Conclusion, that is well
seated in the midst, hath Two Branches: The Proof that
follows, Two Reasons; and the Preface in the front, Two
Insinuations. Of these in their order, so far as the Text
shall lead us. And first a word only or two of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
for Audience. <hi>Audiamus, Let us hear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the truth is, every Man hath not an Ear apt in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for such Conclusions; nor can have, so long as it is
farced and stopt up with the filthy brood of their own
Corruptions. Indeed every Man hath an Ear, but not
an Ear to hear, at least not to hear all things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he utters such Points as these, <hi>He that hath
Ears to hear, let him hear,</hi> saith not <hi>Solomon,</hi> but our
Saviour himself. They are sad and sullen Duties, <hi>Fear
God, and keep his Commandments,</hi> and of an harsh
sound, as seeking to beat us from those delights, which
peradventure, we are not resolved as yet to forsake.
And then that which is distasteful to the mind, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prove over-pleasant to the Ear. Let us indeed seek
out delightful words, such as may comply with Mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
set our invention to hunt, like <hi>Esau,</hi> after Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>make Men savory meat, such as their Soul lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi>
with what Appetite doth the Ear presently fall to,
and how ready themselves (though couzened with a
Goat instead of Venison like blind <hi>Isaac</hi>) even to bles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
us for it? There needs no <hi>Audiamus,</hi> no Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Prefaces for attention here; it's Musick to their
itching Ears, and they suck it as the Ox doth water; but
precepts of Duty, and daies of Doom, or the like are
bitter Pills and will not down without gilding, though
<hi>Solomon</hi> himself be the Physician and Administer. His
very Person, yea but his Name, a Man would think
might be enough to prevail: <hi>Solomon</hi> the Wise! <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:46181:34"/>
the King! <hi>Solomon</hi> the Preacher! and all by way
of Supereminence, the Wisest of Men, the Royallist of
Kings, the most Excellent of Preachers; who shall not
attend unto him, and even hang <hi>narrantis ab ore,</hi> if
he but open his lips? And yet in such cases as these,
(though he well knew his own Wisdom and Power)
yet he is not so confident of his Authority and Person,
but thinks it well if he may gain hearing, though he
pray and exhort for it himself, and give himself too,
for an Example in it, become both Preacher and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,
not refusing to include himself in that Duty
which he doth urge upon others; for so it lyes, <hi>Let us
hear, &amp;c.</hi> It is the next way for our words to take,
when we require nothing of our hearers, but what
we our selves are as ready to do and perform; an easy
matter it is to bind heavy burthens for other mens
shoulders, but it is not so easy to perswade the people
to take them up to bear them, so long as the binders,
like those Pharisees in the Gospel, refuse to touch them
with the least of their Fingers. If we think to awaken
the World out of their dead sleeps, it will not be enough
to Crow unto others, unless withal we shall beat our
Wings too on our own sides. It will make a double
noise, and the likelier to pierce the Ear when it comes,
not with an <hi>Audite vos,</hi> or <hi>Audiant illi,</hi> do you
hear, or let them hear, but like <hi>Solomon</hi> in this place,
with an <hi>Audiamus nos,</hi> Let us be hearers as well as
speakers, especially in such Conclusions as this: <hi>Let us
hear the Conclusion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And sure it is something the likelier to be heard,
and regarded too, for that, were it nothing else, that
yet it is a Conclusion, a truth orderly drawn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from its undoubted principles; a discourse that
flutters not up and down at random, like a seeled
Dove, but flyes on to its period, like and Eagle to her
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46181:34"/>
stand, cutting its way through the vanity and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too of all things else, and not staying until it come
to pitch and rest it self on a Conclusion firm and stable,
even the Fear and Service of God; which as it is our
whole duty here, so will prove our happiness eternal
hereafter in that day, when God shall bring every work
into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good
or whether it be evil. And this shews it to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than a bare conclusion, a material one, of and
to the matter, indeed to that matter, which of all other
is most material. <hi>Let us hear the Conclusion of the whole
matter,</hi> &amp;c. And that certainly is one degree higher,
and would require too an higher degree of regard, that it
is not only an orderly Conclusion but a material and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant;
No curious, idle, frivolous dispute <hi>de lana ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prina,</hi>
no thin empty hungry speculation of the Schools,
though these be the only conclusions the delicate ears of
most Men desire to be tickled withal, such as may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
the wit, but no way affect the Conscience. And
indeed it is a principal Stratagem of the Arch-enemy of
Mankind by curious impertinences to divert the mind
from those real and necessary points that concern their
Souls, and the welfare of them for ever: An unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whereof these latter times have sufficiently tasted,
the Children of the Church for these many years imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their wits in nothing so willingly as in wrangling
with their Mother, and that about trifles, every light
Ceremony and almost Circumstance, that concerns but
the outward forms of the external worship of God, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
in the mean time that, which is indeed material,
the internal truth and substance of his service. But to
such wayward contentious spirits, I shall now only say,
it were much better for them to leave such unprofitable
disputes, and betake themselves to obedience, and if they
fear not God, yet at least that they would honour the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46181:35"/>
King, reverence the Church, and keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of both, for this is their duty too, and this indeed
would be to some purpose, that so they might be at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to set their working heads about some more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
questions, not about a Cap or a Surplice or the like,
but rather about such as are solid, such as that in the
Gospel, <hi>Quid faciendum? What shall I do that I
may inherit eternal life?</hi> and pursue it home, not leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
until they have brought it to <hi>Solomons</hi> Conclusion
here, <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments.</hi> For this
is the Conclusion of every material question, not only of
the matter, but the matter too of all Conclusions that are
material: For it is the Conclusion <hi>totius materiae,</hi> which
is our last degree, and the highest, as universal as mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
<hi>of the whole matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of what whole matter? of the matter of this whole
book? Yes of this and of all Books else, all Divine Books
else whatsoever; and so much we have here expresly in
the inference of it, <hi>of making many Books there is no
end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh,</hi> the verse
immediately precedent. And therefore that we might
have all in little he infers this, as briefly including the
whole matter, not only of this and those books that
were already written, but of all such also as should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
written hereafter.</p>
            <p>And sure all our discourses are but vain and empty, if
not impious, at least they will conclude nothing to the
purpose, unless they draw all at length unto this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which is every way total whether we regard know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or action: For when we have imbroiled and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
our selves in the pursuit of the things of this world,
it will be to no purpose, no though they succeed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our desires; For what shall it profit a Man to gain
the whole World, and enjoy it too for a season, if when
he hath done, he lose his own Soul afterwards for ever?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46181:35"/>
After all his vain labour spent, he will find this is the
only business and profitable imployment he must set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
down unto in the end. When we have entangled our
selves in all those fine and delicate webs of the Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Doctors, which when once we come within Ken of
the Port of Death, whither all winds serve to drive us,
will be swept away in an instant, like those of the Spider;
when I say all these aerial disputes are ended, this will
be found the only solid Conclusion, whereunto our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
must betake themselves at the last, as being the
last and utmost issue, end and upshot of all Conclusions
speculative or practick, to be done or to be studied, <hi>Fear
God and keep his Commandments.</hi> It is the whole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Man, rightly therefore the Conclusion of the whole
matter. So much doth <hi>Solomon</hi> magnify his plain and
despised text, that if it may not be received upon his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
request and example, it might yet be entertained
for its own worth, as being rightly drawn, material and
universal, that so the plainness of it might be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with the importance. This then for the urging of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is but right and just, and therefore <hi>Audiamus,
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.</hi> We can
do no less, and that we may do so, hear it indeed, we will
now pass from the Preface to the Conclusion it self, from
the Conclusion of the matter, to the matter of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
<hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments;</hi> but
we must begin with the first, <hi>Deum time, fear God,</hi> and
then <hi>keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And well do we begin here, at which all Religion,
Piety, and true Wisdom doth begin: So saith our own

               <hi>The fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom:</hi> But the Son
of <hi>Syrach</hi> goes farther, and makes it to begin and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

crown of wisdom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. i. 18</note> Indeed I scarce know any thing,
whereof more contrarieties seem to be delivered, than of
this fear of the Lord: Fear hath pain in it, and he that

               <note place="margin">1 Joh. iv. 18.</note> But what
saith <hi>Siracides; The fear of the Lord maketh a merry

               <note place="margin">Ecclus. i. 12</note> 
               <hi>Perfect love casteth
out fear,</hi> saith the same St. <hi>John</hi> in that place: Nay not
so, <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean and endureth for ever,</hi>
saith <hi>David.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. xix. 10</note> Again, <hi>Work out your salvation with fear
and trembling,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> unto the <hi>Philippians: Tou
have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear,</hi>
saith the same Apostle unto the <hi>Romans:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. viii.</note> what is this but
fear and fear not? yea what else saith our Saviour? <hi>Fear
not, little Flock, for it is your Fathers pleasure to give
you a Kingdom:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. x.</note> And yet <hi>fear him that can cast body
and Soul into Hell fire,</hi> saith our Saviour again unto the
same Flock: If assured of the Kingdom, what need they
fear the fire of Hell? and if they may fear that, how
assured of the Kingdom? Of necessity therefore, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
these seeming contradictions, Divines have been
driven to distinguish of fears and persons too, unto whom
they are appliable; For indeed all fear is not of one sort,
but is divers, according to the diversity of objects which
it respecteth: if it look upon secular and worldly evils
(for generally <hi>Timor est expectatio mali</hi>) and through
too much apprehension run into excess, it then takes the
name of <hi>Timor mundanus,</hi> a worldly and secular fear,
when men fear men more than God, temporary and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
evils, more than ghostly and eternal; And this
fear is always evil, and so are they ever in whom it hath
dominion; and when it hath not dominion, yet because
it hath undoubtedly in all, that are not perfect in love,
some greater hold than it should have, that of our Saviour
is but just, and for the most part seasonable unto all, <hi>Fear
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46181:36"/>
not those that can kill the body, but fear him that can
cast both body and soul into Hell fire.</hi> Again, if it look
upon God, and that Hell, which in his justice he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for sinners, as our Saviour here commands, the
fear indeed is then good, because as you see commanded,
and besides is an act of faith and restrains from evil; And
therefore they that simply condemn it, do but cut the
banks and pluck up hatches, the better to make way for
a deluge of wickedness: But yet if it rest there, and look
no farther; if our obedience have no better motive than
this, though the fear be good, it is not yet so good as
it should be, for the man is still evil, and his fear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so long but slavish, and so it is termed <hi>Timor servilis,</hi>
an illiberal and servile fear; And this is that fear which, as
St.<hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>hath pain in it,</hi> as curbing men in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
and we may add imperfection too, as not able to
sanctify their Persons: yet is it, as the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi>
speaks, the beginning of wisdom, and leads unto that
which is perfect; for by constant forbearance of evil,
though out of terrour, men may come at length to love
and delight in goodness, and then every degree of such
love casteth out a degree of that fear, till perfect love
at last casteth out all fear, all that is painful, but withal
induceth another fear, of another both name and nature,
<hi>Timor castus &amp; filialis,</hi> a chast and filial fear, the fear of
offence, not of punishment, a fear not only good in it
self, but such as makes the subject good too wherein it
resides. And this fear hath two Eyes, with the one it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
God, as the supream and Soveraign good not only
in himself, but of all those that adhere unto him, and
then loving him as such, they cannot but withal fear to
offend, or lose that God and goodness, which above all
things they love: But the other Eye fastens it self on
God, as no less great than good, and contemplating, as
well as it may, or as far as it dares, the Sanctity, Power,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46181:37"/>
and Immensity, the infinite Majesty and glory of the
divine Essence or Deity, is strucken with admiration and
adoration too of so great and inconceivable Excellence,
from whence it takes another denomination, and is stiled
<hi>Timor reverentialis,</hi> a devout and reverential fear. It
is true that the time will come, when even this filial fear
shall lose one of these lights, and be no whit the less
comely and beautiful for that neither: for as the filial
fear throws out that which is servile, so fruition will cast
out the first part of that which is filial. For being confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in goodness, there is no room for the fear, when there
is no danger of offending, or losing that God which we
enjoy. But this reverential fear is never thrown out by
any thing else, but is that fear whereof <hi>David</hi> spake;
<hi>The fear of the Lord is clean and endureth for ever.</hi>
It attends not on this life only, but runs it self into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;
the fear of blessed Angels now, and shall be
the fear of all holy Saints, as here, so in that blessedness
for ever hereafter: And then indeed it will be the fulness
of wisom, and the Crown both of it, and that fulness
also. But as on these several fears, so are we to look
on men too, and their several conditions, otherwise our
discourse will not be so real as rational: But yet
though these fears abstractedly considered, have their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
forms whereby they are differenced, and are in
supream degrees some of them incompatible; yet in the
concrete as they subsist in their subjects, they are not
usually in this life so intense and pure, but that, though
one be predominant, they are all three mixed for the most
part and compounded together. Whence it is, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, even the greatest Saints and Servants of God,
whose fear therefore filial, and founded in love, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
liable, through this body of death, unto frailties
and sometimes unto falls, are now and then found to be
sensible also of his wrath: Even <hi>David</hi> himself, whose
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46181:37"/>
Confidence otherwhiles can carry him through the valley
of death without fear, yet at other seasons is driven to
cry out, <hi>A Judiciis tuis timui, I was afraid of thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
yea from my youth up, thy terrours have I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
with a troubled mind.</hi> Holy <hi>Job,</hi> though a perfect
and upright man, by the mouth of God himself, yet not
so perfect in all his ways, and upright, but that we may
sometimes read these sad complaints. <hi>The Arrows of the
Almighty stick fast within me, the venont whereof drink
up my Spirits;</hi> and, <hi>Quid faciam, cum surrexerit ad ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandum
Deus?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job xxxi.</note> 
               <hi>And if it thus befal the green Trees,
how shall it fare with the dry?</hi> If such Worthies so
complain and cry out under the terrour of divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how shall we that are worse, dare to reject it, as
servile? Certainly he that doth so, doth withal take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for perfect in love, since perfect love alone it is, that
can cast out all fear that is painful. Presu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can do the like, cast it out too for a time, but will
undoubtedly bring great fears upon them in the end.
And therefore for such as grow high through the favours
of God, and more consident than their behaviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them can warrant, the Scriptures want not corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives
to beat down the proud flesh, and abate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
Spirit. <hi>Be not high minded but fear; yea
work out your Salvation with fear and trembling
also.</hi> But on the other side, where this fear and
trembling hath taken hold, and the humbled Soul
steeping it self in the sense and sorrow of her sins,
comes to labour under its own grief, in this Case there
wants not <hi>Balm in Gilead,</hi> neither Lenitives, nor Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
for the wounded Spirit; <hi>Ye have not received
the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of
Adoption, that cryes Abha Pater;</hi> and what is your
Fathers will? why, <hi>fear not little Flock, it is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will to give</hi> such for their sorrow now, <hi>a Kingdom</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:46181:38"/>
of joy hereafter, to wit, <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> if they run
not back again into those sins, for which they are so sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful.</p>
            <p>Thus the Scriptures are not contradictory, only they
suit divers fears with different properties, and contrary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
with as opposite exhortations, as is but just and
reasonable; To scatter the proud in their imaginations,
but to bind up and strengthen the broken-hearted. Now
as these fears, more or less, at one time or other pertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all, but to our gries, if not shame of Christianity are
scarce truly to be found in any; so are they all here in
my Text, not all generally only and in gross under the
name of fear, but with special intimations of all, and
each of them in several.</p>
            <p>For first, here is the worldly fear, but forbidden; as
negatives are ever under their affirmatives. <hi>Fear God,</hi>
not the world, or worldly evils which press only the
body, but that God which can cast both Body and Soul
into everlasting fire. Secondly, the very mention of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the first reason implies a superiority, and that ever
requires Reverence, another of the Fears; And when
duties are performed formally on that manner because
duties, and such, as in the breach whereof we know the
God, whom we love, is offended, it is the fear then of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
not of punishment: and both these make up the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
filial fear. But yet the fear of punishment is not left
out neither, as good in it self, though materially servile,
for that is a motive too, and as the least so the last of
all; <hi>For God will bring every work into judgment, &amp;c.</hi>
as it is in the next verse. So they are all joyned here in
the text, and when they are joyned too in man their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the ywill make up that compleat fear which indeed is
the full and compleat worship, internal worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God; And therefore in the Scripture, it is usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken even for our whole Religion, Piety and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46181:38"/>
of the Divinity, according to that of <hi>David, O
come hither, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord,</hi>
that is the worship of the Lord.<note place="margin">Psalm. xliii.</note> So <hi>Jonah</hi> unto the
Mariners that enquired of him, <hi>I am an Hebrew,</hi> saith
he, <hi>and I fear the God of heaven, and that made the Sea
and the dry land.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jon. i.</note> So <hi>Jacob</hi> in like manner when he
sware unto <hi>Laban,</hi> he swore by <hi>the fear of his Father
Isaac,</hi> to wit by that God whom his Father <hi>Isaac</hi> feared,
that is worshiped and served.<note place="margin">Gen. xxxi. 53.</note> Whence it is that what
<hi>Moses</hi> terms fear, <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God,</hi>
that the Septuagint, and our Saviour himself renders by
worship, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. vi.</note> And therefore we shall not need
to scruple much at the enquiry,<note place="margin">Matt. iv.</note> why the Text saith not
Believe or Love, or the like, but rather <hi>Fear God and
keep his Commndments;</hi> for he that hath said, Fear,
hath said all; no word can go beyond this: It includes
both faith, and hope, and love, and all, yea something
more than all. Not the meanest of these fears, the fear of
punishment, but implies faith, and the fear of offence both
faith and hope and love also; but the reverential fear is
love, and something more than love, even Veneration
too, as acknowledging the love to be, not like that of
ordinary friendships <hi>inter Pares,</hi> between Companions,
but at a distance, and such an infinite distance on Gods
part, as requires the lowest Reverence and Adoration
from all that love him. For though it hath pleased his
goodness to make and stile us his friends, yet I hope we
do not cease to be his servants, nor he to be our Lord,
every way our Supream and Soveraign Lord: So indeed
our Lips stile him at every word, and by that stile
and Title too he himself requires his fear at our hands;
<hi>if I be your Lord, ubi Timor meus, where is my fear?</hi>
Where indeed his fear of Reverence? for he is Lord of
Majesty and Glory. Where the fear of offence? for he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46181:39"/>
is the Lord no less good than glorious: and as terrible as
either, to his contemners; where then the fear of his
wrath? And sure the question is pertinent enough, and
it is but right that he demands, where it is, or what may
become of it? It seems to be fled with <hi>Astraea</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
sure I am, it may trouble a man to find it out any
where upon earth. <hi>His judgments are far off,</hi> as <hi>David</hi>
speaks, even out of our sight, at least they seem yet to be
beheld with such security, as a Man would think most
Men were in a league with death and at a Covenant with
Hell, as the Prophet speaks, so little fear is there of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:
And sure they that fear not punishment, will
hardly be restrained by any filial, the fear of offence.
Indeed it were something well, if we did not offend
with less trouble, than any thing else. And as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the fear of reverence, and that principally in the
holy place where his special presence hath made it espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
due, that is so far from regard, as it seems to have
gotten an ill name of late: we are grown some of us into
such a familiarity with God, as the reverence of his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
or of him in it, or any decency or dignity that
may serve thereunto is suspected now a days for an
out-work of Popery: God grant we do not make it
Idolatry too to reverence even God himself in his
Temple. Is not the question just then in these times also,
<hi>ubi timor meus?</hi> where is his fear indeed, where any
of his fears? sure they have all left this world, and it
seems left in it little but worldly fear behind them; That
indeed and that alone runs through the world, and only
prevails; For her we duck like Die-dappers at every
Pebble that is thrown at us by a powerful hand, and yet
can stand up sturdily, like <hi>Capaneus</hi> upon the walls of
<hi>Thebes,</hi> against the Thunderbolts of the Almighty; we
are become, as he said well, Gyants, yea even Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, but Slaves unto Men, whose Bodies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46181:39"/>
are sometimes equally rotten. The revenge of
the Law and shame of the world is for the most part all
our fear; so we may avoid these, save our goods from
loss, our names from disgrace, our skin from hurt, our
bodies from death, we can sin on merrily, it little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for him that can <hi>cast both body and soul into Hell
fire.</hi> This is the whole of most mens fears; but fear not
ye their fear, neither be afraid, but sanctify the Lord
himself, <hi>Is metus vester, is pavor esto,</hi> let him be your
fear, let him be your dread. But what then, is God only
to be feared and nothing besides?<note place="margin">Isa. viii. 12.</note> surely yes, God and not
any thing else, if any thing shall stand in competition or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
with God; but yet under God, and in subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto him, we are to fear God and others too for Gods
sake; <hi>And all the people feared exceedingly God,
and his servant Moses.</hi> So the Apostle, <hi>fear to whom
fear, and honour to whom honour appertaineth,</hi> and both
sure appertain to all Superiors, but eminently above all
to him that is Supream: Reverential fear, for he hath a
character of the Divinity upon him: Fear obediential,
and filial fear too, for he is <hi>Pater Patriae:</hi> And fear of his
wrath also for he is Gods Minister for vengeance. And
therefore fear the King, for he carrieth not the sword in
vain. Yea and I must tell you fear the Church too, and
those in the Church, that have power over us also, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of power indeed, but yet such as renders them
Gods Ministers in like manner, and your Ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and therefore will require in their degree obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and reverence too, yea and fear of their wrath also:
for they want it not for the wicked when occasions
serve, and therefore fear these too: for they carry not the
Keys in vain. The Powers that are, they are all of God,
and he that resisteth the power, whether Temporal or
Spiritual, resisteth the ordinance of God, and receiveth
damnation unto himself. It is true these are two distinct
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46181:40"/>
powers, yet is it as true also, they are not simply colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral,
but subordinate, ever subordinate when the Prince
is Christian, as having, though not all power in himself,
yet a Princely dominion over all Persons, and that in all
Causes whatsoever; neither is more claimed, and less can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied. For two Supremacies in a Kingdom are
no less inconsistent, than two Omnipotencies in the
world; And therefore the Apostle gives unto him uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
subjection, and conscientious too. <hi>Let every one,</hi>
yea <hi>omnis anima, let every soul be subject to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
powers.</hi> But however this Spiritual power be not col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
simply, but subordinate unto the Royal; yet is it
in regard of its original, and derivation, clearly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
as being not derivable into the Priesthood
from any Prince or Potentate upon earth, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from him who hath it written on his Garment, and
on his Thigh, <hi>The Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev,</note>
And being thus distinct without derivation, it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
the censures of the one should come forth in the
name of the other, but only indeed in Christs name and
in their own persons, who in this are the Ministers not of
the King, but of Christ, as exercising no part of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
belonging to the Sword, but only of those Keys, that
properly are their own, and underivable too from any
upon earth, but those of their own Order. However
therefore these powers are subordinate, yet two distinct
powers they are, and both as was said, immediately from
God, and both therefore to be feared of men. And sure
this latter, though the lesser, yet not a little to be feared
neither; for though the Kings Laws bind the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
yet his revenge for the breaches of them cannot
reach home unto the Soul: His Sword is material and can
but lash the Body, though so lash it, as sometimes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it from the Soul; but St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Sword is spiritual
and reacheth directly to the spirit, dividing the Soul
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46181:40"/>
not indeed from its own Body, but from the Church the
Body of Christ, and so from Christ too, the head of the
Body: a power therefore in it self no way contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it is Christs own, and he the more careful to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it from contempt, yea not it only, but the power
and person too of the meanest Priest amongst us: for that
of his concerns all, <hi>He that despiseth you, despiseth me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</hi>
But yet all this, were not that other Royal Power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
upon earth, I think would be of little force in
these days to preserve them from contempt, or confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
crushing confusion; For did not the Sword of the
Prince defend the Keys of the Priest, they might well
put them under their girdle, if not under the door and
be gone. But blessed be God, he that is the defender
of the Faith and Doctrine of the Church, in his Piety
and Princely Goodness is pleased to be the Defender al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of her Jurisdiction and Discipline. <hi>Et defensoribus
istis tempus eget,</hi> for otherwise the Antihierarchical of
these times and indeed Antimonarchical too, as not well
affecting any either Power or Prerogative but their
own, were it not for this, would soon level all by their
own Rule, that is level with the ground, lay all Power
Ecclesiastick and Honour too, like <hi>Davids,</hi> in the dust,
if not rubbish even Monasterial. But then they may do
well to think of another dust too, the dust of our heels,
which if but justly shaken, there is one that assures us
the sorrows of such Contemners will prove more insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable,
than those of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> in the day
of Judgment. It is but right therefore and well too, that
the Regal Power is the Superior, that so as it is the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
and Governour of the temporal, it might be also the
Protector of the spiritual, causing that fear and reverence
which is due unto both, to be paid also respectively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
either. Neither in requiring this unto them do we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46181:41"/>
divert from the right object of fear in my Text, for it
is but <hi>fear God</hi> still. For God himself hath in a sort Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Authority. He hath given them of his own power,
and imparted his very Name unto their Persons. <hi>I have
said ye are Gods, and ye are all sons of the most high;</hi> And
Gods indeed, not only by appellation, but in effect also,
for the great and universal benefit which they bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mankind; For were not Man thus made a God unto
Man, Men would soon become Wolves unto themselves
and devour one another. And therefore to fear such
Men, is not to fear Men, but God, since the fear is not
so much exhibited unto their naked persons as unto those
beams and participations of the Divinity wherewith they
are clothed. And in this sort, it is not amiss to say, that
God and not any thing else is to be feared; And indeed
he that thus fears God, he only fears nothing else;
though the waves of the Sea rage horribly, and though
the Hills of the Earth be carried into the midst of the
Sea, nay as the Poet, <hi>Si fractus illabatur orbis, Impavidum
ferient ruinae,</hi> though the whole world should disjoint
and fall, he would be buried in the ruines of it without
fear, for he fears none but God, and the offending of
that God whom he fears; That indeed he doth, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to obey him too, as well as fear him: and so we
must all, it is our Duty also, for so it follows: <hi>Fear God,
and keep his Commandments;</hi> the second Part of our
Conclusion, <hi>keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These two are inseparable ever, and it is but just, that
they are not here only, but so often joined together in
Scripture; <hi>The fear of the Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Wisdom,</hi> and he subjoins, <hi>but a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
have all they that do thereafter:</hi> So God
himself,<note place="margin">Job xxviii. 28.</note> as <hi>Job testifies, And unto man he said,</hi> as if it
were the product and total of all that is or may be said
unto him, <hi>the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46181:41"/>
depart from evil, that is understanding:</hi> The self same
in substance with <hi>Solomon</hi> here, <hi>Fear God and keep his
Commandments.</hi> Neither may it possibly be otherwise;
Nature hath linked them as close as Scripture; for no man
departs or can depart from the one, the Law of God,
that doth not first depart from the other, the Fear of God.
The soul and body of man have not a stricter union, than
these two, the one the body, the other the very soul of
the new and interiour man. And therefore the original
hath it <hi>col ha adam,</hi> for this is not the whole duty, but
the whole man, the whole spiritual man indeed: The
outward works of the Law are wrought by the body,
and such righteousness of the body is but the body of
righteousness; but the fear of the Lord sanctifies the
soul, and the righteousness of the soul is the very soul
of righteousness: And the spiritual man created in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and true righteousness must have both these parts
as well as the animal, a soul and a body too: Some
mens righteousness indeed is all body, do many things
good and commanded, but for ends upon by and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
respects: here is a Carcase of holiness, but no soul
to inform it, only hypocrisy inhabits and gives it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as the Devil sometimes, they say, doth the body
of a dead man: Others will be altogether Soul; Fear
God as much as you will, every man likes it well, and
thinks he doth it too, as well as any man: but bring
them to the Commandments, to the corporal works ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Charity to the distressed, or of bounty for the
publick honour and worship of that God, whom they
pretend to fear, and then they leave you; This they
begin to doubt whether it may be any part of their
duty or no: But however the soul of the old and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man may be immortal, though severed from the
body, yet is it not so with the new man: Sever the fear
of God, from the observance of his Commandments, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46181:42"/>
it will instantly cease to be fear. As St.<hi>John</hi> of love, so
may we say of this fear that includes it: <hi>He that saith he
feareth God, and keeps not his Commandments, is a liar.</hi>
Again, observe the Commandments but not in the true
fear of God, and it will be, not observance, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation;
A Liar this, of all Liars, whose hypocrisy can
make the very spirit of wickedness to inform and actuate
the comely limbs and members of true holiness. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
conjunction, and therefore a Monster detestable
both to God and man! It is but right then, and as it
should be that these two here, make but one whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
one whole duty, one whole matter, one whole
man. They may be distinguished, they may not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided:
God hath joined them together, and let no man
seek to put them asunder, but he that fears God, let him
keep his Commandments also.</p>
            <p>Keep his Commandments? <hi>durus est hic sermo,</hi> this is
an hard saying, and the world sure will be hardly brought
to this part of the conclusion, yea it were something well,
if those that seem purest amongst us, did not conclude
clean contrary; That the Commandments were not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to be kept, yea that there is no possibility for any
man, though under the state of grace, at any time, or
in any action to keep without violation even the least
Commandment.</p>
            <p>But two things there are, that seem especially to deceive
men in this point: First, an erroneous opinion, that a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
action cannot be good, so long as it may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
as having so much of sin, as it wants of absolute
perfection, which they suppose, the Law under the high
terms of eternal death doth require at every mans hands.
But this is apparently mistaken, for evident it is, that the
Law under the penalty enforceth only essential goodness,
not so, that, which is gradual, otherwise the holy Angels may
now sin in Heaven, for they excel one another as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46181:42"/>
so in their zeal and operations, yea he that is holier
than the Angels, Christ himself would be endangered, of
whom the Scriptures do plainly affirm, that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at one time more earnestly than at another; And
rightly, for goodness is not seated <hi>in puncto,</hi> in any precise
nick or indivisible Center, but hath its just latitude, and
is capable of degrees of comparison in the Concrete, <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
melior, optimus:</hi> So <hi>Priscian</hi> will instruct them with
this opinion, not admitting it hath false Latin in it, and
false Divinity both at once. This the first.</p>
            <p>The Second thing, is another supposal too, and little
less erroneous than the former. That in every good and
divine action the flesh lusting against the spirit, doth by
that malignant influence, corrupt and vitiate even with
sin the whole operation. But what if the lusting flesh
do not always move and in every action? What if when
it moves, it doth not yet enter into composition with
that act, that subdues and quells it? as indeed it doth
not: what if the vertue of such conquering acts be
the greater by the opposition? as indeed it is ever
the more excellent, by how much it breaks through
stronger resistance, according to that of our Saviour,
<hi>virtus mea in infirmitate perficitur.</hi> Lastly, what if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
act of lust it self be not in true propriety a Sin? As if
it be meerly natural, great Clerks conceive it is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
sin is ever voluntary and moral. They take it for
a true Rule, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Lex datur non appetitui sed voluntati,</hi>
and so they conceive our Saviour doth interpret it, when
he makes not every one whose flesh lusteth, but him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that lusteth in his heart, that is, with his will, to be
an Adulterer. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they suppose, follows his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
interpretation, and though no man doth define lust
more than he, yet he doth it with caution, as the sin, not
of the person, a subject properly not capable of sin, but
of the flesh: <hi>I know that in me,</hi> but with correction,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46181:43"/>
               <hi>that is, in my flesh, there is no good thing; It is no more
I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</hi> And that we
take it not for such a sin, as transgresseth the Law, he is
bold to say, that <hi>the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled
in those, that walk not after the flesh,</hi> not that have no
carnal motions, <hi>but after the Spirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> St. <hi>Austin</hi> therefore,
they conceive, said well, that when the appetite doth lust
but the will doth not like it, is as when <hi>Eve</hi> had eaten,
but not <hi>Adam.</hi> And as we sinned at the first, not in <hi>Eve,</hi>
but in <hi>Adam,</hi> so is it still; for unless <hi>Adam</hi> eat as well as
<hi>Eve,</hi> the will consent, as well as the appetite water, the
fall is not finished. The lusts therefore and appetites of
Nature, if they arise immediately out of the Body, and
be not raised by our unhappy fancy, which the Will sets
on work, or by some act or custom of Sin, which the
Will hath already wrought, they are not in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sinful, unless we will make God the Author of Sin
who is the creator of nature and natural appetites, yea
and Christ too the subject of sin, that was not without
a natural inclination directly opposite to the known will
of God, otherwise he could never have said as he doth,
<hi>not my will but thy will be done.</hi> No doubt but by
the lustings of the flesh, humane frailties and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more than enough may and do too often cleave like
moles and stains unto the divinest actions of the most spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
men; but a mole of frailty is one thing, and the
corruption of mortal-sin another. One thing <hi>claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care
in via,</hi> to go on though halting sometimes, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in the way to Heaven: and another to cross
out of it, run counter directly towards Hell. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from such surreptitious and involuntary defects to
conclude, that no man can love God with all his heart
(clean contrary to the testimonies of the Scripture, <hi>That
the just man falleth seven times a day,</hi> to wit into sin,
though that Scripture intend no such matter, that all his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46181:43"/>
righteousness is but a defiled rag, and the divinest acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the eye of the Law, but a mortal and deadly Sin),
is an exaggeration that doth but rack and tenter a truth
until it burst into two errors and dangerous ones, both in
Gods regard and mans. As if men were bound unto
meer impossibilities, and God, that hard man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
reaping where he doth not sow, and requiring a
law at their hands, to whom he gives no ability for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
In Gods name therefore and mans too, let us
be content to speak as the Scriptures do, which in this
here and more than a thousand places besides do seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
urge and necessarily require the observance of the
Law and keeping of the Commandments, which St. <hi>John</hi>
tells us, through the grace of Christ are not grievous nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Such as will needs speak otherwise, that they may
not be kept either for any time, or in any action, let
them take heed lest they open gates unto impiety, and
like those Spies in the 13 of <hi>Numbers</hi> discourage the
hearts, and weaken the hands of the people of God;
yea let them beware, lest they cast dishonour too as on
God himself, so especially on the blessed Spirit that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits,
and Christ Jesus our Lord that dwells in his Saints,
if all yet can produce in any, not any thing, but sins.
Much better therefore it were to leave disputing, and give
good ear to that of our Saviour, <hi>He that breaketh the
least of these Commandments, and teacheth others so
to do, shall be least in the kingdom of heaven;</hi> that is,
as some interpret, shall least of all others enter into that
Kingdom. For what is this indeed but to withdraw men
from their duty, and teach them disobedience? for even
duties cease to be due, whensoever they begin not to be
possible. But this is every mans constant duty, and the
whole duty of every man, the invincible reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Solomon</hi> here backs his conclusion, and withal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
this opinion. <hi>Fear God, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for this is,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:46181:44"/>
The Reason is strong and full: three degrees or ascents
there are in it. First a Duty, and Secondly universally
of all men, the duty of man and mans universal duty,
and Thirdly the whole duty of man; And though there
be diverse inventions sought out, many turns and wren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
made to slip this duty, yet one of these three or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will meet with and refel all our devices: For they
that scruple at the conclusion as impossible, evince that
they will not stay there, but be as apt to quarrel with the
duty at least, as not simply necessary; a duty peradventure
in the rigid exaction of the Law, and of such as are
under it, as they were to whom <hi>Solomon</hi> spake this; but
we are under the Gospel, dead unto the Law, that we
might be married unto one, even to Christ our Lord
and our life; what then hath this legal duty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
to do with us, or we with it, since we are
mutually dead one to another?</p>
            <p>Yet be we under what times we will, or states either;
so long as we lose not our humanity, so long as we cease
not to be men under any, as being not really dead, but
morally, so long it will have to do with us, for this is a
duty not of some times and persons, but universally of man.</p>
            <p>Neither were they simply under the Law, to whom
this was spoken; led indeed they were by the oeconomy
of the Law, but yet under the promise and promised seed,
and were saved by the Gospel, as we now are, though
the Gospel not so distinctly believed then, as now it is;
Neither indeed they, nor any people else under Heaven,
since that promise <hi>(The seed of the woman shall bruise
the serpents head)</hi> are so meerly under the Law either
of <hi>Moses,</hi> or Nature, but that if they do their duty, keep
the Commandments which they have, and glorify God
according to their knowledge, they may (for ought I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand)
be saved too by the Gospel, which they knew
not, for even the Gentiles so doing, their incircumcision
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46181:44"/>
shall be counted for circumcision, as the circumcision o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
is esteemed but as incircumcision. <hi>In that day,
when God shall judge the secrets of all hearts,</hi> not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
by the Law, but <hi>according to my Gospel,</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. And indeed this is the only reason, why
this duty continues still to bind, because men are not
under the Law simply, but under the Gospel; for that is
the state only of Devils, whose doom is sealed: and
though the law of their nature cannot be abrogated, as
being a branch of eternal equity, yet they seem not to be
lyable unto any mens punishment, for the breaches of it
now, because not capable of any reward for the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
The Gospel therefore doth not evacuate, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, but establish the Law, since every man is
therefore bound in duty unto the Law because not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
excluded from all benefit of the Gospel; But we
who are under the fulness of this Gospel, are in a fuller
manner tied and in an higher degree unto the observance
of the law, than any people else before that fulness came,
as being bound now by the special coming of the Holy
Ghost to keep the Commandments <hi>not in the oldness of
the letter,</hi> which as it seems was sufficient, whilst the
Heir was but a Child and in minority; <hi>but in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Spirit;</hi> for the Spirit it is which gives life and
vigour unto the Commandments, as being the very
strength and power of all lively performance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour though he came with Gospel in his
mouth, yea was the Gospel himself, yet <hi>think not,</hi> saith
he, <hi>that I came to dissolve the law: I came not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
but to fulfil it.</hi> And that we may know, the true
fulfilling of it, if we think to enter into life, belongs to
us, as well as the entire and perpetual unto himself, after
he had vindicated the Text of the Law from the corrupt
glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees, and set it forth in the
highest perfection, if not added perfections above the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46181:45"/>
Law, and beyond that which was said unto them of old,
he closeth up all at last with this conclusion, <hi>He that
heareth these sayings of mine, and doth them, I will
liken him unto a wise man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 24.</note> What then, though being
dead under the law, we become through the favour of
the Gospel to be dead also even unto the law, yet it is
but to the condemning power, the killing letter of the
law, that so we might be married unto Christ our life,
since the end of this marriage is but to bring forth fruit
unto God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place, and that <hi>in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the spirit,</hi> which is not sure to break but to keep
with more exactness the Commandments of God. This
therefore a duty still, the duty of Jew and Gentile and
Christian too, universally of all mankind. <hi>For this is
the whole duty of man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But though a duty, not only in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, but
even now under the Gospel, yet for all that, it may be
but a voluntary duty, a freewill offering indeed of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and gratitude, or so, but not a necessary duty,
necessary unto life: Our life in this World is our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in Christ, and Christ and justification too we
have them both by faith, and by faith alone without the
works of the Law:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us. But however
a duty it is and a necessary duty, necessary even to life,
unless no duty be necessary, or <hi>Solomon</hi> here be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>For this is the whole duty of man.</hi> Justification in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is that act of God, which by remission of Sins
through Christ puts men into the state of Life here, and
gives them right and title unto Life eternal hereafter.
And though therefore an estate attainable by the Gospel
only not by the Law, which all have transgressed, yet is
it most true, that so long as any shall continue wittingly
and deliberately to transgress the Law, they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of this or any other benefit of the Gospel: The
Gospel it self and whole Scriptures are clear in the point;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46181:45"/>
               <hi>Now then,</hi> saith even St. <hi>Paul,</hi> on whom they rely, speaking
of the time of the Gospel, <hi>now then there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
and no condemnation is full justification, but to
whom? <hi>to them that are in Christ Jesus,</hi> but who are
they that follow? <hi>which walk not after the flesh but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the spirit;</hi> If any man walk otherwise, he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with Christ: <hi>If we say we have Communion
with him, and walk in darkness, we lye,</hi> saith St. <hi>John,
and do not the truth,</hi> 1 John i. 6. <hi>He that loveth not
his Brother,</hi> that is one of those, that according to him
walks in darkness; and as he wants light, so life too, he
hath no life abiding in him, yea <hi>manet in morte,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in death, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 14. And what is said of one Sinner,
is true of all, <hi>for be not deceived, neither Fornicator,
Adulterer, unclean person, or covetous,</hi> or any other the
like, <hi>hath any inheritance in the kingdom of God and of
Christ.</hi> As little therefore in justification which is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of life, and hath right to that inheritance; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
therefore, if St. <hi>James</hi> be bold to conclude in terms
clean contrary, <hi>Ye see then, that by works a man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
and not by faith only,</hi> James ii. 24. Indeed much
stir hath been about the seeming differences between
these Apostles: He said not amiss, <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum</hi> are
the common Barrators of the world, and Faith and
Works seem no less to have broken the peace in the
Church. The points have been beaten so long, as some
think it time now they were beaten even out of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
But the truth is, they are some of the noblest that
our Faith doth yield, and unto the Christian Religion
of all other most essential though most abused, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the necessity of the Gospel and invalidity of
the Law, with the main differences and union too of both
Law and Gospel; And peradventure are not driven so
home as they might be unless by very few, unto their
just and right issue even unto this day. If any thing lead
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46181:46"/>
the way unto that, it must be the perfect reconciliation
of these two, which by divers ways and distinctions hath
been attempted on either side, but not I suppose with so
good success as may fully satisfy; for in this, I take it, <hi>Iliacos,
intra muros peccalur &amp; extra.</hi> To distinguish of the
Law Ceremonial and Moral, as some do, supposing that
St. <hi>Paul</hi> excludes the works of the Ceremonial Law, and
St. <hi>James</hi> requires those only of the Moral, is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
for clear it is, as the Sun, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> excludes
both, for he disputes against Jew and Gentile, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the works of the Moral Law, as that which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by all, and therefore cannot justify any. Neither will
it be more available to distinguish with others of works
preceeding faith, works of Nature, and such as follow,
and are effects of faith, works of Renovation and grace:
for St. <hi>Paul</hi> utterly rejects from the ability of justifying, all
works whatsoever, whether before faith or after it, because
the Law being once broken, no after-observance can so
satisfy for the breach, but that it will still condemn all
those that shall stand at that Tribunal. The distinction
then of works not prevailing, others fall to distinguish
of justification, and indeed that is the right way, if it be
rightly done: The <hi>Romanists</hi> according to the Council
of <hi>Trent</hi> make it twofold, a first, and a second justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
From the first St. <hi>Paul</hi> removes works, and St.
<hi>James</hi> they suppose, requires them only to the second:
But they are frustrate in both distinction and application
too; for since their second Justification is but the increase
and augmentation of that Righteousness which is infused
in the first, they cannot be two justifications, since more
or less will not afford a specifick difference, or numerical
either: And were they two, yet the works which St. <hi>James</hi>
requires, he requires for necessary unto the first justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
as well as the second; for he doth instance in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bab</hi>
not justified before, by their own confession: And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46181:46"/>
the works which St. <hi>Paul</hi> removes, he removes from the
second justification as well as the first, as first or last ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be found in any. And therefore he makes his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was justified long before even
that time of his instance. The distinction of justification
in the obtaining, and of justification already obtained is
much after the same manner, and is choked utterly with
the self same answer. Others on the other side distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<hi>Justus factus,</hi> from <hi>Justus declaratus,</hi> of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before God, and justification in the Eyes of men;
St. <hi>James's</hi> words they refer unto this, and St. <hi>Paul's</hi> to the
former, but most erroneously also; for nothing is plainer
than that both of them speak of justification in the sight
of God, St. <hi>James</hi> as well as St <hi>Paul;</hi> for he plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
salvation unto faith, if not accompanied with works,
with an interrogation, <hi>Can thy faith save thee?</hi> and
proves too, that it cannot, as being a dead faith, and the
faith of Devils, and such sure can justify neither with
God nor man, sooner indeed with men, than with God.
That way therefore which is most general and hath been
thought the best peradventure, because the subtlest, is to
distinguish between the act of justifying, and the Subject
or Person to be justified: St. <hi>James,</hi> as is supposed,
requiring only the presence of works in the Subject,
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> removes only from the Act, and is but
thus, in other terms. <hi>Fides sola justificat, sed fides quae
justificat, non est sola.</hi> This may have a promising look,
but will not satisfy neither, but is out too, and that on both
sides, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly removes the works he speaks of,
from the Person to be justified, as well as from the act
that doth justifie, <hi>non operanti</hi> to him that worketh not,
but believeth on him, <hi>qui justificat impium,</hi> that justifieth
the ungodly: And St. <hi>James</hi> requires the works he speaks
of, no less than faith, unto the Act, as well as in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
His words are express, <hi>ex operibus, by works a</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:46181:47"/>
               <hi>man is justified, and not by faith only.</hi> Why, but how
then shall they be reconciled? surely no way so well, as by
looking unto their different intentions, from whence it will
appear, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> removes works, all works from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the things that do justifie; and St. <hi>James</hi> requires
them only, as conditions and qualifications upon which
we are justified: For the purpose of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is by the
breach of the Law, to demonstrate the necessity of the
Gospel, that that only is the power of God unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for since all the world stands culpable before God,
it follows of necessity, that either we must perish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remedy, or else be justified by a Gospel of mercy,
which he well terms <hi>the justification of faith</hi> in meer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to works, all works, even faith it self, as the
things which may be thought to justify. Now St. <hi>James</hi>
intent is only to vindicate this wholsom and necessary
Doctrine from the abuse of Heretical Spirits, whose evil
words had at once corrupted both St. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning and
their own good manners, affirming, that since works
could not justifie, no works were necessary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it mattered little to observe the Law, it was enough
only to believe the Gospel. Against these dissolute Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
this Apostle, as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> observes, wholly directs
his dispute, the purpose whereof is, not to place justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in the works of the Law (for <hi>in many things,</hi> saith
he, <hi>we offend all, and if but in one, yet are we guilty of
the whole</hi>) but only to shew, that unless the works of
the Law, though formerly broken, do come at length to
accompany our faith, we can never be justified by
any grace of the Gospel. So then if we divide rightly
according to these intents, we must distinguish of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
justification, by Innocence, and by Pardon; for it
must be either by works, or by mercy, a legal justification
or an Evangelical: And of two sorts of works subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
unto these several justifications, and of two sorts of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46181:47"/>
ways by which they do justify, Works of Perfection and
perpetual perfection, that inherently justifie, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
in strictness of Law, but are excluded by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as
no where found in any; and works of Renovation after
the breach of the Law, required by St. <hi>James</hi> in every
one, that expect the justification of the Gospel: Those
works perfectly keep the Law, and never break it; These
keep the Law sincerely, but after it is broken: They justifie
therefore in themselves, and by their own worth; These
not so, but because found in none but sinners, prepare
only and qualifie for the justification of Christ: They
justifie, these obtain justification: That strictly the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of works, this properly the justification of faith,
which is their fountain. And faith alone, alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these may justifie, yea cannot justifie with them; for
such works evacuate faith, as not needing it, which is
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine. But faith alone without these cannot
justifie, yea without them is not faith, not a true and a
living faith, which is St. <hi>James</hi> his assertion. And in this
Reconcilation doth appear the reconciliation and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
too of both Law and Gospel, Faith and works,
how they conspire and meet, how they jar and refuse to
mingle. For the justification of the Law evacuates
Christ, who then <hi>died in vain,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. For
there needs no Saviour where there is no sin; And the
justification of Christ disanulls again that of the Law, as
arguing it to be broken, yea and the condemnation of the
Law too, notwithstanding the breach: So they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
and dissolve one another; But what the Gospel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
by remission of sins, it closeth withal again by
the manner of remitting: Never pardoning offences, till
they be first forsaken, and men return again to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of the Law; nor yet continuing that pardon
longer, than they shall continue to observe it, saying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
none but the penitent, <hi>Thy sins are forgiventhee;</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:46181:48"/>
nor yet unto them without saying also, <hi>Sin no more lest
a worse thing happen unto thee.</hi> So the terms stand thus;
No condemnation from the Law though broken, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we return to observe it; and until we do observe
it, no grace or mercy by the Gospel: and so they meet
and are reconciled; For so far the Gospel doth establish
the Law, yea and farther, for it not only requires, but
gives grace, for the performance of that it doth require,
even the observance of the Law. And this reconciliation
St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, the great urger of the opposition, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where doth acknowledge, for they are his own words,
<hi>not the hearers but the doers of the law shall be justified.</hi>
And that the law is done by faith is evident, <hi>for faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by love, and love is the fulfilling of the law.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
are both met, St. <hi>James</hi> requires Faith and Works,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> a working Faith, working by love, and that even
all the Commandments of God, not so as to justifie in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but only to qualify for the justification of Christ. The
Commandments therefore are no freewill offering at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
no voluntary duty of gratitude only, but a duty
necessary unto our justification here, and eternal well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
if any be necessary. <hi>For this is the whole duty of
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> Why, but yet (for there is no end of wrangling,
though this wrangle shall end all) though a duty now,
and a necessary, yet since the Gospel affords a Mediator,
were it never so due, the debt we hope may be paid by
another, that is our Surety, and that surety is Christ,
who hath exactly kept the Law, and is made unto us <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Justice, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> so saith
the Apostle. But no surety in this kind. That which
is the duty of Man, is every Mans own duty, and must
be performed in his own Person. True indeed it is, Christ
our Lord fulfilled the Law exactly, but that we may
break it in our selves, and yet at the same time fulfil it in
him that is our Mediator, this I take it, is not so true.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46181:48"/>
The Apostle saith indeed, that <hi>he accounted all things
loss and dung too, that he might be found in Christ,
not having his own righteousness, which is of the Law,
but the righteousness which is of God by faith.</hi> Yea far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>that God made him to be sin for us, that knew
no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
in him;</hi> but yet this righteousness of God is not to be
taken for Gods own righteousness, but only as he said
in the former place, for <hi>the righteousness which is of God
by Faith;</hi> which righteousness includes both justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is imputative, and sanctification, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent;
but yet neither in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> sence, is our own,
because not of the Law, but of grace and mercy by the
faith of Christ. Be it then, that Christ is made unto us Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Sanctification both, yea Wisdom and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
also, yet not all after one and the same manner: Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
he is made, because he hath revealed his Fathers
will: Redemption, because he hath appointed a day to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
his Children out of the hands of corruption into
liberty, which is glorious: Justice, because he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up himself a Sacrifice for sin; but Sanctification,
because he hath given us his Spirit. Christ therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, is all these, but yet not all these by imputation,
for then his Wisdom should be imputed too, yea and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the redemption of our bodies from the grave impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
also. Indeed we can dream willingly of nothing
but imputation. All seems nothing worth unless Christ
did so do all for us, as we may not have any thing to do
for our selves. I doubt we may come in time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that he did believe and repent for us too, for these
are his Commandments, and so believe only this, that
neither Faith nor Repentance are in our persons necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For if Christ as a surety hath absolutely undertaken
any thing for us, we like the scape-Goat must go free up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46181:49"/>
his performance; The same debt may not with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
be required of the surety and principal too; if so,
then do what we list, all things are done to our hands
already; O this were to be a gracious Saviour to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
if we might take our pleasure, ryot in Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Luxury, and withal have his Abstinence and
Moderation imputed to us, be beheld of God at the time,
as no less Temperate and Chaste than Christ himself; Were
it not glad tidings, a Gospel indeed, that we might be
Feasting, Carousing, Swearing, Drinking, and yet under
the eye of God at the same instant, as if we were Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Fasting, Praying, Weeping even with Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Garden? As though God beheld Men through
Christ, as Men do other things, by a perspective, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth
them to the Eye not in their own colours, but
in the colour of the glass they pass through. No, God is
not deceived with shadows, neither doth Christ cast any
such: He takes not good for evil, nor yet evil, no not for
Christs sake, ever for good: And let not us be deceived
with vain shews neither; The truth is, it is well, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Repentance we are justified by imputation, we
shall be too putative, if we conceipt an imputed sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
too: for two such imputations will not well agree
together; one of them will be needless ever or impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for justification, that is, remission of sins is it self suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
without imputation of farther sanctity, because as
St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath it, <hi>Omnia ut fact a deputantur, quando
quod factum non est ignoscitur;</hi> And perfect sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
imputed on the other side, will leave no room for
remission or imputative justification: so Christs death
might have been spared, since we should then be saved by
his life; for what use may there be of his blood for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
so long as beheld in his righteousness, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sinned? If no sinner, he needs no pardon; if he need a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46181:49"/>
pardon, he must of necessity be beheld as a sinner, and
therefore Remission of sins and perfect Righteousness are
opposite forms that cannot at the same time possibly be
imputed unto the same person, for they expel and shut
out one another. Let it suffice then, that our blessed Lord
vouchsafed to shed his blood for our sins, let us not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suppose that we are not bound to forsake them ourselves;
that were to shed his blood afresh and crucifie
him again, as the Apostle speaks. But as he did that for us,
which if we neglect it not, will prove our justification;
so we through his assistance must do this for our selves,
otherwise we shall want our sanctification, and wanting
it, want the other also: That indeed is the meer act of
God, but on those that are qualified for it: This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from God and his grace, but is the true duty of
man, and which gives him his qualification, and in man
therefore it must inhere; for the righteousness of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is perfect, but not inherent, but the righteousness
of sanctification now inherent but not perfect, hereafter
in that glory, whither it leads us, it will be both perfect
and inherent, yea inherent, perfect and perpetual also.
Rightly therefore to conclude all this righteousness of the
Commandments, the duty of man still, and since Faith is
included in it, as being now commanded, as rightly <hi>the
whole duty of man:</hi> That duty which doth accomplish
his election; <hi>for if any man purge him self from these
things, he shall be a vessel unto honour;</hi> fulfils the end
of his Creation, <hi>created unto good works, that we
might walk therein;</hi> makes effectual the Divine Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for <hi>we are called unto holiness;</hi> is it self our san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
for <hi>the Commandment is holy and just and
good;</hi> procures our justification, <hi>they wrought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and gained the promises;</hi> and lastly leads into
Glory, for <hi>they that have their fruit in holiness, have</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:46181:50"/>
               <hi>their end, everlasting life.</hi> That fruit here, this blessed
end hereafter, the God of Glory grant unto us all in
his Kingdom, even for Jesus Christ his sake the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

            <p>In the verses precedent, <hi>What shall it profit a man</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>to gain the whole world and lose his own

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi>
As if he had said, Gain any man what he list or what he
can, be it never so much (for the world indeed runs all
after gain and never enough) yet if by this means he come
at last to lose his own Soul, there is no profit in it. He
will still be a loser by his gain. Or on the other side, lose
in this life whatsoever he hath, or may lose, Pleasures,
Profits, Honours or any thing else, even Life it self, yet
if in the loss of all other things, he may preserve and
gain his own Soul, he will be a winner even in his losings.
To keep his Soul, he can part with nothing that is too
dear, or if he would part with his Soul, he can receive
nothing that is dear enough: for what can either way be
of sufficient value to make a just exchange for the Soul?
But yet so it is, small things are given in exchange for
great, and according to the momentany works and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of men here, so shall their Souls be gained or lost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
hereafter. <hi>For the son of man, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The points lie in the same order, as the words do in
the Text, and therefore I shall handle them without any
material transposition, beginning first with the Person,
that here speaks this of himself, and his appellation, <hi>fillus
hominis, The son of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that was both God and Man, may stile himself as
he please by either; but yet our blessed Lord (whether
to intimate his love unto our whole kind, or to instruct
us in the imitation of his humility) usually makes choice
of the meanest of his Titles, and though the Son of God,
yet seldom or never speaks of himself, but in the Stile
and Title <hi>Filii hominis, of the Son of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet as he assumes it, it is no vulgar or common stile
neither: for he assumes it with a difference and distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from all other the Sons of men whatsoever: for it is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The or That son of Man; the son of
Man after such a special and eminent manner, as will
make it a peculiar title, an Attribute proper only unto
himself and applyable unto no other. As for our selves,
we are all <hi>Filii hominum,</hi> Sons of Men indeed, in the
plural, he only in the singular, and therefore he only
singularly, <hi>Filius hominis,</hi> the Son of man. <hi>Homo</hi> hath
both genders, and here in the right sence it is only fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine,
and <hi>Filius hominis,</hi> no more than <hi>semen Muli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eris,</hi>
the Son of man, than the seed of the Woman the
Son of the she-man; for Son of man but in this regard he
was not, as being that mighty stone in <hi>Daniel,</hi> cut out
of the mountain without hands, and <hi>flos campi,</hi> the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
not of the Garden but of the field, growing up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
setting: for he, who as the Son of God, had a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but no Mother; as the Son of man, had a Mother,
but without any Father, and therefore by the Mothers
side only <hi>Filius hominis,</hi> the Son of Man. There was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46181:52"/>
indeed a woman once, that was <hi>filia hominis; Eve</hi> taken
out of <hi>Adam,</hi> without the help of woman; as Christ
our Lord <hi>filius hominis,</hi> taken out of woman without
the assistance of man. And as <hi>Eve</hi> the daughter of man,
was both daughter and wife unto her own Father: So
Christ the Son of Man, was both son and husband unto his
own mother: And being Son unto that Mother, in Her he
was the Son of her Ancestors, of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>
and others, but not otherwise; for no descendant from
them, or any other was ever or might be his natural and
immediate Father. Of necessity, therefore, the Son of
Man can be no more, than the Son of the blessed Virgin,
that is, the son of a woman: And however in relation
unto God, Christ though both God and man, may not
have two son-ships, the one as man the other as God, as
God, the natural, and as man, the adopted, because the
Relation of a Son adheres not to the Nature, but to the
Person, and so having but one Person cannot have two
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iliations: yet nothing doth hinder but that in reference
unto some other, this whole Person, though the Son of
God, may rightly be termed the Son of Man also. For when
the Son of God vouchsafed not to abhor the Virgins womb,
he then received a new Relation, and being brought forth
into the world, though otherwise the Son of God, he
now became really the son of a woman, and she that
brought him forth as truly <hi>Deipara,</hi> the very Mother of
God. In regard whereof St. <hi>Peter</hi> being demanded by
our Saviour, <hi>who do men say, that I the Son of man,

man art the Son of the ever-living God;</hi> Two Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
and but one Person, but in regard of two several
relations, and that unto two several Persons: The prime
Article This of our Faith, and foundation of that Church,
against which the gates of Hell shall never prevail. The Son
of God then, and the Son of Man too: The Son of Man
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46181:52"/>
he was here, before he went hence, and as the Son of Man
he shall return again. For so it follows in the second place,
<hi>Filius hominis venturus est, The Son of Man shall come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And come indeed he shall, nothing more sure; but
the <hi>when,</hi> the Time of his Coming, than that nothing
more uncertain. And therefore without all limitation is
doubtfully delivered here, and indefinitely, only with a
<hi>venturus est,</hi> He shall come, and no more.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour would have all men stand upon their
guard, be vigilant and watchful for that hour, have their
Loyns ever girt and their Oyle always ready in their
Lamps; for that cry at midnight may come at unawares,
and for this reason he would have men aware of it.
That it cannot be long hence indeed, he hath given suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
warning, shewn it clear unto all. For a thousand
years it is and six hundred since it was said, These are the
last times, yea <hi>Horae novissima,</hi> the last hour, and <hi>Judex
prae foribus,</hi> the Judge is at the doors; and that Judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the last of the Revelation, <hi>Ecce venio citò, behold
I come quickly, and my reward is with me:</hi> but how
much time this <hi>Quickly</hi> hath in it, how near or far off
it may be, this he hath not shown unto any, yea hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to shew unto his own, though desired by his own
Apostles: But keeps it as a secret, reserved unto himself,
and to be reserved for ever in his own bosom: The Angels
in Heaven understand it not, yea the Son of man himself,
that is to come as the Son of man only, that is in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, he doth not, he cannot discover the time of
his coming. How vain then are the endeavours and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
of all other impotent and ignorant men? And yet
mans busy head must needs be working; nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
his curiosity from prying at least, and though he
cannot possibly affrm any thing for certain, yet he will
be old to deliver his conjecture. And conjectures indeed
there have been many, but all no less temerarious than
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46181:53"/>
vain. The Astrologian, and the Philosopher will needs
have it fall out just in the fatal period of the great Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick
year; when all the Sphears and Stars fixt and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
shall return again unto their first points and positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherewith they were originally aspected: But a
Platonick year (were any such possible) would sooner be
spent, I suppose, than these wise men agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when and what time this great Revolution will be
finished: This atempt therefore as rash and vain, so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
also. The Modern <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Talmudists</hi> seem
to go upon better grounds, and with them some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as <hi>Lactantius</hi> and others, these all resolve the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
for certain, the latter in a strong opinion upon six
thousand years for the worlds continuance, two thousand
under the Law of Nature, two thousand under that of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and two thousand under the Gospel of Grace:
And that these once expired, the son of man then comes
without fail in the glory of the Father. And the truth is,
they have some shews of reason and pretty congruities to
countenance their divinations: Some of the Rabbies by
their Cabal learning have found this out even in the first
verse of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where <hi>Alpha,</hi> the first of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Alphabet, and the Numerical letter that denotes the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thousand, is just (as they observe) six times written:
That so the worlds Age and dissolution might be mysterious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read in the very front and forehead of the worlds Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which in the Creation it self, and the manner of it, is,
they suppose, much more legible, as farther typed out, and
more fully discovered. For in six days, it pleased God to
create the Heaven and the Earth and all that is therein, and
on the seventh day he rested: And to shew that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
mans continuance of Travel in this world, God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
commanded him also six days to labour, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the seventh for a Sabbath, the figure of Eternal rest
in the Heavens: now <hi>mille anni coram Deo, sicut dies</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:46181:53"/>
               <hi>una, A thousand years with the Lord are but as one day,</hi>
one day therefore in signification here, as a thousand
years; And the self same, they would have yet farther
insinuated in the first Patriots and Progenitors of this
new-born world, <hi>Generis humani satores,</hi> the first
storers of the Earth with Mankind: six succeded one
another in order, and then died: <hi>Adam, Seth, Enos,
Cainan, Mahalaleel,</hi> and <hi>Jared;</hi> but <hi>Enoch</hi> the seventh
from <hi>Adam</hi> was translated, taken up to walk with God,
as the type and figure of all his Children. To these,
others add divers other sutable instances.<note place="margin">Gen. viii. 4.</note> That the <hi>Ark</hi>
of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Type of the Militant Church, floated six
Months on the Waters, and that in the seventh it rested
on the mountain. That <hi>Moses</hi> six days was in the Cloud,
and in the seventh was called unto the prefence of the

just as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were going off the Wilderness to
possess their promised Land.<note place="margin">Josh. vi. 16.</note> Some more yet there are
to this purpose, but of another strain, and fetcht some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
farther. There be, that fish for it out of the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
years given to the old world for amendment, before
the coming of the Flood, which though in that regard
literally meant, yet in a mystery these, say they, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
as many great years, or years Mosaical, and Jubilar,
every one whereof contained fifty of the common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and then fifty drawn on six-score, every score pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
a thousand, the product that results from the whole
must needs be just six thousand years, the general space
they conceive for the repentance of the whole world,
before the coming of the second deluge, <hi>diluvium ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
that deluge of Fire. The same these Men collect
likewife from the life of <hi>Moses,</hi> who lived precisely a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46181:54"/>
hundred and twenty years, forty years in the Court of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
which answers, as they would have it, unto two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years under Nature; forty years in the Desart with
<hi>Jethro,</hi> keeping Sheep on the backside of <hi>Horeb,</hi> which
responds unto two thousand under the Law given in that
Mountain; and forty years in the wilderness governing
the people of God, and leading them on unto their Land
of rest, which design the other two thousand under the
conduct and Kingdom of Christ our Lord, who, when
these shall be once elapsed and spent, will come again and
deliver up the Kingdom unto his Father. So some; But
<hi>Lactantius</hi> and others otherwise, That he shall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
at the end of six thousand years, but the end for all
that, is not yet: For he shall spend, they suppose, a thousand
years in a kingdom of Righteousness upon Earth, as a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Sabbath from sin, which first kept, they shall then pass
into that great and eternal Sabbath of Glory even for ever.</p>
            <p>These may be pretty Speculations (to say no worse of
them) but they cannot conclude any thing: They are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than what that learned man tearms them, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta,
quibus malignus ille humana detinet ingenia:</hi>
something indeed they have of wit, much of curiosity, but
of certainty nothing at all. For suppose the conjecture true,
were six thousand years as they would have it, the full
period of the Worlds age, yet what could certainly be
discovered from thence, when the different Calculators
themselves are at a fault, or rather an unrecoverable loss
concerning the just age of the world, and how much of
it is spent already? But what need such computations?

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46181:54"/>
with such a check refused to reveal, why should any other
the sons of men dare presume to search, or think to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover?
But such are the cross, and preposterous ways of
perverse Mortals, ever attempting to know, where they
are enjoyned to be ignorant; and there for the most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
ignorance, where God most requires their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Otherwise we might find other computations, much
fitter to be busyed in; forbear counting of the Times,
and think rather upon that, <hi>Redde rationem Vilicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi>
how we may make up our own Accounts against

nor These peradventure their Computations: For as it was
in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> men eat and drank and married
securely until the Flood came and carried all away: So
saith he himself, will it be at the coming of the Son of
man, who will come as a sweeping deluge indeed, yea
much more unresistable, <hi>For he shall come in power, and
Majesty, and great glory, even in</hi> gloria Patris. Our
third Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father.</hi>
For though the time of his coming be concealed, yet
not so the manner of it, That indeed is plainly exprest,
and revealed unto all; but in such and so high terms, as
mortal man can no way worthily speak of; no nor
rightly in any degree conceive in his thoughts, until he
shall come to see and behold it with his Eyes. Then
indeed and then only he shall know what it is to come in
<hi>gloria Patris, in the glory of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He came once already in the days of his humiliation,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46181:55"/>
and then he came <hi>Filius hominis,</hi> the Son of Man, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptying
himself of his Divine Honour, and vailing it up in
the cloud of our mortality, when he was content to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
himself to be contemned, scorn'd and derided, reviled,
spit upon and buffeted, scourged with whips, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with thorns, until he became a worm, and no Man,
having neither form nor beauty why we should desire
him, and last of all crucified on a Tree: But now the
scene comes to be altered, the face of things utterly
changed: That was <hi>dies hominis,</hi> Mans day indeed, and
the hour of the powers of darkness: They did then
what they list, and he was pleased to suffer whatsoever
they list to do. Now comes <hi>dies Domini,</hi> and the Lord
shall have his day too: He will now be active, and men
another while must be content to suffer every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his deservings. This poor despised <hi>filius hominis,</hi>
this worm, without form or beauty to be desired, will
now appear in the strength of his Glory, as the Sun
breaking out of a Cloud, or the Lightning out of the
East, striking all eyes even with astonishment at his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and brightness, yea and make all faces, all faces of the
wicked gather blackness too to behold it: For as every
hand hath wounded him, so every eye shall see him
whom they have pierced, but not every eye endure the
sight of such overawing and dreadful Majesty, as shall
draw them to embrace Rocks, and cry unto deaf Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to cover them from the presence of the Lamb and
him that sitteth on the Throne, for he now comes in
<hi>gloria Patris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why in the Glory of the Father? Indeed at his
first appearance it was, <hi>Ecce Rex tuus venit mitis; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thy King cometh unto thee meek, sitting on an Ass
and the foal of an Ass.</hi> Now it is, <hi>Ecce Judex tuus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit

               <hi>Cherubins,</hi> as the Psalmist speaks, yea many Cherubins
and Seraphins, millions and myriads of holy Angels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
on his Glorious Majesty, when the whole Earth
and Heavens too shall be filled with the Majesty of his
Glory; Because he endured the Cross and despised the
shame, valued not his life, but humbled and bowed down
his Soul even unto death, therefore God now exalts him,
sets him on high, yea gives him a name above all names,
whereat the knees, that now are so stiff, shall then, will
they nill they, bow and bend, and the tongue of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one confess, <hi>laudando,</hi> as he speaks <hi>vel ululando,</hi>
that Jesus is the Lord, to the Glory of the Father; for he
now comes <hi>in gloria Patris,</hi> in the Fathers Glory. He
comes at this time for Judgment, and that originally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto the Father; <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
saith the Lord.</hi> But yet <hi>the Father judgeth
no man,</hi> saith Christ, but hath referred all judgment to
the Son, even <hi>filio hominis,</hi> to this Son of man, to whom
as man he hath given all power both in Heaven and
Earth: The son indeed himself even as the son of God,
is a Receiver from the Father, even of the Glory which
he hath; for glory he receives from him, from whom he
receives his Essence the fountain of glory, as having his
very being not of himself but of the Father, <hi>Fons Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi>
the fountain that communicates the Deity imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to the other persons, solely unto the Son, who
is therefore <hi>Deus de Deo, God of God and light of light.</hi>
Yet having received it from eternity, it is his own, even
his Fathers both essence and glory, and so though God
of God and light of light, yet because the same both God
and light, he is in Majesty equal, in Glory coeternal: <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
without robbery,</hi> saith the Apostle, and though not
without reception, yet without any duty of gratitude
for the receipt, as receiving it, not by a free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
but by a generation no less natural and simply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46181:56"/>
than absolutely eternal. For which reasons he is

Harvest of the world is now come, and their imployment

in bundles indeed, to tell us that sinners in the same kind

up sometimes like <hi>Haman</hi> on their own Gallows, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

God sometimes doth, that we may know his providence
sleepeth not even for the present. Yet this he doth but
seldom, saith St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that we may consider there is
a day of judgement to come, and the nearer that day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth,
the more rare and seldom are exhibited such
remarkable examples. The indignation of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that was wont in former Ages to follow notorious
wickedness at the heels with as notable and exemplary
revenge; now in these latter times, the day of final ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
draws nigh on, seems to slacken the pace and come
leisurely after at a distance, God inhibiting as it were the
inferiour Courts of his Justice upon earth against the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the great day of his general visitation in the
Clouds. In the mean time, because it is mans day, this, he
permits men for the most part unto themselves, steers
the line of his providence, suffers them to run on at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in their own courses, and men thus permitted to
themselves are oftentimes sure but ill Judges and worse
rewarders of their brethren. For the malevolent and
malignant world prone to calumniate the noblest actions,
doth usually reward men not according to their works,
but its own malignancy. It is not judgment but fancy and
faction, that now adays gives a sutable censure on all
mens ways and actions. But it is little material, for <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facere

But however, if they do not, yet it is but fit, that

 And that very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

holding was their refreshing it seems, in that place of rest
where they lay after death, as it were at anchor, in a

rest, they as yet, saith he, received not the promises,

others that died since the Ascension of our Saviour. For
as it was not convenient they should be made perfect
without us, so neither that we our selves should be made
perfect without the rest of our brethren; If any were
so, who sooner than the Souls of those Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
that refused not even death for Christ and his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
And yet even these are arrayed only in white
Robes, as <hi>Candidati,</hi> and ready drest in their wedding

in death, and plenary possession at the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In life here we walk by Faith, we see not God: In
the estate after death we see him, but afar off, as the
Apostle speaks; but at the Resurrection face to face. Here
in this world we lie as cripples in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch, but
cured by the name of Jesus, death carrieth us into the
body of the Temple where we are leaping for joy, exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and praising God; but the day of Christ will draw

the Veil, lead us into the Holy of Holies, where God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
dwells between the Cherubins. Lastly, now upon

in death we are declared Victours and Conquerors: but
in the resurrection, triumphant, and crowned even with
<hi>that Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord, the just
Judge will give,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, in die illo, in that day:</hi>
laid up indeed before, as he there speaks, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that day, it seems, to be given, but then it shall, for
<hi>then he shall reward, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like on the other side, may well be conceived of
the wicked; their Souls as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sorrows, and torments; the worm that shall never die,
begins presently to feed upon them, but drench'd, it seems,
as yet they are not in that lake of fire, which shall never
be quenched, and will be the fulness of their reward.
The Devils themselves are not yet there, and therefore
are bold to say unto our Saviour, <hi>Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

there is appointed for that; In the interim, as the Crown is

               <note place="margin">Jam. iii.</note> And so likewise all other
the Spirits lewd and diabolical people, they understand
their final and fearful doom already, on which their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

               <note place="margin">Rev. xx. 14.</note> For now the time of full Retribution is
come, this is the great day of reward, and there is no
other. To that then let us pass with my Text, from
the time, to the reward it self. <hi>Then he shall reward,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This word of Reward seems to stick in the Jaws of
many men, at least to come forth fumbling between their
Teeth, as if they did not very well like it. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they like it or no, so the Scriptures often speak, and
accordingly we must be content to receive them. The
truth is, there are extreams in this point as in most others,
lyable unto dispute and controversy; and Verity, like
Virtue, lies in the golden mean between both. For some
are wholly and totally all for reward, and no Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be a stock of Grace, whereby they may condignly
merit the reward.</p>
            <p>Others again can away with no Reward at all, but will
have all of meer Grace: when the truth consists in a
mixture compounded of both, neither totally grace, nor
meerly reward, but <hi>merces gratiosa,</hi> a gracious Reward:
And that not only in regard of the Grace first given, but
of the work too it self, that is to be rewarded.</p>
            <p>The former take Heaven to be as fully merited by the
works of the Righteous, as Hell is deserved by the sins
of the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:46181:60"/>
The latter suppose Heaven to be meerly a free gift,
and in the consequences of their Positions, make Hell as
free a Collation, as the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Both seem to be equally out, and not much unequally
to share both truth and errour between them. For thus
much I conceive is clear and certain, and ought to
be acknowledged by either: That the first Graces of
God either confer'd in time upon Earth, or prepared
eternally by him, who dwelleth in the Heavens; are a free
collation, and absolute without any thing of reward:
<hi>otherwise Grace were not grace,</hi> as the Apostle speaks.
Secondly, The last punishments in Hell, a meer reward in
justice, without any thing of free and undeserved colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
otherwise Punishment were not punishment. But
the Kingdom of Heaven, and the joyes of that place come
to us after a mixed manner, though originally and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
yet not altogether by grace, neither yet altogether
by merit; not as a gift only, nor yet wholly as a reward:
but is so a reward, as it is still a gift; so a gift; as it is still
a reward: A reward, because promised unto works; a
gift, because that promise was of grace, and these works
no way deserve the reward: And therefore the Scriptures
apply themselves unto both: terming it sometimes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
by Adoption: sometimes a Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
sometimes a gift of Grace: sometimes a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of our Works. But that we mistake not, we are
most commonly careful, not to mention the one respect,
without some intimation of the other; In that very
place where the Apostle affirms it a Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet that we may receive it as a Crown, rather given
than deserved, it follows immediately, <hi>which the Lord
the righteous Judge shall give me in that day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim.</note> On the

evil doings: for the merciful Lord, that preserver of
Souls, as the same Author hath it, cannot possibly hate
any man, as <hi>Davids</hi> enemies did him <hi>gratis,</hi> without
any cause, but is ever, as the Scriptures teach, and the
Fathers proverbially affirm, <hi>Primus in amore &amp; ultimus
in odio,</hi> first in love, and last in hatred: And they that
will needs think otherwise, if they be not reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the haters of God, sure I am they will be found
lyars at the last; for the Lord is a just God, and so is
his reward, that will look precisely on the work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect unto any mans person be he what he will, or
may be, for so it follows in the next place, <hi>reddet uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuique,

            <p>Great diversity there is among the Sons of men, but
the summons of this day is universal and will reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them all: Be they rich or poor, noble or ignoble;
none so mean, as to escape unregarded, none so mighty
as to decline the Tribunal: <hi>we must all appear,</hi> saith
the Apostle; we and we all, no remedy, we all must make
our appearance before the judgment-seat of Christ.
And however here upon earth, there doth indeed belong
great respect and reverence unto the persons and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of great and honourable men, yet these things are
all now passed away, and Christ the great Judge in this
terrible day will have no regard unto any mans person
or titles, farther than these have had an influence into
his actions, and rendred them justly rewardable with
greater honour, or else with sorer punishment. For the
Virtue or Vice of such Men, dies not at home in their
own bosoms, but as their persons are great, so their works
and ways in like manner eminent, and every way more
exemplar. And therefore the Wise man saith but right,
<hi>Potentes potenter,</hi> mighty Men that have done amiss
shall be mightily tormented; and for the same reason
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46181:61"/>
those that have done well, as mightily rewarded. There
is nothing mean in them now, nor shall be hereafter. For
these are they, whom God hath made great upon Earth,
filled them with substance and honour, that pouring
out of their plenty upon the distressed, and relieving the
oppressed by their power, they might become even as
Gods unto their brethren. These he hath placed <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
majores venae,</hi> as the greater veins in the body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
to minister blood and spirits unto the rest of the
members; <hi>tanquam communes Patriae parentes,</hi> as the
common Fathers and Parents of their Country, to whom
all the weak and injured may fly as unto a refuge and
sanctuary of protection; yea <hi>tanquam planetae &amp; stellae
majores,</hi> as the greater Stars and Planets in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of power, by sweet and propitious influence to
cherish the Earth under them, and all good things that
are in it. These now, if clean contrary shall abuse this
wealth and power, push the weaker cattle with them, as
with horn and shoulder, as the Scripture speaketh; If the
higher Potentates and Princes, like so many mighty
<hi>Nimrods,</hi> molest and vex the world they should govern,
provoke Heaven, and take peace from the earth, embrue
and embroil all to satisfy their own impotent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
ambitions; If the greater Peers among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
instead of being Gods and common Fathers unto
their Country, prove Wolves unto their brethren, and
like Pikes grow great and vast by eating up the Fry that
is round about them, <hi>donec Serpens serpentem devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans

Stars, they shall be of a sowr and <hi>Saturnian</hi> Aspect, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

activity; or else, but of a <hi>Mercurian</hi> concurring influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
good with the good, and bad with the bad, not
as justice, but as affection and faction shall lead them:
then no marvel if mighty men come at length to be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46181:62"/>
mightily tormented. But if these Noble Persons shall be
truly Noble indeed, and as God hath termed them, Gods
and Fathers unto their Country; If like <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job xxix.</note> they shall
<hi>deliver the poor and such as have none to help, from
those that are too mighty for them, break the jawes of
the wicked, and pluck the spoil out of their teeth,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the blessing of them that are ready to perish come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them for it; If the Prince, that is supream, be not a
disturber like <hi>Nimrod,</hi> but rather as <hi>Solomon, Princeps
pacis,</hi> a King of peace, nourishing his people, like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
with a perfect and upright heart, and ruling them
prudently with all his power; If his <hi>moderation be
known unto all,</hi> and his Piety unto God and goodness
no less exemplary, than his Virtue: then undoubtedly
both he and they and all such Mighty men in this great
day, shall be as mightily honoured; when he that hath
made you Rulers of his people, set you here in the seats of
Justice as on the throne of <hi>David,</hi> shall then advance you
higher, take you up even upon his own throne in the
Clouds, as being in the number of those Saints, that shall
be Assessors there and with Christ, as the Apostle tells us,
to judge the world; whilst those mighty and glorious
Monarchs that once so much troubled the earth and other
Princes, Great men, and Favorites of the world, shall
now stand like poor worms, beneath you at the Bar, <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do

their Dignities and Titles, their Pomp and former Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor?
how is it vanished! Alas all these things accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
none any farther than the grave; but their works,
these follow after unto judgment, where according to
their works, they shall be now rewarded, which is our
last point. <hi>And then be shall reward every man, secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:46181:62"/>
This, as it is the latter part of my Text, so is it the
most substantial, but withal the most troublesome: for
here we seem to meet with nothing but difficulties.</p>
            <p>There are but three words in it: And whether we
look on the <hi>opera,</hi> which is the main; or the <hi>sua,</hi> that
adheres; or the <hi>secundùm,</hi> that hath reference unto both,
Objections we shall find, and some of them difficult e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
even in all three.</p>
            <p>Set the Accent first upon the <hi>opera</hi> (for that as I said
is the main) and we shall no sooner do it, but the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is instantly emergent; for if Men shall be now
judged with precise respect unto their works, since none
are so wicked but have some good deeds; nor any so
righteous but have many sins; how should it come to
pass that either any should escape Condemnation, or if
some do, why should not all escape it, for all are sinners.
But this knot may well be dissolved without any great
labour. For though works at that day shall be judged
of, as good or evil precisely according unto that Law
which they have transgressed, yet the men whose they
are, shall be sentenced for these works, not according to
the law, but with reference and respect unto the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Gospel; <hi>for God shall then judge the secrets
of all hearts,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, secundùm evangelium meum,
according to my Gospel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. i.</note> And according to the Gospel
the same works are not always of the same condition
with reference to reward and punishment, but according
to the repentance of the person, or his falling from it,
do receive ever a new qualification. The Schools there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do accordingly distinguish of <hi>opera mortua</hi> and
<hi>mortifera, viva</hi> and <hi>mortificata,</hi> and <hi>rediviva</hi> too, of
dead works and deadly, of living and mortified and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viscent
also. Works morally good, but not done with any
Pious or Spiritual intention, they account dead works, as
lyable neither to reward nor punishment: Works mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46181:63"/>
and mortally evil, these are <hi>mortisera,</hi> deadly
Works, that draw death and destruction after them:
works of Faith and Charity in the converted Soul, these
are <hi>opera viva,</hi> living works, and such as have title un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
life everlasting; but both these latter may be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and both after mortification revive again; when
the sinner repents him of his Sins, all his former wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is forgotten; and when the penitent man returns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to his Sins, none of his former righteousness shall
then be remembred. And as men do ebb or flow in their
true repentance, so their sins or their good deeds do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
revive or mortifie, and the mortification of the one,
is the reviving ever of the other: And for this reason,
saith our Saviour, in the <hi>Revelation, Behold I come
quickly and my reward is with me, to render unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man,</hi> not as his <hi>works,</hi> but in the singular, <hi>as his
work shall be;</hi> For according unto this one work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
either his sin or his righteousness hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominance,
and shall be accordingly rewarded by him,
who will now reward every man in this sence, <hi>according
to his works.</hi> But yet since this Judgment proceeds in
mercy, and according to the Gospel, why are we not
said to be rewarded according to our Faith rather than
according to our works? As though works, where
the Gospel is revealed, were of any validity without
Faith, or Faith any way rewardable farther, than it is
operative and fruitful in works: But besides, this is a day
of universal reckoning, not confined within the precise
latitude of that revelation; every man without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must now come to his account, and what every one is
bound to account for, according to that, and to that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he shall be sentenced. New the Gospel of Christ
hath not been revealed unto all, but the notions of good
and evil are implanted in Nature, and men are to be
<hi>judged</hi> of, and accepted too, <hi>according to what they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46181:63"/>
have, not according to what they have not,</hi> as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
speaketh. And therefore the Faith of the Jew was
not required of the Gentile, neither yet the Faith of the
Christian at the hands of the Jew. The Law of Nature
indeed binds all, but positive Laws those only to whom
they are given: And thus much seems to be both Law and
Gospel, That no man give an account but for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
that were delivered him; For God is no such hard
man, as that lazy fellow in the Gospel would make him,
to reap where he did not sow; or else like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
his Brick where he doth not afford Straw for the
making. Not therefore according to the Faith, which
they knew not, but according to the good and evil
which they knew, so shall all be judged by him, who
now <hi>comes to reward every man according to his
works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>opera</hi> now, if we come to the <hi>sua,</hi> remove
the Accent thither, we shall but remove from one difficulty
to another; For some there are, that have no works of
their own; How many that die, as soon as born, and
not a few before, and both before they have done either
good or evil, for which they may be rewarded? It may
be said peradventure, that yet even these have one work
of their own; for being all in <hi>Adams</hi> loins, when he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
his Sin, by virtue of the first Covenant becomes
theirs and theirs therefore by St. <hi>Paul</hi> it is expresly
termed, <hi>in quo omnes pecc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This is right, and hath nothing but truth in it, if we
consider only the Nature of the first Covenant, and go
no farther than so; But farther I suppose we are to go;
for since there is a second Covenant passed, and <hi>the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>
as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and reason it self,
will tell us, must <hi>disanul the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the same <hi>Adam,</hi> (and in him we all were at the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46181:64"/>
transaction of the one as well as of the other, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his loyns, when he was restored, as well as when
he fell) for that is the perpetual nature of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
<hi>Vobis &amp; liberis vestris: Deus tuus &amp; seminis
tui.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts xi. 48. Gen. xvii.</note> And sure if we make our stay in the old Testament,
the Father must have come in his own glory, the Son of
man could never have come in the glory of the Father
to render unto every man his own works; for had he
not first been our Mediatour, he had never been our
Judge. Now therefore we are to look up unto him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the person, before whose seat of Judgment we
are to appear, even Christ our blessed Lord, that innocent
Lamb that was slain from the beginning, that Lamb of God
which by his blood, being slain took away <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that sin of the world in the singular, and other
such singular sin of the world, but there was not any.
And for this cause is rightly termed <hi>Adam secundus,</hi> a
second <hi>Adam,</hi> a second <hi>through whom all receive justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
unto life</hi> that became lyable unto death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
in the first.<note place="margin">Rom. v. 18.</note> This is our Judge, even the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the second Covenant, who therefore will not
sentence men, as those Apostate Angels, strictly after the
Law of the first, but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks <hi>secundùm Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium
meum,</hi> according to my, or rather his own Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.<note place="margin">Rom. i.</note>
Before this Judge, when St.<hi>Paul</hi> cites every man,
he assures us, no man shall answer but for what himself
hath done, or be rewarded with punishment, but as my text
hath it, <hi>secundùm opera sua,</hi> according to his own works,
and those his own, not because acted in the loyns of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but because done in his own body; for so saith St.
<hi>Paul</hi> expresly, and purposely it seems to prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
<hi>we must all appear before the judgment seat
of Christ, that every one may receive</hi>

ancient Fathers cite, and the vulgar doth render, <hi>propria

therefore will not satisfy the doubt, and were it admitted,
would yet satisfy but on one part, the part that perish;
still the difficulty would remain, how those on the other
side, that are saved by Sacrament, should be rewarded
with heaven <hi>secundum opera sua,</hi> according to their
own works. But not to meddle any farther in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the truth is, (and it is the fullest answer I can give it)
That we may not measure such ignorant Innocents ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
always by the common rules of doctrine, or at any
time by the general precepts of duty; For those the
Scriptures are usually spoken of, and these perpetually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
unto none, but the full-grown and adult, as they
that alone are capable of them; The not observing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is the chief cause (I conceive) of the great variety
of opinions and intricate difficulties, which this point of
Infants hath begotten; Some excluding them utterly from
this day and seat of judgment because without Works
either good or bad to be then discussed; Others admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of their presence there, but yet neither among those on
the right hand or yet on the left, and so not liable to either
of these two grand Sentences which shall then be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.
A third sort subjecting them unto a Sentence,
and of these some unto such a Sentence, as shall carry them
to beatitude, but in a Paradise apart, others conveying
them thence directly to heaven. A fourth sort even to
Hell; and a fifth unto a middle state, a condition between
both. But yet among all these varieties this is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
not any one of the Antients was ever so severe
unto any of these, whether baptized or otherwise, as to
cast them into that nethermost Hell, and those torments,
which he suffers there of whom our Saviour said, <hi>it had
been better for him, if he had never been born.</hi>

nothing amidst so many doubts, and distractions;
'twere best leave them to stand or fall to their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
especially since my Text, which speaks of works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable
like other general Scriptures, doth not, as I
said, concern impotent and ignorant Infants, but grown
Men, knowing and operative; for whoever of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the Kingdom of Heaven, must receive it meerly as
an Inheritance without any respect of works. They are
exempted from such common rules, and so not included

            </p>
            <p>And now in the last place, let us come to this <hi>secundùm,</hi>
the first of the words, and then sure we shall find our
selves in no less streights than any of the former, yea <hi>ut
unda undam,</hi> so one doubt and difficulty seems here to
drive on another.</p>
            <p>For first, since the good shall now be rewarded <hi>ultra
meritum,</hi> beyond their merit; and the evil, <hi>citra con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignum,</hi>
short of their desert, which is a Maxime in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;
they may well be rewarded for, but not any of
them precisely <hi>secundùm opera, according to their
works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed some there are that like well enough of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm,</hi>
but can by no means away with the <hi>propter</hi> in
this case: But yet St.<hi>Gregory</hi> for this reason conceives
otherwise; and since the reward is ever beyond, or on
this side the work, takes the <hi>propter</hi> to be more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken, than the <hi>secundùm opera;</hi> But the truth is,
both are true, and the reward shall be now given both
<hi>for</hi> and <hi>according to</hi> their works; not indeed in a strict

Geometrical, for <hi>bonis bona retribuet, &amp; melioribus

yet comparatively in what degree of goodness
they exceed others, the excess of their reward shall arise
ever in the same proportion: And so on the other side,
<hi>malis mala &amp; pejoribus pejora,</hi> in like manner. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will the Parable of the Labourers and their penny
any way destroy this, though we have not leisure at this
time to consider it, because of another difficulty arising
from hence, which as it shall be the last, so it seems to be
the greatest of all other. For be it that good works are
rewarded beyond their merit, yet how should those that
for short and momentany pleasures, burn in perpetual and
everlasting fires, be said to be punished short of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
yea how should not their desert rather seem much
short of their punishment? For that the Sins of a Mortal
Man acted in an instant, and the pleasure thereof perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
even with the act, should be rewarded with infinite
and interminable sorrows, is more than earthly mans wit,
I suppose, can easily reach unto. And therefore is well
termed by St.<hi>Paul, Ira revelata de Coelo,</hi> wrath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Heaven, as being without those brighter beams
of Revelation, not fully penetrable by the Star-light of
reason. For what reason may well be rendred, why or
from whence it should be, that limited and finite works
should arise and grow up to an infinite and unlimited
demerit? Is it that men are born in an aversion from
God, and but for God, might they never die, would never
leave sinning, and so in the proportion well deserve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
without ceasing? as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> would have it,
<hi>voluissent uti<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> sine fine vivere, ut potuissent sine fine
peccare.</hi> But no man is now judged for what he would
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46181:66"/>
have done upon suppositions, but what he really hath
done, and that in the body; otherwise <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi>
should have been saved, and peradventure even <hi>Enoch</hi>
himself have perished, of whom the Wiseman affirms,
<hi>raptus est, nè malitia mutaret intellectum ejus.</hi> This
therefore is but vain, and for this reason the Learned
Schoolmen rest not on it, but relie rather on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
answer, that the full estimate of sin is taken not
from the person that sins, or the time and continuance
of the sin, but from the object, the person offended:
And this person being the infinite God, the sin therefore
deserves an infinite punishment. But even this way is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to many and great difficulties. For though offences
do otherwise arise in proportion unto the dignity and
greatness of the Person, that is hurt or wronged by them;
yet it seems not so in this case, where the party offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is infinite. First, because such a Person is clear out of
the reach of Man, out of danger of any real lesion or
hurt by him or any of his actions. Secondly, for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity,
I conceive, is a proper Attribute of God's, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
incommunicable to any creature, unless it be
where he communicates his own Essence and Person, as
in our blessed Lord by union hypostatical, though yet
even then he made not the Humane Nature infinite, or
yet gave the actions of that nature an estimate so much as
morally infinite, any other way, but by assuming it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the unity of his Person, which alone could make the
sufferings of Man the passions of God also, from whence
only they receive the infinity of merit. But between
the act and the object there is no such union to affect that
with a demerit as infinite on the other side. And lastly, <hi>à


posteriori,</hi> were the act after that infinite manner affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the object, how then should not all sins be equal
and equally to be punished, since in Infinites there is no
inequality of magnitude, nor can there be made any aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46181:66"/>
or diminution by any thing we can do or
imagine unto them? For to that, which is once conceived
as such, nothing can be added to make it greater, or taken
away to render it lesser, than before, no not though
we should take away finite parts, or yet add one infinite
to another. For one infinite divided, will but make two;
and two, yea two thousand infinites clapt together
would run all into one. For as one indivisible point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to as much as a million, so a million of united in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites
will arise to no more than one, because all those
have not any, and every of these hath all quantity in it. He
that once should conceipt an infinite number of Towers,
though his imagination should furnish every Tower with
six Bells, yet he could not with reason say for all that
there were more Bells than Towers, for more than infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
may not be imagined. And this is alike true even
in moral magnitudes, as well as mathematical, whether
discrete or continued. And as nothing is to be gained by
Addition, so Substraction on the other side, will lose as
little: He must of necessity take half, whosoever will
take any thing from that which is infinite. As the circle
that hath no bounds, is every where Center, so an infinite
line, the Diameter of that Circle, having no extremities
is therefore all middle, cut it where you list, you shall
still divide it into two equal parts, and which is stranger,
both parts will be equal to the whole, for either part
will still be infinite in regard of one end, and therefore
of quantity immensurable, and that can be no more
which is infinite on both ends. The Product of this will
be not only, that all sins are equal because infinite, but
that one sin is equal in demerit unto all, to all that have
been committed, yea and to infinite sins too, if they
might be imagined; As appears plainly in the sufferings
of our Saviour, which though of different degrees in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the sorrow and torment, yet because infinite
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46181:67"/>
through his Person, they were all equal in respect of the
merit Whence it is, that that satisfaction which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for any one sin, could even in strictness of Justice
expiate all, though never so many, and that which had
faln short of expiating all could never have given sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for any one, even the least sin that is mortal.
Neither will this be avoided by that answer of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that sin hath infinity only <hi>secundùm quid,</hi> that is,
in regard of the object. and that therefore other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
there are, which may add degrees unto it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not simply infinite. For even that, which is but
one way infinite, cannot be enlarged by any finite addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the other way: As a line, that should run on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end, though pieced out never so much at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
would yet be never a whit the longer. If the world
be supposed eternal, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> though days and
months, and years be added, yet it would be no older an
hundred years hence than it is at this very day: or if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had a beginning, yet conceived to be perpetual, <hi>à


parte post,</hi> it would then be as near the end this very day
as an hundred years hence.<note place="margin">Aristot.</note> But this peradventure comes
to pass, because the addition is still made in the same
kind, that is, in length and longitude only: Nothing
hinders for all that, but that two things equally infinite
in one dimension, may yet be unequal in another, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of augmentation. The Mast of a Ship, and the
Spear of a Souldier, that should stand by it, though both
allowed to run on <hi>in insinitum,</hi> and so of one and the same
length, yet notwithstanding in bulk and body there
would be great difference still between them, and might
be greater as we should add unto the one, or withdraw
from the other. And so in like manner all sins may well
have a punishment equal in duration, because all offences
against God, and yet by reason of other different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
that give the bulk and magnitude, not all receive
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46181:67"/>
punishment equal in degree and intension, but some a
sorer punishment than others, though not a longer. But
this though it look well, will not satisfy; for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
is one thing, and the sin another: In that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we may distinguish the duration from the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
or intention, but in the sin we cannot so distinguish;
This doth not receive longitude in one respect, body and
bulk in another; but the sin is infinite in magnitude only,
not in length, and deserves a punishment infinite even
in intension; that it becomes so only in duration is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental:
for being that a punishment intensively infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
as the sin deserves, may not possibly be actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
not through any impotence in God, but incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in the Creature; hence in this supposition it comes
to pass, that what could not after an infinite manner be
at once received, should yet in a finite manner, as it
may be perpetually suffered. The punishment therefore
by succession is only potentially infinite, not in act, nor
shall be ever, but the sin is actually infinite, otherwise
the punishment should be even actually finite. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
therefore of the Spear and the Mast, is besides the
matter, and yet even in these, though this be greater in
sound than that, yet not in matter and substance; For
still not an inch of wood or an ounce of weight in the
one more than in the other. Others therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
a third way, and that is from the infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that is proposed unto the righteous; whence they
conceive it but right, that as infinite a punishment should
be prepared for the wicked: when two infinites are
laid in the ballance, the scales cannot but hang the more
equal: for what injury is there done unto any, if an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Heaven or an everlasting Hell be set open unto all;
and then every man accordingly rewarded as he shall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through Gods grace, or his own perversness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into either? And sure it seems but reason and every
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46181:68"/>
way just, that they who for temporary and trifling plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
neglect full and never fading joys, should receive
for their meed, no less great and never ending sorrows;
And indeed we our selves that by the condition of our
birth, without any sin of our own, came at first to be
plunged into that pit of everlasting misery by the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of another, could not (it seems) with Justice
have been so through the meer nature of sin, for then all
the sins of our intermediate fore-Fathers should lie upon
the Children also; but only by virtue of a Covenant
grounded in this very equity, that we who were in his
loins, should not incur more hurt by his fall than receive
benefit by his standing; For he was to stand or fall, not
to himself alone but to all his posterity. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
may be subject to some objections, though not
so unanswerable, which the time now forbids me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss.
However be it this upon what regard it may be,
that so it shall be is most certain, and that without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto any. God is a righteous Judge and will clear
himself, both when he is judged, and when he judgeth
also. For my part I am satisfied with this last reason, and
were I not with it, or any other, yet in a point so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered in the Scripture, my reason should be led
captive by my Faith. For it abundantly sufficeth, that it
is, as I said at first, <hi>wrath revealed from Heaven.</hi> And I
would it were a little better considered on upon Earth,
what a miserable ruine and calamity it will then bring
upon all the Sons of Pride and Children of disobedience,
sorrows no less insufferable, than interminable, in both,
by Man in this life, inconceiveable: For who knoweth or
can know the power of his wrath? But this destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is nor near enough to affect us now, though (as
that learned Man says) there is only that puff of breath
which is in our Nostrils, betwixt us and it, and that God
knows how suddenly too, may be taken from us. Yet I
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46181:68"/>
say, it is not near enough to affect us now; but <hi>in novissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
intelligetis planè,</hi> in the end ye shall understand all
things clearly: In the end indeed, <hi>when the Son of Man
shall come in Glory and his reward with him,</hi> then they
shall understand and know, when they begin to feel their
sorrows, the strange folly of their ways, and truly then
apprehend the vanity of their pride and pleasures here,
only this one way of value, that once they might have
been given in exchange for their Souls. In the mean
time, what a misery is it, <hi>transire hinc in Infernum ut
ibi discant, quod bîe creder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hence into Hell, there to learn the truth, which here they
refused to believe? How much better were it for us to
believe, and practise too whilst we may, and whilst it
may do us good? Profit in any thing else there is not any,
though a man should gain the whole world: For most
assuredly whosoever hath the wealth and honour now, yet
the Righteous only shall have the dominion in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
In the morning of this great day, when God shall shew
himself no less terrible unto Sinners, than, as <hi>David</hi> speaks,
<hi>marvellous in his Saints;</hi> Happy men are we, if in that
manner we shall compose our lives, as may enroll us in
the Communion of that blessed number. That so when

our selves may be declared among the Sons of God, and

            <head>SERMON IV.
Upon JAMES iv. I.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>From whence come Wars, and Fightings among you;
Come they not hence, even of your Lusts that war
in your Members?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Epistle, however received at first not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some scruple by reason of those heretical
Libertines (<hi>Simon, Nicholaus &amp; similes</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom in the judgment of St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De fide &amp; operibus.</note> it
is especially directed, and lately also questioned by such
once more as setting up a solitary faith, would gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again unto the old licentiousness; yet the long and

confirmed it unto her Children for undoutedly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46181:69"/>
If any thing yet remain doubtful, it concerns
not the doctrine but the Author of it, this indeed is not
altogether so certain; That it was St. <hi>James,</hi> all agree,
but which of the <hi>James's,</hi> there lies the difficulty; Two
of that name we find among the twelve Apostles, <hi>James</hi>
the Brother of <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the Brother of <hi>Alpheus,
Mat.</hi> x. 2. but whether <hi>James</hi> the Brother of our Lord,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> entitles him,<note place="margin">Galat. i. 19.</note> surnamed the Less by St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. xi. 40.</note>
the Just by Ecclesiastical writers, the first Bishop of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and by <hi>Eusebius (lib. Hist. 2. Cap. 22.)</hi> St.
<hi>Hierom</hi> and others, held for the Writer of this Epistle;
whether this <hi>James</hi> were one of those two whom we find
in the number of the twelve, or a third out of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
is much disputed with great authorities and reasons
on either side: <hi>&amp; adhuc sub judice lis est.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them soever it were, it is little material, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
that the matter of the Epistle is Orthodox and
Canonical: Directed it is unto the Christian Jews, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
(by the persecution which began with St.<hi>Stephen,</hi>)
into divers quarters, but not agreeing there (it seems)
among themselves, especially dissenting in points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
every one striving who should be the greatest
Rabbi and Master among them, which contention St.
<hi>James</hi> seeks to dissolve by inquiring into the foul and
poisoned Fountains from whence it proceeds, <hi>From
whence come, &amp;c.</hi> But though directed principally
unto the Jew, yet the Epistle you know hath the Title
of Catholick: The whole doctrin therefore must be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and these particular words not bound unto others,
but pertinent also unto the Wars and fightings of all
other Christians. The enquiry sure will equally concern
them all, and all be found equally liable unto the reproof.
For universally, <hi>whence come Wars, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words we have two questions proposed, and
one of them is an Answer to the other. <hi>Unde Bella?</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:46181:70"/>
whence are Wars, and fightings among you? This is
the first, <hi>Interrogatio disquisitiva,</hi> an Interrogation by
way of inquiry, <hi>An non hinc?</hi> Are they not hence, <hi>even
of your Lusts?</hi> This is the second, <hi>Interrogatio Responsiva,</hi>
an Interrogation by way of resolution; A Question in
form, an Answer in effect; negatively proposed, <hi>Come
they not from hence?</hi> but affirmatively concluding as
much as to say, from hence they come, <hi>even from your
lusts that war in your members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems to involve Riddles, a questioning answer, and a
negative affirmation, but such is the condition of these
responsive Interrogations.</p>
            <p>In the former, The Question Inquisitive, three points
are apparently discernable.</p>

            </p>
            <p>First, Lusts in the habit, that unprovoked lie Couchant,
sleeping, and so in a manner dead, and <hi>Homo mortuus
non belligerat,</hi> as it is in the proverb, so long they fight
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46181:70"/>
not: These awakened and stirred up by the flesh or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or Devil working by both, presently become mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<hi>adversus animam, for they war, but against the
Soul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, if the warring Lusts of the members prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Soul, draw it unto Lust, the Lusts of the Soul
do thenceforth war again in the members, making them
but <hi>instruments of iniquity unto iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> of iniquity in
consent unto iniquity in Act and Execution, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks, And then if hindred in the execution, Stirs begin
abroad, Wars and Contentions are instantly raised. And
that this is the intent here of St. <hi>James</hi> his phrase of
<hi>warring in the members,</hi> is evident, for the original
saith not indeed Lusts but Delights, it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not from your lusts, but from your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
that war in your members. For when Lusts are
turned into pleasures and delights, they then become
Vices, which before were but temptations reigning in the
Soul, and imploying all the members of both Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as Instruments and Weapons too to beat down all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
until they shall atchieve and fully effect their
intentions. But because these three are not three several
things but only three degrees of one and the same lust,
lust dormant, militant, and victorious, for victorious it
must be in the mind, ere the lust of the mind can become
militant in the members, the utmost improvement and
exaltation of lust, when it loseth her name by running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a corrupt affection or delight; Under that Title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we shall simply consider it in this responsive que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
such noysom affections at home being indeed the
ground and foundation, the well-head and Fountain of
all Wars and Contentions abroad. But we must first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the former Question, and in it, as Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
first enter on the subject concerning which it is
moved, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Wars and Fightings, <hi>from</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:46181:71"/>
               <hi>whence, &amp;c. Qui in genere &amp; confusè loquuntur, seip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos
decipiunt &amp; alios, ergo distinguamus,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
And St. <hi>James</hi> here, that his speech be the more distinct,
follows the Rule, and doth first sever publick and general
contentions, from private strifes and lesser brabbles,<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
But this difference consisting in degree ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Nature, doth not hinder, but that we may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
distinguish the diverse kinds of either; And two
sorts sure there are apparently, Verbal Wars and Violent:
so the Orator doth divide, <hi>duo sunt genera decertandi,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

two sorts of war and contention, the one by force, the
other by dispute, and contestation; that proper unto
Beast, this unto Men; yet Men may fly unto that, faith
he, when this latter may not be used, or hath been used
to no purpose; For in case of injuries between States or
Princes that have no Superiour Judges if reason may not
prevail for right, or restitution, the Sword of necessity
must dispute the cause, and be bold to carve out its own
satisfaction. But then what large satisfaction men do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
cut out to themselves that are their own Carvers
and Judges in their own causes, backed with <hi>Caesars</hi>
Maxime of War in the Poet, <hi>Omnia dat, qui justa negat,</hi>
what bitter revenges they take of their brethren; what
sorrows and calamities, what slaughter and effusion of
blood, and confusion they bring upon the world, until
the whole earth doth groan and mourn, if not totter and
reel like a drunkard under the burthen, is an argument
fitter for tears than discourses, for prayers unto God
than declamations unto Men that little regard them. But
such are the conditions of the former sort, violent and
bloody. The second are of a milder nature; disceptive on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
and verbal; In which kind I shall not now meddle with

and Churches, as the war most especially intended in the
Text, and that we be not much offended at it, ever and
in all ages permitted by the Divine Dispensation for
great reasons, more or less to exercise the Church of
God; And these wars, it were yet something well, had
they contained themselves within their proper sphere of
disceptation and dispute, though even thus, such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
it self, and the bitter fruits which it produceth,
is cause sufficient to bring sorrow enough on the heat of
every true Son of the Church; for, whose heart smarteth
not to consider the divisions, I say not now of <hi>Reuben,</hi>
but of <hi>Levi,</hi> and their great thoughts of heart to behold
the parts and parcels, divisions and subdivisions, factions
and fractions whereinto they have broken and even crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

be without seam, not only rent in pieces but torn even
unto rags, until Religion, Christian Religion, seem to
suffer the same fate with that Lady in <hi>Plutarch, quam

have these contentions stayed here? Have they not
thrown aside the Pen and drawn forth the Sword, lest

mortal or rather immortal hatred, not content to spend
it self on the goods, the bodies, the lives of the living, but
to rage on the Memory, the Bones and the very Ashes
and Sepulchres of the dead, yea on the very Souls, as far
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46181:72"/>
as they might, of both; how many such Souls of our late
Predecessors (whole blood in most Savage manner poured
forth and spilt, is yet even almost warm) are there now
lying under that Altar in the <hi>Revel.</hi> and crying unto God
with an <hi>usquequo, how long Lord, merciful and true?</hi>
And how well may we cry out and admire too with that
Poet,
<q>Tantum Relligio potuit suadere malorum?</q>
For certainly there is neither of these contentions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </gap>, publick Wars or private Fightings of either
sort, but will well deserve an <hi>unde</hi> of admiration and
inquisition too; but first of admiration in regard of the
<hi>inter vos,</hi> the parties contending, which is the second
point, <hi>whence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And sure were the <hi>vos</hi> here, only but men, it were
not without marvel, since such violent and bloody con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
(as the Orator said well) is proper to Beasts, to
Beasts that are of divers kinds and several natures, as full
of passion, as void of understanding, not unto Men that
are rational, of the same blood, and descended from the
loins of the same Parent, in whom the lines of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Pedegrees do all meet and center themselves in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
original, that so in their running on from thence there
might be continued a fraternity perpetual. Beasts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
come forth armed, and in their several kinds well
appointed for war, into the world; but Man is sent out
without Tooth or Talon, horn or hoof from the womb,
<hi>tanquam animal sociale, &amp; ad pacem colendam natum,</hi>
as a civil and sociable creature designed and born unto
peace. Is it not strange that such notwithstanding should
become <hi>belluis ipsis magis belluini,</hi> more full of beastly
ferity than beasts themselves? That this sociable Animal
should justifie the madness of the most Savage and intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46181:72"/>
creatures, steel their affections with more cruelty
and barbarity than Bears and Lions can learn in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness?
As if they had sucked Tygers in the desert, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Daughters of Men, or were a <hi>Cadmean</hi>
generation, born not of Women, but <hi>terrae &amp; filii</hi> sprung
up out of the earth, sown with the teeth of Serpents, for
just so we destroy one another,<hi>&amp; pereunt per mutua
vulnera fratres,</hi> like the young men that played before
<hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> every man thrusting his Sword in his
Brothers side.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 2.</note> This cannot be without marvel; But
yet this is not it, there is something more in the <hi>vos</hi>
than this. St. <hi>James</hi> directs his speech not meerly unto
Men, to animal Men and Infidels, but unto Christian
Men, to Men whose Badge and Cognizance, yea whose
very form and essence, is mutual Love and Charity; <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
inter vos?</hi> It is but a just admiration, this, whence
are wars amongst such? That divers and several Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should strive even unto death; that the Jew and the
Christian contending, the Gentile should fall upon both
as in the primitive times is no great matter: but that
one and the same should nourish intestine war, that the
Children of the same Mother should struggle and fight,
like <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> in the very womb that bears them,
that is it that is marvellous indeed. For we may not
conceive that Christianity infolds within it several Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions;
As far as the World is Christian, it is but one, in
which indeed there may be and are Factions and Parts,
some Schisms and rents, which notwithstanding are not
so torn in sunder, or so utterly divided, but that they
hang together, though at some distance by many threads.
As long as there is no new foundation laid, the building
of Hay and Stubble upon the old, may well be termed
Errour, and error sometimes peradventure Heretical, a
new Religion it may not, cannot be: That then this one
should so vary and multiply it self into many several
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46181:73"/>
forms and shapes, every man admiring and contending
for the beauty and proportions of that which his own
fancy beholds, if not frames, and that with such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and bitterness; this cannot be but very strange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and we are now to inquire into the causes, that it
may be strange no longer. For this <hi>Unde</hi> of St. <hi>James,</hi> stays
not in the admiration, but tends especially unto Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the last point, <hi>whence are Wars and Fightings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he doth well to inquire into the Causes of such
deadly evils, as being the best and readiest means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
not only the admiration but the Evils themselves;
For Wars in the world, are but as sickness in the Body,
both distempers and tumults bred by corrupt humours,
the one in natural bodies, the other in politick and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious:
Every Empirick may palliate the malignity of a
disease by outward and local Medicines, but a skilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
deals upon the root and fountain, that he may make
a cure of it; And so doth St. <hi>James</hi> here, though his
discourse be of War, yet his whole intent is for Peace, the
health of a Church and State, yea and the wealth too;
<hi>The blessing of peace,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as if all other
blessings were, as indeed they are, without it unblessed
unto us. But this peace however otherwise pieced and
palliated, yet he well knew could not be firmly knit and
established, without removing the causes of War; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these causes that feed and foment War, removed,
unless first shewn and discovered; And therefore the
enquiry is no sooner made by one Interrogation, <hi>Unde
Bella?</hi> but the discovery follows in the neck of it, by
another, <hi>Annon hinc? Are they not hence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may proceed unto this second general,
we will now follow him accordingly in both; first make
the Enquiry and that distinctly with respect unto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts of <hi>Wars and fightings</hi> before mentioned, and
then consider the truth of his return unto it, whether he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46181:73"/>
hath not opened the right fountain, justly laid the blame,
where it should lie, upon warring lusts; And lastly, take a
more particular view, what Lusts they are, that warring
in the members at home, do cause all other strifes and
contentions in the World abroad. <hi>Whence are Wars?
Are they not hence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But first by the way it will not be amiss to prevent a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
lest some Anabaptistical Spirit peradventure may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it St. <hi>James</hi> his meaning here, because he derives them
from lust, to condemn all violent Wars for utterly unlawful;
True it is, that War cannot be juston any side, unless worldly
lusts have caused injustice on one side, though it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in case of ignorance through inextricable difficulty
of title, that a War which can be just but on one part,
may yet not be unjust on any: But in case of apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
<hi>vim vi repellere,</hi> is the unrepealable Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
even for private men, how much more for such as
are supereminent, and publick? For Kings and Kingdoms
that are bound more strongly to preserve themselves, than
any particulars else, are therefore least bound of all others
to suffer injuries, especially such as are destructive, or but
look towards it: A just War here is ever to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before a running and dishonourable Peace: Though
yet this indeed, is or ought to be the last remedy, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to be used, unless injuries with peace may not
otherwise be repaired: He said well, <hi>Malis foelicitas, bonis
necessitas:</hi> To lay hold of any occasion to subdue Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and enlarge Dominions by Conquest and bloodshed,
wicked and Tyrannous Princes may esteem great glory
and felicity, but by good and Christian Kings War is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sought, but enforced, and is therefore rightly termed
<hi>malum necessarium,</hi> though indeed it be never evil
morally, but when it is unnecessary. And therefore
<hi>Cuncta prius tentanda,</hi> all good means are first to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
but then if it still remain <hi>immedicabile vulnus,</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:46181:74"/>
an injury otherwise incurable, <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se recidendum,</hi> the
Sword must cut it off as a Gangrene, lest it creep on to
ruine and destruction: In this case they alone must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
bear on their own heads, as they may, the
blame and blood too of the War, whose warring lusts
would not permit them to hearken unto the treaties and
just conditions of peace. Though therefore the ground
and occasion of a War be ever some corrupt lusts on the
one part, yet the prosecution may be but justice on the
other; And just Wars are so far from being evil, as they
are termed somewhere, even in the Scriptures, <hi>the Lords
battles.</hi> This premised to remove the Anabaptist that
stood in the way, let us now come to the answer, first
proposing the question, and then applying the responsive
interrogation in the several sorts of contention, beginning
the enquiry as the Text doth with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>whence
are wars,</hi> publick Wars and violent amongst you?</p>
            <p>But the demand here I confess may well be spared:
such Wars are neither so proper to the Text, nor yet
unto our profession, and were they both, yet the inquiry
into them is impertinent at this season, and to this Assembly:
Here is no room for the Question, no place for the
<hi>inter Vos</hi>: Blessed be God there are no such Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us,
<q>
                  <l>—Quicquid minabitur Eurus</l>
                  <l>... plectuntar sylvae.</l>
               </q> saith the Poet.
And so it hath been with us hitherto, and may it be
so still. The Hail-storm that threatens our Cities, may
it ever fall upon the Forest, as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh:
The Lord, it seems, as he sometimes said of his <hi>Israel,</hi>
hath given <hi>Egypt</hi> for your ransom, <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Sheba</hi>
for you, and the chastisement of our peace is upon other
mens shoulders; we therefore may better put the question
clean contrary, <hi>Unde non sunt bella? Unde Pax inter
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46181:74"/>
Vos?</hi> whence is it, that there are no such Wars amongst
you? This <hi>Unde</hi> and enquiry certainly is not without
some admiration neither; That the streams of your Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
should run pure and clean, whilest the Rivers abroad
are turned into blood; that whilst other Nations lie even
waste in the desolations of War, imbroyled and imbrewed
in their own gore, your Country remains unto you in the
mean while like the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> fresh and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
every man <hi>sub umbra pacis</hi> delighting and sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself in the Bowers of Peace and Plenty too, <hi>Unde
haec nobis tanta faelicitas?</hi> we may well indeed make
the demand, whence this is happened unto us above all
others? And may we not as justy answer like St. <hi>James</hi>
here with another demand, <hi>An non hinc? Is it not from
hence?</hi> certainly next unto God and his gracious favour,
from hence it is, that we have a Prince to rule over us
that is <hi>Princeps pacis,</hi> as the Defendour of the Faith, so
a Prince of Peace also. A Prince of su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h mild and
temperate affections, as the eye of envy cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his bosom to be free from those revengefull or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
thoughts, <hi>ab immen sa illa dominandi libidine,</hi>
from that immense and illimited desire of enlarging do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and all other those impotent lusts, that reigning
in the breasts and warring in the members of other Kings,
have so much troubled the world, and like that horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the <hi>Revel.</hi> taken peace from off the earth. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
men are we, did we understand our own happiness, or
rather are we not miserable the more that understanding
our happiness, regard it so little? That notwithstanding
this invaluable blessing of peace, able to swallow up all
petty pretended grievances, can yet hardly, and scarce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
murmuring be brought to contribute any thing for the
preservation of our own felicity, though wrought out with
the care, and brought home unto us with the trouble and
travel of another? An ingratitude able to deprive us of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46181:75"/>
our blessing; and indeed nothing but deprivation, can
teach us rightly how to value it. But then let it come
unto this, set once an <hi>inter vos</hi> upon it, make it your
own case, though but by imagination: Let your fields
be spoiled and your labours wasted, let your eyes behold
the rifling of your houses, the direption and sacking of
your Cities; Let your Sons be numbred unto the Sword,
and your Daughters to reproach and violation; lye but
a while under these, and the like calamities of War, that
usually attend on the victories of proud and insulting
Conquerours, and then consider and say whether any
thing be too dear to redeem that blessing, which you now
have, and think every thing too much, though never so
little, that should be expended for the continuance of it.
May such unthankfulness never bring it to a real case among
us: but sure this and our other iniquities are like enough
to do so. I am neither Prophet nor Son of a Prophet,
only this I say, and a reverend Prelate hath taught it me,
That Mercy and Justice are two Sisters, and as the one hath
had her day, so the other in time may come to have hers
also. For God hath two Arms, two Cups, two Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences:
<hi>Verily there is a reward for the Righteous,</hi> and
doubtless too there is a Judgment in store for unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
murmuring and obstinate sinners. But, 'tis well, as yet
we are free, and blessed ever be God we are so, that we
have now nothing to do with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but have we not

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>neither? we cannot put the question here,
<hi>unde bella?</hi> but may we not, <hi>unde pugnae? whence are
fightings?</hi> I would we might not. Would to God there
were no room for <hi>inter vos</hi> here neither; But however
the tartness of the humour be something allai'd (and you
know still through whose care) yet room there is, and
too much room, if please God, left for making the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<hi>unde sint? whence they are?</hi> and for justifying
the answer too, even from hence, <hi>from she lusts that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46181:75"/>
war in your members.</hi> And it was but time for the Lords
Anointed to set to his helping hand, we were even grown
wanton in destroying the life of one another. A wry
countenance, a mistaken word, any thing was cause e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<hi>non in commodum, sed occidendi causa occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt,</hi>
Men kill, as he said, for no other reason, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to kill, not for profit, but for praise, and since they
conceive there is honour in it, take a pleasure in killing;
As if no matter were fit to build up the aiery Castles of
honour, but such as is tempered with blood; And yet
see the reward, when the Devil by the Laws of
God surrounds and seiseth on the conquered, dying in
malice, and the Hangman by the Laws of the King, gives
the Garland of Honour to the Conquerour: A wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
reward, if any reward may be worthy of such
impiety! How may we say with old <hi>Jacob</hi> unto his
fighting children, cursing their wrath, for it was cruel,
<hi>O my Soul come not into their secret, O mine honour
be thou not ioyned unto their Assembly</hi>; For indeed it
neither is, nor can be esteemed honour with any but the
Assembly of Ruffians and Rodomantado's, Brethren of
the Sword that read Tavern Lectures, and have made
an Art and Philosophy of quarrell, unless it be honour
to Live and Die in the disobedience of God, the King,
and the Church, and to suffer the baseness of those bitter
revenges of all three; for as you have seen them, the
execrations of God and the King, so are the Anathema's
of the Church too, excommunicated <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and not
permitted in other places Christian burial, but cast out
into the common Field, among those beasts they: imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate;
and pity it is not so in our own Church. For he
that dies like a Lion, or rather like a Mastiff, justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
as that Prophet speaketh, <hi>the burial of an Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
But though this be the chief, yet is it not the affectation
of this false honour alone which is the only warring lust,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46181:76"/>
that inforceth these Combatants to the Field. They can
fight sometimes for their money, the Gamesters quarrel:
sometimes for their Consorts in the work of darkness, the
Adulterers quarrel: and sometimes even for pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
the malicious Mans quarrel; when if they miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and perish in the Conflict, The first dies the Worlds,
the second, the Fleshes, the third the Devils Martyr:
And honour still there is no doubt in all three. Are these
Men Christians, trow ye? Certainly I begin almost to
doubt, whether they are within the Verge of this, <hi>inter
vos,</hi> here or no. Sure I am they cannot resolve to fight
these Battels, but they must at the same time resolve to
renounce Christianity: yea and so themselves profess
(and peradventure there is honour in that too) that they
may not, they cannot do it as Christians, only they are
bound to maintain their reputation as Gentlemen. But
what, are the Noble and Ignoble become several species
of Christians, or are there several Gospels, one for the
Peasant, another for the Gentleman to be saved by? I
have read that the great Bishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> could plunder
a Country with his Army, but as a Duke, not as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;
but he was well derided for it by the Countryman
with that sarcastical demand, that when the Duke should
be burning in Hell for such outrages, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the Bishop? And surely when the Gentleman
falling in a Duel shall be damned, we may as justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
with the like derision, what will become of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?
will God and the Devil divide the spoil, come to
the old composition, <hi>nec mihi nec tibi, sed dividatur?</hi> or
will Christ deliver the evil Christian to Satan, and take
the priviledged Gentleman to himself? But not to be
over pleasant in a matter that is serious, I only say thus
much, If the Christian be a Noble Gentleman, let the
Gentleman too be a Noble Christian; Such brute and
barbarous Kites may well be wild branches of Gentilism,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46181:76"/>
but will no way accord with Christianity, or true Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
either; yea the Gentiles themselves, those great
Masters of honour, the old <hi>Romans,</hi> that so eagerly fought
for it, and won it too in just and lawful wars, yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
esteemed it the greatest both Honour and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
too, <hi>privatas injuries magno &amp; excelso animo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terire,</hi>
with an high and a Noble Mind to pass by and
contemn private offences. And therefore he is a Noble
neither Gentile Gentleman, nor Christian that cannot
do the like, but a sordid Vassal unto those base and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<hi>lusts that war in his members</hi>: God and his
Scripture can afford him no other Honour, and with it
I leave him, and pass unto those other fightings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
disceptive, the wars Ecclesiastical, into the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
root and original whereof, we are now to enquire
and consider, <hi>An non hinc?</hi> whether these also issue not
from the same Spring and Well-head, still the head of all
evil, <hi>lust warring in the members.</hi> Are they not
hence?</p>
            <p>Not that these wars neither are on all parts unlawful,
like those latter, because derived from lust: unlawful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are on that side, where lust raiseth errours;
but necessary on the other, where truth seeks to dissolve
them. These are not as Duels, and private Fightings,
but rather as those former solemn and publick Wars; and
as there Lust begets Injury, and Justice repells it; so here
Lust ingenders error, and it is but fidelity to oppose it;
But then we must be sure the error be clear, and of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too, otherwise we may be too forward to make a
war about it. And indeed it will behoove us not to make
or nourish more quarrels here, than needs we must, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
not to prosecute them over-eagerly; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Church, is as a wound in the Soul, or a breach
of the Sea, it may have small beginnings, but nothing
an well make it up again. It sometimes fares with the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46181:77"/>
Watchmen of <hi>Israel,</hi> that have the charge of the Churches
peace, as it did with <hi>Elijahs</hi> servant upon Mount <hi>Carmel;</hi>
At the first looking out peradventure they see nothing;
they look out a second time, and behold a cloud arising
out of the Sea no bigger than a Mans hand; but ere they
can well look about them the third time, the Heaven is
instantly overcast, and down comes a dashing shower,
if not a Tempest upon the Church: if the wood be dry,
a small thing will serve turn to kindle a flame, which
greater pains will not so easily again extinguish. It will
therefore concern us highly to take heed how we strike
fire upon Tinder, or blow that which is strucken: how
we either begin or foment the least sparks of contention,
where the matter round about us is so combustible, and
ready to take fire, as are the affections and fancies of gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
people, prone of themselves to nothing more than
novelty and disobedience. And since it is our office not
to feed such flames, but to quench them, we are to do it
accordingly, as the points shall require. If material and
of moment, by casting on of water even by opposition;
but if otherwise, by withdrawing the Fuel, agreeing or
not furiously striving in unnecessary and difficult disputes.
It is therefore but the idle jealousy of busie Zealots, when
they see any out of this desire of the Churches peace
and union too, as far as may be, not willing to raise or
nourish more controversies than are needful, (where God
knows there are too many already) presently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them for underminers of Religion, betrayers of the
Truth, that deliver it up once more, if not to <hi>Pilate</hi>
yet to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> to be Crucified, either out of fraud, or
I know not what fear, <hi>nè Romani veniant &amp; tollant
gentem:</hi> True, there is no counsel against the Almighty,
and he that shall seek to save any thing by deserting his
truth, doth but take the readiest way to lose it. The
Lord hath said it, and (in such subtleties as the Wiseman
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46181:77"/>
saith, <hi>are fine</hi> but <hi>unrighreous</hi>) ever takes it his honour
to do as he says, <hi>Perdam sapientiam sapientum, I will
destroy the wisdom of the wise, and take them in the
craftiness of their own imaginations.</hi> Alas! who knows
not this as well asthemselves, and who sees not, that in such
points as are apparently noxious and hurtful, for <hi>Sions</hi>
sake we do not, we may not hold our peace, but where
we cannot otherwise joyn, we are ready to joyn battle?
They are the Lords battels, these of all other; and since
the wall of partition is erected on their ground, and the
errors that occasion the War, founded in the <hi>lusts that
war in their members,</hi> we spare not here, as occasion
serves, to lift up our voices, like Trumpets, and stand
prepared to jeopard our lives even unto death in the
high places of the Field, lest the curse of <hi>Meroz</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
us, that bitter Curse by the voice of an Angel,<note place="margin">Judg. v. 23.</note> for
not coming forth unto the help of the Lord: But yet
even in these contentions that are most necessary, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and moderation too, would do well; for violence
or bitterness against Mens Persons may confirm them in
their errors, but is no way able to convert any Man to
the truth. We our selves will not be so converted,
though I doubt not but in case, where sensual Lusts and
desires have stupified the sense, and made Men wilfully
deaf unto milder admonitions, such may sometimes be
rub'd up a little the more roundly. But whether such
terrene affections be the true causes, as of other Wars, so
of these contentions also, we are now to see and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>James</hi> here affirms they are, but by a negative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<hi>Are they not hence?</hi> And he seems to do it
purposely in that form, to see if any Man can except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, or find out any other original. For some have
imployed themselves in the discovery of other Fountains,
and would willingly cast the blame, as well, if not rather
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46181:78"/>
upon the ignorance of Men and the difficulty of the
Scriptures; and indeed in the Scriptures, there are some
things difficult enough, and among Men many ignorant
more than too much; but ignorance in difficulties ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
comes to error and contention, if Men can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be ignorant in what they cannot well understand,
this is, <hi>pia &amp; doct a ignorantia,</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath it, a
pious and a learned ignorance: indeed not so much an
ignorance, as a willing and voluntary necessity, which of
all things else in matters that are thorny and perplexed,
is the best preserver of peace. There may be, no doubt,
abstruse questions enough, proposed by Churchmen and
handled too, but they never come to stirs and strifes in
the Church until they that are ignorant and blind, like
those Pharisees, out of pride or some other Lust, will
needs say and believe too, <hi>that they see;</hi> And then such
guides and their blinder followers, how suddenly are
they both in the ditch plunged over head and ears in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
ere they are aware? Ignorance therefore never
causeth errour and dissention, unless one Lust or other
doth first cause the ignorance: so St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things are hard to be understood</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles,
which yet hurts none but <hi>unlearned and unstable</hi> Men;
Men carried about, it seems, with diverse Lusts, like empty
Clouds with several winds, who therefore pervert such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
places to their own destruction; and let it ever be
their own blame, not the Scriptures, which are most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
wrested to the adulterating of that very truth
which themselves do deliver. But the holy Scripture is
not composed only of difficulies, it hath shallows in it,
and Fords where the Lamb may wade, as well as Pools
and Pits, where the Elephant may swim, yea and drown
too. As there are exquisite rarities to depel satiety, so is
there solid food enough too, to satisfy hunger; And in
these that are universally necessary unto life, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46181:78"/>
are so clear and free from difficulty, as there is no
room for ignorance, did not Men look on them through
the false Spectacles of their deceitful affections; For <hi>if
the Gospel be hid, it is hid unto those that perish,</hi> to
those, whole Eyes the God of this world hath blinded,
saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly; neither doth the God of this world
otherwise blind them, but by exhaling the vapours of
worldly Lusts, that darken and pervert the judgment.
Whether therefore we recur either to the difficulty of
the Scripture, or ignorance of Men; we are still brought
back in conclusion, according to St. <hi>James</hi> here, to the
lusts of their members, as the true and proper causes from
whence such bitter contentions in the Church have been
raised, nourished, and with such violence prosecuted,
for <hi>are they not hence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence indeed they are, so much the very demand
doth import; but 'tis not enough to say so, we must
shew it too, as well as say it. And that may not well be
done, unless we condescend unto some particulars, take
a short view of these several Lusts, and see a little what
several errours they have begotten, and with them what
contentions in the Church. Love and Hatred, if misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
are the two radical Lusts that both found and foster
all others. Those that proceed from Love, the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscible
part of the Soul, are either from the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Love of Pleasure, or of Profit or Honour, which the
beloved Disciple terms, <hi>the lusts of the flesh, the lusts
of the Eye, and the pride of Life,</hi> and these are all either
worldly or sensual: But those that issue from Hatred, the
irascible part, whether from the hatred of peace, or of
truth, are more directly Devilish; And therefore our
St. <hi>James</hi>
               <note place="margin">James iii. 15.</note> a little before reduceth them all unto three
heads. <hi>But if there be bitter emulation and strife among
you, this wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
sensual, and devilish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:46181:79"/>
To begin the instance with that terrene and worldly
affection of Pride and Vain-glory (though this hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Devil in it too) what a fruitful Mother hath it
ever been of dissentions in Religion? and how many
ways hath she hatched and brought forth her deformed
issue? Sometimes by an itching desire of knowing all
things, which boldly searching into hidden secrets leaves
nothing unransacked, whereby it may appear more
learned: And then what such men conceive their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
speculations with much travel have drawn up out
of the depth of night and darkness, lest they should lose
the price of their labour, they obtrude upon others as
necessary to be believed. It was most rightly said, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Heretick yet, that racked the bowels of the Church,
but his pretence was for truth; and Men do usually fall
so deeply in love with the conceited truth of their own
invention, as all their pains seems to be lost, unless they
may press it too upon the Conscience of every Man else.
And then when probable conceipts come to be published
for necessary truths, and speculations of fancy are once
turned into Articles of Faith (as we see it hath fallen
out, as in many others, so in the new Platform of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial
Purity, at first conceived but for a convenient
Regiment, yet afterwards men becoming more enamour'd
with their own conceptions, came to be urged at length
for the necessary discipline of Christ, clearly commanded
in Scripture, as the Scepter upon Earth and very King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Saviour,) no marvel then I say, if contentions
be not only raised, but eagerly and obstinately pursued
also; which yet are rendred the more violent by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
elation of mind that can well away with no supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority:
And those, that by other mundane desires, are
driven to endure it, yet how Heavenly do they do it?
How do they mumur against the power of their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents,
like <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram, Ye take</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:46181:79"/>
               <hi>too much upon you, ye Sons of Aaron,</hi> and much ado they
have, not to say so of <hi>Moses</hi> too. Doubtless the cry in
their hearts, is but that Conspiracy in the <hi>Psalmist, Let
us break their bonds asunder, and cast their cords
from us.</hi> Sometimes again by an higher degree of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
that will admit of no equality, that as the former
would be subject unto none, so this would have all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto himself.

               </q>
The one like <hi>Caesar,</hi> the other like <hi>Pompey,</hi> That can
endure no Superiour, nor This brook any Equal: And
on this ground it was, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church first brake
with the <hi>Roman,</hi> whose Bishop against right and reason,
the rule of Christ, and decree of the Fathers, as she just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taxed him, did arrogate unto himself a plenitude of
power. And from the same fountain have issued those
Waters of strife which do at this day overflow, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
drown all Christendom. Lastly, by an ambitious
desire of Secular Rule and Empire; For there are not
wanting examples in story sacred and prophane of such
as have brought in new Religions, or fitted the old unto
the Palate of the People, by this means to retain their
own, or gain unto themselves the Territories and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
of others; To this end <hi>Jeroboam</hi> first made an

               </hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> lest the ten Tribes by going up year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to sacrifice, as they were commanded,
should chance to return in time unto the house of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
from whence they were rent. And I could with such secular
and politick respects had no power among any of

should return again unto the house of <hi>Levi,</hi> or rather
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46181:80"/>
of God, from whence they are rent, (it were pretty
well, if they could rest contented there,) but rather
that such regards might not prevail with them, in the
desire and intention of a farther renting, to animate our
mutinous contenders and egg on their contentions, that
look that way; I hope there are no such crafty Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
as he terms them, that put in their stock among the
brawling Bankers, help to trouble the Waters, supposing
in time to make another good fishing for themselves.
Though it is to be feared, some Consciences there may be
in the world extensive enough, and patent to swallow
even a Cathedral on the top of an Abby, and never trouble
the Stomach of it much with the digestion neither. It
little matters for Sacriledge, they abhor Idols, and that
is sufficient. But this appertains not so properly unto
Ambition as unto Avarice, the second of these earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but no less contentious and turbulent than the
former. The Apostle well terms it <hi>radix omnium ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi>
the root of all evil, and especially so it is, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the root of dissention, <hi>for where envying and strife
is, there is confusion and every evil work.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. iii. 16.</note> This therefore
a second Parent, and Nurse too of this viperous brood
of errour and contention: For what a multitude of erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
but gainful pardons and dispensations, purgations
and expiations of sin, what indulgences to commit, or
else to continue in manifest wickedness, what translation
of other mens merits on those that want of their own,
and the like, hath this affection conceived, and brought
into the world, and that not for morsels of bread, or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of barley only, as that Prophet, but all, like <hi>Judas,</hi>
for pieces of Silver? Such Silverlings what are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but <hi>Judas's, quaestui habentes pietatem,</hi> saith St.
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that make other mens goodness their
own gain, yea and their wickedness too? Both are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
the Churches Treasure, that may not be dispensed,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46181:80"/>
nor these purged without money: So that Purgatory is
but a Subterraneous Vault, digged only to come at a
Mine, and that <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> though it be but fantastical
and imaginary, yet it serves turn to melt Bullion into his
Holinesses Mint more abundantly, than any Princes fire
else, that is real; And therefore it is not to be wondred
at, if much stir be made, and many bellows ever blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to keep it from going out. On the other side are there
not others to whom the Apostle long since prophesied,
that speak perverse things to draw Disciples after them,
out of whom they suck no small advantage? such as can
lead silly women Captive laden with sins and divers
lusts, that like their fore-Fathers, the old Pharisees, can
creep into Widows houses, and devour too under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of long Prayers? that can teach the Son of a profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte
to say unto the Father, or rather the Wife <hi>Corban</hi>
unto the Husband, if not a proselyte as themselves?
Nay, until they become such, that neither the one, nor
the other hath any just title unto his own goods, which
therefore may be purloyned from them with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
if it be to supply the necessity of the Saints, the right
owners of them. Is not this likewise, as the same Apostle,
<hi>Veritatem cauponari,</hi> to make merchandise of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of truth, or rather of their own fancies and falshood?
Against all which questuous errours of such sheepskin'd
Wolves on either side, when the true and faithful sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
shall oppose himself, when these Flints and this
Steel begin to knock and collide together, out fly the
sparks of dissention, that inflame presently and set the
world in combustion. Hence <hi>Luther</hi> stoutly opposing
the Marts and Markets of the Roman Indulgencies, and
whipping those buyers and sellers out of the Temple,
first began that battery which since we see hath made
such a wide breach in the very Towers of their <hi>Babel.</hi>
But these <hi>wars and contentions</hi> are <hi>sensual,</hi> saith St.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46181:81"/>
               <hi>James,</hi> as well as earthly: and sure pleasure is of little less
power with us, than profit: And whether we take it
strictly for the concupiscence of carnal things, or more
generally, for a desire of sinning freely and without sting of
Conscience, hath her part in these Tragedies, and brings
not a little oyle unto the flames of contention; For this
affection, finding the doctrine of the Cross grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, whose chief desire it is to injoy the delights of this
life, and from them to pass into the joys of a better, hath
for this purpose sought out Doctors, such as may comply
with her desires, and it seems hath found them too, and that
by heaps;<note place="margin">2 Tim. iv. 3.</note> so saith the Apostle, <hi>they heap up unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Teachers after their own Lusts.</hi> I confess, I should
not a little admire why the Romanist that is so strict in
discipline, should yet in life be as loose as any; whence it
should be, that pressing the necessity of good works so
vehemently in their Doctrine, few men yet seem to want
them or commit the contrary with less trouble to their
Conscience; did not their enormous dispensing with Oaths
of fidelity and horrible Incests, their supplying of some
mens empty Lamps with other mens Oyl, their enlarging
of Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al Sins, and their easiness of Absolution in such as
are Mortal, and serving others the like, take off that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration:
Not that I dislike the distinction of Mortal Sins
and Venial rightly stated, or yet the use of dispensation in
the Church, much less of Absolution; but only the abuse
of these things, which yet I think are more abused by
particular Persons, sensual Priests, and presumptuous
people, than by the general Doctrine of that Church,
though so abused also: And I would we had no abuses tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that way at home: For some there are so strict in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and yet withal so dissolute in their Doctrine,
and the unavoidable inferences of it, as would make a
man admire on the other side, why they should not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
teach, as they profess, or else profess plainly, as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46181:81"/>
they teach; such as can distinguish also of Venial and
Mortal Sins, but in another manner, not from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Sin, but the Condition of the Person; The
best works they can do, are deadly unto some, whilst the
deadliest iniquities they commit, shall be but Venial in
the mean time unto themselves, as not making any breach
between God and their Souls, even then, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them, yea as pardoned with a <hi>non obstante</hi> before
they are committed; such as having no part of true
righteousness in themselves, yet even then by Faith and
Faith alone may have the Merits imputed, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
too of another: such as can actually commit Mortal
iniquities, and yet at the same time remain still habitually
Righteous: such as can exclude good works from the
gaining of their justification, and when they have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, can lose it no more by any works that are evil:
such as need not care what sins their flesh committeth,
so long as they act them not without some reluctancy
of the spirit. For so sin the godly; and since no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
have any commerce with the internal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Spirit, as being altogether flesh, they can even
from the enormity of their sins grieving the Holy
Ghost, conclude the very certainty of their Salvation,
as no way else more certain that the Holy Ghost is
within them. No marvel sure if these and many other
their sweet and comfortable positions have easily found
such multitudes of Disciples in the world, or that they
contend so eagerly and strive for them <hi>tanquam pro aris
&amp; focis,</hi> as for the main points of their Religion and
Faith, or whatsoever else is dear unto them. And less
marvel it is, that these Disciples should be so free and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-handed
unto their Teachers, when their Teachers
understanding their desires are so favourable unto their
Disciples: For certainly next unto that of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
I know not any Doctrine else in these days so kind and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46181:82"/>
courteous unto flesh and blood, or in the Genius and just
consequences more impure and dissolute, than that of
those who of all others most profess strictness and purity.
But so it is fit such corrupt people, and their hired Priests
should claw one another, but scratch and lacerate every
Man else. You have seen the earthly and sensual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Love, the love of Honour, Profit and Pleasure,
blowing the coals of dissention; there is one blast of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
behind, and that will shew it to be Devilish also.
For there are not wanting instruments of Satan most like
himself, malignant Spirits, that without the help of
these respects can find in their hearts meerly out of the
hatred of Peace and Truth too, some of them, to raise
Cavils and Contentions in the World, such as those of
whom <hi>Salust</hi> speaks, <hi>Quibus quiet a movere magna merces

of People, that cannot endure to live without an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
such as <hi>Trogus</hi> pronounceth the old <hi>Spaniard, adeo
infensum concordiae, ut puro illius odio inimicitias
suscipiat:</hi> Fishes that cannot live but in Flood-hatches,
Salamanders that die, but in the flames of Contention.
But some of these are of an higher pitch, and have their
aim even at Truth it self; and though for the most part
but Table and Trencher Mates for buffoonery; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their scurrilous prophaneness, they can sometimes
be bold to argue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and it is marvellous to consider what
scruples of difficulty they move, what knots of Sophistry
they knit, what accusations on all sides these Scepticks
frame, and this to no other purpose, but to puzle the
World in the already difficult search of verity; hoping
that others upon despair of finding out the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
may come at length to conceipt, as themselves in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46181:82"/>
favour of their Epicurism do, that there may be no truth
in any; for this can be no other beast, than that which
we term an Atheist, something worse than Devilish. For
<hi>the Devil doth believe and tremble.</hi> And such are the
true causes of those Wars, from whence proceed all the
wounds and breaches, that are or have been made in the
Church. Other prejudices and partialities there are ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from them, that keep these wounds open, and will
not permit them to close again; but this may suffice for
the present to verifie the answer of St. <hi>James</hi> in this his
responsive demand, <hi>For are they not hence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the intent of all this search into the beginnings
and first Fountains of Dissention and War, is but to lead
us in the end into the way of Reconciliation and Peace.
This was the purpose of St.<hi>James</hi>'s enquiry, and it should
be ours. Shall we then for conclusion of all change the
question, let go <hi>unde bella,</hi> and demand now at last
clean contrary, <hi>unde Pax?</hi> From whence comes Peace?
from whence amidst all these stirs may that be procured?
If we do so, <hi>An non hinc,</hi> is at hand, comes it not hence,
even from removing those Lusts and corrupt affections,
that are the causes of War? Many good means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
indeed have been sought out and applied to cool
the burning heat of these Feavors of Dissention, and yet
all but Empirical palliations, for a time peradventure
affording some ease; but hope of health or recovery
there is not any, untill the putrid humours shall be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, that cause and feed the distemper: All other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
of decision, or ways of pacification, which Men
can either propose or practise without this, are too fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and weak for the purpose; For what, are the Fathers
they that may give end to these differences? There is a
reverence belonging unto them, and let them have it;
but how should they finish the broils of after times, that
could not pacify the stirs of their own? Shall the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46181:83"/>
Councils give the definitive Sentence? But what if
they handle not all the controversies among themselves?
How if a good Cause found ill Pleaders, and so fell, not
through its own weakness, but fearful silence, or unskilful
defence? None of these are impossible, yea some say,
that all of them have fallen out. Shall then a present
Council clear all doubts? There is little hopes of any
such, that shall be Oecumenical; and were there any
such, less hope but that it would be carried by Faction. Or
else is the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> the Man, on whose peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
definitions we must all rely? But this is one of the
points of controversie, the mainest one, and in such he
may not be his own Judge. It is not any of these, nor
indeed any thing else, that may restore us our peace:
Not that device of an implicite and infolded Faith, for
these Controversies are between great Clerks, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
only to the ignorant and simple; Not that Law of
the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> which forbids all disputes in point of
Religion (though in impertinent curiosities of excellent
use, and whilst Spirits are inraged in others too, that are
material) for so every Man may teach dogmatically what
he list, and be sure to be controled by no Man; Not that
position of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that every one may be saved in
his own Religion; for it is impious, though peradventure
true enough, if his own be the Christian Religion, yet
not of force enough to allay Contentions, for we are to
consider what is likely, as well as what is possible, and
Errours that are dangerous must be oppugned as well as
such as are absolutely deadly. No not the decision by
Miracles, for we are forewarned against them: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
must come with all false signs and lying wonders, able
to seduce if it were possible the very Elect of God. Nor

do, nor any thing else, the Devil may; for some have
been so shameless to repair even thither for the ending
of controversies, adjuring and conjuring by Spells and
Exorcisms Satan himself to give answer out of possessed
bodies, as out of his Prophetick Charms, unto the truth
of his disputed Articles: A strange remedy and desperate
as their cause, that would establish truth in Religion by
the Spirit of Errour, and Father of Lies. Neither these,
nor any thing else can prevail. Authority may restrain,
wise Men may mollifie and perswade, but neither the
power of the Magistrate, nor skill of the Learned are
both able to effect it; whatsoever remedies the Wit and
Confidence of either dare, or any Catholick Moderator
else, yea of the great <hi>Cassander</hi> himself may invent or
propound, until every Man seek to remedy one, will be
found too weak for the purpose; they are all either
dangerous, or not fully profitable Plaisters, if not malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and hurtful, yet at best too narrow for the Sore, and
unable to pierce unto the root of the Malady; It is only
the removing of those inordinate Lusts, the causes of War,
that is able to give us a true and durable Peace; For the
bitterness of the streams must be cured at the Fountain,
and the fire quenched by subduction of the fuel, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
effects will ever issue from their causes; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>the wisdom which is from above,</hi> saith my St. <hi>James,
is: first pure, then peaceable;</hi> And our Saviour observes
the same method in his benedictions:<note place="margin">Matt. V.</note> first, <hi>blessed are the
pure in heart,</hi> and then immediately, <hi>blessed are the
peace-makers;</hi> for until the heart which is the Fountain
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46181:84"/>
be purged, there is no expectation of Peace. We may
therefore cast up our Eyes towards Heaven, and profess
outwardly as much purity as we please, but so long as
we are contentious, and at opposition still with the
Church and her peace, it is a manifest sign our Wisdom is
not from above, nor yet our selves so pure in Heart, as we
should be; For were the Heart once well purged and
purified from these earthly and sensual desires, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the Soul, and darken the mind, what peaceable and
peace-making affections would succeed, what calmness
and serenity, able to clear the eye of the Soul in discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evident truth, and to temper the passions of the Soul
in such truths, as are not easily discernable? And so end
most controversies and at least moderate all, teaching us,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>sapere ad sobrietatem,</hi> to be wise, but
unto sobriety, or as St. <hi>James, to shew forth our works
in the meckness of wisdom;</hi> For soberness, meekness,
patience, gentleness, brotherly-kindness, love and the like,
these are the high and proper effects of the Wisdom, which
is <hi>desuper</hi> from above, but may not descend into a Soul
filled already with those Lusts, that are <hi>desubter</hi> from
flesh and earthly things beneath. Virtues and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
these, that seem to restore the Soul to her native
beauty, render it sweet and amiable, and of all other
makes her most like unto her Saviour: Vertues therefore
so peculiar unto his Gospel as it breaths almost no other
language; And were that Gospel, a while obeyed rather
than disputed, obeyed in necessary duties, rather than
disputed in speculative difficulties, it would soon be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, what it is in it self, <hi>Evangelium pacis</hi> a Gospel of

            <p>AS there is nothing more necessary, so is there not
any thing of greater difficulty, than to draw man
unto a true thankfulness for Gods Mercies, or a
just acknowledgment of his own Errours. It
will not be easie for his Ministers to prevail in that here,
which could not be done in Paradise, no not by God
himself, where although it were not the first Sin (for it
doth of necessity suppose a former) yet it was the second

            </p>
            <p>And such as was then, such or worse is still the corrupt
and stubborn disposition of a Sinner, who, though his
own guilty Conscience make him hide his head in a bush
for shame, yet thinks any Fig-leaves of excuse will serve
turn to cover his nakedness from those Eyes, unto which
all things are transparent; A crime we have received from
our fore-Fathers, that first used it; the Teats of <hi>Eve</hi> gave
no other milk, than this perversness unto all her Children.
In good and laudable actions every man can readily teach
his mouth to kiss his hand, as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, to commend
and applaud the work, and be content to receive the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
unto himself: But if the question be of our Errours
and misdeeds, how do we labour and sweat to convey
the burthen from our own shoulders! How ingenious
presently is the froward nature of most men to knit the
Stoical Chain of destiny, and (be the action never so
detestable and vile) to fasten the first Link not to the
foot of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Chair, the Stars and Constellations of
Heaven, but, which is a degree beyond the Stoicks, to the
very arm of the Almighty! In this case we are all grown
acute Philosophers, and can climb the physical Scale
of Causes, as if it were <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, until by it we
ascend into Heaven, yea into the very closet of God,
where they will search the Book of hidden Counsels and
eternal Decrees, and from thence draw dark and blind
consequences of inevitable and fatal necessity, rather than
flesh and blood should want wherewith to plead with its
Maker; That as the men of the Man of sin have devised
a compendious way by one position to answer all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against their Doctrin, namely That their Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
err: So these men have found out as brief a Tenent
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46181:85"/>
to stop the mouth of all reproof in the Errours and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
of their life, to wit, that they cannot chuse but err;
As if they had no means to decline the punishment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they drew in God to be a Party in the offence. But
it were good that Man would plead with Man, that <hi>the
Potsheard would contend with the Potsheards of the
Earth, as Isaiah</hi> speaks, and not with his Creator; whose
Scepter is a rod of Iron, wherewith he can at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
bruise the vessel of the Potter, <hi>for he hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his clay:</hi> A power, notwithstanding which how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
he is to use, and how justly at length he doth
use, and how mercifully he forbears to use, we are in these
few words by God himself given to understand, that so
we might cease to wrangle with the Divine Justice, that
is so loth to strike. <hi>O Israel!</hi> words of great compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and learn to condemn our selves and our own sins in
the evil we suffer, when it doth strike. <hi>Thou hast destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy self.</hi> And to bless and adore God for all the good
we either do or receive when in special mercy it doth
not strike,—<hi>but in me is thy help: O Israel, thou hast
destroyed thy self, but &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Israel</hi> is a word that wants not ambiguities, for
all are not <hi>Israel,</hi> that are of <hi>Israel:</hi> There are Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
of the seed, and Israelites of the Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
There are Sons of flesh, and Sons of the promise, and
<hi>Israel</hi> is the Church of God, the womb that conceives
and bears both. <hi>Duoe Gentes in utero:</hi> It is <hi>Rebekahs</hi>
womb, in which <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> and in them two
mighty Nations do contend and strive; It is the Net in
the Gospel, that contains things both good and bad; The
Fold, that hath Sheep and Goats; The Field, that hath
Tares and Wheat; The Barn-floor, that hath Wheat and
Chaff. So then to collect the sum and substance of those
points, which this Scripture doth especially present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
consideration:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:46181:86"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Here are first, two sorts of people, the Good and the
Bad, Elect and Reprobate, implied in <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the two several Ends of those two sorts, Life
and Death, Destruction and Salvation: for the help here
may be none other than help from destruction, and that
can be nothing else than Salvation, and so some Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
render it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And lastly, the two several causes of those ends, God
and Man; God, of life; Man, of death; God the cause
of Salvation unto the Elect, and the Reprobate the cause
of destruction unto themselves; whereby neither those
that are saved, may sacrifice unto their own Nets, nor
they which perish, lay any blame on his decrees; these
being no less deprived of all excuse, than those bereaved
of all boasting. <hi>O Israel, thou hast, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That these words may have a true and litteral under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Calamities and Deliverances incident unto
this present life, that which immediately goes before in
the precedent verse, <hi>I will meet them as a Bear bereaved
of her whelps, &amp;c.</hi> will not suffer any Man to doubt:
But that they are only and principally meant of such,
and not of eternal destruction, and Salvation in them,
that which follows, will permit no man to believe, <hi>I
will ransome them from the power of the grave: I will
redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plague,
O grave, I will be thy destruction:</hi>
               <note place="margin">verse 14.</note> words that do not
carry a sound of momentany affliction. And therefore
this illustrious promise, or Prophecy, or both, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle

to be blamed, who in a late and negligent tract of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,
having so ordered the state of Reprobation,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46181:86"/>
as he saw God thereby must needs become the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Procurer of his Creatures endless destruction,
lest this place here, <hi>Oh Israel thou hast destroyed thy
self,</hi>
should cross his intent, or hinder his building, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that it is meant of such destruction only as pertains
unto the present World; as if there were not one and the
same cause of destruction in both, nay as if it were more
prejudicial unto God, and his Justice, to be the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
cause of slight and short troubles here, than of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
and everlasting sorrows in Hell hereafter. It is
strange he should rather seek an answer, than acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the truth of so excellent a sentence: A sentence,
that is indeed the very line and level, whereby himself
and every one else, must direct and square all his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
that concern those eternal appointments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of a just and merciful God. It is the best if not the
only Star and Card and Compass too, on which the weak
age of reason must continually fix it self, whilst it Steers
in this dangerous Navigation, in this immense and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
Sea of Predestination, in which <hi>Abyssus Abyssum
invocat,</hi> one Deep calls upon another, Deep upon Deep
and Rock upon Rock, so thick, that in seeking to avoid
the one, unless this Golden Rule be our direction, we
shall be sure to strike and split upon the other, as many
that have sailed before us, have done, whose Bark and
burthen should never have perished, had this notable
Saying sate Pilot at the Helm, by whose shipwrack we
may learn wisdom to beware. For some of the first and
best Reformers of the Roman Superstition, justly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at the Pelagian freedom of the Papist, whereby Man
is made the first mover unto his own good, striving with
all their might to bear up from this <hi>Charybdis,</hi> fell foul
upon <hi>Sylla</hi> on the other side, and instead of <hi>Pelagian</hi>
liberty brought in more than <hi>Manichean</hi> necessity,
whereby God is as far intitled unto Mans ill: Both in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46181:87"/>
extreams and both extreamly to be blamed; the former
being not able fully to say, <hi>In thee is our Salvation,</hi>
unto God; the latter, <hi>Thou hast destroyed thy self,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Man. <hi>Arminius</hi> of late, an Acute Dutchman, steps
forth to reform these Reformers, whose main Errour not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
which he should have condemned especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he is found especially to imitate, fleying where he
should but sheer, and flying from one extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when the truth lies between both. For as they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a worthy dislike of a conditional Election upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
merits, through heat or ignorance, come to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an absolute Reprobation; so he out of his as worthy
dislike of this Iron and Adamantine decree of absolute
Reprobation without demerits, fell back again unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Election: In both, both of them equally erring,
the truth lying equally distant from both, so as it is not
easie to judge, (Election upon good works being dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to the freeness of Gods mercy, and Reprobation
without evil unto the Truth of his Justice) whether
contains the greater impiety? The one gives too much
unto Man in the work of Salvation; The other too much
unto God in the means of damnation. My Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
both, the former in the latter part, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the former. <hi>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self,
but in me is thy help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as in Errours, so are their portions not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
in Truth. For <hi>Arminius</hi> election upon foresight,
and his Adversaries absolute reprobation are not more
false, than their absolute Election, and his Reprobation
upon foresight are, as I conceive it, apparently true;
which is not the least reason, that they which are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and friends in all other points, sweetly conspiring
against the common Enemy, should with such violent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
enter into this Civil War amongst themselves;
For there is no stronger nourishment unto mutual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46181:87"/>
than when either side shall behold some demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
truths in his own, and as gross and palpable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in the others opinion: It can hardly chuse but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
prejudice and partiality in either: with which spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles,
that alter the quality, and double the quantity
of things, if once Men come to read or judge, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
if there follow a stiff and stubborn defence, and as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and peremptory prosecution on both sides; <hi>Paries
jam proximus ardet.</hi> Hence it is, that the neighbour
Countrys are in so great combustion, and it may well
be feared, lest some sparks of their flame, if neglected,
should kindle a fire of the like contention somewhere else.
So that, that which judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> observed between
Reverend <hi>Beza</hi> and his Adversary in the question of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
that they had made an even division
of the truth, may well be verified of <hi>Arminius</hi> and his
followers, with their opposers, the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and
<hi>Contra Remonstrants,</hi> as they term themselves in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
as they that have no less equally shared both
Truth and Errour between them. And the reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, for that either seeking to rectifie the croocked opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the other, deals with it as he would do with a
crooked stick, bending it as far unto the one side, as he
found it before inclining unto the other: and indeed it is
the best way to bring the stick to the straight line between
both; But opinions are not like rods that have springs in
them they draw rather unto the nature of a <hi>Lesbian</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
rule, where you bend them, there they stand. The
cure by contraries is not always good in the sickness of
the Body, seldom or never in Errours, the Diseases of
the mind; because Truth for the most part, like Virtue,
dwells between two contrary extreams, that are vitious.
The <hi>Persian Manes,</hi> who well deserved that name from
the <hi>Grecian</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for his unsound Doctrine that carries
so much madness in it, had not long established his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46181:88"/>
in one extream, by fastning upon Mans will a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
necessity unto evil by creation; but our Countryman
<hi>Pelagius</hi> directly opposeth and confronts him with his
Heresie in the other, by giving unto Mans will a natural
freedom unto good after corruption. The Truth in the
mean time evenly wades between both, affirming the
corruption of Nature, but by freedom of will against
<hi>Manes,</hi> and in this corruption no freedom but by grace
against <hi>Pelagius.</hi> In like sort <hi>Nestorius</hi> in the Primitive
Church is so earnest for the distinction of two Natures
in Christ, as he divides his Person: and <hi>Eutyches</hi> on the
other side is so intent unto the unity of Christs Person, as
he confounds his Natures: the Catholick verity holds the
Golden mean, a distinction of two Natures in the unity
of one Person. After the same manner it fareth here;
<hi>Arminius</hi> is so violent to remove God from being the
Author of evil, as he makes Man the first mover unto
good; His Adversaries on the other side are so desirous
to intitle God unto our good, as they lay a necessity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Man of his evil; the one through a respective Election,
and the other by an absolute Reprobation. The truth,
as I take it, lies here also between these two, that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;
I am sure the opinion of St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
according to the tenour of my Text, the just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
of Mans destruction upon his own voluntary diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
by a respective Reprobation against the one,
and giving the honour unto the free Grace of God in
our good and Salvation, by an absolute Election against
the other. And the Coherence of these two, an absolute
Election, and a Reprobation upon foresight, if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
sin to preceed either, as of necessity we must, if not
in act yet in prescience, is clear and manifest; For the
Reprobation is respective, where there is a desert of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
but the Election absolute, when all deserve
nothing but Reprobation. Thus <hi>veritas inter haereses,</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:46181:88"/>
the truth doth evermore hang crucified between two here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
like Christ,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>(whose it is,) between two Thieves.</p>
            <p>Of these three, The one making both the Decrees ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
must needs withal make God the Author as well of
evil, as of good; The other making both upon foresight,
must needs make man the author as well of good as of
evil; Only the mean making one absolute, and the other
upon foresight, doth withal make God the author of mans
good, and yet leaves man to be the procurer of his own
hurt. It was a witty and a pleasant saying of <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the Emperour comparing himself with the Kings of
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> together, That there were but three
Kings in the time wherein he lived, <hi>Rex Hominum, Rex
Asinorum, Rex Regum.</hi> The <hi>Spanish,</hi> a King of men,
because he used them ingenuously and liberally, as men:
The <hi>French,</hi> of Asses, for the immoderate exactions he
took of them: Himself a King of Kings, for they would
do only what themselves pleased. What was by him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
spoken of those three Kings, may not unfitly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
for sundry respects unto these three opinions: The
first whereof leaves reasonable creatures no more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in their actions than if they were beasts: The second
gives them so much, as if they were left like Kings to the
government of their own wills: The third only squares
with the liberty of men, to whom it gives Election and
Choice, whereby they exceed Beasts, but that in their
Spiritual good sweetly guided and governed by divine
Grace, whereby they fall short of absolute Kings. The
one makes God a Tyrannical, the other a Titular, the last
a real and a just King; A King that will be <hi>justified
in his sayings, and overcome when he is judged; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem

undeservedly, nor saving any man deservedly; that so
neither the ones boasting should be true if he say he hath
merited grace, nor the others complaint just, if he say he
hath not merited punishment. And indeed both are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to renounce either, since both have deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and both received undeserved grace; for either
part of my Text may have a convenient sense appliable
unto either sort of men: The Elect in some sort have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
themselves, and the Reprobate in some sort have
had help from God; For as these, unless they had help,
could not rightly be said to have destroyed themselves;
so neither they, unless they had or would have destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves, could rightly be said to have had help
from God. The Reprobate then have had sufficient help,
and the Elect have done sufficient to deserve destruction;
yet so as we must still remember, that we are especially
to appropriate the first, that is destruction, to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
who only shall be actually destroyed; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that is help, to the Elect, who only are effectually
holpen. But howsoever the Reprobate have the first
place, and the Elect the second, as they here lie in my
Text; yet since Election is in order precedent unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
I hope I may have good leave so to order it,
setting the first last, and the last first, as in Nature and
dignity they deserve. And therefore reserving the second
place, and ending of this discourse unto the destruction
of the wicked, that shall never end; we will begin,
through the help of God, with that help and salvation
which the Elect receive of God by a Decree that never
had beginning, but is as Eternal, as he himself, who for
this respect here saies, <hi>In me is thy help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the feet of whose Divine Majesty I now cast
my self, humbly beseeching and imploring his aid and
assistance unto my Heart and Tongue in these high
and secret Mysteries, that I may speak nothing but what
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46181:89"/>
is agreeable unto his holy word, and that with such reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as becomes his Majesty, and this Sacred Place.</p>
            <p>Since this whole sentence, as I said, is appliable unto
either sort of people, it followeth, that before we speak of
this special help of the Elect, we say something of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
whereunto this help doth relate; wherein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
we shall not need to spend much time; for
that the Elect of God have destroyed themselves, that is,
were and are in themselves worthy of destruction, none,
I think, do either doubt or deny: Only concerning the
order and precedence, question hath been made, some
giving the priority unto Election, affirming that they were
first elected, who afterwards through sin came to deserve
destruction, as thinking it impossible that the merit of
destruction, as being a temporal Act, should preceed the
free mercy of God established by an eternal Decree, and
thereby, (which is the cause of no few errours) invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and perverting both the order of my Text, and the
nature of the things, strangely presupposing help or sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
without supposing any former destruction, which
such relative terms must of necessity respect: As strange a
contradiction, as if they should say that punishing Justice
did precede the fault which it doth punish, or acts of mercy
might be extended on those that never were in misery;
For since the decrees of Election and Reprobation are
made and ordained by the same properties in God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men are punished or saved, it follows, that as Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
must needs be an act of punishing Justice, so Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an effect of contrary Mercy. And herein doth consist
the special difference between the Predestination of Men
and Angels: For their Election was a mercy preserving
them from falling into the pit of destruction: But ours a
mercy raising us up, and drawing us out of that destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereinto we were faln: Theirs may better be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Goodness, than Mercy, because it is not opposite
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46181:90"/>
unto Justice, as ours is, and therefore is not goodness, but
strictly and properly the mercy of God: now <hi>Miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae

of Mercy is misery, saith St. <hi>Bernard.</hi>

whereby they are certainly saved whosoever are saved:
And what are these benefits but a new heart and a new
Spirit, begotten through effectual grace, and a powerful
vocation unto sincere repentance, and to lively faith in
the death and blood of the Son of God? Now what have
any of these to do with Innocency? To whom else may
they belong, but a sinner, but to one subjected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
unto that destruction, from whence he could not
be delivered but by the mercy of such a Redeemer?
As for the reason drawn from the time of sin and the
Decree of Salvation before all time, the deceit and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of that doth apparently consist in a wrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of an external Act of mans, with an internal Act
of Gods; when the comparison should have been, if
rightly made, between two internal acts of God: for mans
work is here to be considered, not as it was done by him,
but as it was foreseen by God; and then, if thus taken,
you shall easily find the temporary sin of man to be no
less eternal in Gods prescience, than the deliverance from
it, or punishment for it could be in his Decree: For as
Gods Electing doth in order of necessity presuppose the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46181:90"/>
foresight of their being that are elected, though they be
elected before they be, <hi>quia objectum prius est in se
quàm objiciatur actus in ipsum tendenti:</hi> So for the
same reason, that it doth presuppose this positive foresight
of their being, it must also the permissive of their being
miserable, because Election is from mercy, and mercy,
as is said, doth always presuppose its object, which is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
It follows therefore, to conclude this point, that
the very Elect of God acknowledge to the praise of the
riches of his exceeding free compassion, that when he in
his secret determination set it down, Those shall live
and not die, they lay, as ugly spectacles before him, as
Lepers covered with dung and mire, as Ulcers putrified
in their Fathers Loins, miserable and worthy of nothing,
but to be had in detestation. In the proof whereof, I
have made the longer stay, partly because it opens a
passage for some things that must follow anon, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that the truth of St. <hi>Austins</hi> opinion might more
clearly appear, affirming, that in the search of Election
and Reprobation, no mans wit should presume to ascend
above the miserable mass of corruption. Mans Nature
at first was by Creation Gold, but Sin was the poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<hi>menstruum,</hi> the <hi>aqua regis</hi> more than Chymical, that
dissolved it and drew off the purer parts, leaving unto
us nothing but this earth and these <hi>faeces</hi> of that Gold.
Thus was his fall a great fall indeed, from the purity of
Gold, to the vility of Clay; and this Clay is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
lump, meant by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> over which he grants
with the Apostle, that the <hi>Potter hath power thereout to
frame Vessels either to dishonour or honour as it pleaseth
him best.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. ix.</note> The one being their desert, the other his own
mercy. <hi>Huic fit misericordia, tibi nou fit injuria,</hi>
saith the same Father. God chuseth one, he refuseth
another; to him he sheweth mercy, to thee he doth no
injury, since the one doth receive but what all do deserve.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46181:91"/>
But enough of the desert of destruction: now of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved
help; For Man might fall of himself, but rise
again he could not without the help of another, nor of
any other but him, who here saith, <hi>In me is thy help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we have help from God, and that we need
so to have, there is none, no not <hi>Polagius</hi> himself, that
in plain terms ever durst deny. He will, … if pressed,
for shame acknowledge and subscribe unto the necessity
of Grace in shew of words; but as the manner of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
is, he doth but equivocate, making terms, in
themselves plain, by secret reservation false, and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent,
that so he might have a back-door at a time of
need, whereat to deceive and abuse both himself and his
reader; For secretly within his own mind, he desires
Grace, by <hi>quicquid gratis datur,</hi> that by this means
under the name of Grace, he might hedge in free-will
and abilities of Nature; Nay if this fraud be detected,
he will come yet closer, for he will not refuse to confess
a necessity of true internal Grace, such as the Gospel
mentions, the Grace of Christ and of his Holy Spirit, and
that it is the gift of God, yea a special gift which all
have not, yet still he keeps this secret in the deep of his
Heart, that all might have it, and that it is their own
faults if they have it not, since as he holds, this Grace is
given and withheld according to the merits or demerits
of Men, by a former good or evil use of their free will,
<hi>ut gratia sonaret, &amp; meritum delitescret,</hi> that so grace
might sound in their words, and yet they retain merit
in their minds. Such shift doth proud slime and dust
make to magnifie the arm of flesh, and so unwilling is it
to give the true and whole glory unto God whose it
is.</p>
            <p>Yet this is not all, Men have more subtilties to rob God,
or rather to deceive themselves. <hi>Arminius</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
the late Semi-pelagians step one Step farther, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46181:91"/>
with the Catholick truth acknowledge not only a true
and internal Grace, but a liberal, free and preventing
Grace, a Grace given, not deserved. But for all this he
understands only such a Grace, as is common to both,
to Elect and Reprobate, upon the good or evil use
whereof it is, that Men become either. For according to
these, Election doth not provide or prepare according to
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> any special Grace for particular Men, but
some particular men are specially elected, upon foresight
of their well-husbanding of that Grace, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
so that Man must still have the preheminence. For
however it be from Gods Grace, that they have ability
to obtain Salvation; yet that they are saved, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who received the same Grace, are not, this must
needs be, not from his help, but their own will: An old
rancid opinion long since broached by <hi>Faustus</hi> and <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus,</hi>
whose Books for this were condemned by <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
and a Council of seventy Bishops more, for erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
and Apocryphal, and now lately again revived by
<hi>Arminius,</hi> and others, who are not the Authors and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors,
but only strenuous Advocates, requiring a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
after Judgment of a dead and rotten, a damned and
long since condemned Heresie. So that it is a good judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Reverend Bishop, <hi>Faustum &amp; Cassianum
quasi per Metempsyohosin in Arminio &amp; Bertio revixisse,</hi>
That the Souls of <hi>Faustus</hi> and <hi>Cassianus</hi> do as it were
live again in <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Bertius,</hi> they do so justly
jump and conspire with their Doctrine of universal Grace,
and Election upon foresight, than which no opinion can
be more injurious unto God, or more grossly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively
false in it self. For however it retains the
name, it perverts the end and destroys the very Nature
of Election, causing that Predestination which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
unto the <hi>Ephesians</hi> tells us; was ordained <hi>in laudem
gloriae gratiae suae,</hi> to the praise of the glory of his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46181:92"/>
Grace, to serve and tend only unto the honour of our
own propension and will, since he that reigns in Heaven;
hath no more whereof to thank God, than he that lies
burning in Hell; because from equal Grace they have
wrought out these their unequal fortunes. And therefore,
say St. <hi>Paul</hi> what he will, Salvation is rather of him that
willeth and runneth, that believeth and worketh, than
of God that sheweth mercy; whereas it is not: neither
doth it less pervert the End than the Nature thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the cause into the effect, and the effect into the
cause, making Election a consequent of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
when these are the true fruits of Election,
which is the well-head of Grace, and all the rest of Gods
favours, and our good deeds but streams issuing from
that Fountain, <hi>who have all obtained mercy,</hi> with
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> not because we were, but <hi>that we should be
faithful. Non vos me elegistis,</hi> for you have not chosen
me, <hi>but I have chosen you,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>and have
ordained you:</hi> for what? that you should go and <hi>bring
forth,</hi> and <hi>that your fruit should remain;</hi> for <hi>I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi>

            <p>It were an endless work and a bootless expence of
Travel to heap up places of Scripture for the enforcing of
this point, they are every where obvious, the Glory of
Gods grace through a free and undeserved Election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a main branch of the Gospel, and therefore often
inserted, but by St. <hi>Paul</hi> purposely disputed and
proved in a set discourse; wherein these new oppugners
are so directly confuted, as if the Holy Ghost had espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46181:92"/>
looked on them, when he spake by his mouth, for
there is no other intent or purpose, in that place, but to
demonstrate,<note place="margin">Rom. ix.</note> that the Adoption of the Sons of God, doth
not depend upon the carnal Generation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the
Jews conceived, nor yet upon our own or our Forefathers
works, but simply upon the Eudochie, the meer good will
and pleasure of God.This he makes manifest in all in a
Type, under the names of two, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
equal in all things, only unequal in the favour of
God: both begotten by the same parents, and both born
at the same birth, on either side no advantage by blood,
and as little in quality, they had done neither good nor
evil, nor could do at that time, wherein notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the purpose of God might be known to stand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Election, it was said, I have loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and
hated <hi>Esau:</hi> No difference in the Persons, and yet a

which moves the Apostle to a strange interrogation, but
natural unto the place. <hi>Nunquid iniquitas apud De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um?
what then, is there iniquity with God? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid;</hi>
but how doth he answer it? doth he with these
reply, that though they had then done neither good nor
evil, yet God elected the one and rejected the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
foresight of the good and evil which they afterwards
would do? This had been an acute and brief answer,
<hi>Quis iftum acutissimum sensum Apostolo defuisse non

not see this subtilty? saith St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 103.</note> For had he known
it to have been so, <hi>eodem modo solveret istam quaestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
he would soon have answered the question, <hi>immo
nullam quam solvi opus esset, faceret quaestionem;</hi> Nay
he had then never made any such question, that should
need an answer, For there had not remained so much as
any shew of injustice, where Love or Hatred doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
according to good or evil deserts; But now that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46181:93"/>
there should be a different judgment, where there is no
difference in merit, there cannot but seem a just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of making the demand, <hi>Nunquid iniquitas?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
leaving this vain gloss, as directly contrary unto his
purpose, he reduceth all unto the meer will of God; <hi>I
will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will
have compassion on whom I will have compassion;</hi> An
answer sounding to this effect, That since both were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
conceived in original sin, deserved his Justice, his
Love unto one was an act of Mercy, and in Mercy there
is no cause of his will, but his will, nor of his Mercy, but
his Mercy, <hi>I will have mercy, &amp;c.</hi> And then <hi>quis nisi

as before was noted, though the one obtain free
favour, yet the other receives no injury; By which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
he doth at once free God from all injustice towards
the Reprobate, and withal withdraws all merit from the
Elect, who have that Name and Grace for no other cause
but only because he had a will to shew Mercy, special
Mercy unto them, which he did not unto others to whom
notwithstanding they were of themselves in all things
equal, and with whom they were in like sort obnoxious
unto the revenge and power of Justice. False therefore and
vain, and very derogatory unto the goodness of that God,
in whom is our help, are their conceipts that build Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon a foreseen good or evil use of a general and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Grace, to the prejudice of that which is special
and particular. For however we deny not, but rather
piously believe, that his Providence doth sufficiently help
all those whom his mercy doth vouchsase to call, yet
withal we acknowledge it to be such an help, as where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
withal God, when he looked down from Heaven, saw
there was none did good, <hi>no not one.</hi> A help therefore,
which in effect doth not give Salvation, but takes away
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46181:93"/>
excuse, and seems not so much to justify them, as to make
their Condemnation more just, who notwithstanding
that they might not all perish, and that he might yet
shew his Mercy, of his infinite goodness freely elected
some to such special Grace whereby they should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
a Grace effectual; receiving the rest unto endless
punishment, for abusing that which was sufficient. So
that God doth not only give such Grace whereby we
may be able to do, and then elect us for doing what we
were able; but contrarily foreseeing that we would not
do what we were able with that sufficient Grace to do,
of his absolute Mercy did decree to give us such power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and efficacious Grace, whereby we certainly should
do, what otherwise without this special help, he knew
we should not: For had not he by this means, as the
Scripture testifies, reserved unto himself a Remnant, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the former Grace, we had been all as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and perished as <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> And therefore <hi>Reliqui
mihi,</hi> saith God unto <hi>Elias:</hi> It is not there are, or there
remains unto me, but I have <hi>reserved unto my self seven
thousand which never bowed the knee unto Baal.</hi> And
from this <hi>Reliqui,</hi> they are termed <hi>Reliquiae secundùm
electionem gratiae salvae factae sunt,</hi> A Remnant only are
saved according to the Election of Grace: And if of
Grace, surely not of foreseen works; yea so far is God
from respecting the will or work of Man in the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Grace, as he sometimes denies that help unto
those that would use it well, which notwithstanding he
offers and exhibits unto others, that he knew before
would reject it. Had those great works, saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
upbraiding the Jews, been done in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi>
they had repented in Sackcloth and Ashes. Lo how God
ploughs the Sand and scatters his good seed upon the dry
and barren hearts of the Jews, fitter for salt; and in the
mean time withholds it from another soil, that would
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46181:94"/>
have fructified, and brought forth the fruit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
unto eternal life. What shall we say unto this? Two

some reason why it is done. And though this reason, as
here it is, be often unknown unto us, who can know no
more of his Will, than he himself shall please to reveal;
yet howsoever we know not the reason, yet this we
know, whatsoever the reason be, it cannot be drawn from
our merits. The Election of the blessed Angels, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

            <p>HItherto That help and Salvation is of the Lord,
Now That the death and destruction of man, is
from man, <hi>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self.</hi>
For however it be true, that it is God only who
properly inflicts destruction, in regard whereof it is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said, <hi>vita &amp; Mors à Domino,</hi> Life and death is from
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46181:96"/>
the Lord; yet because he doth inflict it but for mans
wilful offence, it is as true, that he is not so specially the
author of destruction, the inflictour, as he that deserves it.
And therefore it is no less rightly said by the Wiseman,
on the other side: <hi>Deus mortem non fecit,</hi> God hath
not made death,<note place="margin">Wisd. i. 13.</note> 
               <hi>for he desireth not the destruction
of the living, but they themselves by the errours of

but death the reward and wages,</hi> as the Apostle, of mans
merit. From whence it is, that God is ever termed <hi>Pater
misericordiarum,</hi> the Father of Mercies, but never of
Justice, because no desert of man can make any claim
unto it. It is born and bred within himself, a Thread
like that of the Spiders, woven and spun out of his own
bowels, whose nature and property it is, to have mercy
and compassion. But for his Justice, it is not so with it,
that seems so far from being natural, whereunto he is, as it
were, violently drawn against his nature, <hi>tactus dolore

at the heart, he said, <hi>I will destroy the man which I have

himself,</hi> which Law, in these kind of actions, is his Justice,
not his absolute Will; For their Rule is not to be approved,
that say, God doth not will actions, because they are right
and good, but all actions are right and good, because he
wills them. For then he might will any thing without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
since by willing he makes it just, even the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the righteous with the wicked, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>Abraham</hi> thought and was bold to affirm unto
God himself (of whom he was not blamed for it neither)
that even in him it would be unjust. Whereunto that
round and witty saying of St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth also subscribe,
<hi>Deus reddit mala pro malis,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. de Orat c. 22.</note> quia justus est; bona pro
malis, quia bonus est; bona pro bonis, quia bonus &amp;
justus est; solumnon reddit mala pro bonis, quia injustus
non est.</hi> But this Rule and that power was purposely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
to defend the direful decree of absolute Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
that so they might establish dominion, and that
by might, which they saw by equity could not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
as I am now to shew and prove, being it throws
the blame of mans destruction upon God, no otherwise
than the former Election gives Gods glory unto man. The
Authors of the one, and the other opinion being deceived
by one, and the same reason, which both imagined<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was to
be had of both these opposite Decrees: And therefore
as they saw a necessity of framing the one, so they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the other; the one making both upon foresight,
the other, both absolute; whereby it is impossible but
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46181:97"/>
either of them must err in one, since both cannot be true.
For if Reprobation upon foresight only leave man to be
the cause of his ruine, let Election be upon foresight too,
and by the same reason it intitles him to his own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So on the other side, if an absolute Election make
God the Supream Author of all our Good, how should
as absolute a Reprobation choose but say the same of him
in our Evil? For if good works be therefore the effects
of Gods Election, because it is absolute; evil works must
needs be the effects of absolute Reprobation for the same
reason; what is said of one cannot be denied of the other,
especially, since they do so exactly square and sort one in
all points answerable unto the other; Election, that is
absolute, intends the end, and then provides the means,
doth not absolute Reprobation do the like? wherein they
say the first Act or Decree of God was, to manifest his
glory by the declaration of his Justice; but because Justice
might not be shewed, but upon sinners, he did in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place Will, Ordain and Decree (for these are the
words of some, and it is the meaning of all) the ingres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sin by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that so he might make
a way for the execution of his Justice according to the
former Decree; and whereby they are of necessity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
thereunto. For either God by his second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
must determine <hi>Adams</hi> Will unto the committing of
Sin, or <hi>Adam</hi> by the freedom of his Will should have
power to frustrate Gods first Decree in the Declaration
of his Justice. <hi>Horribile decretum fateor,</hi> an horrible
Decree I confess, saith Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom but in this and
his Platform, I shall ever honour. A horrible Decree
indeed and of all pious minds to be abhorred, that first
makes God unjust, that so he might shew his Justice,
which in regard of the former, is not just neither:
<hi>Nec enim justitia dicatur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Moni. lib. 1. c. 22.</note> for his Justice shall not be
just, saith <hi>Fulgentius, si puniendum reum non inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisse
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46181:97"/>
sed fecisse dicatur,</hi> if he doth not find but make
Men worthy of that punishment which it inflicts. For
what greater injustice, saith the same Father, <hi>quàm
lapso retribuere poenam, quem stantem praedestinâsse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur
ad ruinam,</hi> than to punish him for falling, whom
he did predestinate to fall whilst he stood? It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suit. cap. 61.</note> that he had a great desire to have
certain young Maids of <hi>Rome</hi> strangled to death, not for
any offence of theirs, but such was the cruelty of his
disposition, only because he had a mind to have it so;
but understanding that it was not lawful by the custom
of the Countrey to put Virgins to death, he decreed
and commanded (so to open a passage unto his former
purpose) that the Hangman should first force and vitiate,
and afterwards strangle them. I forbear to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
it is too manifest, and chuse rather to pray and
make supplication unto Christ, that he would be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and merciful unto the Doctors and Pastors of his
Church, if deceived through Errour they are bold to
teach and speak and write according to the example of
<hi>Tiberius.</hi> I know it is not their desire or meaning to
charge God with the Sin and Iniquity of Man, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
and with great indignation deny him to be the
Author thereof; but like ill Logicians, they deny the
conclusion, and in the mean time, establish those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
from whence though they grow hoarse yea burst
with denying, it will of necessity follow: All the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
brought for the purpose fail, and should a Man
rack and ransack every dusty corner of his brain for
more, they would still be all too few to defend or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
it. That of the act, and of the vitiosity in the act,
with the lame instance of an halting Horse, or an untuned
Lute is often urged, and may have its use, but not here:
For God, they say, is the cause of the action, but not of the
obliquity in the action: As when a good Horseman rides
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46181:98"/>
a lame Jade, or a skilful Musician strikes a crackt Lute;
the one is the cause of the motion, but not of the lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the other of the sound, but not of the harshness:
these are defects wherewith they are not to be blamed,
because they arise not from their manner of working,
but from the distemper of the subjects, on which they
wrought. After <hi>Adam</hi> indeed had lamed and maimed
himself by a fall, this distinction finds room for applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but what hath it to do with <hi>Adam</hi> in his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
free from all lameness or laxation in his joints, a
well-strung and a well-tun'd Instrument? Nor when the
question is by what means he came to his hurts; let them
take heed how they make God ride him lame, or strike
him so, as to strike him out of tune: Let him be never
so acute, he shall find it an hard matter to bestow the
action upon one and the obliquity on another. In po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
and affirmative precepts where a good action may
be ill done, as he that gives Alms to be seen of Men, 'tis
easy to distinguish the vitiosity from the act; but in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
inhibitions, where not the manner of acting, but
the act it self is forbidden, so that do it after what sort so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he will, he can never do it well, how we can discern
the one from the other, and how God in this case may
be the cause of the act and not of the Sin, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
annexed to the act, because the act is it which
is implyed, is more than my apprehension can reach unto.
I know there is a difference even here, between the act
and the Sin, because the act, as the act, is not evil, but
as forbidden by the Law. But how God may be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
cause that <hi>Adam</hi> should eat, and yet not the
cause of his transgressing the Law, when he did eat, is that
which I say I cannot, and which I think few else can any
way conceive. For when God by his will leaves a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the act, I pray what will become of Mans possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to avoid the sin? surely there is no plea for it, but
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46181:98"/>
this, that since necessity hath no Law, that which is done
under it, is no sin, for sin is the transgression of a Law.
Many other distinctions there are alledged, as that of the
decree and the execution of the decree, of necessity and
coaction, a diverse respect of the Divine decree and the
Nature of Man, of a double will <hi>signi &amp; beneplaciti,</hi>
a secret and revealed will; and lastly, the label annexed
unto all, is the addition of the End, that it is willed
and decreed only for the illustration of Gods Glory.
These and more quiddities they have invented, the vanity
whereof the time will not now permit me in particular
to discourse; sure I am, they all fall short of effecting
that, for which they were devised; they may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
quiet the Authors mind, but shall never justify
those imposed and cruel decrees. There is a story or a
Fable of a silly Man, that lying down to sleep with his
head against a brazen Pot, and finding it but an hard
Pillow, claps a Cushion into the mouth of his Pot, and
lies down again, and then thinking the matter well
mended and himself at ease, falls into a sound Nap. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
they that imagine they may rest themselves upon
this iron Doctrine having stuft it with the Feathers of
these distinctions, do fitly make up the moral of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for though they lie as hard as they did before, yet
this they have gained, that though they receive not
thereby any true ease in their doubts, yet at least by
thinking so, they content and please their own conceipts,
and so are fallen into a profound sleep, embracing
dreams for truth, out of which God of his mercy vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to wake them, that so seeing and rejecting the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and lewdness of these trifling subtleties, they may
rather abandon, and utterly forsake, than with such poor
shifts seek to defend, a Doctrine so harsh in it self, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
unto God, and dangerous unto Men, and unto the
rest of the truth they profess, so extream scandalous. Who
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46181:99"/>
can believe them in any thing else, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that
shall see them only so gross and impious in this? And it
is marvellous to consider how all our Adversaries do
generally raise their stiles and themselves, how they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
and triumph when they come unto this point, and
what infinite absurdities they empty out, and disgorge
upon us and our Doctrine, affirming that all those odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
propositions falsly imposed on St. <hi>Austin,</hi> do rightly
and justly light upon us, who teach that God did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only create, that he might destroy the greatest part
of mankind, whereunto they are unavoidably subjected
by the unalterable, and energetical decrees of an eternal
predestination, more immutable than the Laws of the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that alter not; and more reluctable,
than the destiny of the Stoicks, binding Men with the
iron chains of immutable necessity; from whence they
say, it will follow, as the natural fruit of that Tree
of Fate, that God is the Author of Sin, that he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
sin, that he only doth sin, and so that sin is no sin:
<hi>Pudet haec opprobria nobis Et dici potuisse, &amp; non p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuisse
refelli.</hi> It both shames and grieves good minds, that
such ignominies should be objected, and that they may
not be refuted; surely, at least for ought I understand, by
the ordinary way, they may not. And therefore the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and soundest refutation, as I imagine, will consist not
in labouring to decline and avoid such consequences by
empty distinctions, but by an utter detestation of those
points and positions, that is, those absolute ordinations,
from whence such consequences flow and proceed. This
was St. <hi>Austins</hi> manner of answer, and it may well be
others in the same case; he sought out no quirks and
strains of Wit to salve the appearance of injustice, but
simply denies, and confesseth the decree that was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
<hi>Nihil ergo talium negotiorum Deus praedestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
ut fieret, &amp;c.</hi> God hath not predestinated, saith he,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46181:99"/>
any of these things, speaking of sins, that they should be,
neither is any Soul that lives wickedly and filthily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
or ordained of God so to live: <hi>sed talem futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
non ignoravit, &amp; de tali se justè judicaturum esse
praescivit;</hi> but he was not ignorant how wicked such a
Soul would be, and knew he could justly Judge and
Condemn him for being so.<note place="margin">Lib. advers. mort. sibi falso imp. ad artic.10.</note> So that St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth not
acknowledge any decree unto sin, but only a decree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
punishment for sin, which he foresaw but decreed
not. A decree only that can clear all those doubts and
heinous criminations, and is afterwards no less clear in it
self. For if Election doth presuppose sin, as 'tis proved
in the former part; much more must Reprobation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not precedent but subsequent in order to Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And as Election, because an act of Mercy, requires
a subject of Misery: so Reprobation, because administred
by Justice, can have no place, but where there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
offence, and that only foreknown not preordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for then it would cease to be an offence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>mala tantùm praescit &amp; non praedestinat Deus:</hi> sins
are only foreseen and not predestinated, saith the same
St. <hi>Austin.</hi> So that it was rightly observed and said by a
worthy Bishop of our own, even in his preface unto
that book of Lectures and Sermons penned and published
against <hi>Arminius,</hi> That he must leave behind him the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
decree of Reprobation, whoever he be that comes
to the studying and reading of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> which he
terms a sad and heavy opinion, lately bred and ever to
be abhorred: so that though he refute <hi>Arminius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Election, yet he will not maintain his Adversaries
absolute Reprobation, as being an opinion which the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> though it sometimes seek to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
and excuse, yet it did never receive and embrace:
and therefore he afterwards adds in the same preface,
That if <hi>Arminius</hi> had only inveighed against that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46181:100"/>
and truculent decree, contrary both to Scriptures
and Fathers, and their days, <hi>commodè adhibuisset in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriam
suam, &amp; Ecclesiam nostram Anglicanam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buisset
consentientem secum.</hi> As for some private Men,
that think and write otherwise, they are not the Churches
but their own private conceits, saith the same Bishop in the
same place. By whose authority, though great in it self,
yet I am the easier led, because I see that this Church
though it doth not fore some respects actually and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
refute, yet it doth purposely refuse to give grace
or countenance to any such Doctrine whereof it doth in
this regard forbear to determine. For in the Articles
of Religion whereunto she requires subscription, the
Article of Election is proposed and illustrated at large
by many propositions; but of Reprobation, not an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
not a proposition, no word, no mention at all; by
which silence in that place the Church (as I conceive)
seems not to approve the vulgar opinion, at least
to think it a Doctrine dangerous to mention. And
what it there forbears by writing to confirm, it had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
by fact disavowed, as appears in the Case of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
who was censured and silenced by the Authority of
the Church for opposing the Doctrine of Learned and
Judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> whereof this was a branch, that God
in his counsel and purpose rejects none without a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
worthiness of rejection, going though not in time,
yet in order before: This is it, which hath made me
the more bold to wade so far in this point, wherein
though I may offend some particular Men, yet I shall
not our own present Church, nor the learned Fathers of
former, whose voice unto their dissolute flocks, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been the same with this here of God, <hi>O Israel thou
hast destroyed thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inference and issue of all that which hath been
already said in this point doth reach only to this, That
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46181:100"/>
that Destruction which fell upon the world through the
sin and fall of the Protoplast <hi>Adam,</hi> ought to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
unto his own free and voluntary fault, and not
unto any irresistable appointment and Decree of God's,
all whose Ordinations unto Destruction do not precede,
but of necessity foresee and suppose this offence. Not
that this or any other sin, is the absolute cause, why God
doth, but the desert and merit why he justly may, reject
and reprobate whom he please. It now remains that we
proceed and step one step farther, and enquire, whether
God, as he may, so he actually doth reprobate immediately
out of the Mass of corruption, upon the foresight of this,
and no other sin. Otherwise, I shall fall short of giving full
satisfaction unto my Text, wherein God seems not so much
to relate unto the original misery, wherein they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and born, as unto their particular and actual sin
and disobedience, refusing his love, and rejecting his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
when he so passionately bursteth out, <hi>O Israel!</hi> And
if this be rightly spoken in regard of their own Acts and
Actions, they must be such also, as are willingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
done: For surely they that are destroyed for sins,
which by natural Corruption they could not chuse but
commit, they may be pitied, but cannot be blamed; and
then it will stand firm and good, that it is not <hi>Israel</hi>
that have destroyed themselves, but their fore-Father
only, that hath destroyed <hi>Israel,</hi> since necessary crimes
are not to be imputed to the Doers, but to him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
the necessity. Unto these and many more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
as I conceive unanswerable, must they be lyable,
who make the Decree, and Reprobation peremptorily to
proceed, immediately upon foresight only of original sin,
without any other respect of disobedience and contempt
of the Grace of God, or Gospel of Christ, neither of
which they say was ever provided for them. For first, it
will from hence follow, that though they allow an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46181:101"/>
favour of God unto some few particular men, yet
they bereave him of his philanthropie, his grace and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent
affection unto the kind, which the scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mentions, and so make him to exercise upon the
far greater part of men meer severity without all mercy,
as he did upon the Devils, whereby they clearly remove
the main difference between the Reprobation of men, and
of Angels, which the Fathers place in this, that is, afforded
them means of recovery, but the evil Spirits none, because
the Devil sinned of his own proper motion and instinct,
but man at the instigation of the Devil. Nay farther, that
God deals in much more severity with these miserable
men, who only sinned in the Loyns of another, than
with those powers of darkness, that wilfully transgressed;
for that all their life long he still presseth them with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
commands for no other end, but to heighten that
damnation whereunto they were before unavoidably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted.
Surely, a heavy case, and I verily believe unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
the great compassion and mercy of God which
the Scriptures mention, that he should be so far from
pitying the Case of his own Creature in an involuntary
misery, as he should lay new loads on their backs, and
then whip and scourge them here, and torment them
in perpetual fire hereafter for sinking under those bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
which they were no way able to bear. Besides,
how doth this make God seem to flout and delude poor
Souls in the deep of their distress, calling unto them who
lie in anguish, have all their bones and joints bruised and
broken with a deadly fall, to rise, and come unto him,
and he will help them, and in the mean time, affording
them not one jot of his help to rise who, he knows, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
are not able to stretch forth so much as a
finger in their own help? Nay how should our blessed
Saviours words, yea his Tears over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> seem to
be false and counterfeit, <hi>(O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, &amp;c.)</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:46181:101"/>
if at the same instant notwithstanding, he had no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
either to die for them, or to give them grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might believe in him. So that his Commandment
of <hi>Faith in his Blood,</hi> should want both verity in him,
because he did not die for such; and possibility to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by them, for that he gives them no means to
do it, who have none in themselves. From All, this
Conclusion will result besides, that they either make God
a hard man, like the lazy fellow in the Gospel, <hi>reaping
where he doth not sow:</hi> or a cruel man, with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
withdrawing the Straw, and yet still demanding the full
tale of Brick, requiring works, and withholding the
Grace whereby they should be done. For if without giving
a Saviour, or providing any Grace, there be a rejection
and reprobation of all mankind immediately out of the
Mass of Corruption, Who sees not the necessity of all
these strange consequences, so reproachful unto God,
and so full of severity, if not cruelty unto men, who
lying under more than fatal Necessity, being not able to
go any other way, must needs run headlong in those paths
that lead into Hell? A Position so absurd, as <hi>Zeno</hi> a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
derided, and confuted with blows rather than
words: His Servant being examined upon an error he
had committed, acknowledgeth the fault, but lays the
blame on his Fate, desiring his Master to pardon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was his destiny, and he could not avoid it: <hi>Zeno</hi>
falls on his Man, and Cudgels him most severely; when
he had done, tells him he had indeed beaten him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extremly, but he must be content, it was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny
so to beat him, and he could not help it. And this
by him, was well and wittily done. But had this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher's
Man served some Antient Divine that had been
of this Modern opinion, his excuse and Plea had been
good and unreprovable, because according to the Rules
of his Masters Doctrine, who therefore could have no
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46181:102"/>
cause to correct or beat him, unless it were for anger
that he hath nothing else to answer, as you may see
none of them have, if we consider the replies which they
make to the like impious and idle Dilemmas. If I be
Elected, God will not fail to bring me to his Kingdom; if
Reprobated, there is no means to shift his decree, and
therefore what need I take much care of Religion? An
objection often proposed by themselves, but which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was, nor possibly can be by their Doctrine justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.
The answer of all that I have ever read or heard
is but one, and that briefly to this effect, That Men may
not imagine they may sit idlely and have the Kingdom of
Heaven brought home unto them; it is not at a lower
rate than thy daily bread, that it should be purchased
without the sweat of thy Brows: for he that will attain
unto the end, must labour and use the means. Which is
good Divinity, but gives no satisfaction to the doubt:
for though it be the right answer, yet it may not
be used by them; for how can they blame others for
not using the means which they themselves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is not in their power to use, since they that are
denied Glory, are withall rejected from Grace? And
therefore it is easie for the opposers to reinforce their
forked Argument: If I be elected, I needs must, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
I cannot possibly use the means, and therefore still
what need I trouble my self, what is it you blame me
for? Here they utterly fail, and not well knowing
what they may say or do, they first fall upon the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
terming them dissolute people, and this kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
as lewd, as they are dissolute: but if they be disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
of necessity, and this kind of reasoning part of that
dissoluteness, how should they chuse but reason so, that
cannot chuse but be so dissolute? and therefore this may
not be objected. This then not prevailing, their second
Essay is (such is their perplexity) to reconcile necessity
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46181:102"/>
and freedom, that so at least the works of wickedness
might be justly taxed, because they transgress, though
not without necessity, yet willingly and freely without
all constraint. But what freedom is this, to be free from
coaction, if they be withal also void of election? A free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
surely which the Stoicks deny not, yea which the
Manichees allow their Fate, and the <hi>gens tenebrarum</hi> of
these, that is, both external necessity from Stars, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
from a corrupt and depraved Nature, will suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
and reconciliation with it. A freedom, which
is not only in wicked Men, but in the blackest Devils,
nay in beasts, yea farther, in stocks and stones, and indeed
in whatsoever the world hath, that hath but motion
and operation: for whatever naturally works or moves,
must needs move and work without constraint: so that
as it is truly said of the service of God, that it is <hi>perfect
freedom;</hi> so it may be as rightly affirmed of this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that it is a plain and absolute servitude, from
whence you may no more blame Man for sininng, than
you may accuse fire for burning, being they both work
with equal liberty: for it is not <hi>sponte</hi> but <hi>libere</hi> that is
the Adverb, it is not the willing, but the freedom of the
will which affects the action, and subjects it unto just cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and punishment. Well then, this will do no good
neither, yet they stay not here, so strenuously do they
labour for necessity, they have sought and found out a
third device, that actions of necessity may worthily be
blamed, and punished now in themselves, because they
had and have wilfully lost the freedom of their will in
<hi>Adam.</hi> But this is of as little force for diverse respects.</p>
            <p>First, for that (as was before noted) it removes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from themselves, contrary to this accusation of
God's, and renews the old Plea and Proverb of the Jews;
if we pine and languish under: our Sins, what remedy?
<hi>The fathers have eaten sour grapes;</hi> and contrary to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46181:103"/>
protestation, yea and the Oath of the same God, <hi>As I
live, it shall no more a Proverb in Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, because by the same reason God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
actual. Faith of Children and Mad men, Idiots and
Indians, who either cannot conceive or never heard of
the Gospel of Christ, as well as of those to whom it is
continually preached; because he that wants Legs, is no
more to be condemned for not walking, than he that
hath neither Eyes nor Legs: for where impotency can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
free, ignorance may not make any excuse, especially
since the one as well as the other had, and lost in <hi>Adam,</hi>
whatsoever they now want and have not, from whose
sin both blindness and lameness and all other frailties
and infirmities are equally derived.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it can no whit avail them, because their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as hath been shewed, makes <hi>Adam</hi> to sin with no
less necessity, than his Children do. And therefore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other help, their utmost and last refuge is (which
is remarkable because it disanuls and destroys all the
shifts they formerly made) that it's certainly just with
God so to do, though how it should be so, Man cannot see
nor conceive:<note place="margin">Inst. lib. 3. cap. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Excusabiles peccando haberi volunt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probi,
quia evadere nequeunt peccandi necessitatem,
praesertim cum Dei ordinatione sibi injiciatur hujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi
necessitas: Nos verò inde negamus excusari, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doquidem
Dei ordinationi, qua se exitio destinat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queratur,
sua constet aequitas, nobis quidem incognita
sed illi certissima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein besides the plain tergiversation and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
begging of the point in question, it may please you
to observe how little injury the Doctrine doth receive
when it is accused of Stoicism, unless it be, that it falls
short and chargeth it with less impiety than it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
or the Authors of it themselves confess, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
in plain terms, as you see, a necessity of sinning
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46181:103"/>
unto the wicked, and Gods decree to be the cause of this
necessity, for which the Stoicks modestly never durst as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
farther than the Stars, the loosest and lewdest of
them do but complain of the Planets: <hi>Mars</hi> committed
the Murder, and <hi>Venus</hi> the Adultery: whilst the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of these makes Men bold to lay both upon God,
unto whose Arm it fastens the first Link of that fatal
Chain, which the Stoicks never durst but at the foot of his
Chair. And yet farther will some of the Manichees that
would rather make a coeternal Devil than want a good
God, of whom it is better not to think, than to think
what becomes him not; it being a less offence to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
none, than to account him evil whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
But howsoever wicked Men may now take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Doctrinal errours and mistakes of the
good, laying hold on such misconceived decrees, from
thence to plead and justify the cause of their crying
crimes; yet the time will come when no such excuses
will be taken, yea when those nor any others can be
made. They may here have tongues, and these loud in
their own defence, whilst they dispute with Men; but
when the Bridegroom shall once come and question
them for their wedding Garment, the case of one will be
the same in all, they shall be speechless, not a word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be to condemn their own follies, <hi>we fools,</hi> and
so forth, as the Wiseman hath it, and to justify God in
his sayings, especially in this, <hi>O Israel thou hast destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto of those inconveniencies that cleave unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
if made immediately out of the mass of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
But it is not sufficient to convince errour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we establish truth, which must be by shewing that
Gods patience and longanimity doth not forsake Men
for one sin or utterly reject them for the first fault, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any farther care of them, according to that of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.</hi>

briefly, and so conclude.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And first, for the first, the extent of the death of our
Lord and Saviour unto all. I know not how 'tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the wit of Man, to set it down in plainer, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and more variety of terms, as if the Holy Ghost
did strive to free it from all objections. What terms of
universality are there, wherein it doth not seek to express
this truth? He <hi>died for all, for the world, for the sins
of the whole world:</hi> and that the word may not still be
taken only for the Elect, it is here used with opposition
to them, <hi>not for our sins only, but for the sins of the
whole world,</hi> saith St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep</hi> 2. 1. And yet that it
might not be understood of the world of Elect only, that
were in after ages to succeed; St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis
in other terms that utterly rejects the cavil: <hi>God
is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 20. Nay yet more directly, <hi>the Saviour of those
that perish;</hi> for <hi>through thy knowledge shall thy Brother
perish,</hi> saith the same Author, <hi>for whom Christ died.</hi>
Yet more positively for those that are damned. <hi>There
shall be false teachers among you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Per. ii. 1.</note> 
               <hi>who privily shall bring

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:46181:104"/>For All, for the world, the wole world, the wole
world of faithful, and others, and those others, they that
perish, they that are damned: what can be said more for
it, or answered unto it, I know not. To say herein, that
he died for all sufficiently, if truly meant, is as much as is
required, as the places enforce: but if their intent be, as
it is, That the merit of Christs Blood and death is, in it
self considered, sufficient for all, had it been, as it was not,
intended and laid down for them; then to say that he
died for all sufficiently, is but to abuse others and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
themselves. For how can it be said he died suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
for those for whom he did not die? This is all they
can answer, and the consequence, that if Christ died for
all, they cannot see but how all should be saved, is all or
the chief thing they can object, which they would not
object neither if they observed the difference and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between the imputation of Redemption, and the
application thereof: His life may be laid down for the
whole world, though his death be actually imputed and
applyed to those only that are faithful believers; for he
was as the Brasen Serpent hung up for the good of all,
but benefits none but those that look upon him, that is,
believe in him. A distinction sweetly insinuated and
strongly confirmed by the Oracle of Learning, the <hi>non sicut</hi>
of Divines, in the <hi>non sicut</hi> of Sermons, upon the
<hi>non sicut</hi> of Christs passion, whereof to the former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he thus speaks; <hi>It pertains unto All, but All pertain

               </hi> after whose authority it were but ill manners
to seek a farther proof.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore to the second point, wherein we
are to shew, that this Saviour is wanting unto none with
sufficient power, whereby they may lay hold on him, and if
they will, be saved by him; to none that are called, that are
within the pale of the visible Church, that come to hear
his Gospel and profess his name, according to that of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46181:105"/>
Apostle, <hi>quotquot receperunt eum, as many as received
him, dedit iis potestatem filios Dei fieri, to them gave
he power to become the Sons of God.</hi> And according to
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> where power is given, necessity is not also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that you may know many might receive this power
who never become the sons and servants of God; for of all
that are called and come not, that of the same Father is true,
<hi>qui velle praecepit, posse praebuit, &amp; non impune nolle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misit,</hi>
He that commands to will gives power to perform,
and yet justly permits to neglect: which place he doth
not retract though he repeat it in his Retractations.<note place="margin">Retract. lib. 1. cap. 11.</note> Unto
that supper prepared in the Gospel, saith he elsewhere,
neither would all come that were called, neither could
they have come that did come unless they had been called,

can be more manifest? From whence it is, that that
which from thence he infers, is as just, That he which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
not to be called, begins to deserve punishment,
when he neglects to come being called, because then it
first begins to be in his power: <hi>Sicut non habuit meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

            <p>Many other passages of this Father might be produced
unto this purpose, but I pass them over now to come to
the places of Scripture which are infinite, from whence this
Doctrine may be concluded. I will only point at two:
in one whereof God makes men themselves the Judges,
and in the other the Prophet calls heaven and earth for
witnesses of this truth, <hi>Deut.</hi> l. 19. <hi>I call heaven and earth
to record this day,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, against you, that I have
set before you life and death, cursing and blessing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
chuse life that both thou and thy seed may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:46181:105"/>The reason hereof he had before set down, because the
<hi>Commandment which I command thee this day is not
hidden from thee, neither is it far off,</hi> that is, thou art
neither ignorant of it, neither is it out of thy reach or
beyond thy power to perform and effect it. This then
being so plain, no marvel that God calls to the Men of
<hi>Israel</hi> themselves to judge between him and his Vineyard,
that is, between him and themselves:<note place="margin">Isai. v.</note> 
               <hi>judge, I pray you,
between me and my vineyard:</hi> I have not chosen out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
barren soil, for it is seated <hi>pingui dorso,</hi> in a very
fruitful hill; I did not plant it with a wild or degenerate
or bastard slip, but <hi>generosa stirpe,</hi> with the choicest
Vine; it hath not wanted manuring and culture, <hi>sepsi
&amp; elapidavi,</hi> I enclosed, hedged it in, and threw the
stones and weeds out; after all I built a Tower and a
Vine-press therein expecting Grapes, &amp; <hi>fecit mibi la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brùscas,
and it brought forth wild grapes;</hi> now judge
I pray you, <hi>Quid amplius debui facere vineae meae;</hi>
what I ought more to have done unto my Vine? This was
enough to convince them; but these times are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.
Had some Men of our <hi>Israel</hi> been made Judges,
they would quickly have stopt the mouth of this Plantiff;
Why, you have withheld the first and the latter rain, the
dew of Grace and the influence of Heaven, no marvel if
your Plants thrive not: if you would needs plainly know,
this you ought not to have done, if you would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
grapes. Give but that blessing, and your earth
will bring forth its encrease. As if in the enumeration of
some few particulars, those that these speak of, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
else is simply necessary for this rational Vine, were
not virtually included. Surely the Lords Vineyard was not
planted upon those cursed Mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> on which
there fell neither dew nor rain: for certainly the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Heaven hath not been restrained, the Sun of
righteousness hath risen and shined upon this Vine, but it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46181:106"/>
               <hi>hath loved darkness more than light:</hi> the dew of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace was not wanting to the branches thereof, but
they have turned his grace into wantonness, quenching
and grieving his holy Spirit: And therefore a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the utter rooting up and casting out these degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Plants, St. <hi>Stephen</hi> frames the Inditement unto their
just destruction: why, <hi>ye are a stiff-necked people and a
stubborn generation, as your Fathers did, so do ye, ye
have always resisted the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this leads us unto the third and last point, That
God reprobates none, but after the often abuse of his grace:
for as they were cut and cast off, so are all other also reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and reprobated, for first rejecting and resisting the
same Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My people would not bearken unto my voice, and Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
would none of me,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>So I gave them
up unto their own hearts lufts, and they walked in their
own counsels, Psal.</hi> 81. 11. And this is the first external
act of Reprobation: when God gives Men up unto a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
sense, withdrawing his abused Grace, and leaving
them unto the counsels and lusts of their own hearts. A
Judgment never denounced in Scripture but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Mercy. Now by the external act, Man must
judge of the internal and eternal decree; for what God
in time doth, that before all time he did decree to do:
for they that imagine that difference between the decree
and the execution of the decree, that the one hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto Sin, but the other none, must either make a
decree that is never executed, or an execution that varies
from the decree, as if God did ordain one thing, and do
another; And therefore if he doth now give up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
a people for their obstinate sins, for the same cause
in his Eternal Reprobation, he did order so to reject
them. And as it is in rejection from Grace, so it fares in
exclusion from Glory, from which no Man is irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46181:106"/>
abdicated but for long and wilful grieving of that
God who would have brought them to it. <hi>Forty years
long was I grieved with this generation,</hi> and then <hi>I
sware they should not enter into my rest.</hi> Than which
I know no sentence that doth so clearly represent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the true nature of Reprobation; for what is it, but
Gods eternal oath of rejecting wicked Men from his Glory
into that destruction they have deserved? And this he doth
not suddenly in a passion of choler, upon every light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
but in his wrath, his wrath urged and provoked
by a long Rebellion: even forty years long was he grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and then he sware in his wrath, he resolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
they should not enter into his rest. A decree
that seems not to proceed, but when by extremity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
it is, as it were, violently extorted: so loth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
he is to be brought unto it, as he doth not so much
as think or speak of it without passionate interjections
of sorrow. <hi>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon these exhibitions of Gods mercies and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto the Reprobate, depends the verity and truth
and justice of this complaint against them: for they that
never received any means of Salvation, can by no means
ever be termed the authors of their destruction: But now
since God and his favours have not been wanting unto
them, but they unto God; since they have wilfully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
his mercy, they can rightly blame none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for their own misery; for as the antient Father
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath it, <hi>Judicium justum recipient, quoniam
non sunt operati bonum cum possent operari illud.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 71.</note> The
judgment of God is just, which they shall receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did not do well when they might have done
it. Whereunto <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> doth agree: All im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitents,
saith he, shall be judged, <hi>aliqui quidem quod
cum possent, noluerunt Deo credere, alii vero quod cum
vellent, non elaboraverunt ut fierent fideles:</hi> Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46181:107"/>
when they might believe, they would not: others
because, when they would, yet they did not labour truly
to become what they desired. And it were easie, (that
no man might conceive the Doctrine to be new,) to shew
the like out of the Fathers, yea generally out of all,
both before the <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresy, and after: but (left
the time should fail me) to those already mentioned I
will only add the Judgment of the third Synod of <hi>Arles,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblged
for the defining of these very questions, wherein,
what you have now heard, is not only affirmed, but a
Curse and an <hi>Anathema</hi> laid upon those that shall think
the contrary, <hi>Anathema illi qui dixerit quòd Christus
non pro omnibus mortius sit:</hi> Cursed be he that says that
Christ died not for all. And <hi>Anathema illi qui dixerit
illum, qui periit, non accepisse ut salvus esse posset,</hi>
Cursed be he that says, he that perished, did not receive
means whereby he might be saved.</p>
            <p>But unto this and whatsoever else in this kind may be
said, that in the ix. to the <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau
(before ever they had done good or evil, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of God might stand according to Election, it was
said The elder shall serve the younger,</hi> according to that
of the Prophet, <hi>I have loved Jacob but Esau have I
hated)</hi> like <hi>Medusa's</hi> head is ever objected, though sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or never understood: But that it may be; besides
theirs of absolute Reprobation, I will first shew you the
several interpretations of others. The ancient Fathers
both Greek and Latin before St. <hi>Austin,</hi> yea and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
for a while until the <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresy arose, interpret
these words of the Election of some unto salvation upon
prevision of their future faith and piety; and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of others, upon the fore-fight of the evil they
were afterwards to commit.</p>
            <p>But St. <hi>Austin</hi> rejecting this opinion, and doubtless wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
thinks and proves, that the Apostle speaks here of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46181:107"/>
Election of some unto life, and the preterition of others,
without any regard either of the one, or the others good or
evil, that should be personal. Both opinions agree in this, that
the place concerns the Election and rejection of particular
persons. And yet there are not wanting learned men that
conceive these Verses in a proper and literal sense chiefly to
intend only external and temporary blessings of this life,
but typically under them to shadow the free and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
Salvation of the faithful, and the abjection of
those that believe not; and that therefore the types are
not to be extended farther than to shew that our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is of meer grace and favour, no way descending
either from carnal generation or legal Justice. Of this
threefold interpretation, which is the most genuine and
proper unto the Text, would require a longer disquisition:
at this time it shall be sufficient to shew that absolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
doth follow from neither. Of the former and
the latter there is no doubt, all the difficulty is of St. <hi>Austins</hi>
opinion between both: from whence notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we shall not be enforced so to decree an absolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
if we so interpret his words, as we make him
speak something more indeed than the Antients do, but
nothing contrary, that is, if by a conditional science we
reconcile both opinions, and then the mind of the Apostle
will be thus, Before any absolute prevision and without
any regard of <hi>Jacobs</hi> merits I loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and decreed
to confer upon him such and such a measure of grace as
I saw would certainly bring him to salvation: And again
I hated <hi>Esau,</hi> that is, I did not so particularly love him,
but decreed to give him only such grace as might argue
a good and sincere intent of his good in me and in it
self sufficient for him, though through his fault I know
it would be ineffectual: And though I foresaw, that if I
should afford him this mercy he would abuse it, yet I did
not destine unto him any other grace, but for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46181:108"/>
of my Justice did Decree Eternally to punish those
evil ways of his which through the former grace he might
and ought to have avoided. And both these without
any respect of merit, for he may dispense his free mercy
as himself pleseth. And according to this last interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<hi>to hate</hi> after the Hebrew manner imports no more
than not so specially to love, <hi>minus aware,</hi> or <hi>alteri
posthabere,</hi> to love less, or not so much to esteem and
regard.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Leah</hi> in the xxxix. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. is said be hated of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> that is, in respect to <hi>Rachel</hi> (whom he loved more
dearly,) something neglected: so our Saviour Christ saies,
<hi>Luke</hi> iv. 26. <hi>If any come unto me and hate not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother and Children and brethren, yea and
his own Soul, he cannot be my Disciple:</hi> Not that
Christ in the Gospel doth now command men to hate
what in the Law yea and in Nature he hath taught them to
honour and love, but to shew that when the question shall
be between these and God, these and our Religion, we
are to prefer the last, to leave all, be they never so near
and dear unto us, and follow Christ: and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of hating, when the same point is preached in St.
<hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel x. 37 <hi>Qui amaverit patrem aut ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem
plus quam me, aut filium &amp; filiam super me, non
est me dignus: He that loveth Father or Mother more
than me, and he that loveth Son or Daughter above me
is not worthy of me.</hi> And that this kind of hatred, as
it is taken for less love doth well agree with St. <hi>Austins</hi>
Doctrine, appears by that which he elsewhere speaks
of <hi>Esau,</hi> whom he doth acknowledge God did not so
hate but he vouchsafed him means whereby he might have
been saved. <hi>Noluit Esau &amp; non cucurrit, sed si voluisset
&amp; cucurrisset, Dei adjutorio pervenisset: Esau</hi> would not
and so he ran not; but if he would and had ran, by the
help of God he should have obtained. <hi>Qui etiam velle &amp;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46181:108"/>
currere vocando praestaret, nisi vocatione contempta, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probus
fieret,</hi> who by his vocation would have wrought
in him, both to will and to run, but that by contemning
the call he became reprobate. And the whole Church
of <hi>Lyons</hi> as well as St. <hi>Austin,</hi> is of the same judgment,
affirming in the cause of ... <hi>de scalius,</hi> the predestination,
(whom though she defend as far as she well might, and
as <hi>Hinciomarus</hi> than thought and others still think, in
some things farther too, yet in this she leaves him) affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I say, that Gods reprobation, that is, this hatred here
doth subject, she says, not <hi>Esau</hi> only but no man else unto
any unavoidable necessity of destruction; neither doth
she only say this, but she says 'tis Blasphemy for any else to
say the contrary. <hi>Si quis neget esse apud Deum Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiam
&amp; praedestinationem, manifeste insidelis est.
Si quis dicit, quod praescientia &amp; praedestinatio ejus
atiquem compellat ut malus sit, &amp; aliud esse non possit,
horribiliter blasphemat:</hi> If any man deny prescience and
Predestination of God, it is manifest infidelity. And if
any affirm that this prescience or Predestination of his
doth enforce or necessitate any man (for that she says be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she means by enforcing) unto evil, so that he could
not be otherwise, it is horrible Blasphemy. No marvel
therefore that the <hi>Valentin</hi> Council did detest it with a
Curse, or rather cursed it with all detestation, as another
Synod also had done before. <hi>Aliquos ad malum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinatos
esse, videlicet ut quasi aliud esse non pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
non solum non credimus, sed etiam si sint qui tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

Arausica Synodus, illis Anathema dicimus: vid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Curse upon such, as I rather desire God to bless them
with the knowledge and confession of their error.</p>
            <p>And by this time the truth and equity of this Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or increpation of God, I say not against <hi>Ammon</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:46181:109"/>
and <hi>Amalek, de extraneis judicabit Deus,</hi> for of those
that are without, God will judge, we may not; but against
<hi>Israel,</hi> against the Church of God, against those that are
called unto the Knowledge and profession of the truth,
think is evident and clear enough, <hi>O Israel thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
thy self.</hi> If it be not, there is yet one fresh argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more and strong enough, before your eyes, more
fully to prove it. If any man die, either by hereditary or
contracted Diseases, that hath a medicine before him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to cure both, he may well praise the good will of his
Physician, but can justly blame none but his wilful self,
if he perish. It is that <hi>Calix salutaris, Davids</hi> Cup of
Salvation, wherein is a potion mixed and tempered for
all Complexions, and all Distempers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the universal medicine of the World, of power
and virtue enough to cure all, if all drink it, so they drink
it not upon full Stomachs, but after a time of fasting and
abstinence, if not from flesh, yet from those fleshly Lusts
that war against the Soul. As <hi>Naamans</hi> servants said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him when <hi>Elisha</hi> willed him to repair unto <hi>Jordan</hi>
for the cure of his Leprosy, <hi>If the Prophet had bid thee
do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done it?
how much rather then, when he saith unto thee only
Wash and be clean?</hi> so may we unto you, if God should
command you, sick unto death and poisoned with a more
contagious Leprosie than ever <hi>Naaman</hi> was, to do some
great thing for your recovery, would you not do it? how
much rather then, now when he says only Drink and be
whole?</p>
            <p>It is open and proposed to all, no Man is debarred, no
Man excepted, yea all are invited, nay all commanded.
<hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. xxiv.</note> even when <hi>Judas</hi> himself was one
of them all: yea and there is no doubt but if <hi>Judas</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
with a faithful and penitent heart had drank it,
he might have been saved by a draught of that blood,
which himself drew out and betrayed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:46181:109"/>There can be no stronger argument for the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Christs death, than this holy Mystery wherein it
is generally offered. If his purpose in shedding be not
as large as his command for drinking his blood, he must
say one thing and purpose another, which is hypocrisie
with Men, and let his portion be with Hypocrites, for
my part, that shall think so of god. Doth he enjoin you
upon pain of death, those many which are called, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that which he never meant to give, but to those
few only, that are elected? doth he now bind those to
believe in his death to whom he never intended any
good or benefit when he died? who therefore if they
should believe, must notwithstanding be damned in their
belief, or else saved for believing a falshood? Both infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
absurd, and contain, as a Sea of injury against God,
so a swallowing Gulf of disconsolation and desperation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Men. To avoid which shall we minister this blessed
Sacrament with a tacite and secret condition, if thou belong
unto the Elect? as <hi>Zanchius</hi> and some others otherwise
learned, driven by the like or rather the same absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
confess they baptized Children even the Children of
the faithful: a dangerous Doctrine and of most fearful
consequence, making Christ himself, that is the truth it
self, in whose mouth was never guile found (for in his
person all Ministers that are his in the dispensation of
those mysteries speak) amidst the comfortable and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promises of Mercy and Salvation, to deceive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
poor creatures, like a false Jesuit with mental reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Thus to decline one errour, they fall into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and it is hard to judge which is the worst. How much
better the Valentine Synod, <hi>In Ecclesiae sacramentis ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil
cassum, nihil ludificatorium, sed prorsus totum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
&amp; ipsa sui veritate ac siuceritate subnixum.</hi> In
the Sacraments of the Church there is nothing empty
and hollow, nothing delusory, but all in them altogether
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46181:110"/>
true, as being upheld by no other props but their own
proper sincerity and truth. And therefore as the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Learned <hi>Hooker</hi> hath it, Unless we our selves
hinder, they ever give and exhibite what they promise,
and are unto us what they signify. They are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
of Grace, it is conveyed from the common Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(unless we our selves obstruct, the Pipes) to every
Mans private Cistern; the Seals of the promise of life,
which being given in general in the word, is here by the
Elements of Bread and Wine, sensibly applyed in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
Now <hi>the promise,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the <hi>Acts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to you and your Children, even unto as many as
the Lord our God shall call,</hi> not to those only which he
shall Elect, and many are called though few are chosen.
And then to as many as the promise doth belong to, the
Seals of the promise, yea and <hi>sanguis tastamenti,</hi> the blood
of the promise both promised and sealed, must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
appertain. This being too plain to be denied, they
grant that every Man called by the Gospel ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that his blood was shed for himself in particular,
but withal ought to believe also that it was not shed for
all others that ought to believe it. All may believe of
themselves, that themselves may not believe of all, and
my Faith must deny me to believe that of them, which I
must enjoin them to believe, and so make one Faith to
contradict, and like opposite pellets, to shoot out one
another, every Man conceiving, that every other may be
deceived in his Faith beside himself, and so mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
both themselves and each other; why, if he died
for every one in particular, how could he chuse but die
for all in general, and if he died not generally for all,
with what truth may every one believe it in particular?</p>
            <p>But such mazes and Labyrinths, errour, once hunted
out of knowledge, is enforced to tread and it would
weary me to follow her. The end of the Chase I am sure,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46181:110"/>
is an abrupt and dangerous precipice, for how doth it
evatuate and frustrate the general Will and Testament
of God, like a quirk or gull in Law, that all may fall to the
particular Heir? It cuts the very strings and Sinews of
our general hope, and looseth the Cable of our Anchor,
if not clean through, yet more than half way; it lops
and maims the everlasting promises of bliss, nay it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and shakes our very Faith, the life of our Souls,
and renders it both dubious and deceitful. In a word
it digs so low and close upon the foundation, as I think
it should not be endured. But to such inconveniences
are they driven, who having the persons of Men in too
much admiration, think they cannot sufficiently admire
their Teachers vertues, unless withal they maintain their
errours: But from whence soever the doctrine comes, and
howsoever it be so frequently taught in this Kingdom, I am
sure it is not the Doctrine of this Church who enjoins all
by subscription, that shall teach in it, so to preach the
particularity of predestination in particular, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
not the universality of the promise. And yet though
the promise be universal, it doth not follow that all must
receive the benefit of it, because though the promise of
Christ and his blood be absolute, yet the application
of it is upon condition, which when all do not perform,
all do not receive; but it is their own fault, who being
prevented by Grace may, but neglect to perform it. <hi>Let
us therefore fear,</hi> saith the author to the <hi>Hebrews, lest a
promise being left us of entring into his rest, any of you
should seem to come short of it.</hi> For even those Jews had
a promise of <hi>Canaan</hi> and in it of the eternal rest, whose
Carcasses notwithstanding for their disobedience, fell
short of it in the desert; and God <hi>sware in his wrath,
they should not enter into his rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore though the passion and death of
Christ be absolute, and in it self belonging to all, yet
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46181:111"/>
there may be but a few to whom the good and benefit of
it shall redound. For remission of sins doth not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
flow from his blood without intercedent obedience
in us: the next effect of it, is not presently Salvation, but
a way and means whereby, <hi>non obstante justitiâ,</hi> without
any impeachment to his justice, we may now attain unto
Salvation. It doth not instantly convey us again into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
but only gives us the word, whereby we may, if
we will, safely and without impeachment pass the Angel
and his flaming Sword, that guards the entrance thither:
so that by it, <hi>non solvitur omnibus captivitas, sed sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitur
omnibus captivitati necessitas,</hi> though all be not
actually loosed from Captivity, yet all are loosed from
the necessity of Captivity, as the late and learned
Writer of the Pelagian Story. The gates of Brass and
bars of Iron are smitten in sunder, and so a way opened
unto the Captives, who notwithstanding if they be so far
enamoured with their misery and captivity, may for all
that, lie still in their Prison. It is a potion for the good
of all that are <hi>sick, sed si non bibitur non medetur,</hi> if it
be not faithfully drank it shall never effectually cure,
saith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Prosper.</hi> And therefore we need not be anxious or
doubtful on Gods behalf, but only careful and solicitous
for our selves, what he hath promised in Baptism that he
for his part will not be wanting, sure he will never break
in his Supper; He will not fail to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
if we but seriously bewail the breach of ours. It is a
Spiritual Banquet whereunto there never came any sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
and hungry Soul that ever departed empty. And
therefore let us draw near in full assurance of Faith no
way wavering, <hi>for he is faithful that hath promised,</hi> saith
St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And as he is faithful that hath promised, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he promiseth nothing here, but to the faithful, we
must bring this with us, though it be not of us, a living
Faith that only can work Repentance from dead works
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46181:111"/>
not to be repented of. And this Faith, only once thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rooted, begets that other confidence and fullness of
Faith the Apostle speaks of, which, if it hath any other
Parent, is illegitimate, ill born and falsly termed Faith,
when the true Father's name is Presumption. And for
this cause those that the Apostle exhorts to draw near
with full assurance of Faith, he thus qualifies, having a
true heart, an heart sprinkled from an evil Conscience.
Then we go on rightly and orderly, when we come not
to the confident faith but by the penitent; and as we go
from faith to faith here, so we shall appear before the
God of Gods in <hi>Sion</hi> hereafter: if therefore our heart
within be true an upright within us, if by a deep and
entire Repentance it be sprinkled from an evil Conscience,
let us draw near in full assurance of faith, as being most
confident, that our lips do not more truly drink the
fruit of the Vine, than our Souls do the blood of our
Saviour, the effect and merit of his blood, whereby
that which before was but sprinkled, shall now be drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and thoroughly cleansed from all the stains and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of Sin.</p>
            <p>Our heart is ready O God, our heart is ready: only
come thou and dwell in our hearts, purge them and cleanse
them wholly with thy blood, and being cleansed keep and
preserve them by thy Spirit spotless and blameless, until
the day of thy second coming in the Clouds with Glory.
That we who receive thee with fulness of faith now,
may stand before thee with the same confidence then, and
be received by thee and with thee into those eternal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
at the right hand of God, where is fulness of
joy an pleasure for evermore. To whom with thee and

            <p>Secondly, the utmost improvement of Grace, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
farther adorn and beautify the Soul than with the
righteousness of God, <hi>His Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, the highest degree of glory, nothing can be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
higher than participation with God in his own Kingdom,
<hi>The Kingdom of God.</hi> The less marvel therefore that
our search and travel for these, these latter, yea our
utmost industry and endeavour be so carefully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
led upon and inculcated, with a <hi>Quaerite</hi> and a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
quaerite,</hi> seek and first seek, <hi>Seek ye first the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein the division is as plain,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46181:113"/>
as the matter important. The main parts but two:</p>
            <list>
               <label>A Precept.</label>
               <item>The Precept, <hi>seek.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>A Promise.</label>
               <item>
                  <hi>The Promise,</hi> All these things shall be added unto you.</item>
            </list>
            <p>A promise, not, as it sounds, only of these things which
shall be added, but of those spiritual things also we are
willed to seek for; if those be added, it implies these shall
be given. These given as the Reward of our search,
Those added <hi>ex Abundanti</hi> as an overplus, or surplusage
out of his Providence: so the Promise is of all both spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things and secular: of the one sort expresly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
of the other: And so it should be, for <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
hath the promise of this life and the life which
is to come,</hi> saith the Apostle.</p>
            <p>The precept on which the accomplishment of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
doth depend, and wherein only, I think, I shall at this
time proceed, hath these particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The Action enjoyned, and the manner and modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of that Action, <hi>Seek,</hi> and <hi>first seek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The object of our search proposed: a double ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
prime, and secondary. <hi>The Kingdom of God, and
the Righteousness of God:</hi> for both must be sought,
that intentionally as the end of our Travel, this by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
as the way, the only way that leads unto it,
<hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his Rigeteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because the object (as the Schools speak) doth ever
precede the Action that works upon it, not ever indeed as
really existent, but yet always Ideally in the mind and
contemplation of the worker, whether it be God or man,
whether actions transient, or immanent, external Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Decrees, and prefinition internal; Though they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
nothing in being, but their Author, yet they presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
all things as being understood and apprehended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can be either wrought or willed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:46181:113"/>3. Therefore in the third place the right way thither is
discovered, <hi>Righteousness,</hi> a way as clean as right, unto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
through the paths of holiness: to the Kingdom of
God, by the righteousness of God. But Righteousness is
not so easily found, or being found, is not so easily kept
and observed. And therefore it is not a bare seeking that
will serve the turn here, he must seek and search, knock
and call with his best might and his utmost endeavour,
which will be the fourth and last point though first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
<hi>First seek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So have we all the direction and incitation too, that
may be desired: The Port and Haven of our rest and
happiness everlasting, proposed; <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi>
Our duty and endeavour urged to weigh Anchor, put to
Sea for the search and discovery of it; <hi>Seek.</hi> Our course
shaped and directed, that we wander not in the Ocean;
by the Righteousness of God. And lastly, because the
voyage is tedious and difficult unto flesh and blood, and
no less perilous than painful by reason of many Rocks
and Shelves, and Quick-sands that lie in the way, at least
about it, our vigilance is farther admonished, our best
attention and industry again, and more earnestly called
upon with a <hi>primùm quaerite: first,</hi> that is, chiefly and
above all things most carefully <hi>seek.</hi> For so seeking we
shall be sure to find; performing our part in the precept,
God will not fail to perform his part in the promise: give
both the Kingdom which we sought, and add those other
things which are unworthy of our search. But I begin
with the Precept and in it with that Kingdom that should
quicken us to the practice of it. <hi>The Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereof yet at this time I shall speak but little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no Man can say enough, or indeed any thing to
purpose of that, which neither eye hath seen nor ear
heard, nor possibly can enter into the heart of Man. St.<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
saw but a weak beam of it in the transfiguration of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46181:114"/>
Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. ix. 33.</note> and he was so ravished with it as he spake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
he knew not what. St. <hi>Paul</hi> heard but a little
sound of it with his ear in an ecstasie and rapture into
Paradise, and he was himself he knew not what; whether
in the body or out of the body, he could not tell; only
he heard words there,<note place="margin">2 Cor. xii. 4.</note> which, when he came to himself,
he could not utter neither, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ineffable
words, words impossible, and were they possible, not
lawful to be uttered. The holy Spirit himself seeks not
to express this happiness in it self, but only to intimate it
by similitudes and such feeble notions as we are capable
of and acquainted withal. And of all such, this here,
this of a Kingdom is the best, Kings and Kingdoms they
are the most glorious things that are upon Earth, and
therefore fittest to resemble the glory of Heaven. And
yet they are but resemblances neither, indeed shadows, as
the Author of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> rather than full resemblances
of this Kingdom, <hi>Regnum Dei,</hi> the Kingdom of God.
A Kingdom fully accomplished with all Dignities and
Prerogatives Royal, and that in an eminent and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
manner. They seem principally to be but four. 1. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.
2. Majesty. 3. Wealth. 4. Pleasure. Dominion
and Empire, Majesty and Glory, Wealth and Treasure,
Pleasure and Delights, these are the dazling beams that
give such lustre and brightness unto sublunary Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,
and they are all here, and all infinitely more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
in the celestial, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Empire and Dominion how full and absolute, how
large and spacious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> extending it self not only from Sea to
Sea, from the flood unto the lands end; but from Land to
Sea, from Sea to Air, from Air to Heaven, from thence to
the Heaven of Heavens, which as they contain not his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so neither may they limit his. Dominion and Power.
It is called the Kingdom of Heaven, not that it is there
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onfined and bounded, for it runs through Heaven and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46181:114"/>
Earth, <hi>the heaven is his throne and the earth is his
footstool.</hi> That indeed is the City of the great King, the
Metropolis and principal Province of the Kingdom, the
Heaven of Heavens. Next unto it is the Ethereal Region,
wherein are the Celestial Orbs, the Stars and wandering
Planets, all of them keeping the due course and order
their King hath appointed them, and not fainting in their
watches, as the Wise man speaketh. From hence it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
into the Aereal, wherein are the strange and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Meteors, <hi>lightning and thunder, fire hail, snow, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
winds and tempests, and all of them fulfilling his
word,</hi> as the Psalmist hath it. After this into the Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the Region of Waters, <hi>the great Sea, and all that
walk in the paths of the Sea,</hi> all subject to his power
that made them, they and their raging Element. He hath
given them a law which they may not break, he <hi>hath set</hi>
this <hi>bound which it cannot pass; hitherto shalt thou
come, and here shalt thou stay thy proud waves.</hi> The
earth follows, as the Center and Foundation of all, which
yet hath no foundation it self but is <hi>hung out upon empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
as <hi>Job</hi> speaks. And this though a remote yet a
principal Region it is of his Empire, and furnished with
the noblest Inhabitants of all other, not only with Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
Plants and Beasts, but as yet with rational Men
though mortal, to some of whom the Lord even in this
life hath imparted of his own soveraignty, a Lordship o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the earth, yet so as he retains the Supremacy, and
will be still Lord paramount himself, for <hi>his is the earth
and the fulness thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet it stayeth not here, but pierceth farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the lowest of all, the subterraneous Region, a Region
of death and darkness: <hi>Arabia deserta,</hi> a desert and
doleful Region this, that brings forth no good fruits, but
is appointed only for the habitation of wicked and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Angels, and such of Men as they have seduced to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46181:115"/>
the like wickedness. All these Regions and Provinces are
contained within the circuit of his Dominion and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for <hi>omnia serviunt tibi, all things what soever serve
thee.</hi> Psal. cxix.</p>
            <p>This is Gods Kingdom, and the Kingdom of God it is,
that shall be imparted to the children of Men: His it is, his
only by natural righteousness: his servants it shall be by
gracious communication. Indeed the communication of
the Kingdom is first and principally unto Christ who is
<hi>Haeres universorum,</hi> the Heir, the immediate Heir of all
things, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. There is not an Inhabitant of the three
grand Regions, Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, but
they are all put in subjection under his feet, and must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one therefore bow the knee at the very name of
Jesus, as a reverence and homage unto their Lord. But
yet in and through Christ, it shall be communicated also
unto all his, that are truly Christians: for these are <hi>heirs</hi>
too, <hi>heirs of God, and coheirs with Christ,</hi> Rom. viii.
As they partake of his name, so they shall receive of the
Royal Unction which it signifies; He only is the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
King, but the oyntment resteth not only on him; but
from him, as from the head, runs down into the beard,
and drops on the very skirts of his Rayment, by which
they are all interessed in the same Kingdom. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>qui vicerit dabo ei sedere in throno meo: to him
that overcometh will I give to sit with me on my throne,
even as I overcame, and am sate down on my Fathers
throne,</hi> Revel. iii. 21.</p>
            <p>So Gods throne is over all, Christ sits on God's, we on
Christ's and therefore on God's: and so have a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
power from God, through Christ, over all that
God and Christ have. He will make him <hi>Ruler over all
his goods,</hi> Matth. xxiv. 47.</p>
            <p>Justly then a Kingdom in respect of Dominion, and
no less rightly in regard of Majesty and Glory, the second
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46181:115"/>
Prerogative of Kings and Kingdoms. And sure they are
no mean rays of Majesty, and Majesty Divine, that above
all other persons do descend and settle on the heads of
Princes, crowning them more than that of Gold, with
Glory and Honour. True it is, every rational Man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
more or less with the image and similitude of
God, which all other creatures irrational do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by their fear: the fear of Man is on them all. But
Kings bear this similitude with a difference of eminence
and excellency, and are stamped with a special chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of the Divinity, that commands reverence and dread
from all their inferiours, even those whom all things
else do fear. A great participation of honour, than which
there is not a greater, unless in this Kingdom, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven; that indeed infinitely surmounts it: for
there and there only is the fulness of Majesty, Majesty
Divine, where is the Seat and Scepter, the very Throne
of the Divinity, at the erection and presence whereof
all other Thrones and Scepters, though never so glorious,
must at length tumble to the Earth, as that Image be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Ark utterly broken. It was a goodly statue that
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> beheld, it had a head of pure Gold, but
when that mighty stone cut out of the Mountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hands once fell upon it, it ran instantly into powder:
so the same Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in a vision of his own doth
assure us: <hi>I beheld,</hi> faith he, <hi>till the thrones were cast
down, and the Antient of days did sit, whose garment
was white as snow; and the hair of his head like pure
wooll: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his
wheels like burning fire. A fiery stream came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssuing forth
from before him: thousand thousands ministred unto
him, and ten thousand times ten thousands stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: the judgment was set, and the books were
opened,</hi> Dan. vii. 9, 10. And this sure is a majestick
Throne, and even on this Throne about which so many
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46181:116"/>
blessed Angels stood and ministred, men (which is strange)
holy men and Saints shall sit as Assessors, judging not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> but the whole world, the world
of the wicked, both men and Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 2, 3. And
as their majesty is, such is their glory, a glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and marvellous. <hi>For the glory of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd shall
shine upon his Servants and he shall shew himself mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
in his Saints:</hi> Their very bodies shall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
and shine as the Sun in the firmament, but their
Spirits much more glorious: with them they shall <hi>see God
as he is,</hi> that is, in his glory; and by seeing be <hi>transformed
into his Image,</hi> that is, made like unto him in glory,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. <hi>ult.</hi> And as of Glory, so I think it will be found
for Riches and Treasure, the third thing of eminence
in the Kingdoms of this world, as being the sinews of
their strength, the support of their state, dignity and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.</p>
            <p>3. But as all power is but impotence, all honour igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
so all wealth but poverty respectively unto the
Riches of this Kingdom: This only hath veins and mines
of Treasure indeficient, Fountains of wealth inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when these below are quickly drawn dry, and whilst
they run, cannot quench the thirst of those that drink
them, who therefore have no means to be truly rich by
adding to their wealth but by withdrawing from their
desire. But this beggerly Philosophy (the best yet, that is
in this Vale of misery,) is utterly banished the confines of
this Kingdom, whose Riches are of another nature, and
powerful not only to provoke, but to satiate the appetite.
We need not make a vertue of necessity here, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with such things as we have because we may not
have such as we would; at best but a rich poverty; but
enlarge your selves to the uttermost; open the mouth
wide and it shall be filled: and that is true wealth that
doth fill the mind, not that which doth restrain it; that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46181:116"/>
doth not curb the desires, but feed them till there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to be desired. And such are the riches of this
Kingdom. For what can he desire more, that hath God?
and all that God hath, all that he hath, for <hi>omnia ejus
nostra sunt,</hi> All that he hath is ours; all that he is, is
ours too. <hi>Deus erit omnia in omnibus, God shall be
all in all, 1 Cor.</hi> xiii. Doubtless it could be the intuition
of no other Riches but these that could make King. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
(a Prince of such mighty wealth as the Treasure he
left behind can at this day hardly be calculated, yet amidst
them all) to cry out, <hi>Ego vero pauper &amp; egenus, but I
am poor and needy, but the Lord careth for me:</hi> See
where his Riches lay, in that God which may not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
but in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>4. The last things of moment attending on the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of this world are Pleasures and delights; whereof
indeed they afford great variety, but wherein little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
For as their Gold hath much dross, so their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pleasure is mixed with travel and trouble not a little.
Only the Kingdom of God, the Paradise of true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
is it, that hath liquid pleasures and pure from all
mixtures of sorrow, <hi>Revel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 3. We that are immersed,
drowned in flesh and blood, can hardly think there are any
other pleasures but these of the body; though our own
Reason, if consulted, cannot but inform us, that this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

earth is not more inferiour unto the immortal
Spirit that informs it, than the delights of that Spirit
are excellent and Divine above all the gross and brute
pleasures of the perishing body: Though here are all, and
all sorts of delights, all that are immixed and pure from
imperfection both for body and Soul. The senses of the

to set forth all his magnificence, like <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> unto his
Princes. The marriage-feast of the Lamb, and <hi>write,</hi> saith
the Angel, <hi>Blessed are they that are invited to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lambs Marriage, Revel.</hi> xix. How blessed
then are they that shall at that time be married themselves
unto the Lamb? The Body indeed is invited to the feast,
but the Soul is it that shall be married unto the great King:
as it is in the Prophet <hi>Hosea, I will marry thee to my self
in everlasting kindness. Quales Thalami illius am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexus?</hi>
Who can possibly conceive the joys then of the
Bride-chamber, or the pleasures of the Bride-grooms
embracement! when God and the Soul shall be so closely
knit and closed together, as they become but one Spirit;
as by this marriage here, two are made one flesh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
vi. 17. A strange and marvellous union, that as the Father
is in the Son and the Son in the Father: so all blessed
Spirits shall be in both, and all but one in both as both
they are but one. A true marriage this and a through on
all sides: Souls knit unto Souls, and all unto God: A
union divine like the union of God, the effect of it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a joy divine, no less like the joy of God: So like,
as in Scripture it is said to be the same: <hi>Intra in gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
Domini, Enter into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> even
into that joy wherewith the Lord himself rejoyceth,
and is everlastingly blessed, who perfectly apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own infinite worth and goodness doth as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
enjoy it in himself. And such shall be your joy,
who shall not only pierce: the inmost verity of all other
things, and clearly know the truth of whatsoever is
doubtfully disputed here, but shall be enabled to behold
and contemplate with open face all the excellence and
beauty of the Divinity it self, by the understanding;
and enjoy it too, by embracing and cleaving unto it
with the will and affections: though not comprehensibly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46181:117"/>
and commensurably as God doth, yet fully; every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his capacity and as a Creature may, <hi>Totum
Dei,</hi> but not <hi>totaliter,</hi> seeing and enjoying all of God,
though not in that alsufficient and supereminent manner
as God doth; This is <hi>intrare in gaudium Domini, to
enter into the joy of the Lord,</hi> and that is to be <hi>filled,</hi> as the
Apostle speaks, <hi>with all the fulness of God:</hi> which since
it is the most we can, it shall be the last we will at this time
say of it; only adding thus much, that though we may
put an end to the speech of it, there shall be no end of
the joy. <hi>At his right hand are pleasures for evermore.</hi>
A Kingdom then it is, and in all respects the Kingdom of
God: In regard and so seeing, be made like unto him, and that is
participation of the glory of God: In regard of wealth
and riches; we shall be Rulers over all his goods, and
that is a full possession of the Treasures of God: And lastly
in regard of pleasures and delights, we shall enter into the
Lords joy, and that is no other than the joy of God. Joy,
Wealth, Honour, Dominion, all Divine; and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of all; and therefore the Kingdom of God, that is
an everlasting Kingdom: for <hi>Regni ejus non erit finis,
of his Kingdom there shall be no end, Luk.</hi>iii. But we
must end the point, wherein if I have stayed the longer,
you may please to remember what St. <hi>Peter</hi> said, when he
saw but a shadow of it, <hi>Bonum est esse hîc, it is good to
be here:</hi> A subject so pleasing, that once entred, a man
can hardly be drawn off, with that Apostle, from building
Tabernacles there, and dwelling on it for ever. But yet
we are not so to contemplate the happiness of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as we forget to consider, what we are to do that
we may attain unto it: for something is to be done,
though not much; seek it we must at least, if we mean
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46181:118"/>
to have it; the second Point, <hi>Seek the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And sure it is little worth, that is not worth the
seeking; not any thing, not so much as our daily bread
but must be sought; and that in <hi>sudore vultûs,</hi> in the
sweat of thy brow. And shall the Kingdom of Heaven so
far above all things, be valued at a lower rate than any
thing else? for there is not any thing but misery on earth,
and Hell beneath it, the just reward of sloth, that may
be purchased without travel. Those idle people in the
Market-place whom our Saviour questions in the Parable
with a <hi>quid hîc statis otiosi,</hi> had yet some rational plea
for their idleness, <hi>no man hath hired us;</hi> we have none
such; see a Kingdom, even the everlasting Kingdom of
God is your hire. He that is now idle, is idle without
pretence, and let him be miserable without pity. And yet
two sorts of Men there are, that trespass in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
The one seeks, but without all respect of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
the other would gladly be invested in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
but will by no means seek it: he scorns to work
for hire; this no hire can set a work: that relies too much
on divine attraction; this aims too much at supposed
perfection; but <hi>seek the Kingdom of God</hi> convinceth
both.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first,</hi> (to touch first on them) in their refined
zeal conceive they could serve God sufficiently, were
there neither Heaven nor Happiness to encourage them:
yea that men ought to serve him without all considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of either, branding all intuition of reward for self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,
and all service founded thereon as meerly mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But Gods hired servants, are servants, and have bread
enough, saith the Text; and will have, while these aere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
conceits blow up the Soul only with wind, no way
fill it with solid nourishment. Indeed were the reward
any thing but God himself, it might well be self-love and
a love meerly mercenary to expect only the reward. But
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46181:118"/>
when the reward is God himself, he neither loves God
nor himself, as he should, that doth not then fasten his
eye on the reward; working in the hope and joy of it
whatsoever he works. It is most true, every Man ought
to love God above all; yea all love ought to be fully
and finally terminated in God. But yet with reference
unto him, a Man may and should love both himself and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things also besides; And therefore every love of
himself, is not presently self-love. Indeed he loves himself
least, that hath most of self-love in these poor things and
perishing, that add nothing to his intrinsick perfection,
which he is bound to love: And since God himself, and
God only is the full perfection of a Soul capable of God;
it follows, he cannot but love God most that most affects
his own perfection, that is, union with God. And thus
the love of God and self-love are competible; yea are
and must be inseparable. Neither is it enough to love
God only as the Supream and Soveraign good in himself,
unless he love him also as the supream and soveraign
good of the lover of himself, that loveth; otherwise
while men seek to clarifie, they will but cool their love;
but evacuate utterly their hope; That must henceforth
be razed out of the number of the Theological virtues,
yea by this account, must needs become vitious. But
<hi>there remain these three,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, Faith, Hope, and
Love,</hi> and let them remain still; for sure unless we love
in hope, and have hope to cherish our love, we shall
neither love nor hope as we should, no nor believe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But that blessed Apostle it seems was not yet arrived
unto these Mens perfection; nay nor he neither, that was
perfection it self: He, in whom the fulness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
dwelt bodily, was yet incouraged by therecompence
of the reward, which is set forth as a reason, why <hi>be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
the Cross, despised the shame and run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
the race which was set before him: for he had an
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46181:119"/>
eye unto the recompence of reward.</hi> And as he had an
eye unto it himself in his own particular, so he fails not
to draw all eyes unto it, almost every where in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
This very Sermon (and it is the first set and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Sermon that ever he preached) takes beginning
with this, this proposition of the reward, this very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the Kingdom. <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
their's is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Afterwards in the
whole course of his preaching, you shall find it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pressed and earnestly: yea after his death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
in those last forty days before he ascended, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
often unto his Disciples, he discoursed unto them
of the Kingdom of God, <hi>Act.</hi> i. 3. This brings in and
leads out all his Sermons; the beginning, continuance,
and consummation of them seems to be <hi>Regnum Dei,</hi> the
Kingdom of God. And sure were it well known, did we
clearly apprehend <hi>the hope of our calling, the riches of
the inheritance of the Saints,</hi> could we comprehend
with them all what is the <hi>height, and length, and breadth,
and depth,</hi> and know the dimensions of that <hi>love of God
in Christ, which passeth knowledge:</hi> nay were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
treasures of that Kingdom, which this love hath
prepared, but truly believed, I think no Man would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
any labour too great that might bring him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But to leave these, that seek, but not for the Kingdom,
for they are not so many; The disease of those other that
would gladly have the Kingdom, but without seeking, is
more general. Few Mens thoughts are much troubled
with this employment. If it concern these things indeed,
the pleasures or profits of the present, how diligently do
most Men seek and search, rack and ransack all corners
and quarters of the world? That Woman for her lost

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or these Gentiles in the verse here precedent, not
half so painfully. But for that true wealth and honour, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46181:119"/>
those immortal pleasures of the Kingdom which is to
come, as if they would come of themselves, though we
would gladly enjoy them when we can no longer hold
these, other yet travel or trouble for them in the mean
time, we would not willingly suffer any. As if we thought
to light on this Kingdom of God, as <hi>Saul</hi> did on his,
whilst we seek Cattle in the desert. Here we can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to look on the Lilies of the Field (as our Saviour a
little before wills) but with a contrary intention, and
would willingly be cloathed with Immortality and Glory,
but on their condition, <hi>ne<expan>

we might neither labour nor spin for it. No voice so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to our ears as that of <hi>Moses</hi> at the red Sea, <hi>Stand
still and see the salvation of God:</hi> or that of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
to the <hi>Romans, He was found of those that sought him
not.</hi> It is strange we can trust God for nothing, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
this life and the good things of it, without our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
industry and endeavour: and yet can be confident
in him for the blessings of the future, though we stir nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
foot nor finger in the prosecution of them. As if
my Text were to be inverted, and first seeking these
things, we supposed the Kingdom of God were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
out of his providence and without our care. All
care and thought of our own seeking, seems to be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the conceit of his drawing. That of our Saviour
is so much in our eye as we can hardly see any thing
else. <hi>Nemo venit nisi Pater traxerit.</hi> And it is most true,
unless God prevent us with his Grace and draw us unto
himself, we of our selves shall never, can never come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. But do we utterly want that attractive Grace,
or rather do we not draw back, and turn the Grace of
God into wantonness, as the Apostle speaks? For how doth
God draw, or whom? though he draw, yet he doth not
drag: he draws Men and not blocks, so draws one way,
as yet refractory dispositions may and too often do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46181:120"/>
               <hi>if any man shall draw back, my soul shall hate him,</hi>
Heb. x. There are but two ways to work upon the heart
of Man, Power or Perswasion: That is possible only to
the omnipotence of God; this proper to the rational na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man. And it pleaseth God usually to deal with
Men according to their nature, <hi>Quos sic movet, ut mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
suos agere sinat,</hi> whom he so moves (saith St. <hi>Austin
lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de civit. Dei cap.</hi> 30.) as he yet permits to be
their own movers; yea when he moves most effectually,
yet he moves not but congruously also. So saith the Wise
man of him and his providence, <hi>pertingit à fine us<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

finem fortiter, &amp; disponit omnia suaviter: power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
first yet <hi>sweetly</hi> also, that is, aptly and sutably to their
nature and disposition; He draws them indeed, yet not
by the heels, but by the ear, <hi>qui audivit &amp; didicit,
he that hath heard and learned of my Father cometh.</hi>
The very next verse unto that former in the 6. of St. <hi>John</hi>
gives the way of drawing, by instruction not by impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Rational Men therefore must expect rational means,
direction and instruction. <hi>I will inform thee in the way
wherein thou shalt walk, I will guide thee with mine
eye. Bitt and bridle</hi> that hold in by force, as it follows,
<hi>are for horse and mule, that have no understanding.</hi>
Not a word of his mouth, not a motion of his spirit, not
a benefit of his grace and favour, but are as so many
cords to draw us unto himself, and so himself testifies in
the Prophet <hi>Hosea, I took the yoke from their neck and
I laid meat before them, In funibus Adami, &amp; loris a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matoriis
atiraxi eos, I drew them with the cords of a
man, with the bonds of love.</hi> The love indeed and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Lord laying meat before them, as the Keeper
draws his Call, proposing a Kingdom as in this place (and
what may draw if such a Kingdom cannot?) especially
when the gracious motions of his Spirit unto yours are
not wanting, and the like. These are the cords and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46181:120"/>
bands, wherewith he drew them; and with which intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Men should be drawn, and well therefore stiled
<hi>funiculi hominis,</hi> the cords of a Man: All other Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
traction being the cords of Carts and Carriages, of
beasts and blocks rather than Men. And when God
thus draws and allures, it will concern Man highly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
and follow the attraction. We may not think to
stand idly under the influence of Grace, like Fruit-trees
under the beams of the Sun; much less hang under the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
like dead and inanimate trunks; least of all hale
another way; but being prevented by Divine Grace (for
<hi>you are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> saith St.
<hi>Paul)</hi> it will behove us to cooperate; having received a
Talent, to negotiate; a gift, to stir up the gift of God
that is in us, as the same Apostle unto <hi>Timothy, ne quis
desit gratiae Dei,</hi> lest wanting not grace in himself he
himself chance to be wanting unto his grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii 15.
Rightly therefore the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles, trahe me
post te, &amp; curremus, draw me after thee, and we will
run,</hi> Cant. i. 4. And it should be the resolution of every
one else, for that of St. <hi>Austin</hi> is most true, <hi>Qui fecit te
sine te, non salvabit te sine te:</hi> he that made thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thy self, will not save thee without thy pains: <hi>fecit
nescientem, non justificat nisi volentem,</hi> he made you
without your knowledge, he will not justify you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your will and endeavour, much less glorify. <hi>Nemo
coronatur nist certaverit,</hi> no Man shall receive the
Crown unless he strive for it; or be conveyed into this
Kingdom like <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Azo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi> unless he seek it, and
seek it in the right way, as he is here directed, by Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
even the Righteousness of God, <hi>seek the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God and his righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As no man finds unless he seeks: So every one that
seeks doth not presently find, unless he seek in the right
way. If he err in this, the more eagerly he seeks, the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46181:121"/>
more he errs, it is but <hi>Cursus celerrimus praeter viam,</hi>
and then the farther he runs, the farther still from his home.
Above all things therefore it concerns us to be sure of
the right way before we run on too furiously. And sure
the way were not hard to be discovered, but that it is
now almost overgrown like the rest of the field, for want
of passengers. It is indeed unto humane corruption some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
tedious and troublesome, rough and rocky; which
is the reason men have diverted into so many by-paths
of their own, hoping to find out some shorter cut or at
least a more pleasant passage into the Kingdom. In this kind
certainly, we have had seeking enough yea and too much:
every one almost bending his wits how he may best shape
the course of Religion sutable unto his own fancy and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
Setting up his own Ladder, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> said of
that Heretick, that so he may climbe to Heaven alone by
a way which none ever went before him; but wherein
he supposeth every man thenceforth is bound to follow
him. Yea by this means so many Paths and several Alleys
have been beaten out, as a Maze may sooner be trodden
than such intricate labyrinths: and (which is more) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man contending so earnestly for his own track, as he
condemns and even damns all others that tread never so
little besides his footsteps. Not considering that men
may come to the same place by several tracts, if they run
on in the same road. So long as they agree in necessary
truths and fundamentals, which is <hi>via regia,</hi> the Kings
high way, or rather the high way unto the Kingdom,
they may differ in such as are disputable and doubtful;
and yet both come safe enough thither. And yet we
may not much complain; so it hath ever fared and will
fare with the Church of Christ. Errours if not heresies
must needs be, that they who love the Truth may be the
better approved. But what then is to be done in this
case? Amidst these doubts and disputes where shall we
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46181:121"/>
fasten for that approbation? sure no way in the world so
safe and secure as this (the foundation we hold in common,
standing unshaken) to let go disputes, and fall unto pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
leave the unhappy fatal tree of Knowledge, and
betake us to the tree of Life: that since we cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
find truth, or else agree in it; we may at least seek
righteousness by which we shall certainly find both agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and truth a great deal the sooner. For seeking truth
too earnestly, unnecessary truth, we may easily lose righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and truth too. Vertue and Vice (as he said
well) being commonly at truce, whilst truth and error are
at wars; but seeking righteousness in peace we shall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fail of truth, <hi>Stand up from the dead,</hi> faith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>and Christ shall give thee light, Eph.</hi> v. And bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
therefore ever be the Counsels of his Royal breast,
whose high prudence by damming up these waters of
<hi>Marah</hi> in their Fountain and chasing away bitter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
that began to overflow this, as they have drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
almost other Countries, hath both reserved truth to
more deliberate and appeased cogitations hereafter, and
given peace unto the Church for the present: That so
the clashing of Truth and Errour (indeed truth and
truth, errour and errour) being silenced, Righteousness
and peace may meet, and kiss each other the more freely.
And that sure will be found the right and best way too
at the last. For most assuredly when all contestations are
terminated, when all these Sophismes and subtilties of the
Schools, <hi>Subtilitates ultramundanae &amp; plusquam Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippeae,</hi>
Subtilties, as he said, beyond the Moon, and such
as <hi>Chrysippus</hi> never dreamt on, shall vanish into air, leave
and forsake us utterly, it will be righteousness only that shall
do us good in the end; this righteousness of God and
our faithful endeavour in it, that shall be able to give
peace and comfort to the Soul in death, and through death
lead and light it into immortality and life. No way in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46181:122"/>
the world, no Righteousness thither, but this only the
good way, the way which the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> long since
discovered, <hi>I will shew you the good and the right way,
fear the Lord and serve him in truth, and consider how
great things he hath done for you.</hi> A good and a right,
and therefore a right good way. Not that every way
which is good, is presently right, (some may have the
zeal of God but not according to knowledge) but than
undoubtedly it cannot be right, unless it be good. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
way it be, if it cross or part with goodness, it will
in the same place certainly part with verity: where it
leaves rightousness, we may be sure it leaves truth; the
true Doctrine being always, as the Apostle testifies of it,
<hi>Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> secundum pietatem, a doctrine according unto
piety, I Tim. So Rectum est index sui &amp; obliqui,</hi> That
which is right, doth both discover it self and other things
that are crooked. But be the doctrine never so right and
righteous, yet if the man be not so, to what purpose is it?
Had he all truth and were endued with the knowledge
of all mysteries; yet if he detain that truth in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
it should profit him nothing, but to augment
that wrath of God, which, saith the Apostle, is already
revealed from Heaven against him. When on the other
side, did he know nothing else, nothing but Christ and
him crucified, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> desired to know no more)
yet walking faithfully in that path of Righteousness,
which he hath taught and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rodden out before him; his
ignorance of other controvertible truths, or suspension
either, I think would hurt him but little. For Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
naturally doth lead into truth, and unless men did
first forsake it, they could hardly run into dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
For were not the Soul depraved with unrighteous
lusts, and the judgment of the mind perverted by corrupt
affections, it could not easily resist apparent truth, or not
discern manifest falshood. But when the will gives it self
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46181:122"/>
over to be ruled by the appetite, no marvel if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
(naturally subject unto the will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) be as easily wrapt
in errour. Ambition and Avarice, and desire of sinning;
with sting of Conscience, having once seized upon the
Scribes and Pharisees, of old, what strange leaven were
they soon brought to mingle with the bread of life? And
how mightily have the same affections since wrought in
many more? Hence, as from the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, so many
impious, but profitable deceits and devices have issued
forth upon ignorant people: on the one side, dispensing
with them for their own sins, and dispensing to them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens merits, the imaginary treasure of the Church,
that the Church might be filled with real. Hence what
strange positions, and unto Piety most dangerous have
been formed, on the other side? establishing justification e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the loss of sanctification; presumptuously cloathing
themselves and their disciples with the righteousness of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
even then when they are wilfully unrighteous in
themselves. And so, not content upon repentance to be
justified by imputation, but have found out, even then
whilst they sin, an imputative (indeed a meer putative)
sanctification; that by this means amidst the works of
darkness, in the paradise of conceit, they may still remain
Children of light. <hi>But be not deceived,</hi> saith St. <hi>John, he
that doth righteousness, is righteous.</hi> All which, though
spisse and palpable hallucinatious on both parts; yet so
long as the eye is not single, as our Saviour speaks, but
blear'd with mists of profits and pleasures, they may not
easily be deceived, less easily redressed in either. They
may term themselves as they please; but so long as impure
desires are seated in the Soul, nothing shall be able to
tie them to the purity of that truth which opposeth, or
withhold them from contending for such falshoods as sute
with those desires. Itching ears and lusts in the spirits,
neither will nor can endure sound Doctrine, saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46181:123"/>
But rather than fail, will raise up unto themselves
Teachers after their own lusts, and at their own charge
raise preserments for them too, that so their hired tongues
may tickle their ears when they itch, smooth or smother
their sins; In this case who shall prevail, or what shall
give Men light, if in favour of their evil ways, they love
darkness more than light? It is only the search and study
of Righteousness that can bring us into the way of truth,
and dissolve errours, and their controversies, by taking
away their causes: by removing those gross and earthly
affections that like Foggs at noon darken and benight the
judgment. <hi>The pure</hi> and cleansed <hi>heart shall see God,</hi>
saith our Saviour; see him perfectly hereafter; see of him
and his truth more clearly in the present; as he doth else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
assure us. <hi>If any man doth the will of my Father,
he shall know of my doctrine.</hi> But besides the nature of
Righteousness, leading into truth, the protection and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
divine seems specially to assist and direct it. <hi>The
very secrets of the Lord,</hi> saith King <hi>David, are upon
them that fear him;</hi> who himself having respect unto the
Commandment, became wiser than his Teachers. But
however secrets, yet light enough sure shall ever spring
up unto the righteous, who have undoubted interest in
the promise of that Comforter, which unto the worlds end,
shall <hi>lead into all truth</hi>; all that is necessary for the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, when this world ends, into the glory of a
better: yea and teach them mildness in truths of less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
for the present. For did we follow righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and not pride and passion, we should easily learn to
enter on mysteries warily, and to maintain our opinions
soberly. And when the strife is peradventure, but about
a crackt pane in the Window; or a loose tyle in the Roof,
as he said well; not to raise such stirs and outcryes as if
the Foundation were presently endangered. It is only
the judgment which Righteousness hath cleared from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46181:123"/>
perturbations, that can discern the necessity of points, and
direct our prosecution accordingly; instructing us not to
call every problematical question by the name of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and infallible truth; but agreeing in fundamentals, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to leave superedifications to the tryal of that fire,
which will prove whether they are Gold or Stubble; or
else dispure them so calmly, as neither peace be disturbed,
nor charity destroyed; according, <hi>si non sententiis, sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
animis,</hi> if not in opinion, yet in love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And for these regards and many more (indeed any but
that of imputation) is justly termed his Righteousness, the
Righteousness of God. It is that Image of the Father,
the chief lineaments of that similitude of God, wherein we
were at the first formed, and whereunto we are still crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<hi>Created unto good works that we might walk in
them,</hi> Eph. ii. 10. It is the end and purpose of the Sons
Redemption, <hi>That we being delivered from the hands
of our enemies, might serve him in holiness and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
before him all the days of our lives.</hi> The intent
and effect of the Spirits vocation, for <hi>we are called not
to uncleanness, but to holiness,</hi> and that not outwardly
only by the word, but inwardly by the power of the
Holy Ghost; cleansing from all filthiness of Flesh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that he may purge unto himself a peculiar people
zealous of good works; yea it is, I say, not the form that
doth justify in it self; but the quality that only can qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
for justification and entitle unto it, as it is taken for
remission of sins in Christ. <hi>Blessed are they that do his
Commandments, that they may have right unto the
tree of life,</hi> Revel. xxii. That tree of life is Christ; in
whom without Righteousness, no Man hath any right:
who <hi>came by water and blood,</hi> saith the same St. <hi>John</hi>
elsewhere: first cleansing and then pardoning. For as he
doth sanctifie as well as justifie; so I take it he doth first
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46181:124"/>
sanctifie before he justifie, and no longer justifie than he
doth sanctifie. Lastly, it is the direct and unavoidable
means, though not merit of glorification: <hi>without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
no man shall see God,</hi> nor any enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</p>
            <p>So many ways is it the Righteousness of God; and so
many ways no less necessary for Man, as being indeed
All in All; the fulness of the Law, the full effect of the
Gospel, the substance of Gods revealed will in both, <hi>This
is the will of God even your sanctification.</hi> But what
then becomes of Faith? for this seems to be altogether
work? Is that nothing unto the way that leads unto the
Kingdome? Surely yes, much every way, but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Righteousness not any thing: For Faith is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to Righteousness, but a part of it; the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or root from whence it is immediately derived.
For true Faith is ever that of the Heart not of the Brain,
and <hi>with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.</hi> It
is neither Faith nor Works apart and severed, that can do
us good, but <hi>Fides operans</hi> a working faith; <hi>faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by love,</hi> and <hi>love is the fulfilling of the law,</hi> saith the
Apostle. This is that active Faith so much magnified in
the xi. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> by the power whereof those
Worthies there, of whom the world was nor worthy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many other great things, especially <hi>wrought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi>
and <hi>gained the promises, v. 33.</hi> And to these
and the like Worthies it is that that Angel points in the
<hi>Revel. Hi sunt, These are they that keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God and the faith of Iesus.</hi> To shew that none
keep his faith as they should, that do not keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<hi>Revel.xiv. 12..</hi> Indeed it is the keeping not
the believing of the Faith that is available. <hi>I have kept
the faith,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, henceforth is laid up for me Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona
Justitiae, a Crown of righteousness.</hi> Faith kept
is Righteousness; and such faithful righteousness only it
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46181:124"/>
is, that shall be crowned at last. Righteousness therefore
the only way unto the Kingdom: and so by all those that
would come thither, of all things else and in all regards
most especially to be sought for, with their best strength
and utmost endeavour. For it is not <hi>quaerite,</hi> but <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
quaerite</hi> not seek only, but <hi>seek ye first,</hi> The last
point, but must be briefly handled, though indeed it hath
two points.</p>
            <p>As <hi>First</hi> hath a double signification: for it either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
time, or earnestness of intention. And in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
for time, and intention of travel we are to seek,
and first to seek, the righteousness of God; if we desire
to enter the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>The actions of Piety and Righteousness are the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and noblest operations of the Soul, and therefore of
more worth; They run cross and counter to the bent of
our corrupt affections; and so of more difficulty, than may
be lightly and easily archieved. Indeed <hi>facilis descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
averni,</hi> it is a descent down the hill, the swing of
our own corruptions can carry us headlong thither; but
<hi>the way of life is on high,</hi> said King <hi>Solomon.</hi> Virtue
must upwards and hale the heavy body after it; climb
Hills, and craggy Mountains: <hi>hic labor hoc opus,</hi> this is
not without sweat and difficulty. But notwithstanding
all difficulties, <hi>virtus aut inveniet aut faciet viam.</hi> The
spirit of God by the power of that almighty faith, to
which all things are possible, will and must break through
them all. To do good and suffer evil, to deny our selve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we creep on all four, hands and knees for it, on the
knees of humble and fervent prayer; but using the hands
too, faithful and diligent endeavour: And therefore it is not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46181:125"/>
every cold and careless seeking that will be sufficient. The
way is narrow and the gate strait: <hi>contendite intrare,
strive,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>for many shall seek</hi> (seek negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently)
<hi>and shall not be able to enter.</hi> Nay more than
strive, and struggle too. <hi>I press hard,</hi> saith the Apostle,
<hi>for the price of the high calling which is in Christ Iesus.</hi>
He well knew that though no Man be Crowned unless
he strive for it; yet that every striving doth not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gain the Crown, <hi>nisi legitimè certaverit,</hi> unless he
strive as he ought. And therefore he fought not as those
that beat the air, but as he that means to conquer: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
this Kingdom is not gained, but by conquest. <hi>The
Kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take
it by force.</hi> In this point we need not fear offending in
excess. <hi>Modus amandi Deum, est sine modo amare,</hi> the
measure of loving God is to love him without measure.
In opinions indeed and disputes that have their extreams,
moderation may be good and commendable, (disputants in
heat and passion, supposing they are never far enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder
till both be equally sundred from the truth, and
then in this case to halt, as they say, between two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
may be to walk most uprightly) but no such here;
to halt between two Masters, between God and <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
God and <hi>Belial,</hi> God and <hi>Baal</hi> is most insufferable,
yea more than the clear rejection of him. <hi>Utinamcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
esses aut frigidus, I would you were hot or cold,</hi>
saith the Lord to some in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> As if since
they were not throughly hot, he had rather by much
they were utterly cold, than in that faint temper between
both: fit for nought but evomition, as is there threatned;
for the indignation of God riseth at nothing so much, as
when Men neither so cold as to contemn Religion, nor
yet so hot as to forsake their sins, present him with a
cooler mixture of both. Better therefore be a pure Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
or a graceless sinner; than a compounded and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46181:125"/>
Christian; worse than either, and harder to be
cured; his mediocrity being grown venerable unto the
world and himself, under the shew and title of calmness,
and moderation. For which cause, that may be verified
of these our Saviour said of others, <hi>Publicans and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
shall sooner enter the kingdom of heaven.</hi> If we
mean to find entrance there, it may not be by the formal
and falsehearted seeking, seek the Lord and you shall find
him, but if you seek him <hi>with all your heart and with
all your soul:</hi> otherwise instead of finding a Kingdom
we may chance to fall upon a curse. <hi>Cursed be he that
doth the work of the Lord negligently.</hi> Seek ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>first</hi> with <hi>all Industry</hi> and with <hi>all speed</hi> too:
that it may be the first thing you seek, every way first,
<hi>in time</hi> as well as <hi>in intention.</hi> Death is uncertain and
delays are dangerous; whilst we take farther day unto
our selves, enlarging our time, as the rich Fool did his
Barns, God oftentimes derides us as he did him. <hi>Stulte
hac nocte, Thou Fool this night shall thy soul be taken
from thee.</hi> And who in his own particular knows the
length and date of this his day? who can tell how many
hours there are in it, or how many of them are spent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?
How soon that <hi>now,</hi> that <hi>henceforth</hi> of obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and blindness may come upon him, and refusing to
cleanse his Soul whilst the Spirit, like that Angel in the
Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> is moving the waters; how suddenly
he may fall under that fearful Sentence of the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the <hi>Revelation, He that is filthy, let him be filthy
still.</hi> If that Fig-tree were cursed even before the time
of fruit in comparison was come, before the Gospel was
throughly published; may not those that have lived long
under the bright beams and Sun-shine of it, and still bring
forth nought but leaves, of shew and formality, have just
cause to fear every moment the approach and probation of
that final and fatal doom, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee more?</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:46181:126"/>
Whilst Men in their presumption are sporting themselves
and grieving God with their sins, God in his wrath, in the
mean while, may be swearing they shall never enter into his
rest. Undoubtedly did the rays of true wisdom and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
pierce into the Soul; had the heart any true impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of future things or of the vanity of the present; did
Men taste and relish the good gift of God and the powers
of the world to come; they would not permit any quiet
to their Spirits or peace unto their Souls, till their Souls
had made and gained peace with their God, and freed
themselves from such uncertainties. This is the Haven of
our Rest, and Heaven upon Earth, and we that see it may
well say unto our Souls, better than he did say, but saw
it not, <hi>O quid agis anima me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what dost thou O my Soul? the Port is before thee;
steer away before Sea and Wind manfully; foul weather
is behind thee, make haste to escape the stormy Wind
and Tempest. And however there should chance not to
be any, for there may be room for <hi>misericordia Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
inter pontem &amp; fontem,</hi> He hath not shut up life nor
the gate of his mercy upon any: yet it will concern wise
men to fear the worst, that is more likely, and prevent
it, whilst they have time; to work the work of the Lord
whilst it is yet high day, before that dreadful and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
night approach wherein no man can work. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to the eleventh hour, to the evening and twilight,
were a presumption too full of boldness; especially since
our Sun may set at noon and our light go out in the midst
of our life. For we are but dust as our Fathers were;
and the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with us.
Let us therefore laying aside all delays be resolute and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant,
attending speedily to open when it pleaseth him
to knock; when he calls, instantly to answer, Lo I come;
when he says, <hi>seek ye my face,</hi> to echo immediately,
<hi>thy face Lord, will I seek.</hi> So seeking his face in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

here, you may be sure to see it in glory hereafter.
In the mean time, that God who hath added all things
else plentifully unto you all, abundantly unto one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
and multiply his favours unto all, but principally
and above all unto that one. For since it is one of the
last services your Majesty, before your journey, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from this place, I would not willingly leave it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one word of apprecation. For though I may not
bless, yet I may pray: God almighty whom you seek and
serve, hath blessed you ever hitherto; and may his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and truth be your shield and protection ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
He that went with <hi>Abraham</hi> in his Journey, be
with you in yours: Let him lead you forth in peace, and
to the joy of all hearts, return you again in safety. May
he carry you from Crown unto Crown, from one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to another upon earth; and having ministred all
things else unto you according to your hearts desire here,
may he at last, (and let that be late) minister an entrance
unto you also abundantly into his own Kingdom, this
Kingdom of God. Whereunto the same God of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

            <p>THE holy but fearful Sacrament of the body and
blood of our Lord as it is the highest and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Institution the Christian Religion hath:
so is it to be approached unto with the greatest
reverence and regard. For as it affords inestimable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to the worthy participant: so not less danger and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to the unworthy Receiver. He that takes it must
know he takes a powerful medicine, that will work one
way or other; either cure or kill, prove wholsom Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
or deadly poyson. As the patient is prepared, so it
works this way or that; even either life or death. For the
blood which is received, if it do not wash and cleanse, it will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

certainly stain and dy the Soul of the Receiver: which
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46181:127"/>
must be made partaker, or shall be made guilty: either
partaker of the vertue, or guilty of the shedding thereof
to his endless destruction that receives it unworthily.
The guilt you have in the precedent Verse, <hi>He shall be
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> The destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the subsequent, <hi>he eateth and drinketh damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to himself not discerning the Lords body.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
in my Text lies between both, that it might be the

how much it behoveth him diligently to examine himself
before he eat of that bread and drink of that Cup, <hi>But
let a man examine, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein you see there are two
general parts: first a preparation, then an admission un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the blessed Sacrament of the body and blood of our

unto it, hereafter; at this time only of the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that should go before it. Wherein you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
1. The Act wherein it consists, <hi>Examination</hi>; and
then the object of that Act, <hi>himself. Let a man, &amp;c.</hi>
But we shall run both together, and out of both draw
these points, which we will commend to your obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Because the end of examination is to prepare our
selves, we will shew the necessity of this preparation.</item>
               <item>2. That we may know wherein to examine our selves,
we will consider the quality and extent of that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which is necessary, for the making and constituting
of a worthy Receiver.</item>
               <item>3. We will shew that the best means to attain unto this
due preparation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or qualification, is the study and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our selves and our own ways.</item>
               <item>4. Because the heart of man is deceitful above all
things, and we are all apt to deceive our selves in judging
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46181:128"/>
of our selves, that it is not a superficial view but a strict
examination that must give the just and true knowledge
of our selves.</item>
               <item>5. And lastly, we will make and practise this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in those points we have found necessary: that after
it they who are approved in their own Consciences, may
chearfully approach unto the sacred Mysteries, and eat of
that bread and drink of that Cup to their endless com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
and others that are not so, (as I think few are) may
first reform themselves, lest they eat and drink as the
Apostle here threatens, damnation to themselves: So these
five, The necessity of preparation, and what the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is that is so necessary: That the best means to attain
it, is the knowledge of our selves; and the best way to
come to this knowledge, examination: which examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
because it is the chief point, we will strictly make,
in the last place, that according to it, we may either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
or reform our selves before we presume to come to
the dreadful Sacrament of the body and blood of our
Lord: These 5. I say we shall at this time as God shall inable,
prosecute in their order; but plainly, as desirous to leave
you rather better than more learned. And first of the first,
the necessity of preparation, <hi>But let a man examine, &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The end of examination is preparation; for to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and not to prepare our selves, were but to see our
own foulness and refuse to cleanse it; to inquire into our
Lords will, and neglect it when we have done: and that
will only make us worthy of more stripes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that commands the one, doth in the same words
of necessity injoin the other. And indeed holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mysteries as in reason they require an holy and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
preparation; so in Scripture hath it ever been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and exacted at their hands, that shall draw near
unto them: yea the very Heathen Priests would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon their Superstitious Ceremonies to their false
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46181:128"/>
Gods without first proclaiming a, <hi>procul este profani,</hi> all
profane and unhallowed persons be ye far away. And
it was the use in the Primitive Church for the Minister
as it is in St. <hi>Basils</hi> Liturgy, or the Deacon his Assistant
as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> hath it, To cry with a loud voice before
the Communion <hi>Sancta Sanctis,</hi> holy things pertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
holy people. And for this cause it was that the Lord
gave such strict command in Law that no uncircumcised
person should presume to eat of the Paschal Lamb; nor
yet any circumcised neither under four days preparation
and sanctification of themselves.<note place="margin">Exod. xii. 48. xxii. 6.</note> With what reverence
then and awful regard should we draw near unto the
true Passover, in the blessed Sacrament, which succeeds
in the room of that other? and exceeds it too, no less
than the substance doth the shadow, than the body and
blood of the Son of God, doth the flesh and blood of a
Lamb, taken from the flock? To shew this, our Saviour
himself at his last supper, ariseth from the Table, takes
the Bason and the Towel, washes and wipes his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
feet before he would institute his blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or suffer them to be Communicants at it. Now by
the feet in holy Scripture are meant the affections of the
heart; for as by the feet the body walks, so by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
the Soul moves to whatsoever it desires: They are
the springs and Fountains of all her vital operations; and
as the Fountains are, such are the streams; if those be
troubled, these will be foul; if they be cleansed, the other
will run clear. And therefore these feet, these affections
of the heart being once washed (the meditations of the
head, the words of the mouth and the actions of the
hand, which are but rivers flowing from the abundance
of the heart and the hearts affections) cannot but partake
of the same purity. For which reason when <hi>Peter</hi> who
at the first was not willing to be washt at all, afterwards
was desirous to have all washt, his head and his hands
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46181:129"/>
as well as his feet; our Saviour replies, <hi>he that is washed
needeth not to wash save his feet only, for then he is
clean every whit, Joh. xiii. 10.</hi> The feet then, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Soul, on whose cleanness doth depend the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the whole man and all his actions; these are they
that our Saviour by this act of his own doth instruct us
carefully to wash and cleanse, before they tread a step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his holy Table. How can they there expect to be
partakers of him, who himself in that place told <hi>Peter</hi>
that without this washing he could have no part in him?
They frustrate the end and benefit of the holy Sacrament,
they prostitute the blessed mysteries themselves, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
both them and the Majesty of that God who is
present at and in them; who presume with unwasht feet,
unhallowed affections to enter upon the sacred Symbols
sanctified with the peculiar presence of the precious body
and blood of the Son of the everliving God. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
therefore if such profaners of this blood are held as
guilty of the shedding of it which was purposely shed to
cleanse them from the guilt of their sins; if instead of seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
salvation to their own Souls they do but eat damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to themselves for not discerning the body of their
Lord. For did they discern it, did they understand and
conceive it to be there, they could not but approach unto
it with greater reverence, with much more heed and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
regard. When it was at the worst and lowest estate
the malicious Jews could bring it to, bereaved of all form
and beauty, yea and of that blessed Soul which dwelt
within it; and now remained only a dead and crucified
Carkase, all over gaping with wounds, and gored with
blood; yet even then with what care and reverent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
was it handled by the good <hi>Arimathean</hi>? It was
wrapt up in fine and clean Linnen, imbalmed with sweet
Oyntmens and perfumes, and laid in a new Sepulcher
hewen out of the Rock: How then and with what high
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46181:129"/>
esteem should we, (we that are to be made not Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
but Shrines and Temples, not of his ignominious,
but glorified body, not of his body only, but of his whole
person, of his body and blood and Soul and Divinity
and all) how I say and with what diligent preparation
should we see that all things be pure and clean, and sweet,
and new, where such a guest is to be entertained, where
he is not to be lodged for a night or two, but to inhabit,
where he is not to lye a while as in the grave, but to
dwell and live for ever? This were something to the
purpose, and we should then shew we discerned the
Lords body, which now we seem not at all to regard;
eating and drinking of his flesh and blood with no more
reverence and respect, than if we were at an ordinary
Table of Bread and Wine. Nay I assure my self, many
of us make more preparation, being but to dine with
some Neighbour; than they do to come to the great
Kings supper. They can with all diligence apparel and
trim up the outward man, against every ordinary feast;
in the mean time neglecting the inward man of the Soul,
little regarding how foul and slovenly that comes to the
holy Banquet. But let such careless men in time take
heed; the wrath of the Lord hath never shown it self
more terribly, than on the profaners of holy things, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
his own holy presence. Many and fearful are the
examples in this kind. The great King of <hi>Babel</hi> no
sooner polluted the Sanctified Vessels, but even whilst he
is carrouzing in the bowls of the Temple, a strange hand
from heaven writes his doom on the wall before him:
the terror whereof looseth the joints of his loyns, and
makes his knees knock one against another: which was
but a forerunner of his ruine, who that night lost at once
both his Kingdom and his life. But how dreadful was
that judgment in the 1 of <hi>Sam.</hi> vi. where fifty thousand
Souls are suddenly struck dead for but looking irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46181:130"/>
into the holy Ark; and <hi>Uzzah</hi> instantly smitten
with the like vengeance for but touching it with profane
hands, though with a good intent to hold it up when in
his judgment it was like to fall? And shall we who are
permitted (I say not, to touch or to look into the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but) to walk into the standing Ark, the Temple of
the Lord, yea to enter in within the Vail and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
up even to the Mercy-seat, and eat of the holy
shew bread that stands before the Lord, if we continue
to pollute that sacred place and banquet with our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washt
feet, unclean and impure affections, shall we think
to escape alone without wrath from Heaven? Let no
Soul flatter it self with such a bold and mad presumption.
The divine indignation that in former times was wont e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
almost to follow such profanations at the heels,
though in these later ages the great day of final accounts
drawing on, it seem to slacken the pace; yet it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
overtake them one time or other, if not here in
this world, yet infallibly in that other hereafter, though
oftentimes even in this also.</p>
            <p>Even at this instant when the Apostle wrote this very
Chapter, the Lord had sent a fearful sickness amongst the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that for this very cause, their profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Sacrament; as you may read the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
following my Text. <hi>For this cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>some
are even now sick, others weak, and many amongst you
fallen asleep</hi>; that is, taken away by bodily death. But
however it go with us now, yet at that day when the
great King shall come to take a particular view of his
guests, he will not fail to find out all those careless peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that have presumed to sit down at his table without
their wedding garments, and pronounce upon them that
heavy doom in the Gospel, <hi>take them, bind them hand
and foot, and cast them into utter darkness, there shall
be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi> So necessary is this
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46181:130"/>
duty of reverent preparation, and so great the necessity
urged upon the high terms of no less than plagues and
punishments here, and destruction for ever hereafter. So
true is that of our Apostle, <hi>he that eateth unworthily
doth but eat judgment unto himself</hi>; so the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
judgment temporal, though he repent, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance damnation eternal; and that in so hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a manner as if he were guilty of the very body and
blood of the Lord, no less than the cruel Jews that shed
the one and crucified the other, or treacherous <hi>Judas</hi>
that betrayed both. Well then, necessary it is and highly:
But to come to the second point, let us now see what the
preparation is that is so necessary: wherein it consists,
and how far it extends that must denominate and make
a worthy Receiver. Surely though no Man living be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
absolute worthy in himself, or can by any means attain
unto that entire and compleat worth which is fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
unto the dignity and holiness of those sacred
mysteries, yet it pleaseth God of his grace to accept of
him for a worthy Receiver of them that doth truly and
faithfully endeavour to receive them with a competent
measure of that reverence, and those qualifications which
he hath prescribed in his word, amongst which, <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Faith, Repentance, Love and Charity,</hi> Love to
God and Charity to our Brethren, I suppose, are the chief
if not all. And these sure at least are simply necessary,
by them we must examine and with them we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our selves, whosoever will be worthy Receivers.</p>
            <p>First with Knowledge,<note place="margin">Knowledge</note> an honest degree of knowledge,
what the mysteries are, what they signifie and exhibite: for
what purpose they were ordained of God and are received
by our selves. Thus much seems requisite in the meanest
capacity; for so long as we are ignorant of the substantial
parts and fundamental doctrine of the Sacrament, so long
as we neither know nor consider the main ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46181:131"/>
for which it was instituted, how can we possibly
prepare our selves worthily to receive it? we shall fall
short for want of discerning the body of the Lord. And
in this every Man ought to examine himself; and many
Men others too as well as themselves. It is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
duty of the Minister of God only to Catechise: every
Father and Mother of a Family, is or ought to be in this
regard as a Minister within his own charge. It is our part,
not to be still laying of the Foundations and Principles of
the Doctrine of Christ, but to lead you on towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 1. As St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle said of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
at Tables, nay as St. <hi>Paul</hi> of Baptism it self, <hi>I was
not sent to baptise but to preach:</hi> So we may much more
say of Catechizing, We were not sent to Catechise but to
preach the Gospel: our office is to dispense the Word
and Sacraments, yours it is properly to prepare: yours it
is to teach and instruct your Children and Servants, that
they may be fit and capable to receive both; though the
sloth and ignorance of these times, to your sin and shame,
hath cast this burden wholly upon our shoulders, most Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the want of willingness or knowledge deserving
to be Catechised no less than the Children that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them; yea in my understanding much more, having
lost in their age, that little which they learned in their
youth.</p>
            <p>The second qualification is Faith;<note place="margin">Faith.</note> without it, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to please God; as in any other duties we can
exhibite unto him, so especially in this of the Sacrament.
It is the eye of the Soul, by which we behold and look
upon; the hand by which we lay hold and apprehend;
the very mouth by which we eat and receive the Body
and Blood of our Redeemer, given and applied unto us
in these mystical figures. <hi>Non dentes sed fidem,</hi> prepare
not therefore thy teeth but thy Faith, saith St. <hi>Aug.</hi> for
<hi>crede &amp; manducasti,</hi> believe and thou hast eaten. And
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46181:131"/>
for this duty, we suppose there needs little preparation
or tryal, every Man thinks he can readily assure and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
himself in the performance; but when we come to
examination anon, we shall find it a harder matter than
we imagine, to believe aright and as we ought.</p>
            <p>The third of these preparatory qualifications is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">Repentance.</note>
which though it be also generally required as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous
unto all sacrifices and services which we offer
unto God, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>Let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
front iniquity, whosoever will call upon the name
of the Lord:</hi> yet the more holy and sacred the actions
are, the more especially ought we to cleanse our selves
and purge our sins and corruptions before we go about
them: <hi>for I will be sanctified saith the Lord in those
that draw near unto me:</hi> And nearer well we cannot
draw unto God or God unto us, than in this Sacrament;
ordained of purpose to joyn and unite both in one. But
do we think his pure and precious body will vouchsafe
to be received and dwell in an unclean and polluted Soul?
shall this bread, <hi>panis de Coelo,</hi> bread from Heaven, the
Childrens bread, as it is in the Gospel, and indeed the
food of Angels, shall it be given, do we imagine, unto
whelps? shall these precious Pearls of the Gospel shell'd up
in Divine Mysteries be opened and cast unto Swine?
shall the cup of the Testament be given unto him, that
hath nothing to do with the Covenant? surely no, <hi>What
hast thou to do,</hi> saith God in the <hi>Psalms, to take my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in thy mouth so long as thou hatest to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
to take it in thy mouth so much as by naming of it;
how much less hast thou to do to take the blood of the
Covenant in thy mouth by receiving it, so long as thou
refusest to reform thy self by true Repentance? This
therefore is the main and principal part of our qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein we cannot be too diligent and careful: and
the other of Love is like unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:46181:132"/>Of Love<note place="margin">Love.</note> first unto God who hath shewn such marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Love unto us, and from us should receive all Love
and thankfulness again. And then unto our brethren,
that as God hath loved us, so should we also shew Love
and Mercy unto one another.</p>
            <p>In regard of the <hi>first,</hi> this blessed Sacrament is well
termed the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> that is, the Sacrament of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
wherein by the assistance of the blessed Spirit we do
in all thankfulness and grateful return of our best affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
solemnly commemorate the wonderful Love of
the Son that suffered, and the infinite goodness and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Father that gave him to death for the sins of
the world. In regard of the other (the Love of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
it is as rightly stiled a <hi>Communion,</hi> that is, a common
union for so it is doubly, a common union of our selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our selves, and of all unto our Saviour; But first we
must be united unto one another, before we be united unto
him: as we drink of one cup and eat of one bread, so
we must be knit into one body mystical by Love, or we
shall never be knit unto our head Christ Jesus by Faith.
What union canst thou expect with him so long as thou
art at variance with those for whom he died? His blood
was shed for us all whilst we were yet enemies, and shall
we think we may drink it, and in it remission of sins to
our selves, so long as we refuse to remit the sins of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
can we hope or expect that mercy from God,
which we will not shew to our own flesh? No, no, if
without this thou thinkest to receive any favour from
him, or look he should receive or accept any sacrifice
from thee, thou deceivest thy self. It is his rule in the
Gospel, If when thou comest to offer at his Altar, thou
remembrest that thy Brother hath ought against thee,
leave thy gift there, go and first be reconciled to him,
then come and offer thine oblation, <hi>Ecce honorem suum
despicit, dum in proximo charitatem requirit.</hi> Behold
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46181:132"/>
(saith <hi>Chrysost.</hi>) how he preferreth thy Charity before
his own honour; who will not accept of any sacrifice to
himself, till thou hast shown love to thy neighbour. And
so here these four, Knowledge, Faith, Repentance and
Love, are as you see the principal qualifications where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
due preparation must of necessity adorn and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the Soul; they are the several parts, whereof that
Wedding-garment must be made up, wherewith it is to be
arrayed, and wherein every one must appear that would
be held and accepted of God for a worthy Receiver. And
thus much of the first points, the preparation and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of it drawn from the phrase and commanding
force of the Text, <hi>Let a man examine himself,</hi> for this
[<hi>Let</hi>] is not permissive, let him do it if he will, or if he
will not let him chuse, but mandatory and imperative,
let him see and be sure that he doth it: and that under
pain of damnation, as it follows in the next verse.</p>
            <p>Proceed we now in the third place unto the act whereby
that preparation is made, and these qualifications are best
attained unto, and that is a diligent search and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our selves and ways. Let a Man <hi>examine</hi> himself.
For certainly the readiest way and directest unto due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is the true and faithful knowledge of the right
temper and disposition of our own Souls. And therefore
next unto the book of God, Man himself is the best book
he can study, since the knowledge of himself (as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
heathen Philosophers could acknowledge) is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and fountain of all both Wisdom and Goodness:
of Wisdom, because as himself is a microcosm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiary
sum of all creatures, so the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
cannot but be the sum and brief abstract of all scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and of goodness, because he is evil without remedy
that doth not understand how evil he is: for of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he must know his own corruption before he can cleanse
and purge it, which is the reason that evil Men, who
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46181:133"/>
though they love not evil as evil, yet love the pleasure
of it: are so nice to enter into their own Souls, and
fearful to make too strict a search into the pollutions of
their hearts, lest they should be driven to abandon and
forsake them when they cannot retain without too much
trouble to their own Conscience. Rightly therefore <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,
Mali ubi<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> sunt, praeterquam secum,</hi> wicked Men
are willingly every where else, rather than at home,
they are still gadding abroad, and the less they can abide
to look on themselves, the more they delight to be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
examiners of other men: how securely will they pry
into all their actions; how narrowly can they observe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
defect and imperfection, the least mote in their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
eye that will not behold beams in their own? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
blinder than Moles, without quicker sighted than Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.
And <hi>Plutarch</hi> though but a Philosopher can give
you the reason of both, for the guilty Soul, saith he,
which in it self is but as an unclean cage, a very sink of
Sin and iniquity, <hi>metuens ca quae intus sunt, exibit fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
fearing that foulness and ugliness which is within,
quickly flyes out of doors, and like a Fly flutters up and
down till it light on a gal'd back, sucking and feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other mens vices, that he may the better lessen and
excuse his own, or dare to attempt greater himself. It is
happened unto such, saith the same Author, as unto those
that have sooty houses or curst Wives, they are never
well longer than abroad. Like Satan in <hi>Job,</hi> their Souls
compass the earth, and walk through the world: wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
stars they are to whom the blackness of darkness
is reserved, saith St. <hi>Jude,</hi> at whose doors though our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
himself stand and knock never so long, never so loud,
he cannot hope for admission: there is no body within
to answer or open and let him in, their Spirits are gone
forth, and it is impossible they should hear what is done
at home, their cogitations are so deeply busied abroad;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46181:133"/>
or if peradventure they now and then hear him at their
better leisure, they consider it but little, as supposing they
have not much need of him. They have been so long
taken up in the view of other mens sins, as they forget
their own; they have so constantly fixed their eyes on
the crimes of their brethren, as they begin to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
innocent: In this case now is it possible they should
duly prepare or deeply repent, whilst they judge of their
own goodness by others evil, and suppose themselves
well enough already, because peradventure they are more
wicked? But could we observe the Apostles rule, let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men alone and examine our selves, could we as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
observe our own defects and imperfections (to
give them no worse name) as we do other Mens, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men do ours, taking estimate of our selves by what
we truly are in our selves, not what we seem opposed to
others; we should quickly discover at least the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and hypocrisie of our own hearts: we should soon find
how rotten we are at the core, how desperately sick, and
what great need we have of the Physician. And still the
longer we look, the wickeder shall we appear; the more
narrowly we search and the deeper we dig into these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
vaults, the more ever shall we abhorr our selves
with <hi>Job;</hi> till we cry out with the Prophet: <hi>O that my
head were full of water, and mine eyes a fountain of
tears,</hi> that all the day long I might bewail my sins and
iniquities in the bitterness of my Soul. What else was it,
but this serious consideration of himself, that made holy
<hi>David</hi> so afflict his body with sackcloath, and his head
with ashes? what was it that made his eyes so often to
water his couch, and his bed to swim with perpetual
tears, but that in the 51. <hi>Psalm, I acknowledge my ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and my sin is ever before me?</hi> And sure did we
carefully look into our selves, did we faithfully and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
set our sins before us as that Prophet did, we
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46181:134"/>
should soon acknowledge and bewail them with that true
and hearty sorrow that he hath done. So directly doth
the contemplation and knowledge of our selves lead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
true repentance, the sum of our preparation. But
this knowledge of our selves, especially of our sins, is not
so easily attained as we imagine, and it is not presently
gained upon the first view: every Man hath not such clear
eyes as <hi>Adam,</hi> at first sight to discover his own nakedness:
or if he have, he can quickly find out fig-leaves, subtle shifts
and excuses to cover it, as well as he. And therefore it is
not a slight view, but a strict examination that must eye
it: Let a Man examine himself. It is strange that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
should be driven to examine himself: doth not the
Soul understand the Soul? cannot the spirit of man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what is in man, without searching it out by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination?
surely no, <hi>the heart of man,</hi> saith the Prophet,
<hi>is deceitful above all things and wicked, who can know
it?</hi> and because wicked, therefore deceitful; and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
not only to deceive others but even it self. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
indeed hath eyes, clear and bright enough to
search into the dark corners of the Soul, and discover the
windings and turnings, all the obscure Alleys and Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths
that are in it; did not the heart send forth a thick
fogg of gross and earthy affections to muffle up and blind
them lest they pry too far into her secrets. For the will
wherein the affections reside, hath taught the intellective
power (which is under her command, being Mistris of
the Soul) either not to look at all, or look very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on that which she likes; and instead of judging of
the goodness (which is the proper office of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
practick) she diverts her imployment wholly to
the seeking of cunning devices, and finding out of false co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and disguises to cover the foulness of the evil, which
pleasure or profit moves her to affect. And then how is it
possible for this knowing faculty of our Souls to discover
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46181:134"/>
those sins and hypocrises, which her self with all her wits
seek to hide even from her self as well as from others?
And therefore unless we vindicate the intellect from
this thraldom, and deliver it from the power and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of the will; and that will's corrupt affections, that
it may be a free Umpire and Judge within us; unless lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside all love of our selves and sins, we deal truly and
impartially with our selves; Nay unless we be jealous of
our own souls and take our selves, as we well may, for
the greatest enemies of our selves; and so deal with our
hearts as we would do with felons and other offenders;
that is, search and examine them with all strictness and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;
we shall never throughly discover the truth of
our own bosoms. For the heart is a sly and subtle male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor;
he will not quickly confess; he must be tript with
many questions, often taken in contradictions, nay have
evident proofs brought in against him, or he will never
acknowledge his error: nothing but manifest truth can
extort it from him: Unless it be the rack, on that indeed,
he will sometimes confess: on the rack of some sudden
Judgment, on the rack of a tormenting Conscience you
shall hear it then cry out before any body examines them,
like <hi>Judas, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood,</hi>
and hang themselves when they have done, and to sin
worse in shedding their own. But this of the rack, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and be hang'd; that which we seek by examination,
is confess and be forgiven. <hi>If we confess our sins, God is
faithful to forgive them,</hi> saith St. <hi>John,</hi> though most men
had as lieve be hang'd as confess; and out of a stubborn
Pride had rather excuse than acknowledge their crimes:
So losing the benefit of remission, for want of seeing how
much they deserved punishment: which nothing but a
true inquiry and a faithful examination can set before
their eyes. For want whereof it is that so many think
well of themselves now, and are as sure of heaven as if
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46181:135"/>
they had possession already, who God knows shall never
come there. Only this benefit they gain by their false
security, that without any murmuring of Conscience they
go merrily to Hell: for as <hi>Solomon</hi> hath it, <hi>there is a
way that is right in a mans eyes, but it leads down unto
death.</hi> In this way the Pharisee in the Gospel seemed to
walk: I thank God, saith he, I am not as other men, no
Adulterer, no Covetous, Extortioner, no unjust per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as that Publican: but he gave Almes to the poor, he
fasted every week and payed Tithes of all that he had:
He was right indeed in his own eyes, and why? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his eyes looked only outwards, upon other wicked
men whom he found himself unlike: or if at any time
inwards, it was through the false spectacles of pride and
self-love which can present him with nothing but seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
goodness, and that multiplyed much more than it was:
But as he was right in his eyes, had his eyes also been right
in his head, he might upon better examination have seen
what our Saviour easily discerned, the hypocrisy of his
heart; which did but cover it self with Sheeps cloathing
being inwardly more ravenous than a wolf; under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of religion and long prayers, eating up the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of poor women, and devouring Widows houses:
and therefore he tells them, Publicans and Sinners (that
is, the most lewd and dissolute people) should sooner enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven: For the foulness of their
Crimes past all excuse, leaves some hopes they may in time
come to see and detest them: whereas the other whose
sins being deep and secret are not so easily discerned, and
his wounds though they fester and putrify at the bottom
(as being never searched to the depth) yet because they
are skinned over at the top with an outward formality of
Religion, he pleaseth himself with a conceit he is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cured, and so of necessity nourisheth his death within
him, without ever looking after the Chirurgion. These
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46181:135"/>
Pharisees are not yet all dead, they still live and will
do in many a bosome, and in theirs especially that live
most civilly, and least think they are harbored there. For
who almost is there amongst us that is not right in his
own eyes? who is there that looking on the outward sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of his actions, how justly he lives and free from
aspersion, how diligently he frequents the Church, hears
Sermons, receives the Sacrament, and the like, doth not
secretly in his heart thank God he is not like other men?
when if he look into it a little better, he may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
find it, for all this, as empty of true piety unto God,
or charity unto his Brother, as that false Pharisee was.
We do not yet know, nor shall we till we undestand our
selves better, how apt we are to deceive our selves, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Souls out of their salvation. The very gross and
palpable offender can shrowd, you see, his crimes under
such fair titles as they seem to him little or none at all, nay
vertues sometimes instead of vices. The Covetous
man is but thrifty, and the Drunkard a good fellow:
the quarrelling Ruffian a man of valour; and the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Spendal, kind and freehearted. How much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
then shall the civil hypocrite slide away under the
false pretences of a goodly outside? Wherewith he is so
industrious to cosen others, that at length v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luing his
goodness by their opinions, whom he hath abused, he chea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
himself ere he is aware of his own Soul. That therefore
in so dangerous a case we may take care we do not deceive
our hearts any longer; but every man deal faithfully and
truly with himself, where it so highly concerns him: Let
us come at length to the examination it self. For this
hitherto is but to shew how necessary it is to examine:
we will now endeavour to make that examination, and we
will make it not in all things we might, but only in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and those qualifications of it which erewhile we
found necessarily required in a worthy Communicant: that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46181:136"/>
accordingly we may condemn and reform our selves before
we approach unto the holy table. Wherein, because I
desire to deal impartially with mine own Soul and yours,
I shall intreat your patience, if I come as near your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
as may be, which you cannot afford without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the comfort of it in your selves, for assuredly the
more willing the heart is to be furrowed and plowed up,
the better ever it takes the immortal seed, and the sooner
and surer sends forth fruit to eternal life. To enter on
it then, The qualifications of our preparation, wherein
we are to examine our selves, I have shewn you to be
four, especially, <hi>Knowledge, Faith, Repentance</hi> and
<hi>Love.</hi> But before we deal upon them, it will not be amiss
briefly to reflect on the examination and preparation of
our selves, and see and consider how much heretofore
we have failed in both; and how short we have been of
that due Reverence and regard those Sacred Mysteries
require. Shall I ask you then? for so he must do that
will examine: what time you have taken from your
earthly affairs to bestow on this holy imployment?
nay ask but your own hearts, and they will quickly
answer you: for have you afforded your selves, I say
not a month or a week, but a day or two or some hours
of them to call your Souls to a strict account, to strip
your hearts of worldly cares and vanities, and recal
your wandering thoughts to those severe and serious
cogitations as may become your own sanctification and
the high and holy institution of your Saviour? Consider
well whether with <hi>David,</hi> you have entred into the
Chambers of your own bosoms, and faithfully communed
with your own Souls: whether you have tryed out your
hearts and reins, and your spirit hath made diligent
search, as he both did and requires. Observe heedfully
whether casting off all masks and visors of Hypocrisy,
all Fig-leaves of diminution and excuse, how thou hast
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46181:136"/>
exposed thy self and thy Soul naked unto the view of
thy searching Conscience; whether thy mortified heart
beginning to thaw with remorse, hath freely opened her
pleits and folds wherein she hid her iniquity; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
thee with her sins in their true shape, that thou
mightest as truly detest and abhor them. If it be so, it is
well: if not, take heed, labour and strive, weep, cry,
pray, do not cease, be not satisfied till it be so; for then
it will never be right, thy preparation will lack of his
due, and thy examination will be lame. But I examine
this examination no farther. It is a secret act known on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to their own reins and the searcher of them, to whom
therefore I remit it; and pass on to the qualities and
vertues wherewith you are to prepare, and wherein I may
more freely examine and evict your Souls, as having
outward and sensible effects whereby they may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And the first of these (to omit <hi>knowledge</hi> whereof
we have spoken sufficiently already) is <hi>Faith:</hi> but here
examination thou thinkest altogether needless; for thou
art most sure and certain thou believest. Yet what if
one should tell thee thou didst not believe? like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
thou wouldst tell him again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thou dost not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him in that, for thou wilt still say thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
nothing better than that thou believest, why? and
I know it too, and know more, that the very Devils
believe and tremble, which is something farther: and
their Faith peradventure something better than thine,
who believest and dost not tremble: which yet thou well
mightest, didst thou understand thy self or believe in God
aright, and as thou oughtest. But the truth is, most mens
Faith (as we shewed but now of the understanding) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
their affections; believing little more than what
they desire. Should a Man preach and maintain that
the goods of this world ought not to be ingrossed into
private and particular hands, but that all things, (as it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46181:137"/>
was in the primitive Church) amongst Christians should
be common, who think you would believe this soonest,
the Rich or the Poor? The Poor indeed would quickly
embrace it, because beneficient to them; but the Rich
that should be losers by it, would hardly or never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
In like manner should we urge that precept under
the Law, that money should be lent freely to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that want, and not be put out to interest: or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
that Divine Precept of the Gospel, to lend and look
for nothing again, <hi>Matth.</hi> vi. the poor Creditor you may
be sure will entertain this for his relief, but the griping
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>surer is deaf on that side, and can easily find out shifts
and distinctions to avoid his own inconvenience. Search
now and examine thy self narrowly and see if thy Faith
doth not deal thus with God in the chief Articles of it:
scarce ever believing any thing but what it likes. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Divine Faith is the word of God, wherein besides
Histories, the chief things it proposeth to believe are but
three, <hi>Precepts, Comminations,</hi> and <hi>Promises:</hi> Precepts
of duty: Comminations of punishments: and Promises
of reward to the observers or neglecters of them. And
all those equally to be assented unto, because delivered
by the word of the same God: otherwise thy Faith is
defective and maimed. See then and consider truly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou dost adhere unto the one as to the other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy Faith doth not rest only upon the promises,
neglecting the duties; and yet slighting the threatnings
against those that neglect them. The promises of Mercy
indeed are sweet and comfortable; who doth not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and gladly believe them? but comminations and
duties are terrible and troublesome, and few will give
them faithful entertainment. That Christ suffered on the
Cross, and shed his blood for the sins of the whole world
and every mans in particular, is a pleasant and grateful
Doctrine, how doth our Faith hug and embrace it as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46181:137"/>
if there were nothing else to be believed? But should we
once thunder out that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That notwithstanding
this blood, no Lyer, no Drunkard, no Adulterer, no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
or unclean Person, shall enter into the Kingdom
of God: here our Faith is at a stand, and will be sure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to believe it, or never to acknowledge that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are such. Again, <hi>blessed is the man to whom the
Lord imputeth no sin,</hi> saith <hi>David;</hi> yea marry, blessed
be that tongue for ever, I believe it with all my heart: nay
read a little farther, <hi>and in whose spirit there is no
guile,</hi> how now? why dost thou stagger? pish! 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
this seems to have crept into the Text, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
knows how. St.<hi>Paul</hi> when he cited it, left it out;
and weare not bound to believe it, or any thing else we
cannot away with. <hi>There is no condemnation to them
that are in Christ Jesus,</hi> saith St.<hi>Paul,</hi> a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>very cordial to the Soul, every Man is ready
to lay hold of it before it be out of his mouth: but to
whom doth it appertain? To them, as it follows, <hi>which
walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi> This is a
severe duty on our part, and a very corrosive to the flesh;
which will hardly be brought in subjection to the law
of God, and therefore will not easily believe it should or
possibly may be. Thus thy fruitless and preposterous
Faith is ever strong to lay hold on the promises, though
weak and of no power to work obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
or believe the judgments denounced against dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyers.
For didst thou so, truly thy belief would teach
thee to tremble; for which cause I told thee thy Faith
(which in this case is only a carnal confidence) falls short
of that which the Scripture tells us is found in Devils,
that believe and tremble. Nay, if we search and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
a little farther, we shall find thy Faith failing even
in the very promises. For though in spiritual promises that
concern mercy and remission of sins now, or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46181:138"/>
of Heaven hereafter, thou art more than faithful, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
foolishly presumptuous: yet in the promises which
pertain unto this life, we are all for the most part (though
Christians in profession, yet in truth and practice) gross
and palpable Infidels. Thou beginnest thy Creed with,
<hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty;</hi> wherein thou
dost acknowledge him thy <hi>Father,</hi> and therefore willing;
<hi>Almighty,</hi> and therefore able to relieve and succour thee in
all thy wants and distresses; but from the teeth outwards:
for let want or distress approach though but afar off, how
art thou presently perplexed? what anxious and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking
care doth instantly vex and disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ciate thy
very Soul? how are thy thoughts lost and distracted this
way and that, and every way searching and bending thy
will upon all humane helps and succours that may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined,
with such fear and distrust, as if there were no God
in Heaven or providence of his upon earth? Tell him
how of his <hi>Father Almighty,</hi> that knows whereof he
shall need, and will not fail (if he <hi>first seek his kingdom
and the righteousness thereof</hi>) to add and supply all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things that are necessary, and you shall give him as
much comfort, as if you had cast water in his Shooes.
He is clear out of his belief now, and <hi>Pater noster</hi> too,
when if you shew him the plain Text in <hi>Mat. Take no
care</hi> (that is no anxious and solicitous care) <hi>what you
shall eat, or wherewith you shall be cloathed;</hi> or in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
do good, and verily thou shalt be fed,</hi> he will soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
laugh at their promises than believe them. Nay which
is strange, a Man whom God hath well blest, that hath
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> want within ken, nor likely to have any, yet scrapes
and scratches on every side, as if poverty were coming
on him <hi>like an armed Man,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks; who if
urged to relieve the necessities of his poor Brother (with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
a small piece of Silver) though the King intreat, and
the King of Heaven command, and his Ministers perswade,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46181:138"/>
yet it may not be wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng from him. He can presently cast
doubts, who knows whether himself or his Children may
not live to want? Shew him the promises of God in the
Scripture assuring the contrary, that it shall be a means to
prosper and multiply the rest: tell him that of the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters, and after many
days thou shalt find it:</hi> or that of another, <hi>be that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to the poor, lendeth unto the Lord;</hi> yet nothing
can move him: which manifestly argues either he doth
not believe God when he says it, or at least not believe
he is a good paymaster; yet this Man thinks he hath
Faith; nay many of them are so far from relieving, as
they can find in their hearts to oppress and grind those
that are poor enough already: and as if they conceived
that honest courses and Gods blessing on them were too
weak means to provide sufficiently for themselves and
Children, they can shift and shark; project and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
screw themselves into testaments and deceive
trusts; buy over their Brothers head that imploys them
for himself; and use all their wits and fraudulent devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to compass an estate, and root their possession in it
for ever: madly supposing to establish their Generations
by those ways for which God never fails, as he every
where threatens, to weed them or their posterity out of
the Inheritance so purchased; it being his glory ever to
destroy the wisdom of the wise, and to ruine the house
built in fraud or on the ruines of others. <hi>For the hope of
the wicked,</hi> saith <hi>Job, is as the spiders web,</hi> cunningly
spun out with a great deal of labour all night, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
swept away in the morning. What Faith then is
there in this? or indeed, what is it else but a wild branch
of meer Gentilism and infidelity, if not absolute Atheism?
For did he truly believe God or his comminations, it
were not possible, one that loves his Children so well,
could run so direct a course to destroy them. But assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46181:139"/>
he doth not believe; and whatsoever we pretend,
yet for the most part, we secretly say in our hearts with
that Fool in the Psalm, if not, <hi>there is no God,</hi> yet at
least, <hi>there is no knowledge in the most high:</hi> or else
with those wicked ones in <hi>Job, tush, God careth not, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
cardines coeli perambulat,</hi> his walk is about the hinges
of Heaven, he doth not trouble himself to behold or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the things upon Earth. Do not suppose I wrong
you: search your own Consciences truly, and I believe
the best of you all will find even this infidelity lurking
in them. For wert thou absolutely assured in thy Soul of
the omniscience, and omnipresence of the Lord; didst
thou faithfully believe that he is every where, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
every action and operation of thine, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so secret, that he is about thy path and about thy
bed and spyeth out all thy wayes, and seeth thy thoughts
more clearly than thou thy self; how were it possible
for thee in his presence and under those eyes so often
and deeply to dissemble with thy Brother, with thine
own heart and with God himself? Couldst thou imagine
a window in thy bosome and thy Neighbour permitted
now and then when thou dreamest not of it, to look in
upon thy impure and fraudulent thoughts, and see how
thy cogitations are busied; how would thy Soul shame
and blush to be taken tardy in such base and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
imployments? which yet thou canst freely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and continue without any trouble or interruption at
all, though God himself and his pure eyes behold them,
whereunto thy breast is transparent as glass, and more
open than the air, what doth this shew but that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest
it not? for to believe his presence truly, and so
much contemn it, is meerly impossible. It is beyond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination
to conceive, were thy Faith firm in this point,
how it possibly can be, that the sight of God and his
holy Angels, should not deter thee, not only from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46181:139"/>
but from acting those secret works of darkness; which
the coming in but of a little child can utterly interrupt
and hinder. Of necessity thou must be driven to confess,
either that thy Faith is asleep, and thou dost not believe
it: or thy reverence utterly dead that thou esteemest of
a child more than thy Maker. Assuredly could we fortify
our perswasions but in this one Article of Faith, and
strongly apprehend the truth of it, nothing could be of
greater power to purge our hearts, and our hands too
from all evil and uncleanness. Thus if thou carefully
examine thy faith by the effects, and judge of it, as thou
shouldst, by thine actions, (for the tree is known by her
fruit) thou wilt easily find notwithstanding thy former
conceipt of thy self, how full of infidelity thy false heart
is, and how little thou believest either threats, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
or promises, or providence, or any thing else sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
and as thou shouldest. Well therefore it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
thy frequent cogitations and prayers and tears to
consider and bewail it thoroughly, crying out with him
in the Gospel, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.</hi> And
never think it helped till thou findest it reforming thy
affections and lusts, not led and ruled by them: till thou
perceivest it working powerfully in all the thoughts of
thy heart and actions of thy hands, and the whole course
of thy life. For this is the true test and tryal, and to
these marks our Saviour himself sends thee, to make full
proof of it. These are the signs, saith he, that shall follow
them that believe. <hi>In my name shall they cast out devils,
they shall speak with new tongues: they shall take up
serpents: and if they drink any deadly thing it shall
not hurt them: and when they lay their hands on the
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>k they shall be healed.</hi> If those signs follow not thy
Faith, it is vain and thou art yet in thy sins. But thou wilt
say the time of Miracles is past, and these days require
them not. Neither do I require them as then; neither then
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46181:140"/>
and in those times were they common unto all Believers:
But the saying of our Saviour is universal and in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
sence is ever true, that these signs follow them and
all them that un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ignedly believe: For every Man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
hath Devils enough within him to be thrown forth,
and unless thy Faith have power and virtue enough to
dispossess and cast out the impure spirits of luxury
and avarice, of envy, wrath, malice, and hypocrisie, and
the like foul Fiends wherewith our nature is full: unless
it be able to give thee a new tongue and a new language,
and cleansing thy mouth of all oaths and blasphemies, of
slanders and reproaches, of deceit and scurrility; can
teach thee to speak the words of sobriety, and sanctity,
and of truth every Man unto his Neighbour; unless it
can embolden thee to take up Serpents, to receive and
lovingly embrace thy mortal enemies, and make trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of them too, drinking up all the deadly venome
which their poysoned stomachs can disgorge against thee,
not only without hurt, but even as thy physick; that so
lifting up pure and innocent hands upon them with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and benedictions, though they revile and curse, they
may yet at length be won from it and cured of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
wherewith they were sick; and others also by thy
example, of their several diseases, who seeing thy good
works may glorify thy Father which is in Heaven: Until,
I say, thy Faith hath power to work these things (unless
our Saviours signs be false) it is never current and effectual.
If you say, these things are too high and hard for us, we
cannot attain unto them; you do withal say and confess
that you do not truly believe: For true Faith is not dead

wonders unto flesh and blood; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves
by a full cloud of witnesses in the 11. to the <hi>Heb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thies, who all
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46181:140"/>
through Faith aspiring to the promises were mighty and
marvellous in their actions, overthrowing Kingdoms,
working righteousness and doing such great things as we
cannot consider without admiration. And whence all
this, but because their Faith was stirring and active, not
lazy and languishing like ours; which is only a Carkass
of belief without any soul of life and vigor in it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we should soon find in our selves what the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
elsewhere affirms, that nothing is available like Faith
when it is working. working by love; which is ever
impatient and restless till it attains what it desires. Who
then, or what power is able to resist it? not the power of
the whole world: <hi>this is it that overcometh the world,
even your faith,</hi> John v. 3. no nor the power of any
thing else, <hi>credenti omnia sunt possibilia,</hi> to him that
believes all things are possible, saith our Saviour: And
therefore if ever these things be impossible to thee, if thy

               </gap>th be so weak that it cannot dispossess thee of thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
spirits and work those spiritual miracles on thy Soul, it
is a greater miracle if ever it save thy Soul. For true Faith
purifies the heart, and cleanseth the very reins, and is
assuredly dead, if it do not work powerful effects within
us. If of unclean and covetous, of malitious, envious
and deceitful persons, it doth not make us pure and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
mild and merciful, upright and just in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
it is unprofitable, and shall never justify with God:
In whose account, whatsoever you think, none are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for believers any farther than they are practisers of
his word. <hi>He that says he knows God and hateth his
brother is a lyer,</hi> saith St. <hi>John:</hi> and sure he that says
he believes in God and yet forsaketh not his sins, lyes as
loudly, and doth but abuse his own Soul; vainly dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Faith when he hath but the shadow of it without
truth or substance: and will be found at last but in that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46181:141"/>
poor Mans case, who dreamt all night of treasure, and in
the morning when he awoke was not worth a farthing.
With that Church in the <hi>Revelation, they have a name
that they live, and conceit they are rich,</hi> whenas there
it is said, <hi>they are blind and poor and naked and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
and shall so understand themselves in the end: for
however now we please our selves for a while with the
vain opinion of our imaginary Faith, yet when we have
slept our sleep, and dreamt our dreams; in the morning
when we shall all awake from our graves and come unto
Judgment, it will be found far otherwise than we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<hi>When the son of man cometh,</hi> saith our Saviour
himself, <hi>shall he sind faith upon the earth?</hi> surely yes,
such as ours for the most part is, Faith enough; such a
speculative fancy that floats only in the brain never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the heart; such a presumptuous confidence that
can seize on mercies, neglecting commands, lay hold on
the passion and death of a Saviour, but neither obey
his precepts, nor imitate his life; of such Faith we doubt
the Christian world will be then and now is, full as it can
hold; he shall every where find it: But of that true and
real Faith, rooting out sinful affections; of that high and
mighty Faith, inthroned in the very heart of the Soul,
and from thence commanding all the powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which it hath; of that prevalent and victorious
Faith, conquering Sin and Satan, and treading under
foot the glory and vanity of the whole world; of this solid
and substantial Faith, which only deserveth the name of
Faith, and he only looks for, of this he shall then find
but little in the world, as indeed there is very little now.
Some scattered sparks of it only there are in a few of
our bosoms, but raked up in a great deal of embers: and
if we take not heed, like enough to be stifled ere we are
aware. O preserve and collect them carefully, blow upon
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46181:141"/>
them with thy meditations and ferventest prayers, never
cease till they break forth into a flame, that may even
scorch thy heart with compunction and penitent remorse,
and fire thy Soul with ardent and burning affections of
love unto God and charity to thy Brother, which are
the rest of the qualifications wherewith you are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
your selves, and wherein if we should proceed to
search and continue a strict examination, I am sure we
should find them every way and every one as false as our
Faith. For Faith is the root, and if that be corrupt, these
which are the branches cannot possibly be sound. Such
as our belief is, such is our Love, such ever our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
all these but Cakes of one piece of Dough, and
seasoned with the same leaven, hypocrisy; our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
being but meer formality, our love only verbal,
and our charity for the most part but pride or disguised
malice. Repentance sincere and true, we may well say, is fled
with <hi>Astraea</hi> to Heaven; or rather doubt whether there
be any such matter. Sure it is but a meer word that hath
nothing to answer it. Search thy self, try others by their
actions, and see if thou canst almost any where find it. A
Man of an humble and a contrite heart, broken and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the sight and sense of his sins, groaning and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the weight and burdens of his iniquities,
changed truly, converted, regenerate, and reformed in the
whole disposition of his Soul, cast as it were in a new
mould and become a new Man, a new Creature; such a
one were worthy the seeing; but our eyes may even
look till they fail, and no where behold him. Behold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we may every where new things enough, but not
new men. At these solemn feasts they can have all things
new, but their Souls, these they can permit to go in their
old cloaths; yea to grow old in the same sins, which
they learnt, and grew up with them in their youth. The
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46181:142"/>
antient swearer we see is a swearer still, receive he never
so often. The covetous man takes the Sacrament and
goes away no less covetous than he was. The malicious
man can drink the blood of Christ, which he shed for
his enemies, and yet continue in the same gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as before; <hi>lupi veniùnt, lupi receduni,</hi> Wolves they
come, though in Sheeps cloathing, and Wolves they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
saith St. <hi>Austin.</hi> For indeed they do but put on a
seeming sanctity for the time, and presently reassume a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
their old ways. And do generally deal with their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>lice and the rest of their sins, as men do with their
beards, shave them against a good time; but leave the
roots behind which afterwards shoot out the thicker.
And this is the repentance, this is the love of which these
times are full as the Moon: but for that which is serious
and sincere, knock at your hearts; and see if they do not
sound as hollow as empty Casks. And for the last, our
love and affection to God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is no less verbal than that
unto our Brother is feigned, or our repentance formal. It
is in every Mans mouth but no where else: they draw
near him with their lips, but their heart, is far from him;
that is wholly taken up with pleasure, pride, and profit;
the Trinity which the world worships, that generally
knows no other God but <hi>Mammon,</hi> as it will appear if
they search their thoughts, for where our treasure is, there
are our cogitatlons. But the due examination of these
points will require a fuller discourse than this time will
afford which is run out already, and therefore we must
refer it to another. In the mean while beseeching God
of his great goodness to give us clear eyes and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Spirits, to discern and abhor the hypocrisie of
the world and the deceitfulness of our own hearts, that
we be not counted amongst those formal Pharisees where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
these times abound, professing godliness, but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46181:142"/>
the power thereof in their actions, which can have
no part or communion with Christ; but being inspired
with a true and a living Faith rooted in love, and built
up in charity unfeigned, we may be reckoned amongst
those few which shall be held for worthy receivers of
those pledges of his love in the holy mysteries now; and
be esteemed worthy to be received into the pleasures of
his everlasting Kingdom hereafter, whereunto the same
God of his infinite mercy vouchsafe to bring us all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>And the Angel said unto them, Fear not: for behold, I
bring you tydings of great joy which shall be to all
people.</p>
                  <p>For unto you is born this day, in the City of David, a
Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the verses precedent, the Nativity and birth of
our Lord and Saviour is described: in these here,
it is proved and publisht, descried in them by an
Evangelist, preached and published in these by an
Angel; by an Angel unto Shepherds, by an Angel the
highest and most excellent workmanship of God, unto
Shepherds the meanest and sillyest people amongst all the
fons of men.</p>
            <p>So you see already the three general parts into which
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46181:143"/>
my Text doth branch it self: The <hi>Preacher:</hi> the <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>
and the <hi>Sermon:</hi> The <hi>Messenger: They</hi> to whom
the Message is sent: and the <hi>Message</hi> it self: The message or
Sermon (for so the Angels word imports, <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizo
vobis,</hi> I preach or publish unto you) is the birth of
our Lord and Saviour. The Audience Shepherds: the
messenger or publisher of it, an Angel. These are the
main or principal parts. Two other there are which are
accessary: for his message is high and of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
his Audience mean and fearful, affrighted with
his presence: the one deserves a preface of honour, the
other a word of comfort: first therefore he chears up
the Shepherds and magnifies his message: before he will
deliver <hi>it,</hi> he chears up <hi>them, Fear not:</hi> and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
that, <hi>behold I bring you tydings of great joy which
shall be to all people.</hi> So have you these Five. 1. A.
<hi>Message.</hi> 2. And that <hi>Message magnified.</hi> 3. An <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi>
4. And that <hi>Auditory comforted.</hi> 5. <hi>Both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by an Angel.</hi> And <hi>the Angel said unto them,
&amp;c.</hi> there is the Preacher and his audience: <hi>Fear not,
&amp;c.</hi> there is the Audience and their comfort: <hi>Behold I
bring, &amp;c.</hi> there is the extolling of the Message: <hi>For unto
you is born this day,</hi> there is the message it self. And
this message again hath divers parts, some more substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
as the Birth it self and the Titles and Attributes of
the person born. Three in Number, a <hi>Saviour, Christ,</hi> the
<hi>Lord.</hi> Others it hath that are Circumstantial, as the time
when, <hi>hodie</hi> to day: the place where, <hi>in the City of
David:</hi> and the persons for whom, <hi>For you, vobis, for
unto you, &amp;c.</hi> These are the parts of the message:
and the Preface that magnifies it, hath no fewer particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
1. It is <hi>News: 2. News of joy:</hi> 3. Of <hi>great joy:</hi>
4. Great joy <hi>to all people,</hi> all that are or ever shall be.
<hi>That shall be, &amp;c.</hi> 5. And these all well ushered in witlr
an <hi>Ecce</hi> of admiration and attention, <hi>Behold.</hi> These two,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46181:144"/>
the message and the magnifying of it, are the main parts
of this days celebrity and solemnity, and therefore they
are full, and have many branches: the other three, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
their Comfort and the Angel Preacher that gives
it, are of less importance, and so are but single points brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered. And the <hi>Angel said unto them, Fear not.</hi>
But we must begin with these, though the lesser, as the Text
doth: and first with the Preacher or publisher of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
an Angel, <hi>dixit Angelus, And the Angel said, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And right and fit it was that an Angel should say it: he is
an high and excellent creature, and his ministry hath ever
been justly used in high and excellent actions. Now of all the
actions and operations external of the divine power, the best
and the greatest, the highest and most excellent, the wisest
and most wonderful is the Incarnation, and birth of the Son
of God. The other eminent acts of goodness and power
manifested either in his life or death, resurrection or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,
they do all depend on this which is the ground
and foundation of them all; therefore questionless as it
is the greatest benefit the world ever knew, so is it the
greatest work that God ever did: wherein God is made
man, and man become God; God and man, becoming
but one person. Such a <hi>generation</hi> as this <hi>who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah?</hi> who shall preach and
publish it indeed? surely no creature in the world is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
fit; yet since it must be done by some, none so fit
as an Angel, the best of his Creatures, to preach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Nativity, the best of his works. <hi>The Angel
said,</hi> and he had no sooner said it, but a multitude of
Angels receive and applaud it, with a hymn of glory.
<hi>Gloria in excelsis,</hi> Glory be to God on high: one Angel
preaches and a Quire of Angels sing praises. So the
whole service of this day both Sermon and Anthem, by
Angels all. So great is the day we now celebrate and the
benefit we are now to treat of. And it were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46181:144"/>
it might still be preached by the tongue of that Angel
which first published it. But yet since it hath pleased God
to impose it upon sinful men, we must perform it as well
as we may; but still remembring you, that though we
do it, 'tis a theam in it self fitter for an Angel. <hi>The Angel</hi>
said, <hi>illis</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>And what were they? in the verses precedent you may
see: Shepherds, they were watching over their Focks.
What a fall is here? The best news the world ever heard,
the greatest mysterie God ever wrought, fit to be uttered
by no tonge but an Angel's, the highest of his Creatures,
now in this state to be preached and published to none
but Shepherds, the lowest and meanest of the people?
what congru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty is there in this? The Custom of the world
in case of News great and extraordinary, especially ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of Joy, is to post with it to great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
persons, Kings and Princes, no mans ear may have
a taste till theirs be first possessed with it. And surely
this if ever any, was News fit for a King and the greatest
King. Why is it then delivered unto Shepherds? why is
it not sent to <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> the Monarch of the Earth,
now sending forth his Edict for the description of the
whole world? why doth not the Angel hye him unto
<hi>Cyrenius</hi> his President, or to <hi>Herod</hi> his King of the Jews?
why goeth he not unto the high Priests, to the Scribes and
Pharisees, that sate in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair? or to some other of
the Grandees and Magnificoes of the world? why unto
none of these? why? but because men have one Custom
and God another: they look to the great, to the good:
men respect the high and mighty; but God regards the
humble and meek: Especially in his divine Revelations;
<hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that
thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent
and revealed them unto babes, Luk.</hi> x. 21. This is his
Custom, <hi>not many wise according to the flesh, not many
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46181:145"/>
mighty, not many noble are called; but God hath chosen
the foolish, the weak and the base things of the world
to confound the wise and mighty,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 26. No
marvel therefore, saith St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> if in the first publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the grace of Christ, God did rather respect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
than power, and the simplicity of Shepherds
than the pride and imperiousness of Kings. It was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
then that Shepherds they were, mean Men, Men of
an humble Spirit, of an innocent and contemplative
life, it was not amiss I say, in this regard, if but to shew
the use of God whose manner it is ever to resist the
proud and shew grace unto the humble; but it agreed
well too, in other respects. He that was now born was
sent to the lost Sheep of the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and it was but
right that Shepherds were made acquainted with that;
to shew spiritual Pastors their duty, who first receive
the Gospel, that they may preach it to others; and the
flocks their obedience, not to adhere to their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
but to receive their doctrine ordinarily at the
hands of their Teachers, for to shew this, the Gospel was
first justly preached unto Shepherds. Besides, it was the
birth of a Shepherd that he came to tell: the Shepherd
that was so long ago promised: <hi>Behold I will raise you
up a shepherd,</hi> Ezek. xxxv. 25. he is now born, <hi>the chief
shepherd,</hi> 1 Pet. v. 4. the <hi>great shepherd,</hi> Heb. xiii. 20.
the <hi>good shepherd</hi> that gave his life for his flock, <hi>John</hi> x.
II. It was but just then to tell Shepherds of the birth of
a Shepherd, and the news fitted them well: rightly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>dixit illis,</hi> he said unto them.</p>
            <p>But still said he not his errand presently; they were
not in case to receive it. The appearing of the Messenger
hath so frighted them, that they are not capable of the
message. If he now tell it, they may chance not to hear
it, or if hear, not regard it. And therefore before he go
on with his news, he doth first settle their minds for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46181:145"/>
it with a <hi>nolite timere,</hi> fear not. Afraid then they
were, and sure they might well fear. It was in the depth
of night, and the Angel appeared suddenly and in great
glory, the glory of the Lord shined round about them.
They were but Shepherds, no marvel if such fear at such
and so unexpected a sight; better men than they and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner of persons have been troubled at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of an Angel though in the day time. <hi>Zachary</hi>
though a just person that walked in all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God without reproof; though a Priest, though
in the Temple and ministring there: The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
whom all generations must call blessed, though a Virgin,
though the best of Women, though separated and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for the Mother of God, yet (as you may read in the
very Chapter before this) at the appearance of an Angel
they are afraid both; and both comforted, as these here,
with a <hi>noli timere,</hi> by the Angel, <hi>fear not Zachary,</hi> v.
13. <hi>fear not Mary,</hi> v. 30. And the like might be shown
of divers others; so general it was to fear at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an Angel, that scarce ever any Angel appears but
with this salutation of <hi>fear not,</hi> seven times (as a learned
Man observes) we read it in this very Gospel. But whence
is it, and how comes it about? <hi>Timere ubi non est ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi>
to fear where no fear is, argues a guilty Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but these were innocent and just persons, why then
do they fear the Messengers of their comfort? Sure
though some may be more innocent than others, yet it is
not so absolutely right as it ought to be in any. None
so good and unreproveable in the sight of Men; but yet
they may be conscious of something more or less within
themselves. But say they were not; suppose them free
from actual sin, yet they cannot be freed from natural
infirmity occasioned by the first original sin: which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had no sooner committed but he was afraid of God
himself when he appeared, and hid his head in a bush
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46181:146"/>
as soon as he heard his voice in the Garden. And ever
since all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> have been afraid at the
appearing of any Messenger or receiving of any message,
from that Divine Majesty. Two things therefore it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues;
<hi>first,</hi> that our nature is fallen from her first original;
that her primitive excellence and dignity is gone; since
he (saith <hi>Stella</hi>) who was framed and created to behold
the Glory of God, cannot now endure the aspect of one
of his Angels. And <hi>secondly,</hi> besides weakness it argues
something of wickedness; and shews all is not right: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and we are not in the terms we should be, not the best
of us all. Angels are Messengers from Heaven, what ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
they bring good or bad, we know not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we fear, because we know not: a plain sign all is
not well between Heaven and us; that upon every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an Angel we presage to our selves no better news
from thence; but still are afraid of the messages and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
that come from that place. Since then it befell
so great Saints, it might well be the case of poor Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
in this case to be afraid; and being afraid they
must be comforted, or the message will hardly be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
fear being in the mind, nothing else can well enter:
fitly therefore before he pours in the one doth he seek
to cast out the other with a <hi>nolite timere,</hi> And the, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But fear is not so easily cast forth, it is <hi>plenus conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis
affectus,</hi> a tenacious affection full of distraction
and consternation, and will not presently be thrown out
with a couple of words. Comfortable words they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and may well serve to stay their minds and collect
their spirits; but not throughly to eject their fear. To
effect this, something more is required than bare words.
It is not enough to speak them, but he must give a reason
for them too, that would have them prevail. And what
better reason not to fear, than to shew them there is no
reason of their fear? <hi>Timor est expectatio mali,</hi> fear is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46181:146"/>
the expectation of evil, and here is no evil towards, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but good, and good not towards, but present; that
were but tydings of hope, this is of joy and great joy to
them and to all the people besides. And this is a <hi>nolite
timere</hi> indeed; a fear not, to the purpose; not barely
propounded, but backed with a reason of power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it: <hi>for behold,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein the Angel doth at once, as dispel their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so with an honourable Elogy advance and magnifie
his own message before he will deliver it: he pours it not
forth presently; but sends a preface of state before to
usher it in with reverence and regard. And every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that is in it (for you see it hath many) joy, great joy,
common joy, and every degree I say in it is, as a comfort
to the Shepherds and diminution of their fear, so an
<hi>ecce</hi> of admiration and attention unto his errand: for
<hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ecce est vox admirantis,</hi> it is ever
commonly the watch-word to a wonder: atleast is seldom
set but as a note or mark upon things of greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and such as require our special regards. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what do Men regard so much as news, rare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
events? who grows not erect, what ear is not
open and attent to receive them? And such here is this,
no ordinary and trivial matter, every day to be seen and
met withall; but news it is, unusual and unheard of it is,
which you are called to behold. Behold I bring you ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
strange tidings indeed of a strange birth full of
prodigies and wonders; wherein the Antient of days is
become a swadled child; and he who is the Son of God
without a Mother, now made the Son of a Woman
without a Father; a strange Woman too, that is both a
Mother and a Virgin, nay at once both Mother of her
own Father, and the Daughter of her own Son. For
such a Mother she must needs be, that is the Mother of
God. Where is <hi>Solomon</hi> with his <hi>nibil novum sub sole,</hi>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:46181:147"/>
there is no new thing under the Sun? sure here are many
new things which the Sun never saw nor the world ever
heard of before; and therefore <hi>a greater than Solomon
is here:</hi> of whom <hi>Jeremy</hi> spake when he said, <hi>creavit
Dominus novum super terram, a new thing hath the
Lord created upon the earth, a woman shall compass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a man,</hi> Jer. xxxi. News then it is, and that strange
and admirable; but yet if it be as well good as strange,
as well beneficial to us as wonderful in it self, we much
more willingly behold it. Do so then, for it is both;
both news and good news; tidings and tidings of joy;
great joy too; for <hi>behold I bring you tidings of great
joy.</hi> Joy for the benefit and honour; great joy for the
great benefit and honour we reap by it. Such as the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
is, such is the fire; and as the benefit is, such should be
the joy. Never such a benefit, never so great honour to
us and our nature; never therefore so great cause of joy:
nay, never any cause of joy at all but in this, or at least in
the hope of this. Set it aside, and nothing but argument of
wo and lamentation through the whole world to be seen.
All mankind without it utterly lost in everlasting sorrow;
and the whole frame of Nature and whatsoever is within
the compass of it subject to malediction too, for their
sakes; and therefore could do nothing but <hi>groan and
travel in pain together with us,</hi> as the Apostle speaks,
<hi>Rom.</hi> viii. whose case is well expressed in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> for
we all <hi>sate in the region of death and darkness,</hi> and
<hi>quale gaudium iis qui in tenebris sedent,</hi> and what joy
hath he that sits in the dark, said blind <hi>Tobe</hi> unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel?
But that is not all, we were fast bound too in mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and iron: bound with the chains of our sins, and shut
up to condemnation under the Law, as in a Prison of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
and <hi>quale gaudium?</hi> what joy unto such, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in darkness but in chains, chained both in darkness
and misery? This was our case, and in this case to tell
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46181:147"/>
men now of a glorious light, of a rising Sun that should
shine into their darkness; and not only so, but to tell
them of a strange deliverer also born into the world, to
give them liberty as well as light (for light without liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would serve them only to see their own misery) of a
mighty deliverer indeed that both could and would
break the gates of Brass and smite the bars of Iron in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and so open the Prison to the miserable Captives,
<hi>quale gaudium hoc,</hi> how great were this joy, the joy
of these tidings? And these are the joyful tidings the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
now brings, well therefore may he term them tidings
of joy and great joy by which we are delivered from
darkness and misery, utter darkness and everlasting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
<hi>Behold I bring you tidings of great joy.</hi> Joy then
there is in it, and great joy, yet this is not all that is in
it, 'tis publick joy too, and that is something more. Great
joy there may be, and we see there often is, which yet
concerns but a very few: others in the mean while may
wail and mourn. This is not such, but as it is great in it
self, so it spreads and diffuseth it self unto many, to all,
<hi>omni populo,</hi> to all the people. <hi>Behold, &amp;c.</hi> And well
fare that joy where it is merry with all: every good
heart will like it the better, <hi>bonum quo communius eo
melius,</hi> for the better it is, ever whatsoever is good, the
more general it is: This is a degree beyond general, it
is universal joy; a joy that runs through the universe and
affects the whole world. And the world may well won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it. It never saw, I am sure never could give any
the like. As our Saviour said of his peace, so he might
well say of this his joy, <hi>non sicut mundus dat gaudium,</hi>
not as the world giveth joy so give I joy, the world is
poor and beggarly, and cannot give to one but it must
take from another, cannot make one rich, but it must
impoverish another, cannot advance one, but it must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
another; and therefore cannot give joy to one,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46181:148"/>
but it must give sorrow to another. This is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world, and all worldly joy; The Conquerer
celebrates his triumph, and the vanquisht lament their
misery; The heir joyes and rejoyceth in his inheritance, the
possessor dies weeping and mourning that he must leave
it. The advanced ascends merrily unto his seat of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
whilst his predecessor tumbles from thence with
sorrow into his own ruin. Run through all the glory
of this present life, and see if you can any where find
any man happy whereto felicity doth not arise out of
anothers misery; and whose joy is not built upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans sorrow: and therefore if some be merry, some
must be sad: if some laugh, others must weep: if some
rejoyce, others must mourn: no joy in it to all the
people: <hi>Non vox hominem sonat,</hi> it is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of humane felicity this, neither can it spring out
of the Earth; an Angel must bring it from Heaven, from
that God who is truly rich and of unexhausted bounty, able
alone to fill some without any diminution or emptying of
others. Yea to fill all and leave none empty. Only <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inanivit
semetipsum,</hi> it pleased him to empty himself of
his honour this day, by assuming our flesh, that we and
our nature might be replenisht with it: he made himself
poor lying in a manner among brute beasts, that his
poverty might redound unto the riches of the world;
and make men who for want of understanding might
well be compared unto the beasts that perish, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and goodness too, like the Angels of God that stand
about his Throne, unless themselves refuse it. And this
is the tydings of joy the Angel here now brings, true joy
indeed and publick joy, Christmas joy right, <hi>gaudium
omni populo;</hi> Joy unto all the people; to all that will
but entertain and embrace it; to all that do not wilfully
reject and refuse it. To such indeed this joy shall be
turned into sorrow, but that is their own fault. If when
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46181:148"/>
the Prison is open'd, any of the captives be enamoured of
their own misery, and still love darkness more than light,
they may questionless perish in it; but then they may
thank none but themselves; it was still matter of joy
that a passage was made, and they might have come forth
if themselves would. We must still distinguish between
the event of a thing unto obstinate men, and Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of it in his own mercy: which though some men
abuse to their hurt and sorrow; yet the news of it in it
self is news of joy unto all, to all the people, to all that
then were, and to all that ever shall be, <hi>quod erit omni
populo, which shall be to all people, &amp;c.</hi> Not only it is joy
which is unto the present age, unto all the men of that
or any one time, but which shall be unto all ages and
generations successively unto the worlds end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she that now brought forth the blessed tydings which
the Angel here delivers, <hi>all generations,</hi> saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>shall call her blessed.</hi> And this is our comfort, it is
the word of tenure by which we hold, that it shall be to
all people. But this good <hi>Erit,</hi> that shall be, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
only to <hi>omni populo</hi> all the people that shall be;
but may be read with the joy that goes before, <hi>gaudium
quod erit,</hi> joy which shall be; not joy which is for a while,
and then vanisheth; but which shall be for ever and ever, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
joy. And this gives us one degree more in the joy.
For joy though never so great in it self, though publick
and common unto never so many, yet if it abideth not it is
but a perishing and transient joy: but if great, publick, and
permanent too then 'tis compleat and absolute joy indeed;
when it is <hi>gaudium quod est &amp; erit,</hi> joy which is and
which shall be; that is none but Christs joy, a joy which
none can take from us. The worlds joy is, <hi>quod est, &amp; non
erit,</hi> a joy which is, but which shortly shall not be, but a
flash, but a blaze, quickly kindled but as suddenly out.
<hi>Invicem cedunt dolor &amp; voluptas:</hi> Joy and grief, like
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46181:149"/>
day and night, take their turns in this life, and mutually
ever expel one another. They are clean contrary, yet, like
twins, they are bred in the same bowels, wherein though
they sometimes struggle as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> did who shall
first come forth, yet the advantage of precedence is but
little, when the latter is not so far behind but he hath ever
hold of the formers heel: like Actors in a Tragedy, so
they play their parts on the Stage of this world; when
one goes off, the other enters; and though joy begin
the <hi>Prologue,</hi> the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> ever shuts up in sorrow.
All our pleasures though never so sweet in the mouth,
proving, as the Wiseman speaks, but gall and wormwood
in the belly; and sometimes rottenness in the bones. It is
therefore <hi>gaudium quod est,</hi> only a joy that is, but shall
quickly cease to be: a joy which like the winter Sun
may rise gloriously, but is soon overcast with clouds of
discontent, and must set ere long in a night of sorrow: a
long night unto some that shall never see morning. Only
Christs joy, the joy which the Angel here brings, Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
and Christian Joy, is <hi>gaudium quod erit,</hi> a joy which is,
and which shall be; which is begun here and shall be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and accomplished for ever hereafter: when we shall sit
down at the right hand of God, <hi>where are pleasures for
evermore.</hi> So now you have all unto the full, great joy, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
joy, permanent and perpetual joy; nothing more can
be added to make it fuller or greater; it hath already all the
dimensions of greatness, height, length, breadth and depth;
As deep as Hell from whence it delivers; as high as the
highest Heavens whither it will bring us; broad as the
whole Earth spreading unto all people, that have or do
inhabit it or ever shall; and long as eternity can make it,
whereinto it runs: joy which shall be for evermore. Well
did it deserve that <hi>Ecce</hi> of admiration set up in the top of
it, as a burning Beacon to draw all eyes and affections
towards it. <hi>Behold I bring you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:46181:149"/>But this is but the Preface: proceed we now unto that
wherein all this Joy doth consist, and whereof it is spoken:
the message or sermon it self: whose whole subject is the
blessed birth of our Lord and Saviour we this day Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate,
<hi>For unto you, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein there are three Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the birth, <hi>where, when</hi> and <hi>for whom: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you is born this day in the City of David:</hi> And
three Titles, or Attributes of the Person born, a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
which is <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Lord.</hi> The Circumstances are first
placed, but the parts of substance must be first handled:
both because they are more worthy in themselves, and
also have nearer reference unto the joy precedent and
the three degrees of exaltations of it: whereunto these
three titles do fitly answer and correspond: the joy was
great, publick, permanent, and now we see the reason:
<hi>Great Joy,</hi> for a Saviour is born: <hi>publick joy,</hi> for that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is Christ: <hi>permanent and perpetual joy,</hi> for that
Christ is the Lord; the Lord of eternity that only can
give eternity to our Joy. And briefly of them all:
but first of the first Attribute of him which is a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. And sure if ever any, this is tydings of great Joy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>tydings of a Saviour:</hi> no joy in the world to the joy
of a man saved. We our selves acknowledge it in other
matters; If it concerns the saving of our skin, of our
goods, of our life, or the like, how do we rejoyce in
such Saviours? Let a man under the Law in case of a
lost man, cast and condemned, expecting nothing but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution:
and then let a Saviour come to him with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and see if it be not a welcome message; if he think
it not the joyfullest tydings that he ever heard. But
beloved we have Souls too, and they are our better parts
by far, and the sorrows of that death they are subject
to, great and more lasting: And if the saving of a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
transitory life or living, be so precious unto us,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46181:150"/>
how full of Joy would the birth of a Saviour be, for them
that otherwise must die for ever in perpetual torments? O
when it concerns the loss of Heaven and danger of Hell,
when the Soul is at stake, and the well doing or undoing
of it for ever; Consider it right, and in this case sure no joy
to the joy of a Saviour. But we do not consider it, at least
not throughly, and that is the reason it affects us so little.
To spiritual things we are dull and dead, but quick and
sensible in carnal: and as it seems, more apprehensive of
our sickness, than our sins, of the saving of our goods
and bodies, than of the loss of God or perishing of our
Souls. Otherwise the preserver of those wishes would
not be welcomed with such joy, and the Saviour of these
which are infinitely better, so coldly esteemed. Certainly
could we but see our sins in the true shape, and behold
with our eyes the sorrows they deserve, and our souls
must suffer for them; were we permitted a while to look
into that fearful pit, whereunto we are condemned, and
take a view of the horror that is in it, A Saviour from them
and from thence would be something better regarded.
But however we esteem it not now, when the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is too far off us to affect us; yet the time will come
when it shall, <hi>In novissimo intelligetis planè,</hi> in the end,
saith <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. xxx. 24.</note> ye shall clearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nderstand. In the end indeed,
in that sad and fearful day, when the destruction shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and the destroyer shall come, when tribulation and
anguish shall be upon every Soul that hath done evil; when
they shall cry unto the Rocks and Mountains to fall upon
them, and hide them from the presence of the Lord and the
wrath to come; then indeed when we shall find the want
of a Saviour, we shall plainly understand this, and value
the benefit and joy of it as we ought, and know and find
that there is no joy in the earth to the joy of a Saviour.
<hi>A Saviour</hi> that is the first: the Angel addeth for a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,<note place="margin">

               </note>
which is <hi>Christ;</hi> to distinguish him from all other
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46181:150"/>
Saviours. For others there were many born, and sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them at divers and several times to deliver them from
particular and several distresses. As <hi>Moses, Joshua, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,
Jephta, Shamgar, Sampson,</hi> and the rest in the Book
of the <hi>Judges;</hi> which indeed is nothing else but a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Saviours which the Lord at sundry times raised
up to free and avenge them of their enemies. These were
Saviours all in their kind, and joy there was in them, and
great joy too in their times and to that Nation, but no
universal joy: they were but petty and particular Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.
One there was yet behind, that was worth them
all, one that should save his people from their sins; save
not their bodies for a time, but their Souls for ever; which
none of these Saviours could do. And therefore a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
general and universal Saviour, of whom all had
need, as being all sinners: one much talked of, and long
expected, the great and famous Saviour of all; such
a one was behind: And now he is come, this is he,
the Saviour <hi>which is Christ, &amp;c.</hi> He of whom all
Prophecies made mention; and he the performance of
them all; of whom all the Types under the Law were
shadows, and he the substance of them all: of whom all
the Prophecies ran, and he the fulfilling of them all:
he of whom all those inferiour Saviours were figures and
forerunners, and he the accomplishment of all that in
them was wanting.</p>
            <p>This is he, <hi>Jacob's Shilo, Esay's Emmanuel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. xlix. 10.</note>

then, and now the joy of all nations,<note place="margin">Dan ix 25.</note> 
               <hi>Gaudium omni

            </p>
            <p>And this,<note place="margin">Hag. ii. 8.</note> this universality of joy is comprised in the
very name, for Christ signifies anointed, and that is as
much as S. <hi>John</hi> delivereth in other terms, a <hi>Saviour seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
John vi. 27. for by anointing, Kings and Priests and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46181:151"/>
Prophets in old time were deputed, signed and sealed, as
it were, to their several offices, and received power and
commission to execute those high functions.</p>
            <p>So then a Saviour he is, not as those others were raised
up upon a sudden upon some occasion to serve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and never heard of till they came; but a Saviour
in Gods forecounsel resolved on and given forth from the
beginning; promised and foretold and now anointed
and sent with absolute commission and fulness of power to
be a perfect and complete Saviour of all, a Saviour which is
Christ That is, a Saviour <hi>ex officio,</hi> whose office and very
profession is to save: that all may have right to repair unto
him and find it at his hands; not a Saviour incidently, as it
fell out, but one <hi>ex professo</hi> anointed to that end, and
by vertue of his anointing appointed, set forth and sent
into the world of purpose to execute this function of a
Saviour: not to the Jews only, as did the rest, but to all
the ends of the earth. So runs his commission unto his
Disciples, <hi>ite in universum orbem,</hi> go into the whole
world and preach the Gospel, <hi>omni Creaturae</hi> to every
Creature: so runs his own Proclamation, <hi>venite ad me
omnes,</hi> come unto me, and come all, <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 28. and
of them that do come I will cast none out, <hi>Iohn vi. 37.
Servator omnium hominum,</hi> the Saviour of all men,
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 4. and as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> said of him <hi>Serva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor mundi,</hi>
the Saviour of the world of Samaritans,
Jews, and Gentiles; of Kings, and Shepherds and all.
And sure this is publick and universal joy, <hi>gaudium omni
populo,</hi> joy unto all people indeed; for whom there is
now a saving office erected, one anointed to that end, a
professed Saviour to whom all may resort. None shall
henceforth be to seek; there is a name given under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
whereby we may be sure of Salvation, and this is that
name, the name Christ, A Saviour which is born, &amp;c.
Two of his Attributes then we have, a Saviour which is
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46181:151"/>
Christ, that is, a Saviour and a publick Saviour; but he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
must be a perpetual Saviour too, otherwise our joy will
not be full. Though it be great, though it be general,
though it be general to all people; yet it will fade and
perish, it will not be <hi>gaudium quod erit,</hi> joy which shall
be lasting, everlasting joy, none can give that but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and everlasting Saviour: And he that will be such;
must be something more than Christ: so therefore he is a
great deal more, <hi>Christus Dominus, Christ the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not a Lord that is particular, and hath reference to a
private title, whereof he is Lord; Lord of this or that
place, or people, and the like: but the Lord, which is
absolute, and universal, without any addition: you may
put to it what you will, Lord of Heaven and Earth, of Men
and Angels; <hi>Dominus Christorum, &amp; Dominus domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi>
Lord paramount over all: such was this Saviour,
and such it behoved him to be; not only Christ, that
name will sort with Men, yea it is his name as Man only,
for God cannot be anointed. But he that would save
the world, must be more than Man, and so more than
Christ. Indeed Christ cannot save us, he that must save
us, must be Christ the Lord, and none but the Lord, <hi>ego
sum, ego sum,</hi> saith God himself, and <hi>praeter me non est
Servator,</hi> it is I, it is I who am the Saviour, I am, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
me there is no Saviour; none indeed; no true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
but the Lord, all other are short, <hi>vana salus hominis,</hi>
Mans Salvation is vain, saith the Psalmist, any Salvation is
vain, if it be not the Lords, though they be Christs, as Kings
and Princes are, who are Gods anointed, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
save. Trust not in Kings and Princes, for <hi>non est
salus,</hi> there is no salvation, no; no health nor help in
them, their breath departs, and they return to the earth.
For though they are <hi>Christs,</hi> yet they are but <hi>Christi
Domini,</hi> the Lord's Christs, and we shall never arrive at
full and perfect Salvation, till we come to <hi>Christus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:46181:152"/>
Christ the Lord. All the help and Salvation which
those other Christs and Saviours can afford, doth but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the body; that indeed they may sometimes kill or
save at their pleasure; but not one of them can quicken
his own Soul, much less give a ransome for anothers; it
cost more to redeem it than so, and he must let that alone
for ever: let it alone for this Christ whose work it is,
Christ the Lord that only can save both Body and Soul,
his own and other Mens too. Secondly, those other Christs
which are not the Lord, as they save only the Body;
so can they save only from bodily and corporal enemies:
but we had need of a Saviour from ghostly adversaries,
from spiritual wickednesses in high places, a Saviour that
might wrastle with principalities and powers, and triumph
over them too; and no Christ may do this but Christ the
Lord, the Lord of power and might, only able to bind
the strong Man in his own house, and spoil him of his
goods: of power alone to destroy <hi>Abaddon</hi> the great
destroyer of the bottomless pit. Thirdly, those other
Christs as they save but from corporal enemies; so but
from worldly calamities, from debts, and arrests and prisons
and the like penalties of their own Laws. But who shall
deliver us from sin, and death, and hell? From sin the
grand debt of mankind, from death the universal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
of all flesh, and from Hell the everlasting prison of
Body and Soul? For these they can give no protection,
they are all subject unto them themselves, for breaking a
higher law, the eternal law of the Almighty which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can satisfy for, but a Christ as Almighty, <hi>Christus
Dominus</hi> Christ the Lord. Lastly, all other Christs or
Saviours whatsoever, as they save but in few things and
those only corporal, and worldly; so in them they save
but for a little while; which is but a reptieve rather than
a saving; for long they cannot save others, that so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perish themselves. Evermore they die, they drop away
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46181:152"/>
still, and leave their favourites and followers to seek: but
it is not a short rescue for a time, but a permanent and
perpetual Salvation that we expect for ever, and for ever
we might expect it at the hands of any other Christs,
and not find it, because they cannot endure by reason of
death, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 23. only this Christ because he is the
Lord, <hi>Dominus vitae,</hi> the Lord of life, indureth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
hath an everlasting Kingdom; wherein he dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
eternal Salvation which he purchased by his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
<hi>The author of eternal Salvation</hi> to all that depend
on him, <hi>Heb.</hi> v.9. and mark that well, for none but the
Lord can work eternal Salvation. To save, may agree
unto men; thus to save, to none but Christ. To begin and
to end, to save Soul and Body from bodily and ghostly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
from sin the offence, and death the punishment, from
Hell the destruction, and Satan the destroyer, for a time
and for ever, Christ the Lord is all this and doth all this.
Now then we are right and never till now, we have all
his attributes, a <hi>Saviour,</hi> the word of benefit, whereby he
is to deliver us; <hi>Christ,</hi> his name of office, whereby he is
bound to undertake it; <hi>the Lord,</hi> his name of power,
whereby he is able to effect it. Now our joy is full and
never till now, we have all the degrees of it: whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Angel promised is here performed: great joy, he
is a Saviour; publick joy to all people, a Saviour which
is Christ; perpetual joy, joy which shall be even for ever
and ever, he is Christ the Lord: the Lord who will not
only free us from our misery and bring us to as good and
better a condition as we forfeited and lost by our fall;
(for else though we were saved, we should not save by the
match:) but that we may not be savers alone, but gainers
and great gainers by our Salvation, estate us in all the
bliss and happiness he is Lord of himself. And Lord he is
of life, as I said. Life then he will impart: and he is <hi>Lord
of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 8. and glory he will impart: and he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46181:153"/>
is <hi>Lord of joy,</hi> Mat. xxv. 21. Joy then he will impart,
life and glory and joy, and make us Lord of them, and of
whatsoever is within the name and title of Lord, even
for ever and ever. And then it will be perfect joy indeed
when we shall enter into the joy of our Lord, into that
joy and life and glory and blessedness wherewith our Lord
himself is eternally blessed. <hi>Gaudium quod erit,</hi> joy which
shall be indeed and never cease to be, everlasting, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
So now we have all and never till now, all his
Attributes, a Saviour, Christ, the Lord; all our joy, great,
publick and perpetual; nay if you mark it, we have yet
more than this: all his composition too, two natures in
one person: his humanity in Christ, his divinity in the
Lord: and but one Saviour of both, one Saviour which
is Christ the Lord, and one person which is Man and God.
And just so it should be, for of right none was to make
satisfaction for Man, but Man; and in very deed, none was
able to give satisfaction to God, but God. So that being
to satisfy God for Man, he was to be God and Man: and
so he is: <hi>A Saviour who is Christ the Lord.</hi> And so he
became this day; when though the Almighty God as this
day he was born into the world in our nature and made
Man. The blessed birth of which thrice blessed person,
thus furnished in every point to save us throughly, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Soul, from sin and Satan, the destroyers of both,
and that both here and for ever: the blessed birth of this
thrice blessed person (for every word in his name is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
blessing) is the very substance of this days solemnity,
of the Angels message and of our joy: That which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
is but circumstance, circumstance of persons, time
and place; of the persons for <hi>whom;</hi> of the time <hi>when,</hi>
and the place <hi>where:</hi> yet not so light and trivial, as may
wholly be omitted: the Angel, the Holy Ghost would
not leave them unmentioned, and we may not pass them
over untoucht: yet we shall but touch them and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46181:153"/>
but taking them in their order backward, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with the place where: where this Saviour was born,
<hi>In the City,</hi> &amp;c. And where should the Son of <hi>David</hi>
be born, but in the City of <hi>David?</hi> not in that City
which <hi>David</hi> repaired, and wherein he reigned (that is
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a famous City indeed) but in that City where
<hi>David</hi> was born, which is <hi>Bethlem,</hi> a poor City, a Village
rather than a City: And in this, this little Town did this
great Saviour, this Christ the Lord vouchsafe to be born.
Indeed when he would die, he would die at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi>
when he was to suffer shame and ignominy, derision and
disgrace, and all manner of dishonour, he would suffer it
in the eye of the world in the great City; but when he
was to be born, he would be born in Bethlem: when he
was to be glorified by Angels and receive gifts and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
from Kings and Princes; he would receive it in an
obscure and private place; this little Village: that so he
might condemn the worlds pride at his first entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, and teach men by his very birth the first
point of Christianity, to contemn honour and embrace
contempt. A doctrine which yet the particular place of
his birth doth urge much more vehemently: for it was
not only in <hi>Bethlem</hi> a poor Town, but in an Inn of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
and a poor Inn: so it seems, for there was no room
for them in it; and not so only, but in the poorest and
basest part of the Inn, in the Stable. This was the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of state for this great King, instead of sweet odors
perfumed with filth; and hung with no other Arras,
but what was weaved by Spiders, wherein he had only
Littier for his Bed, a Manger for his Cradle, and an Oxe
and an Ass for his attendants. So low did he descend for
our sakes, by his own example utterly to cry down all
the pomp and honour of the present life, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is of more power to deprive us of the glory of the
life to come. What a deep humiliation hath he begun
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46181:154"/>
withal? and how strange a disproportion is this, between
the titles of his person, and places of his birth? the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
Christ the Lord to be born in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> in an Inn, a
Stable; a Saviour in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> Christ in an Inn, the Lord in
a Stable? yet so he would have it for our instruction; yea
and for our comfort also. It is not point of doctrine only,
but matter of joy too: for joy there is in it, even that it
was in <hi>Bethlem: Bethlem</hi> signifies the house of bread,
and bread signifies all that we want; to give us our daily
bread, is to give us whatsoever we need, whatsoever we
need for the body; but this is spiritual bread, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
us with whatsoever we can desire for the Soul. Joy
and great joy in this, <hi>panis de Coelo,</hi> bread from Heaven,
the living bread, of which whosoever eats, shall never
die; and therefore perpetual joy too; joy which shall
be for ever, he shall never die. Joy in <hi>Bethlem</hi> then: nay
and joy there is too in the Inn, joy in the very Stable;
and that publick joy, <hi>omni popul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> joy to all the people:
For an Inn is <hi>domus populi,</hi> the house of the people, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and free for every Man; and though there may be
private rooms, wherein Men sort themselves in the Inn,
yet the Stable at least is <hi>publici juris,</hi> all Men have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in it: that is common. And as the place, so is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his birth, <hi>the dew of it is as the womb of the
morning,</hi> saith the Psalmist, that is, his birth, from the
womb, is as the morning dew, watering and refreshing not
<hi>Gideons</hi> fleece alone, the land of <hi>Jiery,</hi> but the face
of the whole Earth. And this is the <hi>first,</hi> the place where.</p>
            <p>The second circumstance is the time when, <hi>hodie</hi> this
day, saith the Angel, for <hi>unto you is born this day.</hi> And
what day was this? most think it was the first day of the
week, as this is, so it will serve us right <hi>hodie,</hi> as this
day; this very day of the week: but what day was
it of the year? why of all days of the year, upon the
shortest in the depth of winter; and of all hours in that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46181:154"/>
day in the darkest, for it was in the depth of night; and so
in the very point and close of the old week and beginning
of the new. That as he chose the worst and meanest places
for his birth; so the lowest periods, and utmost limits of
time wherein he would be born. According to his own
rule, <hi>verè recubuit in novissimo loco,</hi> he every way sate
him down in the lowest rooms. And every way is cause
of Joy unto us; for still we have joy in all, joy and great
joy: that he came in that season in the deep of winter,
when all things were at the worst; when all things were
fruitless, sapless and even dead, for want of heat and
comfortable influence. It reflects on our spiritual estate;
for just so and such it was: and the Sun of righteousness
could never rise in a better season, in a time of greater
need, to unthaw with his divine beams our frozen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
to give light to our minds, warmth to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
and life to all, that so we might become as Trees
of the Lord, full of sap, growing up in Grace and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and bringing forth fruit unto eternal life. Joy and
publick joy that he came on that very day, the first day of
the week; it was the first too of the world; and that
he who was to redeem the world, should be born into it
on the self same day wherein the world was created,
what doth it argue but that the redemption was to be as
universal as the Creation; as the creation of this aspecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
world that was made for man? And therefore go into
the universal world, saith our Saviour, and preach the
Gospel unto every Creature. Lastly, joy and perpetual
joy that he came in that precise hour, in the deep and
lowest bottom of the night: the Sun that can then rise
and in that point and shine upon us, it is impossible it
should ever set. If our very night be turned into day, that
day sure can never see night: unless men wilfully muffle
themselves and turn their day again into night by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out their own eyes: and not to be pitied by any

if they dwell in perpetual darkness ever after. So we
have all, all the joy and all the degrees of it in this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
too, the circumstance of time. There only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
the particular application of all, which indeed is all
in all, and you have it in the last point, <hi>Vobis,</hi> all is for
you, <hi>Unto you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not a word in the Text but, as you have seen,
hath joy in it; but this word hath the joy of them all,
all the joy which is dispersed and scattered through the
whole, being collected and united in this one. Before it
was only as oyle or wine pressed out into several vessels:
but this is the pipe wherein all must be poured and tunn'd
up, before it will work either cheerfulness in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
or gladness in the heart, were the joy never so
much. For if it be prepared for others, if we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as empty Casks; <hi>quid ad nos,</hi> what is it to us? and
what are we the better? But now all is poured forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our own bosoms; and that we may be all filled with
the fulness of it, it is particularly applyed unto you, and
every of you, <hi>For unto you, &amp;c.</hi> And herein is the
comfort of all, not that he was born for all in general,
but for you in particular. <hi>Omni populo</hi> to all the people,
is something too large and universal, and the hundredth
part of them shall not receive benefit by him, and so it
leaves us still in doubt: we would gladly therefore hear
it in more restrained terms, in terms of some propriety
that may assure us: why <hi>vobis</hi> for you, he is born for you.
Yea now you say somewhat; And twice it is here said for
failing, in every verse; once <hi>Evangelizo vobis,</hi> I bring unto
<hi>you</hi> good tydings, in the first; and now. <hi>Natus vobis,
born unto you,</hi> in this latter, that ye may know the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
is yours and the birth is yours: therefore the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
is sent unto you, because the birth concerneth you.
So yours they be both, both message and birth, and joy
and all; whatsoever is contained in both is wholly yours.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46181:155"/>
Yours the Saviour, yours the Christ yours his benefit,
his office, his power: his benefit to save you; his office
to undertake you; his power to secure you. Yours his
salvation as Jesus, his Anointing as Christ, his dominion as
the Lord. For if the birth be yours, all that follows the
birth must be yours too: if he himself be yours, all that
is his is yours also. And so it is, <hi>omn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all that he hath is yours, Luk</hi> xv.31. Now then since
he, and all that he hath is ours; will it not be well done
to make our Entry, to take seisin of him, and then to
dispose all to our best benefit? so shall we, as <hi>Bernard</hi>
wisheth us, <hi>uti nostro in usilitatem nostram, &amp; de sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatore
salutem operari,</hi> imploy or make use of him, for
our best behoof: draw his proper extract from him, and
work salvation out of this our Saviour. But how may
that be done? sure no way better, than as God in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
mercy this day gave him, so we this day again in all
thankfulness receive him: otherwise we shall but evacuate
the gift, and dishonour the giver; but abuse his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and lose our own benefit: For it is not so ours, but
by our own neglect it may be lost: For though all be
ours, because given us; yet nothing shall be ours, if not
accepted. Ours indeed he and all his are already by right
and interest; but they are never throughly ours, till they
be ours by possession, and then they are ours indeed.
Possession then let us take: but how or which way shall
we take it? no way so well as in the blessed Sacrament, in
the holy Mysteries instituted of purpose, and ordained
to no other end but for pledges to assure us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
to convey unto us this blessed Saviour and all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.
There and there only we may be seised and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of both: for there and there only are both to be
received. Thither then let us approach with all reverence
and due regard to claim our interest in them, and then
be assured it shall never be denied: He himself will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46181:156"/>
meet and answer us with an <hi>Accipite,</hi> Here take
this is my body, by the offering whereof ye are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
Take this is my blood, by the shedding whereof ye
are saved. Take and receive them both, and with them
all the joyes and blessings they both have purchased, or
this Text doth afford, for now after this, all are yours in
right and yours in possession; none can bereave you of
them. You have the Author of all safe enough, and fast
enough, with you, nay within you. It is no longer now
<hi>Natus vobis</hi> to you is born a Saviour; but <hi>in vobis</hi> in
you he is born, and in you he lives and will live for ever.
Ye may henceforth say with St. <hi>Paul, jam non ego vivo
fed vivit in me Christus,</hi> it is not I now that live but
Christ liveth in me; and if he live in us now, we shall
live in him for ever hereafter: For if whilst ye live, ye do
not live but Christ liveth in you; why, when ye die ye
shall not dye but live in Christ, in Christ the Lord of life
and glory and joy; and with Christ be made coheirs and
Lords of them all, and whatsoever other blessedness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he himself is everlastingly Blessed. Which the Lord
God Almighty vouchsafe unto us, for this our Saviour,
Christ the Lords sake: who this day came to purchase
them for us, and to whom with the Father and the blessed

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <p>When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his
Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law:</p>
                  <p>That he might redeem them that were under the Law,
that we might receive the adoption of Sons.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Text begins with the fulness of time, but
we may well begin with the fulness of the Text,
for it hath both, fulness of time and fulness of
matter; the love of the Father, the humility of
the Son, and the happiness of man arising from both are
here at the full. First the fulness of the Fathers love, who <hi>so
loved the world as he gave his only begotten Son. When
the fulness, &amp;c. God sent his Son, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly the
fulness of the Sons humility, not only vouchsafing to take
on him our nature, made of a Woman, but also our miserable
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46181:157"/>
condition, undertaking to satisfy the Law unto whose
condemnation we were subject, <hi>made under the Law,</hi> &amp;c.
Thirdly and lastly, the fulness of our bliss and happiness
arising from both, as being now ransomed from the death
of everlasting sorrow which the Law did threaten, <hi>that
he might redeem, &amp;c.</hi> and not so only but adopted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
unto that immortal life of glory, which the Gospel
doth promise, <hi>that we might, &amp;c.</hi> by the one we are
freed from all evil, by the other invested with whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is good, and both must needs make up the fulness of
happiness, <hi>That he, &amp;c.</hi> So these three are here at the
full, and in the fulness of them doth consist the fulness
of the whole Gospel, whose foundation is wholly built
upon the Son of God sent into the world; of whom
there is little to be known, and by whom there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
performed and fulfilled, which is not even in these
verses fully expressed. For you have here both founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and roof; both substance of the work and all the
circumstances that belong unto it; and you may see in it
not only that he was a Saviour sent into the world (which
is the main) but also, who it was that was sent, and by
whom, and in what manner, to what end, and in what time,
which are necessary adjuncts. If you demand of it, who
it was that was sent? it tells you the Son of God; if by
whom? it answers, by God his Father, <hi>God sent his Son</hi>;
if in what manner? it replies in a twofold; made and
made again; twice made, <hi>factum ex, &amp; factum sub,</hi>
made of, and made under, made of a Woman, and made
under the Law. If to what purpose all this? it gives
you a double end, which is the comfort of all, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Adoption unto men. <hi>To them that were, &amp;c.
That we might, &amp;c.</hi> Lastly, if when it was performed?
you have it clearly and fully in the first words, <hi>in ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudine
temporis,</hi> in the fulness of time. <hi>When the
fulness, &amp;c.</hi> So have you the sending, and whatsoever
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46181:157"/>
may seem to belong unto it, who was sent, and by whom,
how, and why, and when, not one the least circumstance
is omitted: but you have all, so full it is, and yet you
have not all the fullness. For should we inquire more
particularly into the nature and person of this Saviour,
here they are all three, one person and two natures, or
two natures in one person; he is the Son of God, see his
Divinity, but of a Woman, see his humanity: made of a
Woman; see their union in one person, for God cannot
be made Man, but by making himself one person with
Man. This for his incarnation, will you now inquire for
the birth or nativity of the person so incarnate? it's here
too, for as he was made, so was he sent; as made of a
Woman, so sent into the world: made of a Woman by
incarnation, and sent into the world by birth and nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>God sent his son made of a woman.</hi> Should we yet
proceed a step or two farther, after his incarnation and
birth, would you behold his life or contemplate his death,
see what he did in the one, or consider what he suffered
in the other; that you may do also, <hi>factus sub lege,</hi> will
give you both. For what were the actions of his life,
but the keeping of the Law in himself? or what was the
passion of his death, but the satisfying of the Law for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that had broken it? and in regard of either, <hi>made
under the law,</hi> under the law to fulfil the precepts which
it commands; and under the Law to satisfy the penalty
which it injoins. So by this time I think it is full, filled
with the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
person, actions, passion, whose incarnation, birth
life and death, it fully contains, <hi>verè verbum abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
it may well be termed and abbreviated word, a viol
of Spirits; a very extract, and quintessence drawn from
four Evangelists, and clapt up in two verses by an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
Two verses, which as I said, have but two general
parts; fulness of time and fulness of matter, both tend to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46181:158"/>
declare the greatness of the Fathers love, the depth of
the Son's humility, and the height of mans happiness. The
Fathers love is full, and grows unto its fulness by two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
<hi>He sent,</hi> and <hi>he sent his Son.</hi> The Sons humility
is full, and it ariseth unto its fulness by two degrees,
<hi>made of a woman,</hi> and <hi>made under the law.</hi> Mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is full, and it cometh to its fulness also by two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Adoption, that he might,</hi> or <hi>that
we might, &amp;c.</hi> If then the <hi>greatest</hi> thing the Father could
send (the Son) or the <hi>worst</hi> thing the Son could suffer (the
malediction of the Law) or the <hi>best</hi> thing men could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or wish for (adoption of Sons) can make it full; it is
full indeed and to purpose; for it is filled with all these.
And of this fulness we will now draw out unto you as much
as the short time will permit, beginning first with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the time, <hi>When the fulness of time was come, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the works of God, saith the Wise man, are done
in number, weight and measure, and therefore question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in a just and opportune time; For time it is that doth
both number and measure all his works, yea and gives
weight unto them too: his weightiest works and greatest
would be something the lighter and lesser, were they not
designed unto the fullest and fittest times. This then, as
it exceeds all other in the greatness of the work: so was
it fit to receive an answerable fulness of the season:
And sure the season must needs be full when so great a
work was poured into it, when he came to fill it, in whom
the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily. True, but yet
the Text doth not so much derive the fulness of the time
from his coming, as apply his coming unto the fulness of
the time: as being full and fit to receive him. Again
the time appointed by the Father, as it is a little before,
and foretold by his Prophets, was now full come and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired;
this then must needs be the fulness of time. True
also; they argue the fulness of time, but short as we make
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46181:158"/>
it; for had there not been a fulness and fitness in the
time it self, it had never been either appointed by the
one or foretold by the other: though without his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
it came not to this fulness neither. True it is,
that the wit of Man is too narrow a vessel fully to receive
and comprehend all the reasons of this fulness; yet sure in
that which it doth apprehend, it hath reason enough to
admire the wisdom of the Lord in the fitness of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment;
not without special convenience, chusing
out neither the first beginning of the world nor the last
end of it, but a mid time, as it were, between both,
when the world should arrive at his just age. Not a time
of war, but a time of universal peace: Not the time of a
Common-weal, but the time of a general Monarchy:
not of the AEquinox, but the Solstice: not in the Summer,
but the Winter: not in the day, but in the night: for all
these may be comprehended within this fulness, as not
wanting their convenient fitness.</p>
            <p>First then upon great reason the Lord chose not the
first ages of the young world, but deferred it for some
thousands of years, that being first shadowed in types
and figures, and promised by many and antient prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and predictions, his coming might be the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
and expected of Men; and himself the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and with less doubt entertained when he should
come. So great a mystery is the Incarnation of the Son
of God, that unless his person and actions, his birth,
death, and resurrection, with all the particulars of either
had been clearly and frequently for many ages foretold
by the Prophets his forerunners, we should have little
means either to perswade it to others, or at this day to
believe it our selves.</p>
            <p>And again upon as good reason he chose not the end
and last age of the decrepit world; lest all eyes should
fail, and hope faint, in too long expectation, with Where
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46181:159"/>
is the promise of his coming? Rightly therefore in a point
and period of time between both these; neither when
the world was too old and doting, nor whilst it was
too young and under tutorage, as it is two verses before,
but when it came to full age and strength in the sight of
him that made it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he chose not a troublous time of war, but
of calm and settled peace; as being the true <hi>Solomon</hi> and
Prince of peace, that came to no other end but to make
and establish an everlasting peace between Heaven and
Earth, God and Man, Man and his own Soul.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he chose not a time of Republick, neither of
<hi>Aristocracy,</hi> wherein few, nor <hi>Democracy</hi> wherein the
people have the chief power; but a time of <hi>Monarchy,</hi>
when one Man <hi>(Augustus Caesar)</hi> had obtained the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
did sway the Scepter, command and give law
unto the whole world; to shew that the universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of all Nations, the Supream head of all Churches,
the Catholick Bishop, and Pastor of all Souls, was now
born into the world.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he chose not the AEquinox but the Solstice;
not the Summer Solstice, when the Sun runs at his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
but the Winter Solstice, when the days are at short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est:
because then the Sun first begins to return, and the
days to increase; as in light, so afterwards in heat.</p>
            <p>So in like manner he chose the Meridian time; not
the diurnal Meridian, when the Sun by his presence makes
light more: but the nocturnal, when by his absence he
makes the deep noon of night; because at that time the
Sun is in the furthest point he can go from us, and first
begins to ascend towards the morning. And both, to
shew the true Son of Righteousness was now approaching
and drawing near unto us, by his comfortable presence
to give new light unto our minds and divine heat unto
our affections; to unthaw our benum'd and frozen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46181:159"/>
and to dispel the darkness of errour that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Souls, by the beams of his gracious countenance,
without which a Winter of perpetual coldness and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
night of ignorance would for ever hang upon
this little world of Man. So fit every way and full was
this time: A time when the world was at full age; and
fulness of peace was spread upon it: when a full Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
had general dominion, and the Sun (the measure of
time) arrived at his full period: on the Solstice, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the annual, and on the Meridian, the fulness of the
diurnal revolution; the one making the depth of Winter,
the other of night. A time therefore every way full;
but fuller yet by that which it now received, even him
that was filled with all the fulness of God, and from
whose fulness we all receive whatsoever grace or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
we have: who was the substance of all those shadows,
the body of all those figures, the accomplishment of all
prophecies and the fulfilling or filling full of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
that belong unto our happiness, and in this regard
it is <hi>tempus plenitudinis,</hi> a time of fulness; as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respects it is <hi>plenitudo temporis,</hi> the fulness of time.
And the fulness of time it is: and so the very institution
of this feast doth shew it to be; for look how many
months there are in the year, so many days we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the feast; for every month a several day: that as
the year is a full abridgment of all time, so this time a full
recapitulation of the whole year; that as it is in it self,
so in our own observance, we might acknowledge it to
be the fulness of time. But it is time to pass from this
fulness to another: from the fulness of time, to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Fathers love that was now shown in it, who
now not only sent as at other times, but sent his Son,
<hi>when the fulness of time, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And sure as it is the first, so it is not the least degree of
his love that he vouchsafed to send at all. Do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46181:160"/>
what he is that sent, or what we are to whom he
sent, and we shall soon with our shame acknowledge it.
For what is he but the Lord of glory? what we but vile
worms of the earth? he a gracious Creator emptying forth
his goodness upon us: we his Creatures and yet rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against him by pride and disobedience. In this case
for him to have sate still in the Throne of his Majesty,
and suffered himself to be sent and sued unto by us, had
been a great favour; and happy we if our humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
might be but received at his hands: But now when
he a person so infinitely above us, and so mightily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
and offended by us, not once so much as looked
after, but still neglected with the same pride by which he
was at the first contemned: That he now instead of
hurling down upon our heads deserved vengeance and
destruction, should condescend so low as to send and sue
unto us for peace and reconciliation, must needs argue
an infinite love, and bowels filled with yearning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on our miserable estate. <hi>Erubescat ergo &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundatur
humana superbia,</hi> O how should the pride of
Mans heart blush and be confounded, when the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God first seeks unto sinful Men, and yet wretched
Men stand upon terms one with another, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
dishonoured in seeking peace, and chuse rather to
die in enmity, than admit of reconciliation unless first
sued unto, and not always then neither! But God you see
doth otherwise, and thinks it no disparagement neither to
send and send first, <hi>first</hi> and first unto <hi>us.</hi> Mark well, I
pray you, what one of his Messengers says, <hi>We are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
for Christ Jesus and in his stead, obsecramus
vos, we beseech you to be reconciled unto God.</hi> 2 Cor.v.
God esteemed it no dishonour to send Embassadors unto
Men with terms of begging and beseeching reconciliation
at their hands: and yet perverse Man holds himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
any way to seek it at the hands of his Brother.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46181:160"/>
Our cogitations sure are carnal and worldly, and our
selves full of secular arrogance, otherwise we should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
it our chiefest honour to imitate the love of our
heavenly Father, and to prevent others rather than be
prevented in virtue and goodness. So then a love there
is in it, and a love that hath fulness far beyond the
empty affection of the insolent world, even in the very
sending; that such a sender should once send unto such
persons an offended Creator unto offending creatures;
this love hath fulness, but in that which follows is the
fulness of love, for he not only <hi>sent,</hi> but he sent his <hi>Son,
When the fulness of time was come, God sent his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord had many times heretofore sent unto the
sinful world, sometimes by the ministry of Patriarchs and
Prophets; sometimes by the ministring Spirits the holy
Angels of Heaven: yet both are but his ordinary Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
and therefore declare no more than his ordinary
love: But now he sent one, that was never sent before,
one infinitely above either Prophet or Angel or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
creature else is, or may be, an unusual and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
person. And therefore if we rightly estimate,
as we should do, the love of the sender by the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of that which is sent, especially being sent not as the
former only in a message but as a gift unto the world;
then since there is nothing so great and excellent as his
Son, his only begotten, and only beloved Son in whom
is the fulness of his own Godhead and brightness of his
own glory, As in sending him he sent the greatest, the
best and the fullest thing he had: so it must needs argue
the greatest, the best, the fullest affection that may be
imagined. There is not a sending of his, but hath <hi>ecce
char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tas</hi> in it, behold the love of God; but this <hi>ecce
quantam charitatem ostendit Deus,</hi> behold how great
love God hath shown unto us! 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> iii. 1. In every
one of the other sendings there is a <hi>dilexit Deus,</hi> God
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46181:161"/>
loved the world, but now it is <hi>sic Deus dilexit,</hi> God so
loved the world as he gave his only begotten Son. It was
not therefore any thing but love, and no empty love
neither, that he sent at any time and by the ministry of
any to such as we; but now sure it is full, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of love when he sent unto us him whom he most
loved; his only beloved Son. And sure it is well for us
that he sent such a Messenger: no other that had been but
a meer creature could have been sent in his errand, or at
least if he had been sent, could ever have returned with
his dispatch.</p>
            <p>Were there nothing in his business more than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of Satan, I doubt not some other creature strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
by God and the power of his might, might easily
have been enabled to tread down that evil spirit under
our feet. But considering that God meant not to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Man by a powerful conquest, but a just redemption,
by a just Redeemer that should dissolve the just condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Law, there is something more in it than the
conquest of Satan: In this case he that shall undertake it,
must not only vanquish the Prince of darkness, but by
satisfying Divine Justice appease the King of Glory that
was offended. And this I suppose no meer creature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with any power of God whatsoever (unless that
which ariseth from personal union with the Creator,
and maketh him cease to be a meer creature) could ever
be enabled to perform and accomplish. He that shall come
to Redeem, as it is here, that is, lay down a full price for
Mans transgression: He that shall put himself under the
Law, that is, undertake the penalty which Divine Justice
doth injoin unto the breakers: if he be but a finite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
he shall be sure to suffer infinite sorrow: or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being finite he cannot at once suffer any thing that
is infinite, he must suffer it infinitely, that is, never make
an end of suffering, but lie under it for ever. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46181:161"/>
satisfying must be as infinite as the person offended;
otherwise he can never be of that infinite merit as to make
a temporary passion equivalent to a perpetual punishment.
And this still adds fulness to the Fathers love and to his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
too, who by sending this person not only sent one
that was full and answerable unto his own love, but full
and sutable also to our necessity. When no other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
either in Heaven or Earth was either of worth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to be imployed, or of sufficient ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the imployment of this message and embassy, <hi>misit
filium, he sent his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Fathers love is full; twice full: he sent and sent his
Son: sent first, and sent the best thing that he had. We now
pass on to the Sons humility; wherein we shall perceive
his love, arising unto fullness by two degrees, made, and
twice made; Made of a Woman, and made under the Law.
It must needs be a great degree of humiliation for the
Son of God to be made at all, to be made any thing; for
to make him, saith one well, is to mar him, be it what it
will be. He is the maker and Creator of all things, and
therefore when he himself is made, no less than the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
is made a Creature, which cannot be but an infinite
abasement: But yet since he may not come in his own
glory, but must be made; if there be any thing better
than other, let him be made that; some Angel or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,
or any other of that Celestial Hierarchy. No he
would by no means take on him the nature of Angels,
that descent was not low enough for his humility.
He made himself lower than the Angels; he was made
man, and a man not made immediately by the fingers
of God like <hi>Adam</hi> in his full strength and beauty; but
bred by degrees in the womb of a Woman: for even
that he vouchfafed not to abhor, <hi>factum ex muliere,</hi>
made of a Woman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus it pleased the Lord to
abase himself, and thus it pleased him to exalt us and our
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46181:162"/>
Nature; by the assumption whereof, man is now become
God, and God is made man. He that was the Son of God
without a Mother, is now become the Son of a Woman
without a Father: and as God at the first drew a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
out of Man without the help of a Woman; so he
now took a Man out of a Woman without the help of
Man. For he was not begotten but made; made a man,
but of the substance only of a woman, <hi>made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
&amp;c.</hi> Blessed woman; from whose body the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of mankind took the blood that was to be shed
for the sins of the world: yea of whose blood he made
that body which men and Angels must ever adore. What
wonderful titles hast thou obtained, thou Daughter of
the Father, Mother of the Son, and, I had almost said,
spouse of the Holy Ghost that wrought thy conception<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
how, and how strangely art thou become, as the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of thy Son, so the Mother of thy own Father! For
so she must needs be that is the Mother of God. Blessed
therefore thou art, and well may all generations so call
thee; from whose bowels so great a blessing is descended
to all generations. This much we willingly afford, and
more than this we may not give, thou maist not receive;
we honour, but we may not adore thee: we bless thee,
we praise thee, we magnify thee; only we do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
thee: that belongs unto thy Son, which is both thy
Son and thy Saviour. For the blood which he took from
thee, he even paid for thee: he took it from thee, so he
is thy Son; he pay'd it for thee, so he is thy Saviour. God
thy Saviour, and therefore thy Father, as well as thy Son,
as well as thy Saviour. So his thou art, and his Creature,
by a double title of Creation, of Redemption. Thou
maist not then take unto thy self any part of his honour
and worship; whom thou thy self art for ever bound to
worship and honour. Honour enough it is for thee, that
he that made thee vouchsafed to be made of thee, <hi>Made
of a woman,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:46181:162"/>Neither hath he honoured her alone in her own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or in her own Sex; but man and all mankind. For
though he were made of a woman, yet not made by a
woman; made of a woman, but made himself a man;
that both man and woman might rejoyce and glory in
him. How well may we cry out with <hi>David, Domine
quid est homo,</hi> Lord what is man that thou didst mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
him, or the Son of man that thou didst so visit him?
And how well may we answer with the same Prophet,
<hi>Homo est res nihili,</hi> man is a thing of nought; that is, a
thing drawing near unto nothing, of no worth, no value,
no continuance; yet such a thing it pleased the Son of God
to be made, and therein to be made lower than the Angels,
that he might raise and advance this thing of nought
far above all principalities and powers, and crown him
with worship and glory. So have you both his natures
God and man; the Son of God, and yet the Son of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
So he was, and so it was convenient he should be
that was to be the redeemer of man; who might not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
but by a passion proportionable unto a perpetual
punishment. For as I said before, had he not been God, his
sufferings could never have been of that infinite value:
so I now say, had he been nothing else but God, he could
not have suffered at all; and for this reason be was both
God and man: man to suffer, God to merit: man to serve,
God to set free: man to die, God to rise again from the dead:
for had he been God alone, he could never have suffered;
had he been man alone, he could never have made an end
of suffering: God only could not die; nor man only rise
again from the dead: rightly therefore was he both, both
the Son of God, neither made nor created, but begotten
of the Father; and the Son of a man, not begotton by any
Father, but made and created of the substance of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Made of a woman, &amp;c.</hi> And even unto this his
love brought him for our sakes; for whatsoever else he
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46181:163"/>
had been made, it would have done us little good. In
this then was the fullness of <hi>his</hi> love as before of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi>
that he would be made, and was made not what
was fittest for him, but what was best for us: not what
was most for his glory, but what was most for our benefit
and behoof. But yet this is but the first step of his fulness,
he was made once more for our sakes; made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and made under the Law too, <hi>made under the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a marvellous descent and humiliation that the
only begotten of the Father should vouchsafe to be
born of a woman; that the Son of the everliving God
should be content to lay aside his own Majesty and glory,
and cloath himself with the raggs of our mortality: to
leave his habitation in the highest heavens, and dwell in
a Tabernacle of Clay whose foundation is in the dust, as
<hi>Job</hi> speaks. Surely were man turned into a beast, into a
worm, into dust, into nothing, it were not so great a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement,
as that the Son of God should be made man.
This making cannot but make his humility, and with it,
his love, unto us, deep and full: but this next making
(made under the law) makes it deeper and fuller still.
For in that he only took on him our <hi>nature,</hi> but in this
our <hi>condition:</hi> First our nature as <hi>Man,</hi> now our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as <hi>sinful men:</hi> men under the law, as it follows,
that is, subject unto the heavy malediction wherewith
the Law threatens the breakers of it. This was our
condition, and this he undertook: which was much more
than to take our nature: by that he was <hi>made man,</hi>
but by this, he that knew no sin <hi>was made sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v.
that is, made a sacrifice for sin; was contented to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
as a sinner, and to endure whatsoever the Law could
lay upon sinners; and this is <hi>factum sub lege</hi> made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Law indeed; under the Law he was, and freely
was so; and it must needs add some fulness to his love, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was meerly voluntary, and free from necessity. We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46181:163"/>
though we willingly sin, yet we would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lie under the Law: but we are either born under it
through corruption of nature; or cast under it for our
corrupt actions, whether we will or no: but for him who
neither knew original soil nor actual sins; who though
he took on him our flesh, yet not that flesh which lusteth
against the spirit; though born of a woman, yet of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
only without mixture of fleshly generation, of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
but a woman overshadowed by the Holy Ghost, and
therefore pure in his conception. And as conceived by
the Holy Ghost, so he was united to the Son, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
uncapable of voluntary transgression, and therefore
no less pure in his actions, than in his conception, but clear
and innocent in both; (just so he was born, so just he
lived:) for him I say, if he come under the Law, it must
be <hi>Love</hi> and not <hi>necessity</hi> that shall bring him. <hi>lex justo
non est posita,</hi> no Law for the just, no Law could touch
him. The Law was added because of transgressions, saith
the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim. i. 9.</hi> but no transgression was found in
him: who could convince him of sin? and therefore <hi>quid
illi &amp; legi,</hi> what had he to do with the Law or the Law
with him? He might indeed well be <hi>Dominus legis,</hi>
Lord of the Law, as he said he was Lord of the Sabbath:
but <hi>sub lege</hi> under the Law, or <hi>subditus legi</hi> subject to
the Law, to the pain and penalty of the Law, no Law in
the world could make him, had he not of his own accord
made himself so. And therefore it is not <hi>natus</hi> but <hi>factus,</hi>
not born under the Law, no nor fallen under it neither
(that's our condition) but made under the Law: to shew
that it was not laid upon him either by natural necessity,
or through voluntary breach; but meerly by his own
free undertaking was made that which naturally he was
not, and in justice ought not to be. Made therefore, not
by any other but by himself, who of his own accord, and
out of his own love unto us freely undertook and pay'd
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:46181:164"/>
that debt which he owed not: otherwise no power of
Law, no malice of Devils, no nor the wrath of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
could ever have seised on an innocent person, had he
not of grace and great compassion unto men taken on him
the person of sinners, and in their stead put himself under
the Law, that they might be freed from the punishment.
Freely therefore and of his own accord without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
without any necessity, of meer love and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>factum sub lege,</hi> made under the Law.</p>
            <p>And now the doctrine begins to be comfortable indeed;
comfort there was in it, and not a little in his first making
<hi>ex muliere,</hi> when he was made of a woman; for made of
women we are all; so there was an alliance and consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity
between us in that: besides, the flesh and blood
which the Divinity assumed, must needs be advanced to
great glory; so there is honour in it also to our nature.
But yet if this were all, if there were no more in it than
so, his alliance with us and the honour of our nature in
him would prove but a cold comfort God knows; for
what good is it to us that our nature is exalted in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
person, though to the height of Heaven; if we
our selves be thrown down and perish in the depth of
Hell in our own persons? or what were we the better to
have a kinsman great and wealthy, if notwithstanding we
lye in prison under the Law for our own debts? Sure his
wealth is little unto us unless he relieve us with his wealth:
But if he please to become our surety, to enter into bond,
and put himself under the Law for us; then he shews the
part of a true kinsman, and there is real comfort in that.
Such and far worse was our case and estate: such and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
beyond it was his love and compassion. We were
debters indeed by virtue of a handwriting that was against
us, <hi>Colos.</hi> ii. 14. a handwriting of ordinances which was
our bond; for we were bound to keep and perform them:
but we brake the covenants and so forfeited our bond, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46181:164"/>
in it forfeited no less than our lives. The condition of
our obligation was no money matter, it was not pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
but capital; and the debt of a capital obligation, is
death. Now he that shall undertake such a debt, that in
this case shall be content to take up our forfeited bond,
and put in new security of his own, be bound skin for
skin, body for body, and life for life, and be content to
pay the bond too when the day comes; his love sure is
full, and he brings comfort with him to purpose. And
even this he did; this he undertook and this he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us. He undertook it at his Circumcision, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
it in his passion. Whosoever is Circumcised,
<hi>factus est debitor universae legis,</hi> he becomes a debter unto
the whole Law, saith St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> v.3. At his Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
then he undertook the debt, he entred bond anew
with us; and in sign that he so did, he then shed a few
drops of his blood whereby he signed the bond (as it
were) and gave those few drops as a pledge or earnest,
that when the fulness of time came, he would not fail to
shed all the rest. And shed it he did; what at his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
he undertook, at his passion he performed,
even to the full. He bound himself in a bound of death,
and death he underwent, even the death of the Cross,
the most bitter reproachful cursed death of the Cross: so
payed all to the uttermost farthing; and having paid it,
<hi>delevit Chirographum,</hi> he cancelled the handwriting,
the sentece of the Law that till then was of record, and
stood in full force against us; but now that the whole
world might know it to be void, he hung it up in the
same place where it was satisfied, he nailed it to the Tree
of his Cross, <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 14.</p>
            <p>But yet this is not all; the penalty is but one part of
the Law and he became debtor <hi>universae legis,</hi> to the
whole Law, saith the Apostle, and the whole Law he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whatsoever was due. In the Law we consider a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46181:165"/>
force or power: it hath a commanding, and it hath a
condemning power: a power directive, and a power vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative:
it hath precepts which it injoins, and it hath
punishments which it inflicts: by the one it informs us
what we are to do: by the other what we must suffer if
we do it not; and he was under both parts, that both
might be fully discharged: for as he satisfied the one at
his death, so the other in his life. In his life he exactly
kept and observed all the precepts of the Law to the least
tittle: and in his death he received the full punishment
of the Law to the worst and utmost extremity, and so
was under both, and fulfilled both, paid all, both princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
and forfeiture: the principal, in keeping the Law him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
the forfeiture, in suffering the penalty of the Law
for others, that so others might be freed from both.
Sure now the Sons humility (that humbled himself to
death, even the death of the Cross) is full, no less full
than the Fathers love. The Father sent, and sent his
Son: the Son was made, and made of a Woman; made of
a Woman, and made under the Law; made under the
Law, and both parts of the Law, that he might be fully
made. And this is Gods fulness: Let us now proceed unto
Mans fulness; for from this fulness of the Fathers love
and the Sons humility we all receive the fulness of our
own bliss and happiness contained in our <hi>Redemption</hi>
and <hi>Adoption;</hi> for to these purposes all this was done,
<hi>That he might redeem them, &amp;c.</hi> And these two, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and Adoption, are the two degrees of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
(for without them we had been marred, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done)
and they fully answer unto the two degrees of
his making, made of a Woman, and made under the Law:
He under the Law, that we might be redeemed from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law: he made the Son of Man, that Men might
be made the Sons of God. So the making of him was
his own marring, but his marring was our making; he
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46181:165"/>
twice marred by his making; we twice made by his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
He of God made Man, and of Man made a sinner;
we of sinners, that is, bondslaves to the Law, made Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and of Freemen Sons; Sons of God and Heirs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
with Christ. And what more is there that we
could wish to make it up fuller? since our desires can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
no farther, than to be rid of all evil and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with whatsoever good is; and by these two, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and Adoption, we are made partakers of both.
To be redeemed from under the Law, is to be quit of all
evil; and to be adopted into the state of Children, is to
be intitled unto all that is good. For all evil is in being
under the Law, from whence we are redeemed: and all
good, in that heavenly inheritance whereunto we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted:
we were created to inherit a glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but through sin we lost our inheritance; and not
so only but together with it we forfeited our lives; a
sentence of death and everlasting destruction was passed
upon us; and from this now we are freed by redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in that again we are reestated by adoption, and
what would we more? But we must speak a little in
particular of both, and first of <hi>Redemption. That he
might redeem, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every deliverance is not Redemption; but such only
as is obtained by a just and a full price; so the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
and something more: Redemption; a rebuying
or buying back again of something formerly sold, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
into the possession of another. Ever a former alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
must go before, and a valuable satisfaction follow
after; otherwise there may be a bare emption without
the former, a reemption without the latter: but unless
both be precedent, it cannot be Redemption. And sure
such a matter had formerly befallen us. A kind of aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had gone before whereby we had made away our
selves, sold our inheritance and forfeited our lives: A
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46181:166"/>
making away indeed, rather than a sale it was; for such
a trifle made away: first in <hi>Adam</hi> for the forbidden fruit,
a matter of no moment: since in our own persons daily
made away for some trifling pleasure or profit not much
more worth: And having thus passed our selves away by
this selling our selves under sin, the Law seiseth on us,
whose dreadful doom is death and Hell, and everlasting
sorrows there with the Prince of Hell. So infinite a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
doth it inflict, because in the breach of it an
infinite Majesty was offended. In this heavy case we lay
shut up under the Law as in a Prison, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 23. fast
bound with the cords of our own sins, <hi>Prov.</hi> v. 22. the
sentence passed on us, and we waiting but for execution:
what evil is there not in this estate and on every Soul
that is in it? Our Faith sure is weak, and we do not
throughly apprehend what we have only heard of: but
could we see it with the seeing of the eye, as <hi>Job</hi> speaks,
were we permitted to stand on the brink and look into
that fearful pit of everlasting horror whereunto we are
condemned by the Law, what misery and fulness of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
should we then discern? or rather what misery
should we not discern in our lamentable estate, sentenced
unto that gulf of sorrow before our eyes with legions of
Devils attending at our backs, ready to execute the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and push us in to suffer that torment which we
could not endure to behold? Could we but with our
fancy place our selves in this case, which they are in that
are under the Law, this point, I am sure, would be full
on our parts, even fulness of misery. Well then the first
degree of our happiness, is to be rid, to be quit of this
miserable estate; but by what means may that be done,
and who shall obtain it for us? Prayers and intreaties
would not serve turn, our pardon may not be had for
the begging; but sold we were, and bought we must be:
God was wronged and must be righted: the Law was
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46181:166"/>
broken and must be satisfied; and without this ransom
the prisoners may not be delivered. A matter therefore
not of Intercession, but of Redemption; But now the
price of Redemption who shall lay down? sure it is not
so easily done; we sin indeed with great facility, but to
expiate sin, will cost a great deal more: he that will do
it must resolve to suffer as much punishment, as a world
of Men can deserve or an offended God in justice inflict:
and who or what is there amongst the works of the
whole creation, that may stand under his wrath, until
it hath taken full revenge, and not perish under it for
ever? Gold and Silver in this case is of no worth, the
blood of Bulls and Goats of no value, Men of as little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
as either; and therefore should they offer the Sons
of their loins for the sins of their Souls, they could do
no good, it cost more to redeem them than so, therefore
they must let that alone for ever. Nay should an Angel
of Heaven be incarnate to suffer for sin, he would become
but as an incarnate Devil and must lie in Hell for ever. He
is, though an excellent creature, yet but a creature; and
a creature may not satisfy the Creator: when therefore
nothing may do it; nor mineral, nor beast, nor man,
nor Angel, nor any thing else created, no remedy but
God himself must be made Man, and the Man God made
under the Law, <hi>ut ille,</hi> that he may do it, that he might
redeem them that were under the Law. This is the <hi>ut,</hi>
the end, the first end for which all this ado is kept; for
which Heaven and Earth are thus troubled; for which
is all this business, this sending and making, making over
and over again; that since there was nothing of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
value already created, a new person of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worth and dignity might be made, <hi>ut ille,</hi> that he at
least might be able to redeem us from under the Law.
And sure full and able he was every way; being Man
he might undertake for Man; and being God he could
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46181:167"/>
give satisfaction to God: for as sins against an infinite
person are of infinite guilt, so suffering in an infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
must be of as infinite merit: from whence it is that
a short passion in him is equal to a perpetual punishment
in us; for what is wanting in the sufferings is abundantly
supplied in the dignity of the sufferer, whose infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
suffering finitely, carries full proportion with finite
persons suffering infinite punishment. Able then he was
and no less willing than able; what he only could do he
lovingly did do, and did it too to the full. Any the least
sufferings of his had been enough, but that he might be
sure to lay down a full price, he gave, <hi>pretiosum sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
his precious blood, saith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> yea his life blood,
saith St. <hi>Matthew, dedit vitam,</hi> he gave his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
for many, <hi>Matth.</hi> xx. 28. he is content to bleed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death for this little world, when the least drop of his
blood had been enough for many worlds. He was not
sparing in his price; but as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, <hi>with the
Lord is plenteous redemption;</hi> plenteous indeed, every
way there is a plenitude and fulness in it, he fully made
under the Law, we fully delivered from under the Law;
which yet is but part of our fulness, but the first degree
of our happiness to be rid and quit of the misery under
which we lay. And yet this had been full enough were
there no more; but yet this is not all, no he left us not
there, but that the measure might flow over, he gave us
not over, when he had freed us of this wretched estate,
till he had brought us to the blessed estate himself is in;
and of prisoners under the Law, made us Heirs of that
glorious Kingdom promised in the Gospel. For so it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
at the last end of all and the fullest too, <hi>ut nos reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piamus,</hi>
that we might receive the Adoption of Sons:
that is, of Captives condemned become children adopted;
adopted to the joint fruition of all that he hath, which
is fully as much as he could give or we could desire. To
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46181:167"/>
purchase our pardon, to free us from death and the
Law's sentence, this seemed a small thing to him, yet this
is <hi>lex hominis,</hi> mans goodness goeth no farther: and
gracious is the Prince that doth but so much. For who
ever heard of a condemned Man adopted afterwards, or
that thought it not enough and enough if he did but
scape with his life? So far then to exalt his bounty to
that fulness as pardon and adopt both, <hi>non est lex homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
haec:</hi> no such measure amongst Men. <hi>Zelus Domini
exercituum,</hi> but the zeal of the Lord of Hosts was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this <hi>Isa.</hi> ix. 7. So full is this on his part, that he did
not only redeem but adopt, purchase us, and purchase
for us: give us our lives, but part with us his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And full it is, I am sure, on our parts that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted;
did we fully know the riches of our inheritance;
which we shall not do till another fulness of time come.
Many and glorious things are spoken of thee thou City
and Kingdom of God; but yet when we then come to
behold it, we shall say of it as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did
of the wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when she came to him: The
report was less than the truth, and the one half thereof
had not been told us. For what tongue may tell us that
which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor ever
may enter into the heart of Man, till Man enter into it,
till that day when it shall be said unto him, <hi>intra in
gaudium Domini,</hi> enter into thy Masters joy? In the
mean time where we cannot conceive, what should we
speak? where the thing is so full, that all words are too
empty to express it, it will be enough to admire in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or say only with <hi>David,</hi> Sure the lot is fallen unto
us in a fair ground and we have a goodly heritage: so
now we are come to the true fulness indeed, and we
may not go farther, not farther in our discourse, it must
needs stay where all words fail, and every tongue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
is speechless. Nay no farther in our desires; this
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46181:168"/>
Adoption is the fulness of our option, nay a fulness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our wish; since we could not possibly conceive so
great happiness to wish for it. By this time then it is
full Sea, and all the banks are filled on every side. It is
now as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> waters that he saw flow from under the
threshold of the Temple, that took him first to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles,
then to the Knees, after to the Loins, at last so high
risen there was more no passage, <hi>Ezek.</hi> iv. 7. for just so it
fareth here with the Text, that by the like degrees runs
on, till at length it rise to an immensity of fulness, not
to be forded. <hi>First,</hi> from the fulness of his compassion
God sent to release us: <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the fulness of his
love he sent his Son; who in the fulness of humility,
was content to be made; and to make a full union with
our nature, made of a Woman; and to make the union
fuller yet with our sinful condition, be made under the
Law; that we might receive a full deliverance from all
evil, by being redeemed; and a full estate of all the joy
and glory of his heavenly inheritance, by being adopted.
Lo here is fulness of all hands. And sure amidst all this
fulness, it were much unfit that we only should be empty
for whom all was done. If there be fulness of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Father, if fulness of love in the Son to purchase
benefits and blessings for us, full above measure; sure
there should be in some measure at least a fulness of duty
in us again to return unto them. Otherwise if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
so great Salvation, we may and shall notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Redemption or Adoption either, depart as empty
of mercy, as we are of goodness. The Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
is not so absolute but that many may perish for
whom Christ died, as the Apostle speaks; The general
and probationary Adoption is not so peremptory, but
that upon misbehaviour divers may be disinherited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
<hi>Filii Regni ejicientur foras,</hi> even the Sons of the
Kingdom shall be cast forth, saith our Saviour himself. If
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46181:168"/>
thou then wouldst be a firm and constant partaker of these
benefits, being thus set free by so noble a Redeemer, and
at so high a price, stand upon thine own worth; value
thy Soul at the same rate it was ransomed at; do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
basely sell it and thy birthright, for the poor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of this world, like <hi>Esau</hi> for a mess of pottage: But
as God is full of compassion, full of mercy, full of love;
so be thou full of Duty, full of Piety, full of Repentance,
and then Redemption and Adoption both shall be fully
thine and thine for ever. But yet these are but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
duties of our whole life: if we would make it up
full indeed, we are to consider those that are special and
proper to this time in particular, and they are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two, <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Thanks;</hi> that as the persons are two,
the Father and the Son, and the benefits two, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Adoption; so that both might be fully answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the duties are two, joyfulness and thankfulness unto
the Authors from whence they proceed. So these two
will make up all full; especially if they be in those full
degrees, if they be full in us, in our selves. And that so
they shold be, their very names do teach us, <hi>Joyfulness</hi>
and <hi>Thankfulness</hi> both ending in <hi>Fulness;</hi> to shew that
they may not be remiss, but that we should be full and
abound in them, as at all other times, so chiefly in this
which is the fulness of time, or the time of fulness, chuse
you whether. And a time of fulness I am sure it will be in
one sense; of fulness of bread, and fulness of bravery,
of fulness of mirth and pastime; and so it may be, and so
it hath ever been a joyful time even in outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
only we must be careful that this outward joy eat
not up, evacuate not our spiritual joy proper to the feast.
Which then is truly spiritual, when our spirits shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
not so much in external sports with the multitude,
as with the blessed Virgin, <hi>in Domino salvatore,</hi> in God
our Saviour: God our Redeemer, as it is here. And sure
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46181:169"/>
a Redeemer brings joy with him indeed: we our selves
acknowledge it in other matters, if it concern the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
of our goods, or of our momentany lives. Tell
an undone Man of one that will redeem his mortgaged and
forfeited Land; tell a lost Man cast and condemned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law of the Kingdom, of a Redeemer that will
purchase his pardon; it is a welcom message, the joyfullest
news that ever he heard. Shall those transitory things
affect us thus, and shall spiritual things and eternal affect
us nothing? Are our earthly estates so dear unto us, and
is the recovery of a celestial inheritance in a Kingdom of
everlasting glory not worth the thinking on? Are our
animal and perishing lives so precious, and shall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of our Souls cast and condemned to the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of eternal torment not be regarded? Sure did we
worthily conceive of it, such a Redeemer would be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
with our best and fullest joy. But however it
go with us now when the destruction is not near enough
to affect us, sure I am the time will come when it shall:
<hi>In novi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>imo intelligetis plane,</hi> in the latter end ye shall
fully understand, saith the Wise-man. At that day, that
fearful day, when tribulation and anguish shall be upon
every Soul that hath done evil, when they shall vainly
cry unto the Rocks and Mountains to cover them from
the presence of the Lord, then indeed ye shall understand
and know that there is no joy in the world to the joy
of such a Redeemer: but alas then of a gracious Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he will become a terrible and inflexible Judge. And
therefore, <hi>beatus populus qui scit jubilationem,</hi> blessed
the people that now know how and wherein to rejoice.
And as we are to rejoice for the benefits we receive, so
we may not be unmindful of them from whence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them. That were like swine that fat themselves on
the mast, but never look up to the hand that beats them
down. And therefore after our joyfulness or fulness of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46181:169"/>
joy, our fulness of thanks or thankfulness is to ensue. We
must sing both parts in the Christmas Carol of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Woman of whom he was this day made, <hi>My soul
doth magnify the Lord,</hi> as well as <hi>my spirit rejoiceth
in God my Saviour.</hi> To render our thanks then and to
remember to do it fully; to forget none, to him that was
sent, and to him that sent; sent his Son in this, the Spirit
of his Son in the next verse; the one to procure, the other
to seal and assure unto us both these benefits. To all
three therefore, to the Father that sent, to the Son that
came, to the Holy Ghost that made him at his coming:
(for by him he was conceived) to the Father for his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to the Son for his redemption, to the Holy Ghost
for his adoption (for by him it is wrought; he that made
him the Son of man, doth likewise regenerate us to the
state of the Sons of God:) worthily therefore to all three
is all thanks and praise and honour to be rendred for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
But yet this thankfulness is but verbal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not yet full; for fulness of thanks would surely be
exprest in something more than words: and in what may
that better be, than in the holy Eucharist, the Sacrament
of thankfulness, and is by interpretation thanksgiving it
self? When <hi>Davids</hi> zeal throughly warmed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of Gods mercies brake forth into that fiery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>quid retribuam Domino,</hi> what shall I return unto the
Lord for all his benefits? he could find our nothing so full
as this, <hi>accipiam Calicem salutis,</hi> I will take the Cup
of Salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if our hearts be hot within us as his was, and we me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
a return as he did; <hi>Ecce calix salutis,</hi> behold the
Cup of salvation; let us take it, and with it in our hands,
call upon him, render him our true Eucharist or real thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
indeed. The Cup of Salvation cannot but do well
in the day of salvation: In it is the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the price upon Covenant to be laid down for us,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46181:170"/>
and therefore the Cup of Redemption: In it is the blood
of the Testament wherein our glorious inheritance is by
way of legacy conveyed unto us; and therefore the Cup
of Adoption. So that our freeing from under the Law
and our investiture into our new adopted estate, are not
full, nor fully consummate without it. And yet this may
not be all. No, when this is done, there is an allowance
of twelve days more for this fulness of time, that we
shrink not up our duty into this day alone, but continue it
throughout the whole. Sure every good heart in this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
commemoration of our Redemption, and Adoption,
will himself remember to redeem some part of the time,
to adopt too some hour in the day at the least, to think
on him a little and bethink himself of the duty the time
calls on him for. That so no day be empty, quite empty
in this fulness of time: but that fulness of time, fulness of
mercy, and fulness of duty may all meet together and
make a full union. That as the time is filled with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of the Father, and the love of the Son; so we
may be filled with the grace of the Holy Ghost. Then
shall we be sure to pass on from one fulness to another,
from this here to another which is behind, from the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Grace to the fulness of Glory. For all this is but
the fulness of time; that is the fulness of eternity: when
time shall be run out, and his glass empty, and <hi>tempus
non erit amplius,</hi> and shall be no more; which will be
at his next sending; for yet once more shall God send him,
and he come again. At which coming we shall then
indeed receive the fulness of our Redemption, not from
the Law, that we have already; but from corruption to
which our bodies are yet subject: and receive the full
fruition of the inheritance whereunto we are here but
adopted. And then it will be perfect, compleat, absolute
fulness indeed, when we shall all be filled with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of him that filleth all in all, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 23. that is, with
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46181:170"/>
the fulness of God himself. For <hi>Deus erit omnia in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi>
God it is that shall be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and
then sure all will be throughly full indeed. To this we
aspire, and in the fulness appointed of every one of our
times, Almighty God bring us; by him and for his sake
that in this fulness of time was sent to work it for us in his
person, and work it in us by the operation of his blessed
Spirit. To whom with the Father and the Son, be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
all thanks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>OF whom speaketh the Prophet this, of himself
or of some other man, said the Queen <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace's</hi>
Treasurer unto <hi>Philip:</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi>
saith the Text, <hi>began at that scripture and
preached unto him Jesus: Act.</hi> viii. And this is that
self-same Scripture, at least part of it, which that <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi>
Eunuch then read, and <hi>Philip,</hi> that we be not
ignorant whom it concerns, of Christ Jesus expounded.
And though he who was a stranger unto the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Israel</hi> and the Oracles of God, could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it without a Teacher; yet unto us that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in the mystery of Christ, it is manifest in it self;
there being no clearer nor more illustrious Prophecy
of it than this whole Chapter, wherein his birth, passion,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46181:171"/>
death and resurrection are so fully and evidently descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
as it may well be termed an <hi>Evangel</hi> a Gospel, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a Prophecy. It begins first with his first birth
and beginning, <hi>He shall grow up before him as a tender
plant and as a root out of a dry ground, v.</hi> 2. It goes on to
his sorrows and sufferings, and for whom he endured them.
<hi>He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief, &amp;c.</hi> He suffers then, and for us
he suffers, but he must suffer unto death, and of that it
will assure you too. <hi>He is brought as a Lamb to the
slaughter, &amp;c.</hi> But though he be mean, slain and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
yet he may not abide under death: though judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be passed on him and executed too, and he impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in the grave and jaws of the pit, yet all the bands
and cords of death cannot hold him, he must up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of them all: And therefore it follows, <hi>he was
taken from prison and from judgment;</hi> which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in his resurrection from the dead, wherein the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and sentence of death was disannulled and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Grave broken up. In contemplation of which
high argument of his Divinity that could so arise; the
Prophet breaks forth into this admiration of his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
descent, and off-spring, <hi>Who shall declare his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then it is manifest not only by <hi>Philip's</hi> interpretation
but by the Prophecies own clearness and fullness, that the
Prophet spake not this of himself but of some other man;
and that other man to be none other than Christ Jesus the
Eternal Son of God, whose Incarnation, birth or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
we this day with all joy and thankfulness publickly
Celebrate, and are now as well as we can to discourse of;
yet not as thinking to express it, but only to shew you
how inexpressible it is, for <hi>Generationem ejus, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (that we may bound our discourse within certain
lines and limits, this generation of our Lord and Saviour
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46181:172"/>
is not simple and of one sort, but various and manifold.
As his Person is compounded of divers things, so hath he
accordingly several generations. In the blessed Trinity
there are three Persons and but one Substance: In Christ
Jesus three Substances and but one Person: he hath but
two Natures indeed, Divinity and Humanity; but the
Humanity again is compounded of two several Essences,
corporal and spiritual, a body and a Soul; so in all there
are these three, a body, a Spirit, and the Divinity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
both are united. And according to these three we
shall consider a threefold generation, <hi>Divine, Humane</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual:</hi> For Christ was born from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and still is in heaven without a Mother; on earth
he had in due time a humane birth without a Father;
and in the minds and Souls of men he is spiritually born
without Father or Mother: of a Mother without a Father
he was born once: without Father or Mother he is born
often: of a Father without a Mother he is born always
and perpetually. Lastly, of his Father in Heaven he is born
God; of a Mother on Earth he was born man; without
Father or Mother in the Souls of men he is born God and
man. As there are three Substances therefore in our
Lord and Saviour: so hath he three births or generations
which we shall consider in their order, <hi>Divine, Humane</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual;</hi> all three so hid and full of admiration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable,
as the Prophet and we with him, may well say
of them all, <hi>Generationem, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin then with the <hi>First</hi> his Divine generation,
whereof we shall say but little, because indeed we can say
nothing worthily and as we should say: For how shall
frail man say, what no man can possibly conceive, since he
cannot fully say and enunciate what he doth conceive?
That there are several persons in the God-head, is the high,
yea highest Act of our faith, no subject for our expression.
That God hath a Son we are bound to believe, but how
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46181:172"/>
he begat him we are bound not to inquire; because he
hath not revealed, nor will reveal, peradventure may not,
but to the glorified eye. Then indeed and then only
when we shall <hi>see him as he is,</hi> we shall see his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and be happy in seeing it: it is the eternal and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
blessedness of the Father to beget him, for it is his
inmost natural Act and essential: and it shall be our
perpetual happiness hereafter to behold it, which we
shall then but behold, comprehend it we may not; but
know it we shall: And <hi>this is life everlasting to know
thee and him whom thou hast sent.</hi> In the mean time
till that life everlasting come, whilest we are Pilgrims,
and lead a life temporary here upon earth, wherein we
know and prophesie but in part; it is not our least wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to know such high mysteries are no part of our
knowledge. It is enough for us with holy <hi>Moses</hi> to see
the back-parts of the Lord, to see him in his effects, his
word and outward works; to see him in his glory, in his
Essence and inmost operations, we cannot, and live. And
they who will attempt it with those <hi>Bethshemites</hi> that
would needs pry into the Ark, shall assuedly die. Such
aspiring Spirits, that with the bold Schoolmen, do pierce
into the hidden secrets of Divinity, what do they but
like foolish flyes, flutter about the light, till they are at
length singed with the flame? For <hi>qui scrutatur ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestatem
opprimetur à gloria,</hi> he that searcheth into the
majesty of God shall assuredly be opprest with his glory.
And therefore it is <hi>docta ignorantia,</hi> a learned ignorance,
as St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath it, not to know what may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
and it were much better piously to profess it
than rashly to arrogate science: For that may deserve
pardon, but this shall never want punishment, saith the
same Father, <hi>Serm. 15.</hi> For which reason well said the
great St. <hi>Basil</hi> of this high Point when he came to treat
of it, <hi>mysterium hoc silentio potiùs quàm oratione co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendum,</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:46181:173"/>
it is a mystery to be adored in silence not exprest
by words. <hi>Homil. de. Nat. Domini.</hi> The Prophet
<hi>Esay</hi> himself was not able to do it, and which is more, he
knew that none else could. And therefore <hi>quis enarrabit</hi>
who shall declare it? for his Interrogation hath the force
of a Negation, who shall? that is, none can, <hi>who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, &amp;c.</hi> There is indeed in it self, nothing so light
and clear and evident as this Divine generation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>light of light, and very God of very God, is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and begotten:</hi> but withal unto us, nothing more
hidden, secret and obscure. Not that there is any obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in God, <hi>in quo tenebrae non sunt ullae,</hi> in whom there
is no darkness, saith the Scripture: but that he dwells in
unaccessible light, and is cloathed with Majesty inapproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as with a garment; <hi>aciem oculorum vincens, non
solùm hominum sed etiam Angelorum,</hi> darking and
blinding the sight both of men and Angels. And therefore
how is it possible to behold the light of his generation,
who is the brightness and very splendor of his Fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
<hi>mens deficit, vox silet, non mea tantùm sed etiam
Angelorum,</hi> the eye of the mind fails, and the tongue of
every Creature becomes mute and dumb, not mine alone,
saith St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lessed Angels also. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Quis enarrabit?</hi> Before ever the world was, or any
foundation of it laid, <hi>Ibi non tempus, non seculum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessit,
nemo spectator adsuit,</hi> when as yet, saith St.
<hi>Basil,</hi> neither time nor age was formed, nor any spectator
by, to witness or report it: but God alone injoying and
embracing himself from all eternity in himself and of
himself he begot his only Son, who is none other but
himself: no other God though another person. And <hi>who
then shall declare?</hi> Again, the Father begets a Son, and
yet the Son is not younger than the Father; nor the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any antienter than the Son: he begets him by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
his Essence unto him, and he communicates not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46181:173"/>
any part, for it is indivisible, but his whole and intire Essence
unto his Son, and yet parts with none himself, who hath
heard or may conceive such things? <hi>who therefore shall
declare?</hi> Yet once more: the Son of God is perfect and
compleat within himself and so hath been from everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
intire and wanting nothing, and yet, which is strange,
as continually produced and begotten: for not as in the
beginning God made the Heavens, so in the beginning he
begot his Son; who in the beginning both was and was
begotten: the Heaven was made once, but the Son is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
for ever, <hi>and who, &amp;c.</hi> Lastly, to omit many
things, the eternal word is truly the Son of God, and is
truly born of him; and yet notwithstanding hath no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that ever bare him, but (which hath most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
is begotten only with a look, by mere aspect and
intuition, as the Fathers speak and the Scriptures inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and therefore <hi>who shall declare?</hi> These and many
other the like high and inexplicable mysteries of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
generation the Apostle seems not to express but to
shadow as well as he might, when he terms him the
brightness of his Fathers glory and the express image of
his Person, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 3. For though these words cannot
reach home to the thing; yet others more apt and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
may not be found. For brightness is ever coeval
with the thing that is bright; if bright in it self: the
brightness of the Sun is neither before nor after; but
fully as ancient as that Sun that begat it: and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
it, as it doth not cease still to beget it. For it is not
produced once for all, but is generated perpetually; and
generated not of two, but of one only; who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
it to other things, and yet lose none of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Excellently therefore the <hi>brightness of his glory;</hi>
and as fully the <hi>express image of his person,</hi> to shew as
far as may be shown the manner of his generation by
sight and intuition. For the images which we behold
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46181:174"/>
when we look on our selves in a glass, are of all others
the most exact and perfect. Now God himself is his
own mirrour; wherein beholding and comprehending
himself, he produceth the most express and absolute image
of himself. So that the Divine intellect of the Father
reflecting inwards and fully conceiving his own perfection,
doth at once both conceive and bring forth his own and
only Son; the substantial and essential picture of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And therefore no thought here, of Mother or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
nor imperfection or inquination; but he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
after a pure, clean, chast, high and sublime manner:
as the beam from the Sun, as the image from the glass, as
being the brightness of his Fathers glory and the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Character of his person. Though neither of these
can fully express it; for it is wonderful, and therefore to
our ears cannot be uttered: it is singular, and therefore
hath no example: for how should the imperfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
every way square with the absolute perfection of
the Creatour? And therefore let us adore in Soul and
believe it in heart; but lay our hand on our lips and not
think to utter it in words: whereof when we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
yea and thought all that we can, we must shut up all
with the Prophets Admiration, <hi>who shall declare?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this shall suffice for the non-declaration of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
birth and generation, we now pass on to his humane
the subject of this days Solemnity, and therefore the chief
theam of this hours discourse, but a theam every way beset
also with so many Pearls of highest admiration, as we may
well say of it as of the other, <hi>Quis enarrabit?</hi> Nay in
some things it may seem something stranger than his other
generation. For that God should be born of God, though
we can no way apprehend it, yet in reason it carries some
Correspondence and proportion: But that God should
be born again, and born of a woman, hath such an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
disparity, that unless it had been foreshewn by such
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46181:174"/>
illustrious prophecies and confirmed by so many and great
miracles, it had exceeded not only reason but even all belief.
Well therefore did S.<hi>Paul</hi> term it a mystery and a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
and great too without controversie, <hi>without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
great is the mystery of Godliness, God manifested in
the flesh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. God in the flesh, a great mystery indeed!
yea how many great mysteries are there in it! The Antient
of days is become a swadled Child; and he who was the Son
of God without a Mother, now made the Son of a woman
without a Father; a woman that is at once both a Mother
and a Maid; conceiving and bearing a Son, and yet a Virgin
in and after both conception and birth. Nay more, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of her own Maker, and so the daughter of her Son: as
he the Son of his own daughter. No marvel therefore that
at this admirable birth of his, he had marvail and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it self given him for his name; for his first, <hi>To us a
Child is born and to us a Son is given, the principality
shall be upon his shoulders, and you shall call his name
Wonderful, Isa.</hi> ix. wonderful, and full of wonders, as in
other things so especially in his birth and generation, and
therefore, <hi>Quis enarrabit?</hi> Wise <hi>Solomon</hi> having with
all his skill and diligence searched into the depths and
profundities of Nature, after all his travel could find out
no new thing under the Sun; but that you may know a
greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> is here, our Saviour this day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with himself brought many new things, you see,
into the world, which the Sun never saw before, nor
ever shall see again: A new birth, new man, new person,
new Heavens, new Earth, a new Creation; for all had
need of renewing, and all things in him are made new,
<hi>Ecce nova jam facta sunt omnia,</hi> behold all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
new, saith the Apostle. All things, but wretched
men, that regarding it not grew old in their Sins, but
shall receive a punishment hereafter that shall never grow
old in it self, because it shall never be ended. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46181:175"/>
               <hi>Quis?</hi> Yet that we may declare it as far as we can,
or at least declare how far it is above all declaration, we
will in their order briefly touch upon these circumstances
of his birth and generation: Who it is that is born, of
whom, and in what manner, and where he was born:
For there is newness and strangeness in them all not fully
to be declarable. And <hi>first,</hi> who or what he is that is born?
And what is he, an ordinary man as we our selves are,
one of the rout, one of the vulgar? A Man indeed he
was, and when he was at the lowest and worst, <hi>Pilate</hi>
could term him so: <hi>ecce homo,</hi> behold the Man: but yet
no ordinary Man, he was a King too, and a King born;
<hi>where is he that is born king of the Jews?</hi> say the
Wisemen of the East. Nay no petty King, no King of
the Jews alone; he shall have the <hi>Nations too for his
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
his possessions,</hi> saith God in the Psalm. And therefore
an universal Monarch. And yet higher, for <hi>I will make
him my first-born, higher than the Kings of the earth;</hi>
higher indeed, even the high God that is King both of
Heaven and Earth; and therefore his name shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Wonderful and mighty counsellor, and Deus fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,
the strong God, pater aeternus, the everlasting Father,</hi>
saith my Prophet in the place but now quoted. And it
is worth the observing in the beginning of the verse, <hi>A
child is born and a son is given:</hi> towards the end this
weak child is the <hi>mighty God,</hi> this young Son is the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Father;</hi> for the Son of God is our Father, and
this Father now became the Son of Man and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
our Brother. The Antient of days that sate on the
throne in the 7. of <hi>Dan.</hi> whose garment was white as
snow, and the hairs of his head as pure wooll, to shadow
his eternity, who hath neither beginning of days nor end
of life; This is he that is this day born a young and
tender child, even that mighty and Almighty God now a
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46181:175"/>
weak and swadled Infant. This sure is new and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
rightly therefore still do his titles begin with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
whose person and birth may well be admired, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expressed, for <hi>Quis enarrabit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet this is not all the wonder that is in him:
strange and very strange it is, that he should be the Son
of Man and Mans everlasting Father; that is, God and
Man: but yet it is another new thing and little less strange,
that this God should be perfect Man. and yet have no
Humane Person. A Humane Nature he had, but a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Person he had not. And therefore <hi>non solum actus
est novus, sed is qui nascitur est homo novus,</hi> it is not
only a new birth, but he that is born is a new kind of
Man; the like whereof was never known, having a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, but a Divine Person. <hi>Nestorius</hi> indeed
after the manner of other Hereticks, not content to
leave this mystery unto his Faith, but seeking to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it with his reason, was so blinded with gazing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a light too strong for his eyes, as he would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the thing, because his weakness could not conceive
who it should be; how a Humane Nature should be and
subsist without a created and Humane Person: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he impiously formed unto himself a double Person in
Christ, and so in effect two Christs, one that had a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
another that had a Divine, both Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
a great errour and pernicious: For were it so, were
they not several Natures, but two distinct persons, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
or passions of the one could not properly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the other since the one is not the other. Christ
the God could not be Man; and Christ the Man could
not be God: but one God alone, the other Man alone:
and so neither could have redeemed the world; for God
could not suffer, nor Man satisfy. Christ Jesus therefore
our blessed Lord is but one; one substance and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis
that hath two Natures Divine and Humane; both
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46181:176"/>
knit and united in one and the self-same Person, and
therefore justly and truly may be said to be, and is, both God
and Man: and because Man, could die; because God, could
add an infinite price unto his death, and so reconcile both
God and Man. But you will say, how is it possible that a
Humane Nature should subsist in a person and hypostasis
not her own, who may conceive, who can apprehend it?
neither do I say you should, but that you should believe
it. Had we reason to demonstrate it, it were not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful;
had we example, it were not singular: But now
when besides and above the whole order of created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a new Man and after a new manner with so great a
miracle is born and brought forth, having a created and
Humane Nature subsisting in a Divine and uncreated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
we may truly say <hi>quis enarrabit?</hi> And this for the
person, who or what he is that is born.</p>
            <p>Now if we shall remove our consideration unto her of
whom he was born, peradventure we shall find neither
less nor fewer marvels and miracles in this, than in that
other. For certainly that God should become Man is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much; but that he should be born of a Woman is yet
much more. For he might have created a Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of the Earth, as he did the first Man, and had
it pleased him, assumed it in an instant: and therefore
needed not have lain nine months in the womb after
that manner as we shame to imagine, and is altogether
unfit we should speak: there is horror in the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of it, and therefore well saith the Hymn, <hi>thou didst
not abhor the Virgins womb,</hi> This would be very strange
indeed could we apprehend the infinite Majesty of that
God who was pleased for our sakes to descend so low.
That that sublime and excellent glory, in presence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the holy Angels themselves cover their faces with their
wings; that Almighty Lord which sate on the circle of
the Heavens, and in comparison of whom the inhabitants
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46181:176"/>
of the Earth are but as Grashoppers, and all the Nations
of the World but as the dropping of a bucket: that such
and so great a God, for our good, and that we might
have nearer affinity with him, should disrobe himself of
all his honour, and be wrapped in films and skins instead
of a Garment; leave that circle of the Heavens and cast
himself into the Dungeon of the womb, not abhorring
that dark place, which we our selves abhor but to think
on: Astonishment may well seise the mind that shall truly
meditate on it. If it do not kindle your affection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
it cannot at the least but raise up admiration;
enforcing us to cry out with the Prophet, <hi>Quis enarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is this all the strangeness, that God was born
of a Woman, who by this means was advanced into a
strange affinity with her Maker, becoming at once both
the Mother of her Father and Daughter of her own Son: It
is strange too and a miracle in Nature that he was born
of none but a Woman, that he who before had a Father
and no Mother, should now have a Mother and no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Three sorts of Generation or rather Production,
had passed before: The first, without Man or Woman,
so <hi>Adam.</hi> The second, of Man without Woman, so <hi>Eve.</hi>
The third of both Man and Woman, so we all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.
But now to make all compleat and never till now,
the fourth is added, of a Woman without a Man; that so
a Fatherless Son, and a Virgin Mother might double the
wonder: this is it which my Prophet intimates in the
first entrance of this Chapter, <hi>he shall grow up as a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
plant and as a root out of a dry ground:</hi> as a root
springing of its own accord from that virgin earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till'd,
unsown, and unmanured by the hand of Man: So
sprang he from the maiden loins of his Mother, and had
no Mans assistance living for a Father, <hi>who then shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:46181:177"/>And as he was begotten without a Father: so (that
we may touch upon the manner) was he born, as it is
likely, without pain or hurt unto his Mother. It is true
a punishment it was, and from the beginning, and from
the beginning until now hath it ever prevailed, all Women
naturally bringing forth in sorrow. But our Saviour was
no natural Man: All things in him you see are miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and supernatural. And why not this in his birth as
well as so many things else? why not born without sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
as well as conceived without pleasure? It is the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of a Father, <hi>Ubi voluptas partum non antecessit,
ne<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>

conception suffered rightly as little pain in the birth,
saith <hi>Greg. Nyss. orat. de Christi resurrect. Nec in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione

unstained in her conception, and unpained in her partu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition,
saith St. <hi>Austin, Serm.</hi> 14 <hi>de Nativ.</hi> and in my
understanding, rightly; for what labour or sorrow could
he bring in his birth, that left her a perfect Virgin, that
bare him? And therefore in this regard also, <hi>who shall
declare, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So many wonders are there in his birth, and yet it is
not a much less wonder he made choice of such a place
to manifest all these wonders in. In <hi>Bethlem</hi> an obscure
and little Village, in a poor and mean Inn of that Village,
in the meanest and basest place of that Inn, the Stable.
This was the great Chamber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the stately Mansion hung
with Arras weaved by Spiders, and paved with the filth
of other Beasts; wherein this great Monarch, the mighty
King of Glory, was pleased to be born, and together with
himself to produce so many miracles into the World:
The very place, wherein he had only littier for a Bed, a
Manger for his Cradle, an Oxe and an Ass for his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
being as great a miracle as the rest. And as the
basest place, so did he make choice of the obscurest time:
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46181:177"/>
A time indeed famous for an universal peace spread upon
the face of the Earth, but in it he picked out the lowest
and utmost extremities time hath; the last age of the
world, the lowest period of the year, the deepest and
darkest point of the night. And so in both regards, <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè
recubuit in novissimo loco,</hi> he truly sate him down
in the nethermost room; and at his first entrance into
the world, trod the world and all worldly pomp and
glory under foot: that his very birth might preach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
both of it, and all the vanities it hath, unto sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Man, for whole sakes he vouchsafed not to abhor, I
say not now, the Virgins womb, but the durty cratch
and filth of the Stable. And in either respect, <hi>who shall
declare, &amp;c.</hi> or who shall declare the infinite love he
shewed in it unto miserable Men, for whose advancement
the King of Glory was pleased to abase himself so low?
Surely as the great <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Morals, <hi>Deo tantò ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gìs
homo debitor fuit, quantò pro illo Deus etiam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digna

with St. <hi>Bernard, quantò pro me vilior, tantò mihi cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,</hi>
by how much the viler he hath made himself for
me, the dearer ever shall he be unto me. Thus every
circumstance of his production is wonderful, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but declare how every way undeclarable his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is. But yet, that we may more perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, from
the circumstances to the substance and effects of this
mighty work. And indeed in these regards, who shall
declare his generation? For it is the best and greatest,
and wisest work the Almighty ever wrought, and doth
more fully manifest his infinite power, wisdom, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yea and justice too, than all the rest of his creatures,
or all the rest of his operations in them. First then for
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46181:178"/>
the <hi>power</hi> and omnipotence of God, how unutterably is
it here shown more than in any, or all other things else?
the Incarnation of God being a greater work than the
Creation of the whole World. He made indeed at the
beginning Men and Beasts, Plants and Elements, Sun
and Moon, Heavens, Stars, and Angels, excellent works
and wonders of his power: but yet when the <hi>word was
made flesh,</hi> he made and wrought a greater wonder than
them all. Much power was shown in knitting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining
jarring and discordant Elements peaceably in one
body: more in the conjunction personal of this material
body with an immaterial spirit; but incomparably most
of all in the hypostatical union of created Body and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
with the uncreated divinity of the Godhead it self.
For howbeit to make Man of dust, and dust of nothing
argues an infinite power; yet that infinite is much more
conspicuous when this Man is made God, and that God
which made him, made Man himself. And the reason is,
because that in making of Man, or any other creature
the infinity of power is not manifested in the effect, which
cannot be but finite because created; but in the manner
of creating it of nothing, and the ability every of creating
it, of some other greater and more excellent. So God
might have made a larger world than this, and creatures
of other kinds, and in every kind of richer essence and
higher perfections: And when he had done so, might do
so again and again, yea and after that might yet still
and perpetually do so. For an effect of finite and limited
perfection, may be infinitely multiplied by an omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
power, but can never grow infinite in it self; and
because it cannot grow infinite, is infinitely capable of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perfection. But here the infinity of power is not
only in the manner of working, but discernable after a
sort in the work it self. And God hath now produced
an effect even commensurable with his power, and unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46181:178"/>
of farther perfection substantial, an effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
nothing can be added that may advance it higher,
or make it greater; silly Man being made and become
the great God, whom all other both Men and Angels
must worship for ever. So here is in a manner an infinite
effect, and so the expression, as firm as may be, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
power; not that the humanity is infinite, for then
it should be the divinity, but that both are so united as
they make but one person, which is infinite. From whence
it follows, that as Christ the God, is truly Man: so Christ
the Man, is truly God: and therefore to be adored, both
God and Man. And what more infinite production of
an infinite power is there imaginable than the making of
a creature so one, (as he is, and is to be adored as one)
with the Creator blessed for evermore? For who then
shall declare the <hi>power</hi> of his conception? Secondly, the
<hi>wisdom</hi> of the Almighty, which though like his mercy
it be over all his works; is yet more conspicuous here
and shines brighter, than in the Sun or any other opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his hands, had we eyes to discern, or wisdom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of our own to behold it. For <hi>in him are hid all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,</hi> saith the Apostle.
The treasures, that is, the wealth and riches, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the Divine Wisdom, are all in him; but like
veins and mines they are hid in him, in him are hid <hi>all
the treasures,</hi> and we cannot fully discern them now:
yet unless we be stark blind we may discern enough for
our satisfaction. He is the eternal wisdom of the Father:
and indeed none but the Fathers wisdom could have
found out a way to shew mercy unto Man, and yet give
full satisfaction unto his own justice. For Justice and
Mercy, (Man offending) were, as it were, at variance,
either pretending who should have him. Justice demands
him, to be given to her for revenge: Mercy opposeth
and with all her might pretends for a pardon: both strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46181:179"/>
in the bowels of the Almighty, that dearly affects
both. Justice proposeth but few, only two arguments:
but they are powerful. The <hi>first</hi> urgeth the Almighty
with his own verity and truth. Thou hast spoken the
word, <hi>the day that thou eatest thou shalt die the death:</hi>
And with thee there is no shadow of change, therefore
thou must not alter the thing that is gone out of thy lips.
The <hi>second,</hi> with a precedent drawn from his former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
The Angels sinned, and thou didst not spare
them; why, be alike then unto all. For why shouldest
thou afford earthly men that favour which thou deniedst
unto Celestial Spirits, of far more excellent Nature? But
now Mercy on the other side cries out pitifully with that
cry in the Psalm, <hi>wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?</hi> what though thou hast said the word, it was
but the word of legislation, and thou art Lord of the
Law, the supream Lawgiver, and therefore maist dispense
with the Law, which thou givest, and in doing so thou
dost but remit thine own right, thou wrongest none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which therefore is without all wrong to thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
And for the Angels, they were but some of them,
not all the Angels that sinned, and they sinned willingly
and wilfully, of their own accord and without a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
their sin remaining in themselves not propagated to
others, and therefore they perished worthily in thy
wrath, and I made no intercession for them. But Man
was deceived and seduced by the subtlety of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
his sin besides not cleaving to himself alone, but
passing forth upon all his posterity that pass from him.
And shall the whole generation and kind, who sinned
not of their own will but by being in his loins, be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
destroyed, for one and that anothers transgression?
It is sufficient that Justice hath triumphed in those evil
Spirits, let me have my victory now in these: Good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
there should be some regard had of me, as well as of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46181:179"/>
her: she is thy Daughter indeed, yet she is but thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-in-law,
I am thy natural: it is thy nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to have Mercy and compassion. Thus these two, the
very favourites and darlings of the Divinity, contend
together, and who or what wit shall decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy;
or give both content when they have contrary
demands? Herein then shines the infinite wisdom of God
that in so difficult a case, and perplext (as <hi>Damascen</hi> terms
it) could discover a way, find out an issue, that should
give full satisfaction unto either: and not only so, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the glory of the rest of his Attributes; of his power,
wisdom, goodness and all, and all at once, and in one
action; by informing a piece of our clay and contriving
himself, and his whole Divinity into a trunk of Earth,
that so one person might be made of both. A person on
whom Justice might take her full revenge; that Mercy
afterwards might be shown unto the offender: that so
both death might be inflicted (as the one urged) and a
pardon granted (as the other intreated.) For being Man
he could die, and being God his temporary death could
satisfy for an eternal: And being God and Man he could
dye, and with conquest, (having satiated revenge) rise
again from the dead, and proclaim life and grace unto
the whole world. So by the infinite wisdom of this work
all strife ends, and both are well pleased: Mercy and
Truth are met together, Righteousness and Peace do kiss
each other. Yea so great is the wisdom of it, that the
blessed Angels themselves desire to pry into it profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Sure it exceeds the natural understanding of the
wise and subtle <hi>Lucifer</hi> himself; who for all his wit and
cunning was clearly deceived, and foil'd in this mystery
whereby he was drawn on to bite at that heel which he
little dreamt would crush his head, even whilst he bit it:
For supposing to swallow the humanity which he saw, he
was suddenly choaked with the divinity which he could
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46181:180"/>
not comprehend. So wisely God by Man restored Man,
and vanquisht Satan in theself-same nature he had conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before. And therefore who shall declare the wisdom
of his generation?</p>
            <p>But above all either power or wisdom, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
love and goodness of the Lord in this act shown unto
the whole world, especially unto wretched Man, may
well drink up admiration and confound the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of both Man and Angel. For what an astonishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
would it be, could we consider it as it deserves,
that such vile worms and wretches as we, should receive
such high and undeserved favour from that God whom
we had so grievously offended, and having offended, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
notwithstanding so much as sought or regarded?
That he for all this should seek us, yea and assume our
nature and become as one of us, that he might the better
find us? That instead of hurling such rebellious sinners
into the depth of Hell, as they well deserved, he descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his own glory in the highest Heavens and took
on him the infirmity and baseness of our earth, that he
might carry it thither, and into that glory from whence he
descended? O the infinite goodness of this God to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the wretchedness of Man, that Man might be
assumed to the blessedness of God, that sinful Man to
the blessedness of that God against whom he sinned, and
delighted only to sin! <hi>O Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David, what is
man that thou didst so regard him, or the son of man
that thou didst so visit him?</hi> Surely, <hi>homo est res ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hili,</hi>
Man is a thing of nought, of no worth, no value;
yet such the eternal Son of God vouchsafed to become,
that he might advance this thing of nought far above all
Principalities and Powers, and Crown him with Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Glory. Neither did he by this act glorify that
particular humanity alone which he assumed, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
shall redound, though not in that manner nor yet
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46181:180"/>
so fully, yet in a marvellous degree unto all others that
shall but glorify him; for in him they shall be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
too, even of the Divine Nature, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>1. 4. He
was anointed indeed with the Oyl of gladness <hi>above
his fellows;</hi> not alone then anointed, but above and
more abundantly than any others. As that precious
Oyntment which was poured forth on <hi>Aarons</hi> head,
so Divine honours and graces by this union descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon His; which it most plentifully drenched: but
drencht not it alone (for of his fulness we have all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
and therefore it trickles down upon his beard, and
all men living that shall adhere unto him; and not so
only, but from thence drops on the very skirts of his ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even the rest of the Creatures, who have all some
interest in his body and therefore in his glory.</p>
            <p>Whereby we are given to consider not only the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but the large extent of the Almighty's, goodness in this
Act of his Incarnation. For <hi>bonum est sui diffusivum,</hi>
goodness is diffusive, and loves to communicate it self, and
that of God the supream good most of all other: And
indeed whatsoever we every where see, whatsoever any
where is or hath any being, it is nothing else but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of the Divine goodness from whence they
have all that they have whatsoever they are. But now
in this mystery God did communicate a new goodness,
and a greater than ever before; not only unto man, but
in a sort unto all his Creatures: which all have some
title in his person, and shall in their time receive a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
from it: for man as he was <hi>Supremum Creationis
colophon,</hi> the last and supream work of the Creation;
so was he the sum and recapitulation of all that was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
before him: and all that was so created was but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spiritual as the Angels, or corporeal as the rest of the
world: and in man who hath a material body with the
one, and an immaterial Soul sutable to the other, both were
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46181:181"/>
bound up together in one Creature. A Creature which
hath being with the Elements whereof he is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
life and vegetation with plants; sense with beasts;
reason and spiritual existence with the Angels; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a little but compleat world within himself, <hi>Nexus
&amp; vinculum totius creaturae,</hi> the very knot and band
that holds together the whole Creation. And therefore
the whole world being united in man and man unto God,
every Creature of the world cannot but have some inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the union, who have a part in the Nature that
was united. Had he assumed the nature of Angels, the rest
of his works that are corporeal had been excluded.
Had he taken unto him a Celestial body and made his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
in the Sun, the Creatures that have life and
sense had lain unregarded: and should any of these have
been honoured with it, those that are intelligent and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
men and Angels, had been left out under contempt
for ever. Man therefore was the only creature in whom he
could interest and honour all the rest, as being both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
and spiritual, and having in him being, life, sense, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
and whatsoever the rest have and are. And mansna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
therefore he only assumed, <hi>ut dum una assumitur in
qua reliquarum gradus continentur; in una reliquae
omnes quoad suos gradus assumerentur.</hi> That so assuming
the one wherein the degrees of all the rest were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
all the rest in that one, according to their degrees
might be assumed. Wherefore that Cardinal Schoolman
<hi>Cajetan</hi> said not amiss, <hi>Incarnatio est elevatio totius
universi in divinam personam,</hi> the Incarnation is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
of the whole Universe into the Divine Person.
Since by it man, in whom all things are knit together, is
himself knit and united unto God; that, as man is all in
one, so God might be all in all. And all from God receive
not only elevation and honour, but blessing and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46181:181"/>
the head both of men and Angels; to them a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server,
to us a Redeemer, and not unto us only but unto
all other Creatures that were made for our use, and become
subject unto vanity through our sin: that as they suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by mans transgression, so in man they might partake
of mans Redemption. And therefore the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> travaileth in pain together with us, and
together with us shall be delivered into the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the sons of God; and therefore waiteth until
they shall be revealed. For which reason our blessed Lord
fully is, as he is termed, <hi>Saelvator mundi</hi> the Saviour not
of man alone but of the whole aspectable world and
whatsoever is in it. <hi>Thy truth reacheth unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
(saith <hi>David</hi> of him) <hi>and thy faithfulness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Clouds; how excellent is thy name in all the
World! thou Lord shalt save both man and beast:</hi> and
what name is that which is so excellent in all the world,
but the name of a Saviour? thou Lord shalt save both
man and beast. And therefore the prophet <hi>Esay</hi> calls unto
Heaven and Earth, the Forest and all the Trees that are
in it, that is the whole world and whatsoever dwelleth
therein, to sing and rejoyce together for this Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Sing O Heavens, for the Lord hath done it: shout
ye lower parts of the Earth, break forth into singing ye
Mountains, O Forest and every Tree therein; for the
Lord hath redeemed Jacob and glorified himself in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
Esay</hi> xliv. 22. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the reason
(which is the same we have hitherto given) because in
this Redeemer all things in Heaven and Earth were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<hi>and gathered together in one even in Christ, Eph.</hi>
x. 10. And not only gathered and collected, but restored
in him and renewed: For <hi>nova jam facta sunt omnia,</hi>
all things are now made new, saith the same Apostle. Most
worthily therefore at the name of Jesus, the knee of every
Creature, both in Heaven and Earth and under the Earth
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46181:182"/>
is injoyned to bow and give glory; as being by that name
glorified in a sort, and restored to more excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
So great, so universal is the goodness declared in
this Act: Yet this is not all. But as it is great unto man,
and universal unto the Creature: so is it the highest
Communication of goodness in it self, and the best demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the intrinsick goodness of the Creator: the
highest in it self, because in this he communicates himself,
which is not goodness, but goodness it self. Besides this
there are but three degrees of communication, Nature,
Grace and Glory: but this fourth of hypostatical union, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
exceeds them all: on which all acknowledge their
dependance; for it restores Nature, gives Grace, purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Glory. Nature indeed and natural properties are
a great communication of Gods goodness unto natural
things: supernatural Grace unto the Soul of man in this
life a greater: Divine glory unto body and Soul in the
life to come greatest of all: yet the best goes not farther
than a Created quality; for though being glorified, we shall
see God, see his Essence and be blessed in seeing it, yet we
shall see it but <hi>per speciem,</hi> by a Divine indeed but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
light: but in this of Incarnation he doth not exhibit any
shews or similitudes, he doth not bestow any created gift,
whether of natural or supernatural order; but he gives
and bestows himself immediately unto his Creature: who
doth as immediately see and injoy him in himself, being
the self-same Person with him: a communication of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
wonderful above all other, and not to be conceived,
had it not been revealed. And as the highest in it self, so is
it the greatest demonstration of the intrinsick goodness,
that is, holiness of the Lord that vouchsafed it. For if
the detestation of evil be an argument of goodness, how
full of goodness is he, who, that we might know how utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he hates and abhors all sin and wickeness, rather than it
should escape unrevenged, would incarnate the Divinity
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:46181:182"/>
it self, that so he might punish it and severely too, even in
his own Son? which doth not only manifest his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but his Justice also, and together with both the
greatness and grievousness of our sins. How far were
our Souls gone, and how deadly our Iniquities that must
either draw God from Heaven, yea dragg him to the
Cross, or plunge us in an everlasting Hell? And unto that
our blessed Lord vouchsafed to be brought, that we might
be delivered from this—Who then shall declare, either
the heinous guilt of our sin, or the infinite power, the
manifest wisdom, or infinite both goodness and justice
declared in his generations? Especially his goodness unto
us miserable sinners, which we must ever especially think
on, but never hope to utter? O what mind, what speech
shall utter, say or conceive the great honour he hath this
day done unto our nature? how many and marvellous
benefits he hath in it confer'd on our persons? freeing
us from all that is evil, sin, sorrow, death and Hell, and
investing us with whatsoever is good, Grace, Joy, and
Glory everlasting in Heaven? Say we then all with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lergus,
Age O Christe Dei Verbum &amp; Sapientia,</hi> Well
then O dear Jesus, the word and wisdom of the Father,
what shall we poor miserable Creatures return unto thee
for all thy favours? <hi>Tuae enim omnia, &amp; à nobis nihil
cupis nisi salvari:</hi> for thou hast done all things for us,
and requirest nothing of us again, but that we would
suffer our selves to be saved; nay thou givest us salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and takest it kindly at our hands, yea, as a benefit
unto thy self, if we will but receive it. O infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness!
and that we may laud and praise and worship thee
worthily for it, add one more mercy unto all that is past:
and as thou wast pleased to be born in our nature; so
vouchsafe to be born again by thy holy Spirit in our
Persons, that we may once more say, <hi>Quis enarrabit,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:46181:183"/>So we pass unto our last point, from his <hi>Divine</hi> birth
of the Father and his <hi>Humane</hi> from the womb of the
blessed Virgin, unto his <hi>spiritual</hi> in the Souls of all the
faithful: For it is not enough that the Son of God was
born for us or in our nature, unless he be also born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us and in our particular spirits, by his grace: that so
as he was made the Son of Man by being united unto our
flesh, we might become the Sons of God by being united
again unto him in the spirit; By wihch spiritual union
and mystical, are conveyed and applyed unto us all the
benefits and graces purchased by the personal. And it is
not the meriting of Mercy but the actual conferring of it,
that must do us good; which is never fully done until
he that was born for us be reborn again in and within us;
till he live in our hearts by Faith, and his life revive in
our conversation; till his patience be stamped upon our
Spirits, and the rest of his Divine Vertues ingraven and
formed on our Souls. For so speaks St. <hi>Paul</hi> of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Generation, <hi>My little children, of whom. I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in birth again until Christ be formed in you.</hi> Gal.
iv. 19. And formed then he is in us, not before, when
we can shape and form our hearts in some good measure,
according to the pattern and precedent he hath left us,
truly saying with the same St. <hi>Paul, Vivo jam non ego, sed
Christus vivit in me,</hi> I live now, and yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me: A birth and formation so full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
and miracle, as we may no less say of it than of those
other, <hi>Quis enarrabit, &amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in the first indeed God is born of God: in the
second God is born of a Woman; but in the third, many
Men and Women at once both bear and are born of God:
because Gods formation in Man, is Mans reformation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the image of God: his generation in us, our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in him. And so by the same act in which God is
born in Man, in the self-same both act and instant. Man is
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46181:183"/>
born of God, as St. <hi>John</hi> speaks. And that by the insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and unsearchable working of the Spirit, which works
so secretly, as Man himself cannot observe and discern it,
though it work within himself and even in his own spirit.
The child is not more inobservably conceived in the
womb of the Mother, than Christ Jesus in the Soul of
the Christian. And therefore <hi>the kingdom of heaven
cometh not by observation,</hi> saith our Saviour: that it is
come, we find; but how it came, we perceive not: and
what we cannot discern, how should we express? who
then shall declare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is it more secret than strange and powerful;
there being nothing of greater admiration than the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
work of God in the conversion of a sinner. How
marvellous is it, that the hearts of wicked Men, that
were for so many years before, <hi>domicilia Daemonum,</hi> the
habitation of Devils, <hi>wherein the Foxes had holes, and
the fowls of the air their nests,</hi> that is deceipt and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
roosted, and with them Luxury and Avarice, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Wrath and Malice, Prophaneness, Falshood, and all
manner of filthiness, until it became a den of beasts, a
cage of unclean birds, and indeed a very Hell of impure
spirits; that such a Stable of filth, <hi>Augea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>'s Stable, should sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
be cleansed, and a Tenent of Grace, Jesus, as in that
of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> be born in it, in an instant? That so dark
vaults of lusts and uncleanness should presently be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into Temples of the Holy Ghost? That so impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and inthralled Souls should be indued with power
from above, and inspired with such an Almighty and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Faith, as is able in a moment to cast out all those
Devils? To teach the prophane to speak with a new
tongue, the wrathful and vindictive with patience to
suck up all the poysoned malice venemous stomachs can
disgorge against them, without hurt; and not only to
be good in themselves, but by laying their hands on the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46181:184"/>
sick, by their charitable works unto the distressed, not
only relieve them, but with their very example recover
others that were sick of sin unto death. Who can behold
such a change, such and so sudden a mutation, and not
say with <hi>David, This is the Lords doing and it is
marvellous in our eyes?</hi> Sure it is <hi>digitus Dei,</hi> the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God indeed, the very power of his Spirit; nay no
other than another incarnation, and spiritual birth of the
Son of God in such a Soul. And <hi>quis enarrabit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A generation performed with so secret and yet so
powerful an operation. Which yet we shall perceive the
better and receive too the sooner (for though it be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
all do not always receive it) if we be observant of
the circumstances of this spiritual, in the mind, which
for the quality of time, place and person doth much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
that other humane birth in the flesh. For as then
he was born in the night; so still is he usually begotten
in the nightly and silent meditations of the Soul. When
all things were in quiet silence, and the night in her
swift course, then the Almighty word left the Royal
Throne and leapt down from Heaven, saith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
in the book of Wisdom: And sure then especially
when all things are quiet and silent, when the works and
toils, cares and labours of the day are laid aside and the
Soul in sweet contemplation of the vanity of all her tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
under the Sun, then I say especially is Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
preparing the place for the Son of God: who
though he leave not Heaven and his throne there, yet
by his spirit doth he vouchsafe to descend and live and
dwell in this earth of ours for ever. And as in the deep
of night, so for the most part is he born still in the
depth of Winter. For in the Summer and sun-shine of
prosperity, we are all apt to forget God and regard but
little what he speaks unto us; but in the cold and bitter
storms of Winter when our Bark is tossed in a tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46181:184"/>
Sea of afflictions; then like other Mariners we can
quickly pour out vows, leave our canns and carouses,
and betake our selves to Supplication and Prayers; and can
attentively hearken also what the Lord God will say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our Souls. Only take heed of the 3d. circumstance
in this point: and though he came in the last age of the
world, yet be sure not to defer thy entertaining of him
till the last age of thy life. For however he be sometimes,
and it may be usually as yet born spiritually in that
point of Mans days, as he was then of the world; yet it
cannot be safe, yet it must be more than foolish to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
of it. For we well know how frail we are, and
God knows how suddenly we shall be swept away in our
sins; when we would give the whole world, if we
had it, for but one hour of that time we so foolishly
neglected, and may not have. Remember therefore thy
Creator in the days of thy youth before the eveil day come;
and give attentive consideration to the counsel of the
Wiseman, <hi>Defer not to do well, and put not off from
day to day, for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord
come forth and in security thou shalt be destroyed.</hi> But
<hi>lastly</hi> and above all, be most assured that as then, so he
will still be born in no other time but a time of peace.
Peace there was in the whole world when he was born
in it; and we must cease from wars and envies and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds,
and have peace every one with his Brother, or
he will never be born in us. It was the Song and Anthem
at his birth, sung by Angels, <hi>Glory be to God on high,
in earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> He is the great
peacemaker that came of purpose to establish an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
peace between God and Man: but on this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Man shall first be at peace with Man; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
not to expect it from God, of whom he may not so
much as beg mercy for his offences, but as himself remits
the trespasses of others. O take heed therefore, flatter
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46181:185"/>
not thy self, but search narrowly and be sure to strip all
wrath and revenge from thine heart, or be most assured
Christ will never dwell and inhabit there: who cannot
but hate the very place where such odious and hateful
sins make their abode. Sins that bind all the rest of our
iniquities on our Souls, yea make whatsoever else is good,
sinful unto us. Whereof so long as thou art guilty, thou
dost but curse thy self when thou prayest, and damn thy
own Soul when thou receivest. This for the <hi>time:</hi> see
now how well the other circumstances agree, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the <hi>place</hi> of his birth, and especially the person of
whom he was born. For born he was not of any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Woman at a venture, but of a pure and chast Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin:
and so will he still be both born and bred; in a
clean and unpolluted Soul. Into a defiled heart full of
noisom lusts and sordid affections he will not enter, they
must be first purged out, and all the stains and pollutions
of them washed away and cleansed in a bath of peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
tears; then he will descend thither, be born there,
and instead of those natural corruptions fill the place with
all divine and supernatural Graces: and so not find but
make the Soul a Virgin by being begotten in it: A Virgin
full of virtue which he will espouse and marry unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for ever. But yet of all virtues he most affects humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in her; the first and laft of virtues; the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and last consummation of whatsoever is virtuous. For
without it, the Soul is not capable of virtue; and had
she never so many would spoil all by growing proud of
the virtues which she hath. And therefore as he was
born of a Virgin, so would he be born in no other but
a Stable the meanest place and lowest in the house: to
shew us the condition of the mind, the humility and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of the spirit, where he still is, and ever will be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
brought forth. For as the covetous Soul is but a
Barn; the Epicure's a Kitchen; the Drunkard's a Cellar;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:46181:185"/>
the Ambitious a Chamber of State; so the low and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Stable may well signify the humble spirit; that both
is, and esteems it self a wretched sinner. Not then in the
Barn of Misers, nor in the Kitchin of Belly-gods: not in
the Cellar of Winebibbers, not in the great Chamber of
Pride and Prodigals; but in the despised Stable of humble
and dejected spirits, there is he, there will he and no
where else ever be born. And every Soul wherein he is
so born may be bold to say with the blessed Virgin that
first saw him; <hi>for thou regardest the lowliness of thy
hand-maiden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet humility is not more acceptable to him than
worldly cares and covetousness displeasing; than which
nothing can more hinder his conception and generation
in our Souls. For God and Mammon cannot dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And for this cause, as in a Stable, so he would be
born in an Inn: For an Inn is <hi>domus populi,</hi> free and
open unto all comers: and so must the Soul be where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he will be the second time born; free and generous;
holding nothing as it were in private, and proper to it
self, but open and ready to communicate all things to
those that want and are distressed, and no less freely than
the other for money. And the sooner because he knows
the world it self is but an Inn, where we do not inhabit
but lodge for a season: and who is so mad as to build and
plant, garnish and make great provision in an Inn? in his
passage and upon the way, being to depart ere long, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
the next morning? For here we have no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
place, no permanent City, but as strangers and
pilgrims, we look for one which hath a foundation. And
in such a Soul, which is in it self as an Inn, and esteems
the world for no other, and therefore void of all scrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and wretched desires, the Son of God is ever most
infallibly born, and will as certainly bear it where are
true riches and everlasting. Now these three, pleasure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46181:186"/>
and pride, that is, the flesh, the world and the Devil,
are the three heads whereunto all sins are reducible: and
as Christ cuts them all off in his birth, so must we cut
them off in our selves, or he will never be born in us.
Carnal pleasure must depart, he will be born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin:
Devilish pride abandoned, he is born in a Stable:
worldly cares and covetous desires utterly discharged, he
is born in an Inn. And when the Soul is thus prepared,
by being truly cleansed from all these, the time is at hand;
and then let him make hast and go up with confidence
unto <hi>Bethlem,</hi> for there he will be born, that is the last
and general place of his nativity, born in <hi>Bethlem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Bethlem</hi> is <hi>domus panis</hi> (so the name signifies)
the house of bread; and never so truly as now, when
the bread of life was born in it. And as then, so will be
still be born in <hi>Bethlem</hi> in the house of bread. Of bread
not corporal but spiritual; and such as can nourish the
Soul: and what house think you is that? surely <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
is nothing but <hi>Bethel;</hi> the house of bread, none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but the house of God. Where Men eat Angels food,
and that bread of life is freely dispensed; not only <hi>panis
verbi,</hi> but <hi>panis verbum,</hi> the bread of the word, but
the bread which is the word, the eternal word of God;
<hi>panis de Coelo,</hi> bread from Heaven, of which whosoever
eateth shall never die. And this is that house: <hi>&amp; ecce,</hi>
and behold there is that heavenly bread indeed, not so
much bread as the body of thy Redeemer, <hi>the bread
which we break is it not the Communion of the Lords
body?</hi> the Communion sure of his body and blood too:
of himself and all that he did or suffered, yea or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
either. For all are communicated in these; the
same <hi>Symbols</hi> of all, and Conduits by which all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to us. And therefore Christ Jesus himself is under

in this shape; that he might be at once both received in
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46181:186"/>
thy mouth and conceived in thy heart; conceived and
born; live and inhabit therefor ever. So justly was <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
the seat of his Nativity: and therefore as <hi>Jacob</hi> said
when he awoke out of sleep, in that place where some
suppose the Temple was afterwards built: <hi>how fearful,</hi>
saith he, <hi>is this place? the Lord was in it and I was
not aware: this is none other than the house of God and
the gate of heaven:</hi> if he said so of the Temple the
house of that bread, how much more justly may we say
of the bread of this house, How <hi>fearful is this bread?</hi>
the Lord is in it, and much more, especially than, in the
Temple; and wo unto them that are not aware of it,
that discern it not; for they do but eat damnation to
themselves, because they discern not the Lords body.
Take heed therefore above all things unto thy self when
thou comest to this fearful, twice fearful place, this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Temple; the Temple of his worship, and Temple of
his Body: and so, that thou make thy approach with due
regard and diligent preparation, with that deep sorrow
as becometh thy sins, that low reverence as becometh
thy Saviour. And so in the end think on the night where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was to be born, and betake thee to thy sweet and
silent meditations: consider the deep of Winter, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
thine afflictions: Look upon the days of peace, and
let go wrath: view the Stable, and down with thy pride:
see the Inn, and contemn the World: contemplate the
Virgin, and cleanse thy self from all pollutions of the flesh:
so shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty and thy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Soul; come up safely into <hi>Bethlem</hi> and take of the
bread of life freely, and with it the blessed Lord of life
himself: who will make thy spirit another spiritual <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
or house for this living bread; an habitation for this
living Lord, to be born and live in, so long as thou livest,
and give thee everlasting life, when thou canst live no
longer. Which God of his infinite mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom,

            <p>DO not marvel, the Text may be fitter than you
imagine, or I could have made choice of: for
it is not I, but another: it was not taken, but
given me. She that is now gone and at rest (and

the prison of whose blessed Soul lies here before
your eyes, as a spectacle of mortality, as a document of
the frailty of our humane condition, which I would, (if

you shall see how well it sorted with the one, and how
fully it is now accomplished in the other. But for this
you must stay a little. First therefore of her Theam, then
of her self, <hi>Bring my Soul, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole <hi>Psalm</hi> is a prayer of <hi>Davids,</hi> pursued by
<hi>Saul</hi> and shut up in a Cave as appears by the Title, but
whether that of <hi>Adullam</hi> in the xxii. of <hi>Samuel</hi> as <hi>Haimo</hi>
and <hi>Remigius;</hi> or else of the other of <hi>Engedi</hi> in the
xxiv. of the same book, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi>
suppose, is uncertain, nor is it material to enquire: In
one of them it was, and in this distress he flees unto the
Lord for sucour, in this whole <hi>Psalm;</hi> the sum and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of whose devout prayer you have in this last
verse, <hi>Bring my Soul, &amp;c.</hi> This is the Historical truth;
and the literal sence of the Text which ariseth from
thence is manifest. Deliver my Soul out of Prison: <hi>Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunca,</hi>
out of this Cave; and not so only, not out of the
Cave alone, for so he might have fallen into the hands of
<hi>Saul</hi> from whom it did secure him out of that danger and
deep distress wherewith he was environed on every side,
and wherewith he was inclosed, shut up and surrounded
as in a Prison. And out of this Prison <hi>Educ animam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem,
deliver, bring forth my Soul.</p>
            <p>But besides the literal; the holy Scripture (it cannot be
denied) especially the old Testament, and the Psalms more
than any else, doth every where abound with many other
both moral and mystical sences: for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it,
<hi>omnia contingebant illis in figura,</hi> all things happened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them under the Law in a figure; and are for examples
unto us on whom the ends of the world are come. Their
very Histories were Prophecies, and their actions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46181:188"/>
saith St.<hi>Austin:</hi> and as when words signify acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there ariseth the historical sence; so when those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
again are instead of words to signify other several ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
from thence doth emerge the mystical interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For which reason it is, that the Fathers and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Writers of our own and former ages have given unto
this place such variety of expositions; and that not by way
only of accommodation, but as the proper and intended
meaning of the Spirit, that endited it: justly taking that
for the Souls Prison which doth any way either natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or morally straiten or oppress the Soul, or restrain
the freedom and liberty of it in her operations. And
therefore every faithful Christian under what distress so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
whether of outward afflictions or inward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
sins, whether of bodily infirmities, or worldly
troubles and cares, whether meaning any or all and every
of them, he may truly say with <hi>David, Bring my Soul
è custodia,</hi> out of the inclosure and custody of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Prison: for though <hi>David</hi> peradventure did not
himself actually behold all those meanings when he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
yet the Holy Ghost which did dictate to him might
easily forethink, and intend unto more senses, than the
wits of men can, according to the analogy of faith, find
out or discover. And as this first part is something trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with diversity of Interpretations, so the latter part
is become much more difficult through variety of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</p>
            <p>Here it is, <hi>Which thing if thou shalt grant me, then
shall the Righteous resort unto my company,</hi> as if it
were promissory and votive. In the rest it seems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
assertory and positive, <hi>The Righteous shall compass
me about, for thou shalt deal bountifully with me, so</hi>
our new Translation. <hi>Then shall the Righteous come
about me, when thou hast been good or beneficial unto me:</hi>
so <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> render it. <hi>Me expectant Justi</hi>

                  </gap>ribuas mihi, The Righteous wait and expect
till thou dost reward me with deliverance,</hi> so the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
edition. Yet all seem to agree in this, that upon his
deliverance the Righteous shall compass him about, and
he either to them or they with him shall praise and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
the name of the Lord by whom he was delivered.
But this help these divers readings will afford us, it will
make the Text more appliable unto the several expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Antients have given us. So having opened the
passage and a little cleared the sence of the Text, we may
now go on without offence to the divisions of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we shall not need to labour much, it requires neither
Art nor Industry; Nature hath already done it to our
hands: It runs forth of its own accord into two Branches,
and no mans eye so weak but he may see them of himself,
<hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise. Prayer</hi> for deliverance; <hi>Praise</hi> and
thanksgiving, when he hath obtained it: in the one ye
may behold the <hi>devotion;</hi> in the other the <hi>gratitude</hi> of
his Soul. <hi>Deliver my Soul out of Prison:</hi> see the Prayer,
<hi>That I may give thanks unto thy name:</hi> see the Praise.
And yet you see not all of the praise neither: Praise his
name he may do in his own heart and within himself, and
that is but private praise: but this is not enough, he will
have it publick too: his good heart is already filled
but to think of his deliverance, and he presently medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
where he may vent it: and no where so well as in the
Ears of the righteous, who will soon flock about him to
rejoyce in his mercy, and gladly bear a part in his song
of thanksgiving; among them therefore he will pour it
forth, that the voyce of honour and praise, as from a
full Quire, may ascend into the Ears of the Lord his
deliverer. <hi>Which thing if thou wilt grant me, then,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because it will be more convenient for us to end
with the Prayer, we will begin first with this last, the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46181:189"/>
Praise, and it will agree well with the order of nature:
for indeed every Mans praise should be first in his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
before he offer to open his mouth in his prayer.
<hi>Offer unto God thanksgiving,</hi> saith <hi>David, and pay
thy vows unto the most High, and then call upon me in
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee;</hi> as if no
Man might expect deliverance in that day, the day of
trouble, unless he first resolve on and vow thanksgiving
unto the most High. And indeed thus far we can go with
the Prophet: we are all apt enough to promise and vow
many thankful returns unto the Lord when our Souls are
in sorrow, and his afflictions lie heavy upon us; but for
performing of these promises and paying of these vows
afterwards, there is the difficulty, and there we leave
him. Under our burthens and distresses, especially if
great and pressing, it is almost every Mans vow: O if the
Lord will but deliver me now, free me but this time,
we will do this and that and marvellous things then: but
the hand of the Lord is no sooner removed, the prison
of our afflictions broken up, and our Souls brought forth
in safety, but all is instantly forgotten, as if it had never
been. We are now well and at liberty, and have no need
we think of the Lord; when we have, he shall hear of us
again, in the mean time pay vows he that list; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for us to smile in our sleeves, as if we had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacht
the Lord and cheated him out of a deliverance
with fair language. But God will not fail to reach home
one time or other, unto such false hypocrisie: for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
they are and no better; and for such they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
and stiled by God himself, though they promised
nothing but what at that time they truly meant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
<hi>When God slew the Israelites,</hi> saith <hi>David, then
they returned and inquired early after God, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that God was their rock, and the high God
their redeemer;</hi> and no question but all this with
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46181:189"/>
true devotion: yet because upon the deliverance they
fell back like their forefathers, starting aside as a broken
bow, the Prophet presently subjoins, <hi>Nevertheless they
did but flatter with their lips and dissemble with their
double tongue, for their heart was not right in them,
neither were they stedfast in his Covenant:</hi> not stedfast,
and therefore in Gods account not right; but even dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers
in what they truly intended, because they falsly
forsook it. Hypocrites then they are, and with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
they shall have their portion. Consider therefore
faithfully what thy lips spake, when thy heart was in
trouble; and be sure that thy hand perform it when
thou art released. And yet if your lips spake nothing,
if you have no vow upon you, thanksgiving is due with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, pay that at least with cheerfulness. No such Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in the world, not the Hypocrite himself, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
Man; he that hath said Ungrateful, hath said all,
and the worst he can say. And therefoer above all things,
if there be no vows to pay, yet offer unto God thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;
next to that of a broken heart, it is the best sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
thou canst offer him. <hi>This shall please the Lord
better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofes,</hi> Psal.

the purpose: you may see him summon up, not only
righteous Men, (as here) but all the creatures of Heaven
and Earth, to bear a part with him: Angels, Sun, Moon,
Stars, Fire, Hail, Snow, Vapour, Storm and Tempest too,
praise ye the name of the Lord. And as yet not satisfied,
he calls for all the Instruments of Musick, Trumpets,
Psaltery, Harp, Timbrel, Cymbals, and the high tuned
Cymbals to express and set it forth the more solemnly.

How mightily doth this upbraid the dead and cold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of the present world! scarce a spark of this holy
fire to warm it, can now be found in one bosom of a
thousand: we think we have performed a worthy sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
if with a barren and a dry heart we can only say
with the Pharisee, I thank thee O Lord that thou hast
not made me like other men. Superficial we are and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46181:190"/>
in all our service, forward in nothing but to run
on the point of that curse of the Prophet, <hi>Cursed be he

reason is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or that it all things do not run according to
our desires, we are insensible of the goodness of God in
other matters, and seldom meditate on it thoroughly.
But had we apprehensive spirits, and could duly weigh
and seriously consider the mercies of God, not only to
Man in general, but every Man his special favours unto
himself in particular, a thousand ways, when a thousand
ways he deserved destruction, he would soon find his
breast straitned and too narrow for his swelling affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
till he breath them out in our Prophets double expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulation
of love, not only, <hi>Domine quid est Homo?
Lord what is Man that thou art so mindful of him?</hi> but
<hi>Domine quid sum ego, what am I, what is my Fathers
house that thou so regardest me?</hi> Let such meditations
blow on the little fire that lies raked up in our embers,
and they will soon kindle into a flame, wherein our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
may ascend into Heaven like that Angel which
went up playing in the flames of <hi>Manoabs</hi> sacrifice,
<hi>Judg.</hi> xiii. And this shall suffice for this part, for the thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
the Prophet promiseth, both private and publick,
within himself and in the resort and company of the
Righteous. I now leave his praise and come to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<hi>Bring my soul out of prison O Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being in prison, in streights and pressures, what
should a good Soul do but pray? <hi>If any man be merry
let him sing, if he be afflicted, let him pray,</hi> saith St.<hi>James.</hi>
For prayer it is the Souls Herald sent forth in extremity
to parly and intreat for comfort. And as nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
our distress better than prayer, so nothing can again
assist our prayer better than distresses. They inflame our
zeal, and set an edge upon our devotions: the cries of
our own will are weak and feeble, as cooled with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46181:191"/>
in respect of those which grief doth utter. Sorrow
is ingenious to pray; and in an instant formeth the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
tongues to an holy eloquence; and furnisheth them
with sighs and groans which cannot be expressed. And
sure those are the best and most piercing prayers of all
other, <hi>fidelis oratio plus gemitibus constat quàm ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monibus,
plus fletu quàm afflatu:</hi> faithful prayers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
consist rather of Tears and silent groans than many
words. And such a prayer is this to speak on, it is but
a groan, very short but very pithy: few words, but fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and full of substance, including in it, (as an abstract
of all prayer) whatsoever conditions may seem necessary
to a holy and devout supplication, if you consider the
object, the manner and the matter of it. The object <hi>the
Lord,</hi> so some Texts have it here, but it is evident in
the former verses, I cried unto the Lord. The manner
vehement, by way of crying out, as himself in the same
Psalm testifies, <hi>I cried</hi> unto the Lord. The matter or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
larger than we imagine, even no less than delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from all evil that may any way inthral the Soul, as
will appear when we come to open this Prison from
which he desires it may be freed. <hi>Bring my Soul, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First then it is well and rightly directed not to Saint
or Angel or any creature else in Heaven or Earth, but
unto the Creator of Earth and Heaven and Angles and
all, to him that made them and is Lord over them. He
cried unto the Lord, this cry, <hi>Bring my Soul, &amp;c.</hi> He
well knew what <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>
               </hi> wrote afterwards, <hi>Abraham is
ignorant of us, and Israel knows, us not.</hi> And if they
should know and understand him and his prayers, yet he
well understood they could not help him in his distress:
for which reason amongst an hundred and fifty Psalms
which he wrote (one hundred whereof at least are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,)
you shall not find one directed to <hi>Cherub</hi> or <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi>
to <hi>Gabriel</hi> or <hi>Raphael, Abraham</hi> or <hi>Moses,</hi> or any
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46181:191"/>
other whatsoever, but still his cry is unto the Lord: He
was sure, he could hear his complaints, and no less able
than willing to relieve him when he complained. It is he
only that is Lord indeed of Death and Hell, of sin and
affliction too; who alone hath the Keys of all these Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
who opens and no Man shuts, who shuts and none
shall ever open; that hath power and strenght in his
holy arm to break the Gates of Brass, and smite the bars
of Iron asunder, and so make way for the Captives that
are fast bound in misery and iron; either in the Iron
chains of sin; or the misery of distress and affliction. To
him therefore must this prayer come of all others, <hi>Bring
my soul out of prison,</hi> that of all others, can break it up
at his pleasure. And however in small and petty grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
we may cast about for humane succours and strain
our wits for stratagems to relieve us, neglecting the Lord
in the mean time, yet <hi>cùm dignus vindice nodus inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derit,</hi>
in great and overwhelming calamities, especially
if sudden too, when neither head nor hand, counsel or
force can provide a remedy; when it is once come to
<hi>Davids</hi> case in this Psalm, that we have no place to flee
unto, nor any Man that careth for our Souls, <hi>tunc Deus
intervenit,</hi> then we run readily whether Papists or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
leave all, they their Papois and Pictures we our
projects and devices whatsoever, and betake our selves
only unto the Lord, the Lord alone of deliverance, and
in <hi>Davids</hi> cafe approach with <hi>Davids</hi> petition, <hi>deliver
thou my soul out of prison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then the object was right, and his prayer well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected:
And the manner was answerable, devout and
fervent, he cried it out, <hi>Deliver my soul out of prison.</hi>
And yet it is not likely he cried with his voice, he now
lay hid in a cave, and it was not safe for him to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
loud cries, saith <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Austin.</hi> It was not
therefore the outward sound of the lips, but the inward
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46181:192"/>
affection of the heart that sent forth this; the cry of this
voice, as those Authors observe; for as St.<hi>Bernard</hi> hath
it,<hi>Desiderium vehemens, clamor magnus,</hi> a strong and
earnest desire cries loud though the lips say nothing. And
this is the cry, the cry of the heart that gives acceptance
to our prayers, and deliverance too from our Prisons.
The prayer of the Just availeth much, if it be fervent, saith
St.<hi>James:</hi> otherwise even the prayers of the Just if they
be cold and of custom rather than Devotion and Piety,
may hurt but they profit nothing. The Lord is nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all them that call upon him <hi>faithfully,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi>
not <hi>formally;</hi> if as those Jews we draw near only with our
lips, when our heart is far from him: he may draw near
unto us with plagues and miseries, but his heart will be as
far from our supplications and distresses, <hi>when you stretch
forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes: and though
you make many prayers I will not hear you,</hi> saith the
Lord in <hi>Isa.</hi> i. The reason is there, <hi>your hands are full
of blood;</hi> the reason to us may be, your hearts bleed
not. Your Altar is without fire; your prayer without
heat, how should I accept your sacrifices? The very
wooden Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> may be an instruction to us:
<hi>They called,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>on the name of their god
from morning till noon,</hi> and when they had no answer
<hi>they cried loud,</hi> nay they <hi>themselves with knives
and lances,</hi> till they prayed not only in tears but in blood,
that they might be heard: and I would the children of
light were as zealous in their generations, though not so
foolish. But yet rather let us receive directions here at
home from our own Prophet. You saw how zealous he
was in <hi>praise,</hi> and he is as well affected in <hi>Prayer:</hi> it
was his darling this, and delight of his Soul; and it is
hard for any Man ever to pray well, that hath not learnt
it of him. No Man ever so frequent, so fervent in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercise; I will pray, saith he, at Morning, Noon, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46181:192"/>
Night, yea seven times a day will I pray, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
with the inwardst and deepest affections of his
mind. His bleeding heart may easily be discerned at his
weeping eye, which every night washt his Bed and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Couch with tears. He mingled his bread with
weeping, nay made weeping his bread, tears were his
meat and drink. Sure he had a strange fire within him
that made him run over so fast: or at least he was water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
plentifully with the dew of Heaven, that could mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
such continual fountains to his eyes. We, why we go
to prayers as if our Souls and tongues were strangers;
like the right hand and the left in the Gospel, one seldom
knows what the other doth; as if we gave God an Alms
and not prayed for our own necessity Our Bodies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
are in the Church, but our affections abroad:
our lips utter prayers, our hearts are on our penny: and
then no marvel if our eyes be dry when our devotions
are so drousie. But this is not it that can do it, such faint
and feeble prayers will break open no Prisons. He must
cry louder and deeper, that will be heard in his distress,
when we can say with <hi>David, è profundis,</hi> out of the
deep have I called on the Lord, when the depth of our
sins calls for the depth of our sorrow, and both upon
God for the depth of his mercies, when <hi>Abyssus Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi>
shall call one upon another then with <hi>David</hi> we shall
be sure to be heard, and have our Souls brought out of
Prison, which is the matter of the Prayer: our last point,
but hath many points in it. <hi>Bring my Soul out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is not a Prayer only for one penn'd up
in a Cave; but whatsoever doth any way inclose and
straiten the Soul, as was said afore, may not unfitly be
termed the Souls Prison, and for ought we know intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Scripture, at least applyable to it. And of these
things that thus besiege and shut up the Soul, though
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46181:193"/>
they are infinite almost in themselves, yet they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to these four. <hi>Afflictions, the World,</hi> or worldly
cares, <hi>sin,</hi> and this <hi>body of sin and death:</hi> And under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these we may say and pray with <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>Bring
my Soul out of prison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first (to take them in order) are afflictions, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and distresses; and that these imprison the Soul, and
are here specially meant and intended, there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all agree,<hi>tribulatio &amp; angustia</hi> are inseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<hi>Tribulation and anguish upon every Soul that
hath done evil,</hi> saith the Apostle; and <hi>Anguish</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the English of <hi>Angustia,</hi> for streights and
pressure there are in all tribulations. Prosperity and Joy
do dilate the spirits, and draw forth the Soul; but strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with grief and sorrow, like a prickt Snail she shrinks
into her shell, and is instantly straitned. But yet of
all the Prisons this is the most necessary: It is the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
of the world,</hi> and without it we should quickly grow
<hi>Bedlam</hi> and run mad in excess and wanton delights. For
all sins are frenzies, and such sinners seldom recover their
wits any where else. The wild Prodigal whilst free and
in prosperity, runs on in his course and never perceives
his own distraction, till shut up here and well whipt a
while <hi>redit ad se,</hi> then he comes to himself and can say,
<hi>surgam &amp; ibo ad patrem,</hi> I will arise and go unto my
Father. For <hi>tribulatio id habet proprium ut hominem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocet
&amp; reducat ad se:</hi> it is the very nature and property
of affliction to call home and reduce Men again unto their
senses. Neither doth it only give them their wits but
sets them on work, affording them matter whereon they
may exercise themselves and all the Christian virtues,
Faith, Hope, Patience, Meekness, Humility and the rest,
which otherwise would languish and vitiate, if not exhale
for want of imployment. This Prison therefore is of
excellent use: But why then if it be so profitable, should
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46181:193"/>
we pray to be freed of it? why, absolutely we do not;
but with limitation; if God shall think it expedient for
us; who when the cure is perfected, it may be will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
us; or if he keep us there longer, he will make us
large recompence for it hereafter. Our Saviours Prayer
is our rule in this point; because all afflictions are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
for the present we may say with him, <hi>if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
transeat calix ista, let this cup pass:</hi> but still with
submission to his good pleasure, <hi>not mine, but thy will
be done.</hi> And thus much though not always exprest is
ever reserved and understood, whensoever in this case
we shall say here with <hi>David, Bring my Soul out of
prison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is the world, or rather worldly cares, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>log and fetter the Souls of most Men, nailing them fast
unto the Earth that they cannot stir a foot, nor move a
thought towards Heaven and heavenly meditations. This
is a large prison wherein every one hath seen restraint
more or less, as they have learnt that high precept of the
Apostle, <hi>to use the world as if they used it not;</hi> but satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
nature only, account the rest that belongs to pomp
and superfluity, nothing near at that high rate as they are
bought and sold for in this Market of Fools, <hi>quanti ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur
&amp; emuntur in nundinis stultorum.</hi> These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have some freedom, and though they are in a sort
prisoners, yet they are prisoners at large, and have liberty
as large as the Prison, wherein they have elbow room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
not to be straitned. But those miserable wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
that, admiring the wealth and honour of the present
world, have inthralled and wrapt their Souls in terrene
and base solitudes, how close are they shut up, and how
miserable a servitude do they indure! No Gally-slave can
be tied in stronger chains than the Ambitious and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Man; like those condemned to the Mines he digs
under earth, and sweats for Ore all his life long; and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46181:194"/>
when he dies hath his mouth stopt only with a handful
of gravel. And here every one may freely pray, and
without any restriction at all, <hi>Out of this Prison O Lord
deliver my Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Third of these Prisons and worst of all, is Sin;
the Third indeed it is in order but first in time, that gives
power and strength unto both the other. Had not that in
the beginning seised on our Souls and fast bound them to
their hands, they could never have touched us. The world
instead of a Prison, had been a Paradise; and the men in
it, subject neither to Cares nor afflictions: But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fast tyed by this, we have a thousand Chains cast on
us, besides; and are become prisoners almost to every
thing else. This therefore is the head and fountain of
our misery, and as the first so the worst, straitest and
closest prison of all other; a common Jayl indeed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a Prison, and the very hole of the Jayl wherein
millions of men lie fast bound indeed, in misery and Iron,
putrifying and stinking in their corruption, like <hi>Lazarus</hi>
in his Grave; the very emblem both of the Prison
and Prisoners. And unless that Son of God who came
down himself from Heaven to open this Prison and preach
liberty unto the Captives, unless he graciously call unto
us, yea cry aloud as in the Gospel he did, even groaning
in his Spirit (to shew how difficult a thing it is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
these bonds wherewith custom and habit hath tyed
us as with cords) unless he, I say, by the power of his
holy voice cry unto us all as lie did unto him, <hi>Lazare
veni foras, Lazarus</hi> come forth, we shall all perish in our
captivity for ever, and never see light. For this sink of
sin (wherein the longer we lie, the deeper indeed we
sink) doth at length empty it self into Hell, the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Pit and Prison of everlasting sorrow. But blessed
be his name, the barrs are smitten asunder, and the doors
thrown open by his death: And he still calls unto us by
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46181:194"/>
the voice of his Ministers, yea and Spirit too, to come forth;
and unless we be enamoured of our own misery, and like
Beasts delight to lie in our own filth till we perish in that
nethermost Gulf, let us hearken unto his calls and rouse
up our selves betimes, answering his voice with another
call of our own, calling and crying with all our might
and without ever ceasing, all of us, From this Prison
good Lord deliver our Souls. But yet call and cry as long
and as loud as we can, our Souls shall never be clearly
freed either from this Prison of sin, or those others of
Cares and Sorrows, so long as they are still inclosed in this
of the corruptible body. Which is the Fourth and last
Prison of the Soul, and here intended by <hi>David</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the exposition of many Fathers, whose words I
cannot now stand to recite.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Laurentius Justinianus</hi> said well of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
this Prayer, <hi>Verba sunt peregrinationis suae miserias
meditantis, &amp;c</hi> they are the words, saith he, of one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
on the miseries of his peregrination on Earth, and
the joyes of the celestial <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above, and as it were
sighing in himself that he was detained so long from prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the name of God, and singing hymns of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and honour amidst all the company of the righteous
there, and congregation of the first-born both Saints and
Angels, he grieves at his absence, and groans out the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventness
of his desire in this short Prayer, <hi>Bring my Soul
out of Prison, that I may praise thy name.</hi> A desire
which he doth elsewhere often express, <hi>As the Hart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
the water-brooks, so longeth my Soul after thee O
God. When shall I appear before the presence of the Lord?
Blessed be they that dwell in thy house, they shall be always
praising of thee from generation to generation:</hi> and that
he might be in the midst of them praising his name, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
in this Prayer is here, <hi>Bring my Soul out of Prison &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, if we shall suppose he did not, yet others
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46181:195"/>
may, and no question but many do. The Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
report, not without Joy, that their holy St.<hi>Francis</hi>
died with this very sentence in his mouth, and this sence
of it to be his mind, which he had no sooner uttered but
<hi>Anima à Corpore libera evolavit in coelum,</hi> his Soul
according to his request freed from his body, flew away
into Heaven. And certainly whosoever hath but so
much goodness, as he can grieve to be detained from
Heaven, or desires to be freed from the molestations
of sin upon Earth, cannot but esteem of the body as a
Prison which hinders him in both. Nay the very Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
that knew neither of those respects, out of
moral regards, could both perceive and acknowledge it
for such, <hi>Carcer &amp; sepulchrum Animae,</hi> the Prison and
Sepulcher of the Soul. And so may we term them too,
only we must be careful we avoid the error of <hi>Origen,</hi>
That our Souls sinned in Heaven, and are condemned to
bodies, but as to Gallies or Prisons where they are to do
penance for former transgressions. But as St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth
well distinguish, it is not the body in it self which was
first built for a house of delight though sin committed
in it, but the corruption of it that makes it a Prison, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that in the Book of <hi>Wisdom Corpus corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibile
aggravat animam,</hi> the corruptible bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> presseth
down the Soul; and ceaseth not to fight against it with
many noysome lusts, in regard whereof the Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was inforced to cry out as even weary of his Prison,
<hi>quis liberabit, who shall deliver me from this body of
death? why? Thanks be unto God through our Lord
Jesus Christ,</hi> this is he that shall deliver us, this is the Lord
to whom <hi>David</hi> did and we all must pray, that desire this
benefit. <hi>Bring my soul out of Prison O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet though we may lawfully make this Prayer in
this sence, yet it must be as before with submission of our
will unto his: we must wait the Lords leisure with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46181:195"/>
to whom only belong the issues of death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not seek to break through the walls or throw our selves
out at the windows; but stay till he shall please to open
the door, and lead us forth in peace, for it is <hi>Educ ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam,</hi>
we may not thrust it out our selves, but he must lead
it forth, or we shall but thrust it out of one prison into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infinitely worse. Nay it seems by that word it should
be no hasty desire, that he himself should do it neither:
it doth not sound as if we would have him presently
break down and demolish the building, and so sweep us
away in an instant; that were <hi>Eripe animam,</hi> pluck forth
my Soul out of prison, but it is <hi>Educ,</hi> lead it forth, and
seems to import not so much an anticipation of our time
as an humble Petition, that when our time is come, and this
Tabernacle must needs be dissolved; that then amidst all
the conflicts and terrours of death he would be pleased to
be with us to sustain and uphold us with his grace, chean
up and guide forth our Souls with his comforts, for this is
<hi>educere animam,</hi> to lead the Soul out of Prison. And
happy, thrice happy are those Souls that are thus led and
conducted in this perillous time. Every one indeed prays
for it, but every one shall not obtain it, It is <hi>Educ ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
meam,</hi> and we must put an accent upon that <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
on <hi>Davids</hi> Soul; that faithful and penitent Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was, and all others without fail shall be (in their due
time) thus led and guided out of their Prisons in peace:
but those that have no part in his penitence, they may say,
if they will, but they shall have no part in his Prayer. As
they neglected God and all his ways in their life: so God
again will be as far from hearing or keeping them in their
death, but will rather laugh in their destruction and mock,
when their fear cometh, as it is in the first of <hi>Proverbs.</hi>
And then on the otherside how miserable, thrice miserable,
shall he be, that must part with his Soul at a venture,
without any comfort to sustain it, or light of grace to lead
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46181:196"/>
it, through the fearful passages of death! Look on him,
and you shall then see, when after all his mirth and
revels, you shall find him at the last laid on his groaning
pillow, on the bed of languishing, as <hi>David</hi> speaks. O
consider well how woful and disconsolate his estate must
needs be, when after all his former pleasures being worn
out with his body, the Soul begins to loath the ruinous
house of age and sickness; when it may not stay, and
yet knows not whither to go; at what time those sad and
severe cogitations formerly beaten from him through
youth and felicity, return to afflict, and pay him home
for all his vain and wanton delights: yea peradventure
when the terrours of God shall fight against him, and the
Arrows of the Almighty stick within him, the venom
whereof drinks up the spirit, as it is in <hi>Job;</hi> In this
misery of his, wounded in body through sickness, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
in conscience through sin, what shall lead him forth
with comfort since God refuseth to do it? shall his wife,
his sons or his friends, his honours, offices or wealth?
why the very thought of these and whatsoever else he
hath, that is good, doth but double his afflicton, since now
he must part with them for ever; and may well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
say unto them as <hi>Job</hi> did unto his three friends, <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
comforters are ye all:</hi> what then? shall he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himself as some of the servants of God have done,
by looking back on the ways of his life? why nothing
can possibly torment him more: he now sees that he
hath but wearied himself in the ways of Iniquity; and
perceives, though too late, what before he refused to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that such paths lead down unto the Chambers of
death. Since then he can neither comfort himself, nor receive
any from the rest of the world, shall he for his last refuge,
as thousands of others have done, cry, Lord, Lord, be
thou my help and comfort, <hi>and bring my Soul out of
Prison?</hi> But alas unto what purpose, and upon what
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46181:196"/>
acquaintance? He that gave his Soul unto sin and Satan
in his life time, why should he think God in his death will
embrace and entertain it? No, no: Either give up thy
Soul unto God when he calls for it in his word, in the
provocations of his love, in the holy motions of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
unto thine; or else when thou wouldest give it, he
will none of it; unless as an angry Judge to deliver it
over to the tormentor. And in these streights what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
but that he either take up the ditty of that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Emperour, <hi>heu, quae nunc abibis in loca,</hi> fearfully
part with his Soul he knows not whither, or else embrace
the counsel of <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, desperately curse God and die?
Either way he comes to his deserved end; and he whose
whole life was as the way of a snail, not a step but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
filth behind; at the last dies like a Candles end in
the Socket, boyling and burning in the flame of his own
distressed and distracted Soul, till he go out in a suff, and
leave an ill savour behind him amongst all good people.
Such is oftentimes the fearful departure of those whom
God for their former wicked lives shall refuse to lead out
of their Prisons when they die. No, this favour belongs
not unto them, it is reserved for those faithful Souls that
with holy <hi>David,</hi> have throughly sorrowed for their sins,
for they only shall partake of <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer that imitate
<hi>Davids</hi> repentance. And these, however he may seem
to absent himself for a while, and hide his countenance
from them, yet in that day of need, in that last and
Fearful time that most requires it, they shall be sure of
his comforts. He will not fail then to discover his face,
and make the light of his countenance shine into that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of darkness: and by the beams thereof chear up his
people, leading and lighting them through all the dark
and winding Alleys of death, until they arrive in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Kingdom of immortality and peace.</p>
            <p>Believe not me, but behold the holy man of God and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46181:197"/>
see it performed with your Eyes. Look upon <hi>Jacob</hi> the
Patriarch, and Father of the Patriarchs, he that wrestled
not only that one time at the River <hi>Jabbock,</hi> but all his
life long with the arm of the Almighty continually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
him, yet in the end, all these storms are blown
over, and he is gathered unto his Fathers in a calm of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and peace. But first mark how the Lord gave him
strength, before he went hence and was no more seen;
wherewith he collects his fainting Spirits, raiseth himself
up in his bed, calls his Sons about him, gives every one his
several blessing and benediction in such a high and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
strain, as if an Angel had sate on his lips: and
I think many Angels sate waiting in that door of his body
for the coming forth of his Soul, which stayed not long
after, to convey it into the bosom of his Grand-father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
there to rest in everlasting peace. Look upon
<hi>Joshua</hi> the Captain of <hi>Israel,</hi> after all his Wars and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
past; at length he sits him down and divides the
spoil among the Tribes of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and death drawing
near, see how he summons the whole people together,
and with such power of speech exhorts them to the fear
and service of God, which had dealt so mercifully with
them, that the whole Congregation as if it had but one
heart and one tongue and both throughly affected, joynt|
ly cry out unto him, <hi>God forbid, that we should forsake
the Lord; nay but we will serve him, for he is our God.</hi>
Thus out of the flame of his own zeal having kindled a
fire in the breast of others; this great Worthy was led
forth from his Prison in peace. See <hi>Samuel</hi> the Judge of
<hi>Israel</hi> going to his grave as to his bed, and in him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the power and vertue of a good Conscience, arising
from the memory of a well acted life: <hi>Whose Oxe or
whose Ass have I taken, whom have I defrauded, or at
whose hands have I received a bribe?</hi> saith he unto the
Congregation, as all bear him Record, saith the Text, <hi>hoc
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46181:197"/>
ducit ad funus &amp; sepulturam:</hi> This is it which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
him to his grave, and laies him in his rotten Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.
Lastly, consider St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his marvellous
confidence, <hi>even before his death,</hi> that made him bold
to deliver up his Soul almost like his Saviour with a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summatum
est, I have finished my course, I have kept
the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
which the Lord the just Judge shall give me at
that day:</hi> words worthy of a Soul so near unto its Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
such have been the blessed ends of these holy Men
of God and many more, famous in their generations, and
such it is and shall be in all others that faithfully serve
him, though it be not ever manifest in all.</p>
            <p>And what is there now that can more deeply affect a
good heart? what can a religious mind so much desire
unto it self, or behold with so great delight in another;
as to see a devout and penitent Soul give a peaceful fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
unto Nature, and in the midst of death depart full of
comforts of immortality and life? as those Souls only do,
whom God shall vouchsafe to lead out of their corruptible
prisons with the sweet consolations of his spirit.</p>
            <p>But peradventure far off examples, will be left too far off
respects. Usually those that are nearest do affect us most: if
so, this sad occasion will afford you a worthy one: for I
have done with her Text, and must speak as I promised and
you expect of her person, that made choice of the Text:
and by this time you cannot but perceive how justly.
She delighted in prayer and praise while she lived, and
she left this behind her written with her own hand, that
it might testify so much for her even after her death; and
that by it she might in a sort (lest her thankfulness being
private should die with her self) publickly praise the name
of God amidst the company of the righteous, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of good men here on earth, even then when
she her self, freed from her prison, should be singing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46181:198"/>
and glory with Saints and Angels in Heaven, Yet
this was not all the reason of her choice. It sorted well
with her condition whilst she was in the body; and she
knew it would be fully accomplished when she should be
led out of it. For she had her part of afflictions, and
they prest sore upon her too, even straitned her Soul.
Her branches she saw were rent away, branch after
branch; and to so loving a nature they could not but go
off as limbs from her body. What <hi>Bernard</hi> said in the
loss of his friend is most true in her case: <hi>Her bowels
were pluckt from her, and she could not but feel the
wound;</hi> and therefore if for nought else but her sorrow
and afflictions sake she might well pray, <hi>educ animam, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But other troubles she had besides and distractions in
the world, that often called her meditations from Heaven
where they delighted wholly to converse: especially in
her later time wherein she so inured her Soul unto blessed
contemplation, as she had almost freed her self from this
prison ere she was freed from the body: that indeed was
still in the world, but her mind and affections were usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with her Maker: So that those earthy cares which
hang at the heels of other mens Souls like talents of lead,
hung at hers only but as a line that usually gave her leave
to soar aloft, only humane necessity that held the end of
it, had power now and then to draw her down, to the
grief and sorrow of her heart. I am a witness of her
complaint, and of her tears too that any worldly occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
though never so necessary, should trouble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
her spiritual devotions, and therefore I am sure
in this regard it was her frequent prayer, <hi>Bring my Soul
out of prison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And besides afflictions and cares, sins she had too no
question, for what Soul is without them? but yet so few
and so far from habit, as I think no man can easily tell
what they were. Infirmities and omissions it may be,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46181:198"/>
though for my part, I know them not; yet this I know,
that her goodness esteemed them as the greatest sins, and
bewailed them with sorrow enough to suffice one that
had murdered his Father, or betrayed his Country, never
ceasing to send forth her fervent supplications in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
unto the last gasp. Her tongue, her hands, her heart,
all prayed this prayer: her tongue as long as it could
move, and when that failed, her hand spake; and when
both were gone, yet questionless her heart cried this cry,
<hi>deliver my soul out of this prison,</hi> the prison of sin. But
yet until the body be severed from the Soul, the Soul
can never utterly be severed either from sin or care, or
sorrow of affliction. And a body she had, it is now you see
a carkase: but sometimes was a goodly frame, a well built
and come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, and even; cut out of an antient
Quarry; but unto her, whose thoughts were on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
habitation above, as it was in it self, by reason of the
corruption whereunto it was subject, so she esteem'd it,
but a prison unto her Soul: and that did at last trouble
her peace with pains, and delay her from those joys that
are pure and know no mixture of sorrow.</p>
            <p>No marvel therefore, if in the desire of these she could
make that her prayer, which others tremble to think on,
deliverance from her Prison. But yet there needed no
earnest Prayer for this, death comes fast enough on of
it self without hastning; it more concerns us to die well
and with the comforts of God in our bosomes, that may
shield us from our spiritual enemies that are then busiest;
and guide and conduct us through the dark valley of
death, that is terrible in it self. And therefore in this
respect I rather conceive, she that was so careful of her
Soul, could not but make it her humblest and heartiest
prayer that when the time should come, the Lord of his
mercy would be pleased to lead it out of Prison. So fit
was it every way, and in many regards so good a choice
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46181:199"/>
did she make of her prayer, whilst she lived, and the
Lord from his holy habitation heard her cry and at last
accomplisht and fulfilled it all in her death. Though
before he pleased to lay sorrows enough upon her, yet
now in the midst of them all, his comforts did refresh her
Soul. Now he comes to it in his dearest loving kindness;
and leads it forth indeed with his choicest consolations
and graces to make her a full recompence for all her
former afflictions. How doth it now rejoice others about
her, even in the depth of their sorrow, to see her full of
the Spirit, and out of the abundance of it sometimes
pouring down blessings on her children and childrens
children, and every one his several blessings, like <hi>Jacob:</hi>
sometimes stirring up and exhorting to the fear and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Lord, with holy <hi>Joshu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> sometimes again so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing
her self in the sweet peace of a good Conscience,
as blessed <hi>Samuel:</hi> and lastly sometimes venting out her
strong hope, and stedfast confidence with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but
in the words of <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer liveth,
and I shall see him with these eyes,</hi> as she often repeated.
But what may be said enough of her fervent praying?
she was ever pious and frequent in this holy exercise
through the whole course of her life, thrice a day at the
least, at morning, at noon and at night, besides her times
of publick prayer: so five times a day she prayed, and I
doubt not but instantly too. But now when her prison
began to ruine and death to appear within ken, how assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
is she now? it is not <hi>Davids</hi> seven, nor twice seven
times a day that can suffice; but she plies it, as if she had
meant to fulfil the Apostles precept, <hi>pray continually.</hi>
I told you but now her heart, tongue and hand prayed
to the last gasp, and I think that gasp was a prayer too,
when her understanding failed, and she could neither
hear nor see others, yet others might see and perceive
that she prayed. So perfectly had she taught her tongue
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46181:199"/>
to pray, that when her senses were locked up, it could
run of it self. And if such a Soul as this, be not, whose
shall ever be, led forth with comfort and peace? But yet
before her leading forth, being remembred of it, she wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
made confession of her Faith, acknowledging all
the Articles of her Belief, and adhering only unto the
blood of Christ Jesus for her hope: in these she had lived,
and in them she would die; but die in charity too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
and desiring to be forgiven of the whole world:
as at other times she did not refuse to ask it even of her
own Servants when she had but uttered a word with a
little more earnestness than ordinary. And this solemn
profession made, that she might farther yet fulfil all
rights, she gladly makes her Son her Father, and receives
his absolution. And not long after the God of all mercies
on whom she continually called, answered her gently,
and opening the Prison, <hi>eduxit animam,</hi>led forth her
blessed Soul full of gracious comforts unto everlasting
glory, for with this all the other prisons are utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.
No more afflictions now, nor sin, nor death for
ever: all tears are wiped from her eyes, and sorrow from
her heart, all pain from her Body and sin from her Soul;
which now in the highest Heavens compassed about with
the righteous, sings the songs of praise and honour and
glory unto him that sitteth upon the throne and to the
Lamb for evermore.</p>
            <p>Who now shall mourn, who shall weep for such a
Soul? none can sorrow for her unless they envy her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
<hi>foelix illa anima, imitationem desiderat n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n
planctum</hi> that blessed Soul is no subject of grief, but a
pattern for imitation. And therefore if any weep in her
death, they must be tears of joy, not of sorrow; and if
they be of sorrow, they must not be for her but for our
selves, and our own loss. This indeed is great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable,
and when you think on it, weep a Gods name.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46181:200"/>
               <hi>Quis natum in funere matris flere vetat?</hi> he were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
that would forbid it you: yet you shall not have
all to your selves, we'll bear you company, for she was a
publick loss. Such a Wife, such a Mother, such a Friend,
such a Mistriss, such a Neighbour, such and so good a
Woman, and so great an example of Virtue, cannot,
should not go to the grave with dry eyes, in whose loss
so many have interest. I would praise her if I could, to
make you weep more, but she is beyond my commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
A Woman of her Wisdom and Judgment, of her
Wit and discourse, so free and liberal and yet so prudent
and provident withal, for she was so in her self, though
misfortunes befel her: so sweet, so kind, so mild, so lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and respective to all, and withal so charitable to the
poor, a Chirurgeon to the hurt, and a Physician to the
sick: she eat not her morsels alone, and their loins were
warmed with her wooll, <hi>as Job speaks;</hi> such a Woman,
so well born and bred, and of such a strain beyond or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
as she seemed with the blood to inherit too the
virtues of all her Ancestors: so upright and clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
in her whole course, that the eye of envy, nay
were all the malice of the world infused into one eye,
it could not find any just stain to fasten on her; such a
one, so every way compleat, surely no Man unless he
had her own, or the wit and tongue of an Angel can
sufficiently commend: neither can we, if we regard our
own loss, sufficiently bewail. But the truth is, she is
not lost, <hi>non amissa sed praemissa:</hi> sent before she is,
lost she is not: And therefore you whom it most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
though you mourn, mourn not as those without
hope. It is but a short separation, and the time will come
when you shall see her again, though not with these
earthly affections. Pay the due tribute unto nature; but
then shut up the sluces for graces sake. And the God of
all grace give you comfort; the Holy Ghost the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46181:200"/>
himself replenish your heart with consolations. And
the blood of Jesus Christ wash us all from all our sins, and
strengthen us with the power of his might; that we may
so live whilst we remain here in this Prison of the Body,
that when it shall be dissolved, we may obtain mercy
from him, to lead forth our Souls. To lead them with
his grace, and then (as he hath done to this blessed Saint)
receive them unto glory; There with her and all the
company of righteous spirits that are gone before us, to
sing praise and honour unto his holy name for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.

            </epigraph>
            <p>MAN of all Gods Creatures, is the strangest
compounded, the most marvellous mixture that
ever was, a very fardel of contrarieties, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
united and wrapt up in one bundle.
Heaven and Earth, light and darkness, Christ and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial</hi>
may seem to dwell together, and man the house of
their habitation: what can be more directly opposite
than Flesh and Spirit, Life and Death, Sin and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness?
and lo all of them united here in one verse, nay
in one man. For the Text is but the Anatomy of man,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46181:201"/>
and must therefore be composed of and divided into the
same parts man himself is. As his body is composed of
contrary Elements, heat and cold, fire and water: So his
person is composed of contrary Natures, Corporal and
Spiritual, Body and Soul: His Natures again of contrary
qualities, Life and Death; the Body is dead, the Soul
lives: and lastly these qualities issuing from contrary
causes, sin and righteousness, death from sin, and life from
righteousness. <hi>The Body, &amp;c.</hi> And though the sin by
which the body dies is our own, yet that we may know
that the righteousness whereby the Soul lives is not of
our selves but received from our Saviour, there is a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given in the entrance of the verse, <hi>If Christ be in
you.</hi> So then here are three couples, a Body and a Soul:
Sin and Righteousness: Life and Death: The body with
her two attendants, sin and death; the Soul with her
two endowments, righteousness and life. The former is
universal and common to all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the flesh; the latter particular and proper only
to the Children of the second <hi>Adam</hi> begotten by the
Spirit, <hi>If Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the first part, which is a meditation of
death and our chief Christian comforts against death.
But yet before the Apostle brings in his consolations he
premises a conditon, <hi>If Christ be in you:</hi> To teach
us, that the comforts of God belong not indifferently
to all men: He that is a stranger from Christ, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with them. <hi>What hast thou to do to take
my Covenant into thy mouth, so long as thou hatest to
be reformed?</hi> saith God in the <hi>Psalm</hi> I. When our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
commanded his Disciples to proclaim peace unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
house they came to, he foretold them it should rest
only on the Sons of peace. He forbad them in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to give those things which were holy, unto doggs, or
to cast pearls before Swine. This stands a perpetual Law
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46181:202"/>
to all his messengers, that they presume not to proclaim
peace to the impenitent and unbelieving; but as <hi>Jehu</hi>
said unto <hi>Jehoram</hi>'s horsman, <hi>what hast thou to do with
peace?</hi> so are we to tell the wicked who walk on still in
their sins, that they have nothing to do with the peace
or promises or priviledges of the Gospel, <hi>If Christ be in
you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> if we compare the verse immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or that which is subsequent with this between both,
you shall easily perceive after what manner Christ dwells
in his Children. Sometimes we are said to be in Christ,
and sometimes Christ is said again to be in us; and both
in effect come to one: we are in Christ by faith, and
Christ is in us by his Spirit: For so it follows, <hi>If the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also
quicken your mortal bodies.</hi> It is not then a Carnal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
but a Spiritual, that doth link and associate unto
Christ. To make up our union with him it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that his humane nature should be drawn down from
Heaven; or that his body should be every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
on Earth, as the <hi>Ubiquitaries</hi> affirm: or that the
Bread in the Sacrament should be transubstantiate into
his body, as the Papists imagin. His dwelling in us is by
his Spirit, and his union with us, is spiritual. So himself
in the same place where he speaks of eating his flesh and
drinking his blood, doth interpret himself, <hi>the flesh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth
nothing, the words that I speak are spirit and life.</hi>
And his Spirit, it is, not his body that shall give life unto the Spirit, when the body shall perish, <hi>If Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This touch shall suffice for the condition, I proceed to
the substance of the Text. <hi>The Body is dead.</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
as I said, an admonition of our frailty, corruption,
and death, and comforts against death. It is but the body
that is dead, the Spirit is life, First of our corruption and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:46181:202"/>
frailry, <hi>The body is dead.</hi> That we all tend unto death
we all know; but the Apostle's speech is more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
he says not, the body is subject to death, but by
a more significant phrase of speech he presseth it homer,
<hi>The body is dead.</hi> There is a difference between a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
body, and a dead body. <hi>Adams</hi> body before the
fall was mortal in some sort, that is, subject to a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of dying: but now after the fall our bodies are so
mortal, as they are subject to a necessity of dying; yea if
we'll here with the Apostle esteem of death by the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and seisure of it, they are dead already. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
and harbingers of death, dolours, infirmities and
heavy diseases have seised already on our bodies, and
marked them out as lodgings which shortly must be the
habitation of their Master.</p>
            <p>But how near this manner of speech draws unto true
propriety, they best conceive, who best understand how
that malediction of God and curse of the Law, <hi>The day
that thou eatest thereof thou shalt die the death,</hi> was
fulfilled. If God spared not the Angels when they wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
proud, will he spare thee, who art but a putrifying
worm? <hi>Ille intumuit in coelo, erga in sterquilinio,</hi>
he was puft up in Heaven, and therefore was cast down
from the place of his habitation: and if I wax proud
lying on a dunghil, shall I not be cast down into Hell?
So often therefore as corrupt nature stirreth up the heart
to pride, because of youth and health, beauty and strength,
and the like perfections of the body; let this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
humble thee, that though these are fair and beauti|
ful flowers, yet they cannot but suddenly wither; because
the root from whence they sprung is corrupt and rotten
and even dead already. Neither is it more available to the
cutting down of arrogance and pride, than to teach us
Temperance and sobriety. What availeth it to pamper
that Carcase of thine with excess of delicate feeding, which
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46181:203"/>
is possessed by death already? If Men took the tenth part
of that care to present their spirit holy and without blame
unto the Lord, which they take to make their bodies
fair and beautiful in the eyes of Men, they might in short
time make a greater improvement in Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
than they have done. But herein is their folly; they
make fat the flesh with precious things, which within few
days the worms shall devour; but never care to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
the Soul with holy and virtuous actions, which short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is to be presented to God. Let us therefore refrain
from the immoderate cherishing this proud and dead
flesh; <hi>meats are ordained for the belly, and the belly for
meats, but God will destroy them both,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 13. I
might inlarge this point almost infinitely; for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of this consideration is not confined unto Humility,
Sobriety, and Temperance or any particular virtues, but
it's universal; restraining from all evil, and inciting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
unto all virtue and goodness. <hi>Nihil sic revocat
bominem à peccato quàm frequens mortis meditatio,</hi>
saith St.<hi>Aug.</hi> nothing can so recall a Man from his evil
ways as the frequent meditation of death; especially if he
consider, as the certainty of death, so the uncertain
time of his death, and the unchangeable estate of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
misery if he die in his sins. Would to God we
were wise, thoroughly to apprehend and apply this unto
our own Souls. It is strange that there is nothing so well
known, nothing of greater benefit, and yet nothing so
little regarded. What a Prodigy is it, that sinful Men
should carry about their death in their bosoms and in
every vein of their Bodies, and yet scarce admit a thought
of their mortality into their minds, but live here as if
they verily thought they should never die? If we had
no Religion, yet reason would teach us that our
strength is not the strength of stones (and yet them even
the drops of water weareth) nor our sinews of Brass and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:46181:203"/>
Iron, as <hi>Job speaks</hi> (and yet these the rust and cank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
consumeth) but a vapour, but a smoak, which the Sun
soon drieth or the wind driveth away. It was wittily
said of <hi>Epictetus</hi> the Philosopher, who going forth one
day and seeing a Woman weeping that had broken her
Pitcher, and the next day meeting another Woman that
had lost her Son, <hi>Heri vidi fragilem frangi, hodie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo
mortalem mori,</hi> Yesterday, saith he, I saw a brittle
thing broken, and to day I see a mortal Man die. And
what difference of frailty between these two? surely
none unless Man be the frailer of the two. For as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
hath it, Take the brittlest veslel of earth or glass and
keep it safe from outward violence, and it may last many
thousand of years: but take a Man of the most pure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
of the strongest constitution, and keep him as
safe as thou canst; he hath that within his own bowels
and bones that will bring him to his end. Nay I hear
some say, saith the same Father, that such a one hath the
Plague or the Pleurisie, and therefore sure he will die;
but we may rather say, such a one liveth and therefore
sure he will die; for diverse have had these Diseases and
did not die of them, but never any Man lived, that did
not die. The Consumption of the Liver is the messenger
of Death, the Consumption of the Lungs the Minister
of Death, the Consumption of the marrow and moisture
the very Mother of Death; and yet many have had these
Diseases and not died of them. But there is another
kind of Consumption which could never yet be cured;
it is the Consumption of the days; the common Disease
of all Mankind. <hi>David</hi> saw it and spake of it, when
he said, <hi>my days are consumed like smoke,</hi> Psal. cii. yea
the Philosopher saw it and could say of it, <hi>quicquid prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritum
est temporis mors habet:</hi> all our time that is
past, death hath seised on it; and so much of our life is
consumed. Let me then warn you and stir up your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46181:204"/>
of your mortality in the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut.
xxxii. 29. <hi>O that men were wise, then would they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this,</hi> then would <hi>they consider their latter end.</hi>
Sure we are unwise that we consider not the things past,
the evil we have committed, the good we have omitted,
the benefits of God we have abused, the time we have
mispent; and yet we grieve not, because we think not
yet whether we shall die. More unwise are we not to
consider the things present, the deadness of our Body, and
uncertainty of our death; the difficulty of Salvation,
and the small number of such as shall be saved, and yet
we shame not, because we think we shall not yet die.
But most unwise are we that we consider not the things
to come, Death, Judgment, Hell, all to come; and yet
we fear not, because we think we shall never die. But O
that we were wise; then should we understand, then
should we consider our latter end, and considering it,
we should both prepare for it now, and more cheerfully
entertain it when it comes, <hi>memorare novissims,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy end saith the Wiseman, <hi>&amp; in aeternum non
peccabis,</hi> and thou shalt never offend, never do amiss,
<hi>Ecclus</hi> vii. 36. So universal is the goodness of this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and therefore I have stayed the longer on it.
But now I pass from mortality to the cause of it, from
death to sin, that first brought it into the world. <hi>The
body is dead because of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sin it is and only sin, which is, as the cause of all our
dolours and calamities, so of death it self that follows them,
without this there never had been, there never could
have been any death in the world. Death were not
death, had it not a sting to kill; but the sting of death is
sin, as the strength of sin is the law, saith our Apostle.
The cursed apple of disobedience which our first Parents
would needs eat, sticks still in all our teeth: it was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
unto his nature and infected his blood, and he hath
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:46181:204"/>
derived the contagion to all his posterity; who still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to feed on forbidden fruit as he did, do perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
strengthen the original Disease and draw death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves more hastily and violently than either that
sin procured, or the prime corruption of nature for it
doth inforce. Hence then we may perceive first how
foolish they are, who living still in sin yet never consider
that they are the Butchers and Murtherers of themselves,
according to that of the Psalmist, <hi>The malice of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall slay themselves,</hi> xxxiv. 21 his own sin which
he hath conceived, brought forth and nourished, shall
be his destruction. Every Man judgeth <hi>Saul</hi> miserable
that died upon his own Sword: but what better are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wretched Men whose sins and iniquities are the cruel
instruments of death, wherewith they slay themselves,
Souls and Bodies too? Thus are they twice miserable;
first that they must die; and secondly that they are guilty
of their own death. O the lamentable blindness of Men!
who albeit in their life they fear nothing more than
death, yet do they entertain nothing more willingly than
sin which causeth their death. In bodily diseases Men
are content to abstain even from ordinary food, when
they are informed it will but nourish their sickness;
and this they do to eschew death: only herein they are
so ignorant, that notwithstanding they abhor death, yet
they take pleasure in unrighteousness that brings it upon
them. And <hi>secondly,</hi> which shall be the last use we will
make of this point. Since sin it is, that did first bring
and doth still hasten on death, upon wicked Men; what
marvel is it, if in these last and worst days the Lord strike
the bodies of Men with sundry sorts of diseases and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
kinds of death, seeing Man by sundry sorts of sins
doth not cease to provoke him unto anger? He frameth
his Judgments proportionable to our iniquities: <hi>if ye
walk stubbornly against me, and will not obey me, I will
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:46181:205"/>
then bring seven times more plagues upon you according
to your sins,</hi> Levit. xxvi. 25. He hath a famine to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
intemperance and the abuse of his creatures, if the
memory of our own corrupt and putrifying bodies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it; he hath a devouring sword to bring down
the pride of our hearts. If we have fiery and unclean
affections, he doth not need burning Fevers and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
diseases to punish them. And now if the Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he hath stricken us with such a dreadful pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence shall
renew his Plague amongst us; or go on to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
that former destruction with the Sword of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
what shall we say? but the despising of his former
fatherly corrections, or our stubborn walking against the
Lord our God hath procured it justly unto our selves.
<hi>Quid mirum in poenas generis humani crescere ir am
Dei, cùm crescat quotidie, quod puniatur?</hi> what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
that the wrath of God increase every day to punish
Man, when that doth daily increase which deserves that
God should punish it? But enough of this part: it is
now time to pass on to the second and most worthy part,
as of Man so of my Text, from the Body to the Soul,
from the memory of death, to the comforts against
death: for though the body be dead yet it is but the
body, the spirit (which is the highest consolation of a
Christian) is yet alive, Mans life it self. <hi>But the spirit is
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot now stand to discourse of the excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Mans Spirit and the wonderful union of it with
flesh and blood; for Man you see is no simple creature
but compounded of both; both a Body and a Spirit. He
is the abstract and brief compendium of all the creatures
of God. The world was corporeal, the Angels spiritual,
and both were united in Man, and made as it were into
one creature; A creature which hath being with the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
life with plants, sense with beasts, reason and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46181:205"/>
existence with Angels; that so the Almighty God
first uniting all his creatures in Man, and then uniting
Man unto himself in the person of Christ, might in some
sort through Man communicate himself to all his creatures.
Worthily therefore did the Naturalists term him a little
world; and as worthily did St. <hi>Austin</hi> say of him, that
of all the miracles that were ever wrought amongst Men,
Man himself is the greatest miracle; and that not only in
regard of his two substances, but especially in regard of
their marvellous union; that a mass of clay should be
quickened by a spirit of life, and both united into one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
That as God himself hath diverse persons in one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
so man hath diverse and those contrary natures in
one person. Commonly, says <hi>Bernard,</hi> the honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
not with the ignoble, the strong overgoes the
weak, the living and the dead dwell not together. <hi>Non
sic in opere tuo domine: non sic in commixtione tua:</hi>
not so in thy work O Lord, not so in thy commixtion;
here the living and the dead dwell both together: <hi>The
body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then are the high consolations of a Christian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
death, briefly comprised; and they are three, That
his death is neither total nor final, but his life is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:
His death is not <hi>total,</hi> it is only of the body, for the
spirit lives: it is not <hi>final,</hi> for the spirit is not said only to
live, but that it is life, and that in two respects, <hi>first</hi> because
it shall give life again unto the body; and that <hi>secondly</hi> an
everlasting life, and therefore it is not barely the spirit
shall live, but in the abstract, the spirit is life. So you
may perceive the reason why the Apostle varies his
manner of speech: he said not the body is death, as he
says the spirit is life; neither saith he the spirit is alive, as
he said the body is dead; but the body is dead and the
spirit is life: the body is dead and not death, because it
shall live again; and the spirit is not alive but life, because
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46181:206"/>
by the virtue of the spirit it is, that it shall live, and live
for ever. <hi>The spirit &amp;c.</hi> So our life is perpetuate, our
death but short and not total. Amidst these comforts
what hath death in it that shall greatly trouble or distress
the faithful Soul? why should it not stand erect in
the midst of all the panick terrors thereof, so long as
there is begun in us a life, which no death shall ever be
able to extinguish? Albeit death invade the natural and
vital powers of our bodies, and suppress them one after
another; yea though at the length he break in upon this
lodging of clay and demolish it to the ground; yet the
inner Man and spiritual that dwells in the body shall
escape with his life. The Tabernacle is cast down (that's
the most our enemy can do) but he who dwells in it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
unto a better. The dissolving of the body, to him,
is but the breaking up of the prison wherein he hath been
so long detained, that he may thenceforth be delivered
into a glorious liberty. For as the Bird escapes out of the
snare of the Fowler: so the Soul in death mounts up and
flies away wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> joy into the rest of her Maker. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
knew this well, and therefore desired to <hi>be dissolved
that he might be with Christ.</hi> As in the battle between
our Saviour and Satan, Satans head was bruised, but he
did no more than tread on our Saviours heel: so shall it
be in the conflict of all his members with Satan; by the
power of our Lord Jesus we shall be more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors:
<hi>For the God of peace shall tread him under
our feet,</hi> Rom.xvi. While he is there, let him nibble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the feet, it is no great matter, yet 'tis all he can do,
and let him do it. <hi>Manducet terram meam, &amp; dentem
carni infigat,</hi> let him bite the dust (saith <hi>Ambrose,</hi>) it
was his original curse: let him eat that part of me which
is earth, let him bruise my body, all this is still but to
tread upon my heel: my comfort is, there is a seed of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
life in my Soul, which no power of the enemy is able
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46181:206"/>
to approach, much less to overcome and extinguish; for
the spirit doth not only live, but is life, life eternal. <hi>The
spirit is life, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet that we may more fully understand to whom
these consolations belong, and what spirits they are that
can live in death and injoy the comforts of life when
their bodies can live no longer, it is added because of
righteousness. <hi>The spirit is life, because of righteousness,</hi>
or for righteousness sake. The righteous then, these are
they to whom it belongs, these only are the holy Spirits
that shall revive in the midst of life and live in death, as
they died while they lived: whilst the body lived, they
died unto sin; and when the body dies, they shall live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. For as the life of the Soul, is the comfort of the
heart; so the spirit of righteousness, is the life of the
Soul. And therefore deceive not thy self in a matter of
such moment, in the business of thine everlasting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
but be most assured that so far forth thou dost live
as thou art sanctified, and no farther. As health is to
the body, so is holiness to the spirit. A body without
health falls out of one pain into another, till it die; and
a Soul without holiness is polluted with one lust af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, till it perish eternally: As the Moon hath
light more or less, as it is in aspect with the Sun; so the
Soul enjoys life, less or more, as it is turned or averted
to or from the Lord of life whose righteousness only can
give life, (as this life, peace and joy) unto the Soul. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
are those wicked ones, that want both, they are
as St.<hi>Jude</hi> speaks, <hi>bis mortui,</hi> twice dead; that is, dead
both in body and Soul. Their Souls indeed do live and
shall live eternally, a natural life, but there is a life of
Grace as well as of Nature; by the one the Soul lives for
ever, by the other it lives for ever in happiness. This life,
they do not, they shall not ever live; and as for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
the Spirit of God accounts that but a death, whilst
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:46181:207"/>
they live in the body, he saith they are dead in sins; and
when they go out of the body, though they live, yet he
calls their life, and justly, an eternal death. Immortality
seems to be added rather to their sorrow, than to their
Souls: Since their Souls are only kept immortal that
their punishment might be everlasting. It is true
that so long as Men enjoy this natural life in health of
body and prosperity of fortune, the loss that comes
by want of the spiritual life is not so safely discerned;
no more than the defects of a ruinous house are known
in time of fair weather: but when the storm of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when the tempest of death shall come pouring down
upon him; then the decaies and breaches will manifest
themselves. How woful then must his condition needs
be, that hath now no other life but a natural, and must
now part with that, and he knows not whither? In this
estate he cannot but die either uncertain of comfort; or
rather most certain of Condemnation. And therefore it
is not much to be marvelled they are so loth to think or
so much as to hear of that final and fatal time. <hi>O death,
how bitter is thy remembrance unto such,</hi> saith the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
How doth the only apprehension thereof even chill
the blood in his veins &amp; kill the very marrow in his bones?
<hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s doom is no sooner written upon the wall,
but the joints of his loins are loosed and his knees smite
one against another. How did that one word of the
Witch strike <hi>Saul</hi> thorough and thorough, leaving him
tumbling on the earth in a swoon. <hi>To morrow by this
time thou and thy sons shall be with me?</hi> so bitter
indeed is the remembrance even of bodily death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those that have no spiritual life in their Souls. But
what misery may we think will there be in the endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and suffering of that whose only expectation is so
fearful?</p>
            <p>Sad and fearful is the departure of the wicked though it
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:46181:207"/>
outwardly appear not in all: the comforts of my Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not to them: as their Spirits were dead whilest
they lived, so they shall not live when they die. Where
there is no righteousness, there can be no life, <hi>For the
Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> No, the righteous, the righteous that is
the faithful and penitent Souls, these are they, who as
they have the true spiritual life in present, so in death
they shall have the true comforts of the blessed life
which is to come; for however God at other times
brings trouble, heaviness and afflictions on his best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
yet at that hour he never fails to assist them,
and in the midst of death to make the life of their Souls
appear more clearly for righteousness sake. He may
seem to absent himself from them and to hide his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> but then in that day of need, in that
last and fearful time, which most requires it, they shall be
sure of his comforts, he will not fail then to discover his
face and make the light of his countenance to shine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that region of darkness, and by the gracious beams
thereof to chear up his people, lighting and guiding their
feet through that obscure Valley and shadow of death
into the blessed ways of immortality and peace. Believe
not me, look upon the holy men of God a little and see
it perfomed with your Eyes. Behold the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi>
the Father of the Patriarchs, he who wrestled not
only that one time at the River <hi>Jabbock,</hi> but all his
life long with the arme of the Almighty continually
afflicting him: But see how contrary it fell out in the end,
when all the clouds of affliction being blown over, a
calm of contentment follows and he is gathered unto his
Fathers in peace: but first mark how the Lord gave him
strength before he went hence and was no more seen,
wherewith he collects his fainting Spirits, raiseth himself
in his bed, calls his Sons about him, tells them of things
to come, great things to come for many generations, and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:46181:208"/>
with an inspired Spirit ready to expire gives every one his
several blessing and benediction in such a prophetical, so
high and Heavenly a strain and stile, as if an Angel had sate
on his lip, and I doubt not but many Angels sate waiting
in that door of the body for the coming forth of his
Soul (which stayed not long after) to receive and convey
it into the bosom of his Grand-father <hi>Abraham</hi> there to
rest in everlasting peace. Look upon <hi>Joshua</hi> that valiant
Captain, who having spent his life in travail and more
than Herculean labours, warring against Gyants and the
Sons of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ak:</hi> yet at last you may see him sitting down
in peace and dividing the spoil among the Children of
<hi>Jacob:</hi> And in the end death drawing near, see how he
summons the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> together and in a sweet Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
recounts unto them all the mercies of God which had
followed them from <hi>Terab</hi> the Father of <hi>Abraham</hi> that
dwelt beyond the flood, to <hi>Cheusem</hi> that had now gotten
possession of the promised land within <hi>Jordan.</hi> And
being full of the spirit and spiritual life, with such power
of speech he exhorts them to the fear and service of this
merciful God, that the whole Congregation as if they
had had but one heart and one Soul, and both throughly
affected, joyntly cry out, <hi>God forbid that we should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Lord, nay he is our God and we will serve him,
Josh</hi> the last. After this manner from the flame of his
own zeal, having kindled a fire in the hearts of others,
this great Worthy and worthy Servant of the Lord, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in his death, and dyed in peace. See holy <hi>Samuel</hi> the
Judge of <hi>Israel</hi> going to his grave as to his bed, and in him
consider the power and vertue of a good conscience arising
from the memory of a well acted life, <hi>Whose Ox or whose
Ass have I taken, whom have I defrauded or opprest, or at
whose hands have I received a bribe,</hi> saith he in the publick
assembly, and <hi>all the people bare witness unto him,</hi> saith
the Text. <hi>Hoc ducit ad f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nus &amp; sepulturam,</hi> this is it that
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:46181:208"/>
accompanies him to his Grave, and layes him in his rotten
Sepulcher. The like blessed savour of rest did this peace of
conscience send forth in the blessed Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in
that wonderful confidence was bold to deliver up his Soul
in the breath of the same words, as it were, his Saviour
had done before him, a <hi>Consummatum est, I have finished
my course, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up
for me, a Crown of righteousness which the Lord the
just Judge shall give me in that day:</hi> words worthy of
a Soul so near its Heaven. Lastly, view the Protomartyr
<hi>Steven,</hi> blessed with peace in the midst of a cruel death,
for all torments are easy if they have answerable comforts.
The obstinate Jews threw the stones of death at him but
he filled with the Holy Ghost, looks stedfastly into
Heaven, where he beholds his Saviour standing at the
right hand of God, to whom now dying he speaks as he
had done before to his Father, <hi>in manus tuas, into thy
hands O Lord I commend my Spirit.</hi> Such have been the
blessed ends of these holy men of God, and of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
famous in their Generations: and such it shall be in
all others that faithfully serve him, though peradventure
it is not manifest in all. Their bodies are buried in the
Earth, but they have left a name behind them, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
sweeter than the perfume made by the art of the
Apothecary, as was spoken of the good King <hi>Josiah.</hi> And
what is there now that can more deeply affect an honest
and a good heart: what can a religious mind either so
much desire unto it self, or behold with so great joy in
another, as to see a devout and penitent Soul give a
peaceful farewel unto Nature, and in the depth of death,
depart full of the comforts of immortality and life? But
it may be far off examples will be left too far off respects;
for likely those that are nearest do affect us better: if so,
you want them not neither, two among the rest more
remarkable you have had of late. The one not long
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:46181:209"/>
since, the other now before your eyes: The Mother and
the Daughter: of both whom I may truly say, in the words
of my Text, their bodies were dead while they lived, and
their Souls lived in the death of their bodies for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
sake. A memorable and exemplary couple, I may
well join them in my speech, they were so many ways
joined in themselves. They were joined in affinity and
alliance: they were joined in affection and love: they
were joined in the quality and nature of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and would not be severed till death did it: in
the time of their sickness they were joined in the
comforts of death, and now they are joined in the
glory of an everlasting life. But the formers rites are
passed; yet they might not be now passed over; I
cannot but give her a touch, she desired it from me,
and I am sure she deserved it. For the latter here now
in your sight, I shall not speak much because I can
hardly speak enough: with her former times I have had
no acquaintance, and therefore can make no relation of it,
only I assure my self that she who was so patient and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
in her sickness, so devout and cheerful in her
death, could not but be well and religiously disposed in
the course of her life. But for the latter part of her days
them I have known, and in them been an eye-witness of
the expression of more goodness, than I have often
seen, or from a Woman of her quality, could have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
The things of note which I especially observed in
her and shall commend unto you are principally these:
her willingness to entertain death, and her deadness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world and worldly affairs, her joy in spiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and her frequency and fervency in devout pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
For the first, if we consider the impediments, it was
much she should do it so cheerfully: she was but young
and entring upon the prime of her years. She had small
and tender Infants of her own, that went near her: she
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:46181:209"/>
was well bestowed where she found both youth and
love and means too, wanted nothing nor was likely to
want: <hi>&amp; haec sunt quae faciunt homines invitos mori,</hi>
and these are the things that make Men unwilling to die,
could the Philosopher say. Yet notwithstanding all these
she gently submitted her self unto it: she resolutely went
forth to meet it, and lest he should miss her, she call'd
it unto her, Come gentle death, and even held forth her
arms to receive and embrace it. For the second, I was
with her often, yet never heard a word of worldly matter
or secular affair, so much as fall from her tongue: Her
heart was bent on Heaven which made it delight so much
in heavenly contemplations; they came down upon her,
as the Scripture speaks, like rain into a fleece of wooll and
as a shower upon a thirsty land. With what an open and
greedy ear did she suck in celestial comforts, which she
shortly after vented out again in devout supplications,
wherein the mercy of the Lord did not forsake her even
to the last gasp? And then at last when her hands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
her tongue, and her tongue had almost forsaken
her heart, yet her heart did still adhere unto God in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant
prayer, and therefore she intreated others to hold
her fainting hands, that her tongue failing they at least
might testify that her Soul did commune with her Maker.
It calls to mind the story of <hi>Moses</hi> having <hi>Aaron</hi> and
<hi>Hur</hi> to support his arms, for whilst he prayed, <hi>Amalek</hi>
fled and <hi>Joshua</hi> conquered. Sure I am whilst she did in
like manner, the true <hi>Joshua</hi> conquered all the spiritual
<hi>Amalekites,</hi> and enemies of her Soul, who only could
batter down the prison of her body, that her spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loose and at liberty, might freely clear the air and
mount up to the desired place of everlasting rest: where
she now is, and where may she still in peace remain till
another day shall invest both Body and Soul with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
glory. Who can now mourn, who can weep
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:46181:210"/>
for such a Soul? if ye do, they must be tears of joy not
of sorrow, at least they must be for your selves not for
her. You may bewail your own loss, you cannot grieve
at her death, unless you envy her happiness: <hi>foelix iss a
anima, imitationem desiderat non planctum,</hi> that happy
Soul is no subject of sorrow but a pattern of imitation.
And therefore I now leave the dead, and conclude to the
living, that their Spirits may live in death, as hers hath
shown them the example. For this should be the chief en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
this should be the principal care of a Christian
in his whole life, that when his life shall end, yet the
life of his Soul may not end with the death of his body.
It little matters how it fares with us in the rest of our
time, so it go well with us here; when if wrath overtake
us it shall eleave unto us for ever, but if peace end our days,
our days afterwards of peace shall never end. For as the
tree falleth there it shall lie. Wretched Men that can wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
think of any thing save this that infinitely concerns
them above all things else! that can wish with <hi>Balaam,
let me die the death of the righteous and let my last
end be like his,</hi> but never endeavour themselves in the
works of righteousness whereby they may procure it; as
if they might be like them in their death whom they
refused to imitate in their actions. But they may wish
like <hi>Solomons</hi> fool till their tongue cleave to their gums,
for so long as they live the life of <hi>Balaam, loving the
wages of iniquity,</hi> they shall never die the death of the
righteous nor have their last end like his whom they are
nothing like in conversation. No if the Soul then live, it
must be as my Text hath it, for righteousness sake. Set
thy self therefore to it seriously and speedily. Wise Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
make many days preparation for a field that must be
fought in one. Beloved, let us be wise too and lay up
something every day, for the last, when we shall wrestle
with death. If we win that skirmish we have enough;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:46181:210"/>
but where or when or how soon we shall be called to the
conflict, who can tell? be not secure therefore, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
not on the last hour; it may come suddenly upon
thee: flatter not thy self and thy sins, and frame not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
unto thine own Soul. Send not Religion before thee
unto thine old age; whither peradventure thou shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come, or else come hardned through the deceitfulness
of sin. Give not thy youth and strength unto Satan, and
then when thou art low drawn, and upon the lees, think
to present God with the dregs of thy life. What a folly
were it for thee to adventure thy surest, thy everlasting
weal or wo, making or marring, on so sandy and sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a foundation? how much better were it for thee to
remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth before
the evil day come, and thou say I have no delight here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
that thy Creator may not forget thee in thine old
age, when strength faileth and Man returneth to his long
home. Sure <hi>in these great water-floods we shall hardly
come nigh him,</hi> and therefore let us seek his face while
he may be found, and make our prayers in an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time. So shall our petitions be heard, and we in all
our tribulations, in the hour of death, and in the day of
judgment (as we desire) be most assuredly delivered:
finding comfort in our life, and life in our last end. And
what is all the wealth and honour, pomp and glory of the
world in comparison of this? They may yield discontents
enough as being gotten with travel, kept with care, and
lost with grief; but can never give any true satisfaction
to the Soul, especially in that last and perillous time which
most requires it.</p>
            <p>Surely every Mans thought is a secret watch unto his
own heart: let him then ask his own Soul, and it will
tell him, <hi>versa &amp; reversa in tergum, in latera, in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem,
dura sunt omnia, Christus solus requies:</hi> muse
and forecast, toss and turn, all the night long from side
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:46181:211"/>
to side; still, still no true ease nor true contentment, no
perfect joy to be found but in the sweet peace of a good
Conscience sprinkled and washed with the blood of Jesus
Christ the Prince of peace. All other things fail us at our
death, and therefore are unworthy of our care whilst
we live. No, no, Thoughts of remorse and joyes of
sorrow, silent moans and melting tears, an heart truly
humbled, and a Spirit ever setled chearfully to live and
willing to die, in the loving arms of a gracious Redeemer,
this is the prize, this is the Crown we should contend
for; and this is the way, now to live a Saint on Earth
and ever hereafter to injoy an exceeding and an eternal
weight of glory in the highest Heavens. Which the Lord
of all glory grant unto us for and in the meritorious
Passion of his Son Christ Jesus our Lord. To whom with
the blessed Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
