         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Treatiſe, in way of a brotherly Anſwer to
reverend Maſter <hi>Herle;</hi> I now preſent unto
thy view a defence thereof againſt ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
and anſwers as have been returned
to ſundry paſſages therein, by reverend and learned
Maſter <hi>Rutherfurd.</hi> In which undertaking it hath been
farre from my intention to increaſe or uphold the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
that have appeared of late yeares in <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ſervants of the Lord, about matters of
Church government. For I had much rather bring Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and teares for the quenching of ſuch fires, then fewell
or oyle for the increaſing thereof: neither ſhall the ſame
I hope, be any thing at all increaſed by what here I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
now thy view. At the leaſt this I may ſay, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:114129:3"/>
no ſuch thing but the contrary, even the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of truth and peace, if it were the will of God ſo to
bleſſe my deſires and endeavors. True it is, I have taken
the liberty to conſider and try ſome things delivered by
that reverend brother whom here I have to doe withall,
but this I truſt cannot be juſtly offenſive, in as much as
<hi>the Spirit of the Prophets is Subject to the Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.
32. and the doctrine of the Apoſtle himſelfe was examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thoſe noble Bereans, whom the holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
<hi>for ſearching the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe
things were ſo</hi> Act. 17. 11. It is alſo true which our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
brother ſaith in his Epiſtle to the Reader, <q>before
his <hi>Peaceable Plea,</hi> that there is great cauſe of ſorrow
that all the Lords people ſhould not minde one thing,
and ſing one ſong, and joyne in one againſt the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </q> Nevertheleſſe, this may be ſome comfort
againſt this ſorrow, that by the providence of the Lord
this diverſity of opinions and diſputes, if it be Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried as it may, may occaſion and produce in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
the further clearing up of truth. <q>For as our author
well obſerveth, from the Colliſion of opinions reſulteth
truth:</q> and diſputes as ſtricken flints caſt fire for light.
<hi>Due Right of Presbyt. Epiſtle to the Reader.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and hope whereof, together with the advice of ſuch
brethren as I conſulted withall, was that which chiefely
prevailed with me for the publiſhing of this reply, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the reader will finde ſundry Scriptures and queſtions
controverted in theſe times, diſcuſſed and conſidered ſo
farre as the nature of a Reply or defence did lead thereto;
and I hope ſome or other through Gods bleſſing may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome profit thereby. And if the humble Chriſtian
who deſires to know, and love and practiſe the truth,
<pb facs="tcp:114129:3"/>
ſhall receive any benefit or help for attaining theſe ends
by meanes of this labour of mine, it is that which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and aimed at, and for which I deſire that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
may have the praiſe and glory. If any ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
otherwiſe minded; yet in due time I hope God
ſhall reveale even this unto them. In the meane time, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of apprehenſions in theſe points ought not to bred any
alienation of affection amongſt thoſe that are otherwiſe
Orthodoxe, and ſincere. It were a thouſand pitties, if it
ſhould. For my part, I cannot but approve what this
<q>reverend brother ſometime profeſſeth, that he doth
both love and diſpute, contradict and reverence at once:
<hi>Peaceable Plea:</hi> Epiſt. Yea, he counts himſelfe a debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
for love, charity, honour and all due reſpect in
Chriſt Jeſus, and a ſeat and lodging in his heart and
higheſt eſteeme to all thoſe that be godly, lovers of the
truth, and ſufferers for the truth againſt Prelacy,
though poſſibly they like not well of Preſbyteriall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:</q>
               <hi>ibid.</hi> In anſwer whereto (for I would be
loth that ſuch love ſhould be loſt upon us, without due
returne of the like) I would for my part profeſſe the like
deare and due reſpect to all thoſe that are qualifyed as
here he doth deſcribe (of which ſort I know there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
though poſſibly they may like better of the way that
is called Preſbyteriall, then of the Congregationall. For
thoſe that give apparent Teſtimonies that they are the
Lord's, and ſo that they muſt live together in heavens, I
know not why they ſhould not love one another on earth,
what ever differences of apprehenſions may for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
be found amongſt them in ſome things. As for bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe
of ſpirit and tartneſſe of conteſts, I never
thought that to be Gods way of promoting truth amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:114129:4"/>
brethren, and therefore I have endevoured in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to avoid the ſame. For I beleeve there is more
hope of doing good by ſolidity of argument with a ſpirit
of meekneſſe and love, then by ſharp and tart language,
the fruit of bitterneſſe of ſpirit, wherein for the moſt part
right of reaſon is wanting, the paſſions being there moſt
vehement and ſtirring, where the intellectuals are moſt

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeble and weake.</p>
            <p>Now if any aske why this defence hath been ſo long
deferred, it being now two yeares and more ſince Maſter
<hi>Rutherfurd</hi> his due right of Preſbyt. came forth, ſuch
may be pleaſed to conſider that New <hi>England</hi> being
as 'tis counted 3000 miles diſtant from old; therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Books may be extant in <hi>England</hi> a long time afore we
that are ſo remote can ſo much as heare any ſound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and thoſe few that come to our knowledge, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
extant in <hi>England</hi> a matter of a yeares ſpace afore,
and ſometimes longer. In which reſpect many things
may be ſpoken and Printed againſt us, whereto it cannot
be expected that we ſhould returne any ſpeedy Anſwer.
And though it be now twelve moneths agoe or more ſince
Maſter <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> his due right of Preſbyt. came to my
hands, yet at that time my few ſpare houres from my
conſtant and ordinary employments were wholly taken
up otherwiſe, ſo that I could not attend this buſineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſooner: which I deſire may be accepted as a juſt apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
for the late coming forth of this Reply; which as it
may ſeeme late, ſo it is more large then in ſome reſpect
I could have deſired, by reaſon that I doe uſually tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
thoſe words of Maſter <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> whereto I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
apply my Anſwer; which courſe I confeſſe I did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
(in ſome reſpects) chuſe, partly to ſave the
<pb facs="tcp:114129:4"/>
Reader a labour of turning to the place in Maſter <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furd</hi>
which I am ſpeaking too; which elſe he muſt have
done, or have taken things upon my report upon truſt;
and partly that my candid and faire dealing with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
whom I have to doe withall might the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
For when a mans words are not kept, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
and others ſubſtituted in their place, his minde
and meaning may ſoone be miſtaken, and repreſented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
unto the Reader. Which is a practiſe that I have
often ſeene, but never approved; and therefore I have
not uſed it. For I would be loth to wrong any man;
ſpecially a man of ſuch worth as I take Maſter <hi>Rutherfurd</hi>
to be, by imputing to him what he doth not teach nor
deliver: and for this cauſe it is that I have uſually tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
and expreſſed his owne words; and by this
meanes my booke is growne to the greater bulk.</p>
            <p>One thing more I would advertiſe the Reader of, and
then I ſhall quickly have done: the figures from 185
and ſo forward, noting the number of the Pages in
Maſter <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> his Treatiſe, are ſet downe twice
therein, once in their proper place, and againe after the
page 484. Wherefore if any of theſe pages be quoted in
this Reply, as ſome of them are, if the thing that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
be not found in the page that is named, looke for
it in the other place of the booke where are the ſame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and there you may finde it.</p>
            <p>Courteous Reader, ſtudy the truth in a way of Piety
and peace: Be zealous for it, but loſe not love to the
Saints: beware, when the world is filled with diſputes
about diſcipline, that thou be not drawne onely to erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
opinions in maine matters of doctrine. Be ſure to
practiſe and expreſſe the power of Godlineſſe in humility
<pb facs="tcp:114129:5"/>
of minde, mortification of thy own corruption, faith
in the Lord Jeſus, and love to all his redeemed; and be
not by any meanes drawne away from theſe things, which
doe ſo mainly conduce to thy ſalvation. Finally as the
Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8, 9. whatſoever things are true,
whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt,
whatſoever things are lovely, pure, and of good report,
if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, thinke on
theſe things, and doe them; and the God of peace ſhall
be with thee. Improve I pray ſuch intereſt as thou haſt
in God through the mediator, by affording the help of
thy Prayers for me, who am</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeare 1643. there came forth a Treatiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Independency, under the name of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
and learned Brother Mr. <hi>Charles Herle,</hi>
the Paſtor of <hi>Winwick</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
becauſe it ſeemed to bee written with ſuch a
Candid and peaceable ſpirit as might witneſſe for
its Author that the thing he aymed at therein was
meerly the diſquiſition of the Truth; and becauſe the Author thereof
was many yeares agoe of my Reverend brother M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tompſons</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and mine; therefore we thought it might not be in vaine if we
ſhould lovingly communicate to the learned Author ſuch apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ours, whereby wee were detained from concurring with his
judgement in the principall Queſtion diſputed in the ſaid Treatiſe.
And therefore in the latter end of the ſame yeare, there came forth a
ſmall Script under our Name in way of a brotherly Anſwer to that his
loving and learned Treatiſe. Againſt this Anſwer Mr. <hi>Samuell Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi>
a learned writer of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath alledged and
publiſhed many Objections. Exceptions, and Anſwers, in his Booke
entituled <hi>The due right of Presbyteries:</hi> I may call them many, becauſe
in that Treatiſe of his there are no leſſe then 24 or 25 ſeverall places,
wherein he bring up by name the ſaid Anſwer, diſputing againſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
paſſages therein as if they were not ſound; which paſſages if they
be indeed erronious and unſound, are a great many to bee contained

much more then the places therein which this learned Writer doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

And having ſo done, I here preſent my apprehentions to publike view,

Tell the Church,</hi> I know no reaſon why hee ſhould bring thoſe words of mine at ſuch

which hee hath ſet downe or ſuch like, in the place by him alledged; yet that they
were brought by me for ſuch purpoſe as hee doth report <hi>(viz.</hi> For the cleering of
Doubts concerning the meaning of <hi>Math. 18 17.)</hi> that I doe utterly deny. He that
ſhall looke upon the Chapter and Pages alledged, will find that I doe not there med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
at all with that Scripture, either for one purpoſe or another; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be truly ſaid to have uſed the words alledged, in way of cleering Doubts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſame. And albeit in another place, (cap. 3. pag. 22. <hi>et ſequ.)</hi> I doe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
ſpeake to that Scripture; yet in that place there is no mention at all of the
words by him alledged nor of any ſuch like, and where ſuch words are to be found,
there that Scripture is not mentioned at all. Now who knoweth not that a man may
be much wronged, when the words which hee hath ſpoken are taken and applyed to
ſuch a purpoſe, for which he did never bring them nor intend them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:114129:8"/>
But to let this paſſe, let us heare what our Reverend Author ſaith againſt the
words alledged, in his Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of Appeales, ſaith he, is not becauſe inferiour Iudicatures
may erre, for ſo wee might appeale from all Iudicatures, even from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councill, for it may erre, Pag. 315. lin. ult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is not this the very ſame that was ſaid in the Anſwer, Pag. 13, 14. The
pages which hee here undertakes to anſwer, is it not there ſaid; <hi>As for Claſſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Provinciall, and Nationall Synods, there is none of theſe but thoſe
Caſes of deficiency and poſſibility of Partiality may befall the beſt of
them; and therefore if for theſe cauſes the ſingle Congregations may not
be indep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndant, but there may be Appeales from them, the Synods being
ſubject to the like, there may bee liberty of Appeales from them alſo—.
For as the Congregations may be partiall and erre, ſo we ſuppoſe it will not
be denyed but the Claſſis may erre, the Provinciall Synod may erre, the
Nationall may erre, yea generall Councils may erre; and ſo by this reaſon
not Synods nor generall Councils may have entireneſſe of Juriſdiction,
but there may be liberty of Appeales from them alſo.</hi> Theſe are our words
in thoſe very Pages which here Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> pretends to Anſwer and diſprove or
confute. But in ſtead of a Confutation we ſee we have nothing but a plaine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
or affirmation of his owne, that the thing is even ſo as was affirmed by us
before. Now why hee ſhould make a ſhow of taking away or weak'ning that which
we had ſaid, and then in ſtead of accompliſhing what he undertakes, to doe no more
but onely to ſay the ſame thing againe which wee had ſaid before, what reaſon I
ſay he had for this I know not; but plaine it is that for the particular in hand, the
Anſwer which he pretends to weaken, is not yet weakned at all, but rather ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and confirmed by his apparent yeelding the Cauſe, and affirming the ſame that
was before affirmed by us.</p>
               <p>But ſaith hee Pag. 316. The true cauſe <hi>(viz.</hi> of Appealing to higher
Courts) is, 1. Becauſe they doe not ſo frequently erre. 2. They are not ſo
inclined and diſpoſed to erre; for many eyes ſee more then one, and doe
more ſeldome miſcarry in taking up the right Object: 3. Becauſe wee
conceive more equality and leſſe partiality in higher Courts.</p>

               <p>If any aske why may not this Conſequence be owned? Why may wee not ſay,
there muſt bee liberty of Appeales from all Synods and Presbyteries, except onely
the generall Councill? The Anſwer is, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t wee may not ſo ſay; becauſe then
Cauſes would be too long depending a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ore they could come to iſſue, yea perhaps
would never come to iſſue as long as this world ſhall endure: For by this Rule
they may by Appeales upon appeales be protracted untill they be brought to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councill to be determined there. Now as there hath not beene any ſuch
Councill for many Ages by-paſt, ſo it is very uncertaine when there will be one
aſſembled, whether ever or never whilſt this world ſtands. But wee thinke <hi>Christ
Jeſus</hi> hath provided better for his Church then ſo, and hath not appointed ſuch a
neceſſitie of Appeales upon appeales, but that Cauſes may bee determined afore
any generall Councill can be aſſembled.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if ſuch Aſſemblies might be frequently attained, yet it is not yet cleered,
that when they are aſſembled they have any power of Iuriſdiction at all; but onely
a Doctrinall power to cleare up the Rule, the power of Iuriſdiction remaining in
ſome other Aſſembly. Sure it is, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> thus teacheth expreſly, for his
words are theſe; <hi>Verily I profeſſe I cannot ſee what power of Juriſdiction

<hi>Becauſe ordinary Communion faileth when you goe higher then a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Church, and Christ's way ſuppoſeth an ordinary Communion—;
therefore I deny that this remedy is needfull in any Church above a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall

Cenſure Scandals not needfull in a generall Councill, yea and hee ſeriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
that hee cannot ſee that ſuch a Councill if it could bee had, hath any power
of Iuriſdiction at all to cenſure Scandals. Which being ſo, it muſt needs follow,
that Scandals muſt be cenſured, and Cauſes ended ſomewhere elſe, afore they can

and having many eyes doe more ſeldome miſcarry in taking up the right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
For this Cauſe is moſt properly appliable to the generall Councill, unto

touch the contrary, I would wiſh no more favour of ſuch a one but to peruſe the

               <p>I know indeed there are ſome places in him which doe looke another way; as that

power, that the Court of a Catholick Councill can not in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

of</hi> Due Right, <hi>page 308. And a little after hee ſaith, He ſeeth nothing
to prove that a generall Councill hath not power to Excommunicate a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Church. Yea and further, that if there were a generall Councill
at this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enſuing he ſaith, This of our Saviour, <hi>Tell the Church, is neceſſarily to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to all Churches and Courts of Christ, even to a Catholick Councill.</hi>
Theſe Places I confeſſe doe ſeeme to me not very well to agree with the either afore
alledged: For in the one he plainly affirmes, there is in generall Councils power
of Iuriſdiction to cenſure Scanda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and in the other hee doth as plainly deny the
ſame. But it is the former places and not theſe latter which I doe ſtand upon; in
which former as I conceive him to hold the truth, ſo for ought I ſee, that which
hee ſaith in this place wee have in hand about the true cauſe of Appealing from
Congregations to Synods is much infirmed thereby. For how can that be taken to
be the true cauſe of Appeales, which is moſt properly found in ſuch Aſſemblies (I

               <p>To conclude this Chapter: When wee doe enquire about Power of appealing,

the beſt way is to enquire where the Lord <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> hath placed the Power of the

they are under no command, in Church and Common-wealth? I ſuppoſe it will
not follow at all. Or ſhall we ſay, that Claſſes and Provinciall Synods have no
right to end their own matters within themſelves, if a Nationall Synod have power
to command them? Or if they have ſuch right, ſhall we therefore ſay they are not
under the command of the Nationall Synod, and that the Nationall Synod hath no
power over them but only by way of Counſell and adviſe? Wee ſuppoſe Maſter

being about the power of that meeting <hi>Acts</hi> 15. There is nothing in the place
alledged by Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> that can warrant him to frame ſuch an Objection
under Maſter <hi>Tompſons</hi> name and mine, as proceeding from us: And the reaſon is,
becauſe that meeting <hi>Acts</hi> 15, is not mentioned at all in the place by him alledged,
neither for that purpoſe which he ſets down, nor for any other; much loſſe is the
Objection ours in <hi>Terminis.</hi> Now to frame an Objection, and to alledge chapter
and page for proofe that the Objection is ours, when as neither page nor chapter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
do ſpeake any thing at all of that matter, what reaſon can be given for this
I know not.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, becauſe the matter contayned in the Objection doth not much
differ from my apprehenſion and judgement, and ſomething in the anſwer elſewhere
may poſſibly intimate ſuch a thing, though but briefly touched, I will therefore
conſider of what he ſaith for removing the Objection as himſelfe hath propounded
the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is falſe, ſaith he, that there is no cenſuring of perſons here, for—it
is more then evident that the publike Synodicall cenſure of rebuke is put
upon thoſe who held and urged the neceſſity of Circumciſion, and why not
Excommunication alſo in caſe of obſtinacy? For the Synodicall cenſure
of a publike Synodicall rebuke is only gradually different, not ſpecifically
from excommunication, &amp; both muſt proceed from ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> &amp; the ſame power.
<hi>So then the ſumme is, the Synod had power of rebuking, and therefore of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Conſequence is not cleere, for who knoweth not that there may be
power to rebuke, where there is no power of Excommunication? Is it not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
Law of God, that every man ſhall plainly rebuke his Neighbour and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſin upon him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17? And are not our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> words as plaine, if thy
brother treſpaſle againſt thee rebuke him, and if he repent forgive him, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 3?
Whereby it is evident that one particular perſon hath power by the Law of God and
Chriſt to put a rebuke upon another, if there be occaſion for it. But will it follow
hereupon that one particular Chriſtian hath power to Excommunicate another in
caſe of Obſtinacy? I ſuppoſe Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> will not ſay ſo; and yet unleſſe
this be ſaid, I know not how his Conſequence can be made good, that if a Synod
may rebuke, they may Excommunicate alſo. I know indeed he ſaith, the Synodicall
rebuke is only gradually different from Excommunication, and not ſpecifically,
and that both muſt proceed from one and the ſame Power. But this would require
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114129:12"/>
ſome proofe, and ſhould not nakedly be affirmed without any proofe at all. For of it
ſelfe it is not evident, that where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ver there is power to rebuke, there is power
of Excommunication alſo. The contrary I ſuppoſe is evident from that which hath
already been ſaid from <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. and <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 3. and from many other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and reaſons, which ſhew that one man alone hath power to rebuke, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

from us, and have troubled you with words, ſubverting your Soules, &amp;c.
That this Aſſembly doth not only in a Doctrinall way confute the falſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
and Doctrine of theſe teachers of Circumciſion, but doth alſo rebuke
them for another fault, to wit; their obtruding their falſe way upon the
Soules and Conſciences of others, and for their wilfull and obſtinate uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that opinion and rayſing a Schiſme in the Church.</hi> But if all this were
granted his purpoſe were not gained thereby, unleſſe he would prove that which he
doth but only affirme, to wit, <hi>That a Synodicall rebuke is not ſpecifically dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
but only gradually from Excommunication,</hi> and that both muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

                  </gap> he hath not proved at all.</p>
               <p>But ſaith he, I argue thus: If the Apoſtles do not only in a Doctrinall
way refute a falſe Doctrine in this Synod, but alſo in Church way and by a
Juridicall power do rebuke and Synodically charge the Authors as ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Soules, and Lyers, then they doe not onely uſe a meere Doctrinall
power in this Synod, but alſo a Juridicall power: but the former is true:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> With favour of ſo learned a man, I thinke this kind of argu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng is but a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the thing in queſtion, and a proving of <hi>Idem per Idem.</hi> For if the Synod did
not only in a Doctrinall way refute a falſe Doctrine, but alſo by a Iuridicall power
rebuke the Authors of it, then it muſt needs be true indeed that they did not only uſe
a Doctrinall power, but alſo a Iuridicall power; that is, If they did ſo, they did ſo:
if they did uſe ſuch power, they did uſe it. But there ſtill lyes the queſtion, whether
they did ſo or no: and whether they did uſe ſuch power or not, and this kind of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doth not cleere it all. If we on the contrary ſhould argue thus, if this Aſſembly
did not put forth any power of Iuriſdiction or Diſcipline, but only in a Doctrinall
way con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then our learned Author, would ſoone eſpy the looſeneſſe of ſuch reaſoning: at

friend your Logick is naught, page 177. And yet (be it ſpoke without offence) the

the truth to be otherwiſe. For Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> himſelfe confeſſes Page 394.
<hi>That there is great odds to do one and the ſame action materially, and to

thence to be in a Synod. The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, that this will not helpe at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this is nothing but the bringing in of another Efficient, <hi>viz.</hi> The Synod,
for effecting or acting the ſame effect. Now Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> confeſſeth pag. 393.
<hi>That he doth not fetch the ſpecification of this rebuke and of thoſe Decrees
from the efficient cauſes; and gives that for his reaſon, which to me is
unanſwerable, to wit, becauſe one Apoſtle might himſelfe alone have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
theſe obtruders of Circumciſion:</hi> And in the page next enſuing he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
alſo, that actions have not by good Logick their totall ſpecification from the
efficient cauſe. Which being ſo, then though it were granted that any Synod may,
and that this Synod did performe this action of rebuking, yet the thing in queſtion,
to wit, that the power of a Synod is a power of Iuriſdiction and of Excommunication
is not at all gained thereby.</p>
               <p>At the leaſt wiſe (to end this paſſage) this I may ſay, that if this Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will be true to his own Principles, and not gainſay what himſelfe hath already
written, he for his part cannot conclude the Synods power to Excommunicate from
this argument of their power to rebuke, nor yet from any other argument whatſoever:
and the reaſon is, becauſe he doth elſewhere confeſſe that Synods are not to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
any, and not this Synod in particular to Excommunicate theſe falſe teachers,
but to remit the cenſuring of them to other Churches, Commanding them to doe it.
His words as they are to be ſeene in his Page 413. are theſe, <hi>viz. I could eaſily
yeeld that there is no neceſſity of the Elicit acts of many parts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch as Excommunication, Ordination, admitting of Heathens, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the Faith to Church-memberſhip, in Synods Provincicall, Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
or Oecumenicall; but that Synods in the eaſe of neglect of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rycall
Churches, Command theſe particular Churches whom it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to doe their duty: and in this ſence</hi> Act. 15. <hi>Is to remit the cenſure
of Excommunication to the Presbytery of</hi> Antioch <hi>and</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>in
caſe of the obſtinacy of theſe obtruders of Circumciſion.</hi> In which words we
have two things concerning Excommunication (to omit other particulars) firſt, that
there is no neceſſity that Synods ſhould Excommunicate any, but only command the
Churches to do their duty therein. Secondly, in particular concerning that Synod
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114129:13"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 15. That they were to remit the cenſure of Excommunication to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in caſe of the obſtinacy of theſe obtruders or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.
Which particulars being moſt true (as I for my part ſo eſteeme of them) it
followes thereupon, that what Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſaith in this place we have now in
hand, is greatly weakned thereby. For how both theſe can ſtand together, that this
Synod ſhould have power not only to rebuke, but to Excommunicate theſe falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and yet neither Provinciall, Nationall, nor Oecumenicall Synods to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
any, nor this Synod in particular to Excommunicate theſe falſe teachers,
but to remit the cenſure to other Churches to whom it concerned, commanding them
to do it, how theſe things I ſay can ſtand together, I for my part am not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>

for ought we yet ſoe, the power that we ſpeake of, and which wee hold to bee in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114129:14"/>
Presbytery of a Congregation is there indeed by the appointment of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But let us heare Maſter <hi>Rutherfords</hi> Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſaith he, they ſeeme to make this Dogmaticall power a Church
power, and the exerciſe thereof formally an act of Church government;
and ſo it muſt be Church power and Church government in the Synod, as
well as in the Congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whence doth it ſeeme that we do ſo make it? Are there any ſuch words as
here he ſets down? Or any words equivalent thereto? Or doth the place make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mention of Church-power, and Church government at all? Or is there ſo much
as one word that looketh that way? If there be, let our Brother ſay that we ſeeme to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>each as he doth report; but if there be not, we are ſorry he ſhould report us to teach
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſeeme to teach, that which to our remembrance we never ſaid nor thought. And
ſure it is, we have expreſly ſaid the direct contrary in page 7, the Page next ſave one
afore this which heere he is dealing againſt, where wee have theſe words,
<hi>It ſeemeth to us (ſay we) that this power,</hi> viz. <hi>By diſquiſition and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to cleere up the rule (and then to command Obedience thereto) is not
properly a power and exerciſe of government and Juriſdiction, but a power
of Doctrine, and ſo a Synod is rather a teaching then a governing Church.</hi>
Theſe are our words in the Page afore alledged; wherein we plainly expreſſe what
the power of Synods ſeemeth unto us to be, even the direct contrary to that which he
ſaith we ſeeme to make it; wee on the one ſide affirming and expreſſing, that it
ſeemes to us, the power of a Synod is no power of government and Iuriſdiction, but a
power of Doctrine: And he on the other ſide reporting that we ſeeme to make the
exerciſe of Dogmaticall power to be formally an act of Church-government, and ſo
to place Church-government in the Synod. In which report we muſt needs ſay, wee
are plainly miſ-reported.</p>
               <p>His ſecond anſwer is this. The laſt period and Concluſion of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
cannot be both in the Congregation by right only, and in the Synod
by right only: For two laſt powers cannot be properly in two Subordinate
Iudicatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is very true, but it toucheth not us at all. For we never ſaid the laſt
period of the controverſie is both in the Congregation only, and in the Synod onely.
If we have ſo ſaid, let the place be produced where we have ſaid it; for the place by
him alledged doth afford us no ſuch thing, nor any place elſe that we know of. All
that the place affords concerning this point is only this, that there is a power of clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the truth Dogmatically in a Synod, though not in a Synod only, but alſo in the
Presbytery of a ſingle Congregation. And this Doctrine I hope our Brother will not
deny. But whether this power be laſt in the Synod, or in the Congregationall Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
of this we do not ſpeaks at all; much leſſe do we ſay as he doth apprehend
and report, that this power is both laſt in the Synod and laſt in the Congregation
too. Wherefore our defence in this particular muſt needs be this; that what here
he confuteth to be outs, is ſuch a thing as never fell from our mouths or pens, nor for
ought we know did never enter into our thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114129:14"/>
Thirdly, he ſaith. If a controverſie concerne many Congregations as this
doth <hi>Act.</hi> 15. I ſee not how a Congregation except they tranſgreſſe their
line, can finally determine it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither doth this touch us, except we had ſaid that a Congregation may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
determine controverſies which concerne many Churches, which yet we have not
ſaid. As for that controverſie <hi>Act.</hi> 15. It is plaine from verſe 2, that <hi>Antioch</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to have ended it amongſt themſelves, ſo far as they were troubled therewith.
For ſome teaching that corrupt Doctrine amongſt them, they had much diſputation
about the point afore they determined to ſend out for helpe elſewhere. Now to what
end was thus much diſputation, if they had no right to determine the matter? might
they not better have ſpared their paines? Or did they not tranſgreſſe their line in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
what they did attempt? Sure it ſeemes they did, if they had not right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the matter. But for our part, ſith we do not find them in the leaſt reproved
by the Holy Ghoſt for this attempt, therfore we cannot but think they did well therein.
And thereupon it followeth, that if <hi>Antioch</hi> was a Congregationall Church (as it
ſeemes to us it was, from <hi>Act. 14. 27.)</hi> either this controverſie did trouble no
Church but <hi>Antioch</hi> only, or elſe when a controverſie or corrupt opinion doth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
many Churches, one of them may lawfully determine and end it, ſo farre at it
concernes themſelves.</p>

               <p>I deny not ſaith he, but there is a great oddes betwixt a concionall rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by way of Preaching, which may be and is alwayes performed by one,
and a juridicall rebuking by a power Jurididicall of the Keyes, which is
performed only by a Church ſociety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If all this were granted, you the Objection is not ſatisfied, nor his purpoſe
gained thereby. For the cleering whereof it is good to conſider the thing in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and how this Objection comes in, and whereto it tends, and then we may better
deſcerne how the objection is removed by Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> anſwer: The thing in
queſtion is, whether a Synod have power of Iuriſidiction and Excommunication.
Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his ſcope in that place is to prove the Affirmative; and therefore
for a dozen or 14 Pages together, hee hath theſe words in the top of every leaſe,
<hi>The power of a Synod a power of Juriſdiction:</hi> and his medium to prove this
Tenent is this; Becauſe a Synod hath Power to rebuke. Whereupon enſueth the
Objection, that <hi>Paul</hi> might rebuke the Athenians and yet might not Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
them; and therefore enough a Synod may rebuke, it followes not that they may
Excommunicate. This is the order of the Diſpute, as is plainly to bee ſeeme by
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſing the place. And now comes in the Anſwer which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> gives to
the objection; to wit, <hi>That there is a great odds betwixt a Concionall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking
and a Juridicall, the one being performed by one, and the other
by many;</hi> Which Anſwer I conceive is not ſufficient, becauſe this Difference may
hee granted and many more may be added if hee pleaſe, and yet the thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not gained, nor the Objection removed at all. For what though a Concionall
rebuking be performed by one, and a Iuridicall by many? Yet ſtill it remaineth
cleare, that there may bee rebuking where there is no Iuriſdiction; and therefore,
though a Synod may rebuke, it followes not that they may Excommunicate, nor
have power of Iuriſdiction. If our Brother would have ſatisfied the Objection, he
ſhould not have ſatisfyed himſelfe with alledging the difference mentioned betweene
a Concionall rebuking, and a Iuridicall or Synodicall; but ſhould have proved
that there cannot be any Concionall rebuking at all, at leaſt wiſe not any rebuking
of Athenians who are not ſubject to Excommunication, and if this had been proved,
the Objection had been fully removed. But this he hath not proved at all, nor once
attempted to prove it, but plainly yeelds the contrary; and therefore for ought
I ſee the Objection remayneth in its ſtrength, and ſo the ſtrength of his argument
removed thereby, who would prove the Synod, power of Iuriſdiction from their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of rebuking.</p>
               <p>But let as heare what he anſwereth in the words enſuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:114129:15"/>
It cannot be denyed ſaith he, but the rebuking of men becauſe they
ſubverted Soules, verſe 24. Is not a meere Concionall rebuking which
may be performed by one. Firſt, it is a rebuking verſe 24. Second, it is a
rebuking performed by many, by a whole Synod, 6. 22. Third, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by a politicall Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw,</hi> And what of all this? May it not nevertheleſſe be denyed that this rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
was any other then in a Doctrinall way? Be it granted, that it was a rebuking,
and a rebuking performed by many; and if were granted by a Politicall Society
too; muſt it needs follow that therefore it was Iuridicall, or in way of Iuriſdiction?
I ſee no neceſſity of ſuch Conſequence. Nay, Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> himſelfe doth
confeſſe (as we heard afore) in his Page 393. <hi>That the ſpecification of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
muſt not be fetched from the efficient cauſes, becauſe one Apoſtle
might himſelfe alone have rebuked theſe obtruders of Circumciſion.</hi>
If therefore it were granted that many perſons, a whole Synod, a Politicall Society,
or what ever elſe he will call them, were the efficient cauſes of this rebuke, yet all
this is too little to prove that the rebuke was Iuridicall, unleſſe the ſpecification
of it muſt be fetched from the efficient cauſes, which Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> himſelfe
diſclaymes.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I would put this Caſe: ſuppoſe a Pagan or a Chriſtian of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Kingdome, ſhall come into a Church Aſſembly, whether the Aſſembly be a
Congregationall Church, or a Synod; and in the Aſſembly ſhall openly and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly
miſbehave himſelfe in one kind or other, to the diſhonour of God, and
grieving of the godly, and the danger of corrupting others that ſhall behold ſuch
bad example. I would gladly know whether this Aſſembly be it Synod or other, may
not lawfully rebuke this Scandalous practice and behaviour, and if they may, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it would follow therupon that they may alſo lawfully Excommunicate the man,
if his ſin and impenitency ſhall deſerve the ſame. If it be ſaid they may, I would
know: <hi>quo jure?</hi> And who gave them ſuch Authority to Excommunicate Pagans,
or men of another Nation, being only there preſent at that time occaſionally? And
if they may not ſo proceed againſt ſuch a perſon, then the anſwer to Maſter <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi>
alledgements in the Caſe we have in hand, is ready and plaine: For as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
<hi>Firſt, here is a rebuking. Second, a rebuking of many, even a
whole Synod. Third, of a Politicall Society and Body;</hi> even ſo the ſame
may be ſaid in this Caſe in all the particulars; For firſt, here is a rebuking. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
rebuking of many. Third, by a Politicall Society and body: and yet all this
is too little to prove a power of Iuriſdiction and Excommunication in the caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
and therefore I ſee not how it can be ſufficient to prove ſuch a power in a
Synod, for which purpoſe Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> brings it. Of neceſſity for ought that
I ſee, one of theſe muſt be ſaid, either that this Aſſembly have no power to rebuke
the man, but muſt ſuffer his ſin to be upon him, though God be diſhonoured, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
endangered thereby; or elſe it muſt be ſaid they have power to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him as well as to rebuke him; (neither of which I conceive can ſafely be ſaid)
or if neither of theſe can be ſaid, it muſt then follow that their may be power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
even in an Aſſembly of many perſons, a Politicall Society; and yet the ſame
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114129:16"/>
Aſſembly have no power at all to Excommunicate the perſons ſo rebuked, and ſo this
learned Brothers arguing is anſwered.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, I ſuppoſe it will not be denyed, but one Congregation if need ſo require,
may rebuke and reprove another Congregation, though neither of them be Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to other, but both of them equall and Independant of each other in regard of
ſubjection, Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> confeſſeth, p. 294. <hi>That Congregations and Churches
may admoniſh and rebuke each other,</hi> And ſure it is, that Scripture, <hi>Cant. 8. 8.
We have a little siſter, what ſhall we do for her?</hi> Doth ſhew that Churches ought to
take care one for the good of another. And if they muſt take care and conſult for one
another, there is the like reaſon that they ſhould reprove and admoniſh one another,
as need ſhall require. Now when one Church doth ſo practiſe towards another, it
cannot be denyed, but here are the ſame things which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſpeakes of,
Firſt, a Rebuking Second, a rebuking performed by many. Third, a rebuking
performed by a Politicall Society and Body. But can any man inferre from hence,
that the Church thus rebuking another Church hath power to Excommunicate that
other Church? I ſuppoſe none will affirme it. And if this may not be affirmed, I
do not ſee how rebuking performed by many even by a whole Synod, can be any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground to prove that the Synod hath power to Excommunicate.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles and Elders (ſaith our Author) are not conſidered here
as meerely Preachers and teachers in the act of teaching; for why then
ſhould they not be formally a Church Aſſembly, if they be an Aſſembly

thinke Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> reaſon doth prove them ſo to be. For <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that theſe Aſſemblies were formally Churches.</p>
               <p>Yea but ſaith our Author, the exerciſe of the Keyes of knowledge in
the hearing of a multitude, is eſſentially an act of Preaching of the Word,
Page 412.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> This is very true indeed, an act of Preaching the word it muſt needs bee,
the word Preaching being taken in its utmoſt Latitude. But is not unavoidably and
alwayes a Church-act, or an act that infallibly proves the Aſſembly, where ſuch an
act is performed, to be formally a Church? This is the thing that ſhould have been
cleered, or elſe the thing is not cleered; But this our Reverend Author doth not
cleere at all; and the contrary is very plaine from ſundry inſtances in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
where the Apoſtles did exerciſe the Key of knowledge in the hearing of multitudes in
ſundry places, where yet for all this there was not forthwith any Church; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

whereas he ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles and Elders are not conſidered in this
Aſſembly as Preachers and teachers in the act of teaching, becauſe then
the Aſſembly ſhould have been formally a Church,</hi> We rather thinke they that
ſhall conſider it will find that the Apoſtles did, and other Elders in theſe dayes may
put forth the act of teaching and Preaching in ſome Aſſemblies (ſuppoſe Aſſemblies
of Turkes and Indians) and yet the Aſſemblies not thereby proved to be Churches.</p>

Surely the aforeſaid Reverend Brethren of <hi>New-England</hi> have theſe
words, but it ſeemeth to us the power (of a Synod) is not properly a power

ſo a Synod is rather a Teaching then a governing Church: from whence
(ſaith he) I inferre, that our Brethren cannot deny a power of governing
to a Synod, but it is not ſo proper governing as Excommunication and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
performed in their Congregations; but ſay I, it is more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

wholly forſaken and left, and inſtead of anſwering them, he fals as we ſet upon other
words which we have written elſewhere, and applies himſelfe to deale againſt thoſe
other. By which dealing the conſiderate Reader may judge whether the former words
being thus handſomly forſaken and left, do not ſtill remaine in their ſtrength: and
whether it had not been as good never to have propoſed them at all in his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as having propoſed them to turne away directly and immediately from them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<hi>I take not here Lawes for Lawes properly ſo called, but for Miniſteriall

prove by this Noble and Eminent and high power of making Lawes is not proved
thereby at all, in as much as this Noble and eminent power of making Lawes doth
not belong to any Synods upon earth, but to Chriſt only. And this may be an Anſwer
to what he ſaith or a Synods power to make Lawes, it Lawes be taken in their proper
ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But if he intend not this ſenſe and meaning in the place we are ſpeaking of, but
only the latter, <hi>viz</hi> That Synods have power to cleere up the Lawes and rules of
Chriſt, and to command obedience thereto, then I confeſſe the anſwer in the 7.th
page thereof doth acknowledge ſuch power to belong unto Synods, but how this can
prove their Power of Iuriſdiction and government properly ſo called, which Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi>
would thence inferre, we for our parts do not yet perceive. For the power
here deſcribed is but a meere Doctrinall power, and we have given ſundry inſtances
in the Anſwer, Pag. 43. 44. To ſhew that there may be a power by way of Doctrine
to cleere up the rules and Lawes of Chriſt, and to command obedience thereto, where
yet there is no power by way of Iuriſdiction and Diſcipline to puniſh the breach of
thoſe rules; which inſtance, this Reverend brother doth not ſatisfie at all. And
therefore though Synods have power to cleere up the rules and Lawes of Chriſt, and
to command obedience thereto (which power we deny them not) yet that which he
from thence would inferre, that they have alſo a power of government and Iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doth not follow from thence at all, unleſſe we ſhall ſay, that Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
Doctrine and Iuriſdiction or government are the ſame.</p>
               <p>Briefly thus: a power of mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng Lawes properly ſo called is a Noble and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
kind of government, but this power doth not belong unto Synods, but to Chriſt.
A power of cleering up Chriſts Lawes, and commanding in his name obedience
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114129:18"/>
thereunto doth belong unto Synods, but this is no power of Iuriſdiction and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but a Miniſteriall power of Doctrine, and ſo ſtill our Tenent doth ſtand, that
a Synod if it may be called a Church, is rather a teaching then a governing
Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſaith our Author, Our brethren incline to make a Synod a
teaching Church.</p>
               <p>

Scripture the name of a Church is given to a Synod, we are not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
though we give not a Synod that name.</hi> Anſw. Pag. 1. The moſt that
we have yeelded in this point is this, that for the name we will not contend, and that
if a Synod may be called a Church, then ſith they have Power by diſputation to
cleere up the rule, they are rather a Teaching then a governing Church. <hi>Anſwer
Pag. 1. &amp;</hi> 7. This is all we have ſaid, and we deſire our words may not be ſtretched
beyond our intent and ſcope therein. But let us heare what our Brother would hence
inferre.</p>
               <p>I inferre, ſaith he, that Synodicall teaching by giving out Decrees, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many Churches, as our brethren of <hi>New-England</hi> and the forenamed
Authors teach, is an Ordinance of Chriſt, that can be performed in no
ſingle Congregation on earth, for a Doctrinall Cannon of one Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can lay any Eccleſiaſticall tye upon many Churches, <hi>Ergo</hi> by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
our Congregations ſhall be dependant as were the Jewiſh Synagogues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When he ſaith the Brethren of <hi>New-England</hi> and the Authors of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
do teach a Synodicall teaching by giving out Decrees tying many Churches,
and aledgeth for proofe in his Margent, <hi>Anſw.</hi> 7. to 32. q. 9. 14. page 43, 44. and
Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> Chap. 4. Pag. 40. 41 with favour of ſo learned a man, wee
muſt returne this Anſwer, that neither of the palces alledged will make good his
purpoſe, in as much as neither of them doth make any mention at all of the thing
which he reports them to teach, <hi>viz.</hi> Such Synodicall teaching as gives out Decrees
tying many Churches. Let the places be viewed and the thing will be found as I ſay.
And therefore how they can be ſaid to teach that which they neither teach nor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doth ſurmount my ability to conceive. If the Reader would know what it is
that is taught in the places, it is no more but this, that in ſome Caſes it is requiſite
that Churches ſhould ſeeke for light and Counſell and advice from other Churches,
as <hi>Antioch,</hi> did ſend unto <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in a Queſtion which they wanted ability to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
amongſt themſelves, and that there ought to be Synods, and that we thinke
that meeting <hi>Act</hi> 15. might be ſuch an one. The firſt of theſe is taught in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
of the places, and the other in the other. But for giving out Synodicall Decrees
tying many Churches, this ſame be it within the power of Synods or otherwiſe, is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> taught at all in either of the places, except wee ſhall ſay (which we thinke were
unreaſonable) that there can be no Synods, nor conſulting of other Churches for
light and Counſell and advice, but there muſt be in thoſe other Churches ſo conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
withall, a power to give out binding Decrees, yea Decrees that ſhall bind or tye
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114129:18"/>
many Churches. We thinke this latter doth no wayes neceſſarily follow upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
and therefore though the places alledged do ſpeake to the former, yet the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which this Author reports them to teach, they do not teach at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I Anſwer further, that if ſuch a Doctrine were indeed taught in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by him alledged or any other, yet the inference which he would thence bring in,
<hi>That then our Congregations ſhall be dependant as were the Iewiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi>
Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſame doth not follow at all: and the reaſon is, becauſe the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
were dependant on the Supreame Synedrion not only for light and Counſell,
no nor only for Doctrinall Cannons or Decrees, but alſo for Iuriſdiction and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
that Synodrion being their ſupreame Court, to whoſe ſentence they were all
bound under paine of Death to ſubmit, as is cleere, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 11, 12. And therefore
if it were granted (which yet we do not ſee proved) that Synods may give out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Doctrinall Cannons, that ſhall tye many Churches, it doth not follow
that our Congregations ſhall therefore be dependant as were the Iewiſh Synagogues,
except it were alſo proved that they muſt depend upon Synods in point of Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Diſcipline, as well as in point of Doctrine, yea and ſo depend as that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of thoſe Synods muſt be obeyed under paine of death. Sure the Synagogues
and every member of them were in this ſort dependant upon the Supreame Synedrion:
but we hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Reverend brother will not ſay that Congregations muſt in this
ſort be dependant upon Synods. At the leaſt wiſe this we hope he will not deny, that
every member of a Church is bound to depend upon the Paſtor of that Church in
point of Doctrine; and yet it will not follow that he muſt depend upon one Paſtor
alone in point of Iuriſdiction and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcipline. And the reaſon is, becauſe Doctrine may
be diſpenced by one Paſtor alone, but Diſcipline muſt be diſpenced by a Church,
which one Paſtor alone cannot be. And therefore if Congregations were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
upon Synods in point of Doctrine, it would not follow that they muſt bee
dependant in point of Iuriſdiction and Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſaith he, It is a begging of the queſtion to make <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the
Supreame Church and the Synagogues dependant Churches; becauſe it
it was lawfull only at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to Sacrafice; for I hold that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
was a dependant Church no leſſe then the ſmalleſt Synagogues in all their
Trybes. <hi>And ſo he proceedeth largely, to ſhew that ſacrificing at</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>did not
make</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>Supreame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It this were even ſo as is pleaded, yet that which we have ſaid of the
compleatneſſe of the Synagogues and of their dependancie is not at all removed
thereby: and the reaſon is, becauſe we do not make the Synagogues dependant nor
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſupreame, meerely upon this ground, becauſe <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> alone was the place
of Sacrificing, but this is the ground upon which chiefly we go, that at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
was the Synedrion upon whom all <hi>Iſraell</hi> muſt depend for judgement, and from
whoſe ſentence there was no appeale, which ground wee ſtill thinke doth prove both
the incomplearneſſe of the Synagogues, and the ſupremacie of the Synedrion, and
the contrary to this muſt be cleered if our Tenent in this matter be removed. True
it is, we thinke it ſome argument of the Synagogues incompleatneſſe and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they were not permitted to enjoy all the Ordinances which were of ordinary
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114129:19"/>
uſe: but the ſupremacie of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> we do not place in this only, that there was the
place for Sacrifice but in this withall that the ſupreame Iudicatory was there, upon
which all <hi>Iſraell</hi> muſt depend, and from the which there muſt be no appeale. And
yet this ſupremacie we do not place in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> conſidered a part from the Synedri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but in the Synedrion it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore, whereas he ſaith, Pag. 415. That we might as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

upon</hi> London, <hi>inaſmuch as the Parliament uſeth there to ſit,</hi> I conceive

If the Government of conſociated Churches be warranted
by the light of Nature, then this light of Nature being
common to us in civill as in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, it will
follow that every City governed with rulers within it
ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be ſubordinate to a Claſſe of many Cities, and
that Claſſe to a Nationall meeting of all the Cities: and
the Nationall government to be a Catholike or Oecumenicke civill
Court—. And becauſe by the ſame light of Nature there muſt bee
ſome finall and ſupreame Iudgement of controverſies, leaſt Appeales
ſhould be ſpun out in <hi>infinitum,</hi> it muſt be proved that this ſupremacie
lyeth not in a Congregation. <hi>And in the Margent he citeth Mr.</hi> Tompſon <hi>and
my ſelfe in page 16 and page 10, of the Anſwer, as Authors of this laſt baſſis in

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true that in one of thoſe pages alledged we ſpeake to the like purpoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114129:19"/>
as here is reported. For we there ſuppoſe it to be cleere by the light of Nature, that
there muſt be ſome finall and ſupreame judgement of Cauſes, and that unleſſe it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
where that ſupremacie doth lye, (which we account the very thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion)
we ſay the uſefulneſſe and neceſſity of Appeales may be granted, and yet we
ſhall be ſtill at uncertainty about the thing in queſtion, and as much to ſeeke as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
becauſe that there ought to be appeales til you come to the higheſt is one thing,
and that a Synod and not a Congregation is the higheſt is another. To this purpoſe we
have written in one of thoſe Pages, the ſumme whereof is this much; that though
the uſefulneſſe of Appeales till you come to the higheſt be granted, yet the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of Synods over Congregations in matter of Iudicature is not concluded thereby.</p>
               <p>Now what doth our Reverend Brother returne in his Anſwer? Doth he prove the
contrary to what is here affirmed by us? Doth he cleere it ſufficiently, that if it bee
once granted that there muſt be Appeales till you come to the higheſt, then the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
of Synods over Congregations muſt inevitably follow? I conceive the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of this conſequence had need to be cleered, if that which we have ſaid be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
anſwered. But doth our Brother cleere this? Or doth he ſo much as once
attempt the cleering thereof? Surely to ſpeake freely what I find, I find nothing that
looketh that way, and therfore cannot but wonder why our opinion ſhould be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Objection, and ſo his Reader be led into expectation of ſome ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
thereto, and then the anſwer which he returnes to be taken up in other matters,
our opinion propoſed in the Objection, being wholly in his Anſwer left untouched. If
that ſaying of ours be not ſound, why doth he not returne ſome anſwer? If it be ſound
and good, why doth he make an Objection of it, and ſo breed an apprehenſion in
weake Readers of its unſoundneſſe, and put them in hope of a confutation, when no
ſuch thing is performed? I leave it to the wiſe in heart to conſider what this doth argue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nevertheleſſe, let us conſider of what he doth returne for Anſwer, Page</hi> 423.
Firſt he ſaith, Appeales being warranted by the Counſell which <hi>Iethro</hi>
gave to <hi>Moſes</hi>—cannot but be naturall?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe this be ſo, what can there be concluded hence, that makes againſt
us? cannot appeales be Naturall, but the ſupremacie of Synods over Congregations
muſt needs follow? If there muſt be an higheſt, muſt it needs be yeelded that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
and not the Congregation is that higheſt? I conceive this needs not to be yeelded
at all, and therefore though Appeales be Naturall, I ſee not what is gained thereby.</p>
               <p>Againe, he ſaith, God hath appointed that the ſupremacie ſhould lye
within the bounds of every free Monarchy or State, ſo that there can be
no Appeale to any Oecumenicall or Catholike civill Church, for that is
againſt the independant power that God hath given to States.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let this be granted alſo, and are we not ſtill where we were before? Is there
in this any thing at all that doth make for the removall of our opinion, as himſelfe
hath ſee it down in his Objection? We may truly ſay we ſee it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No, nor in that which doth follow,</hi> viz. But in the Church it is farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
for God hath appoynted no viſſible Monarchy in his Church, nor
no ſuch independency of policie within a Congregation, Claſſicall Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or Nationall Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:114129:20"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For that which is ſaid of a viſible Monarchy in the Church, I confeſſe it is
true, God hath appointed none ſuch. But for the reſt, of theſe words, ſith they
containe an expreſſe denyall of the ſupremacie of all Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be the generall Councell, I would gladly know how our Tenent afore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
is diſproved, or how the neceſſity of that Conſequence afore mentioned is at
all cleered hereby. If there be no independencie of policie in Congregations, nor
yet in any Synods exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pt it be the Oecumenicall, doth this prove that the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
doth lye in Synods and not in the Congregation? Nothing leſſe: for how can
our Brother prove that it lyes in the one and not in the other, by ſaying as here he
doth, that indeed it lyes in neither? Or how is that Conſequence made good, that if
there muſt be appeales till we come to the higheſt, then the Synod is the higheſt?
How is this I ſay made good by affirming, that neither the Congregation nor the
Synod is the higheſt? For my part I muſt confeſſe it paſſeth my underſtanding to
conceive, how the denying of a thing ſhould be the proving and cleering thereof.
And yet except this be admitted, I know not how our apprehenſion in the matter we
have in hand is at all diſproved. For whereas we ſay, Appeales may be granted and yet
the ſupremacie of Synods over Congregations will not follow, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> for
the diſproving of what wee apprehend herein, doth bring nothing in the place wee
have in hand but only this, that the Supremacie doth neither lye in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor in the Synod. Which is no diſproving of us all, except as I ſaid, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
of a thing may ſuffice for the confirming and cleering thereof. For I conceive
if we be diſproved the ſupremacie of Synods muſt be proved and cleered, which here
our Brother doth not, but on the contrary denies the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore, if there be no independency of policie within a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a Claſſicall, Provinciall or Nationall Church,</hi> As here our Brother af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
then what ſhall become of that which he tels us elſewhere, <hi>viz.</hi> Page 483.
<hi>That that remedie of our Saviour, Tell the Church, is not needfull in any
Church above a Nationall?</hi> For ſure if there be no independencie of policie in
any of the leſſer Churches, nor yet in the Nationall Church, one would thinke that
of our Saviour ſhould be needfull in ſome Church above the Nationall. Or if it be
nor needfull in any Church above Nationall, then one would thinke there ſhould be
ſome indepencie of policie in the Nationall Church, or in ſome of the former. For my
part I know not how this difficulty will be expedited, I meane how both theſe ſayings
of our Brother can ſtand good, except we ſhall ſay that which I ſuppoſe he will not
ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That independencie of policie is no where. And yet I cannot ſee but this
muſt be ſaid, if both the other ſayings ſtand good? For if independencie of policie be
neither in the Nationall Church nor in any Church above it, nor in any Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, I know not where we ſhall have it.</p>
               <p>Againe, if there be no independencie of policie in any of the Churches afore named,
what ſhall we ſay to that paſſage where our Brother doth verily profeſſe,
<hi>That he cannot ſee what power of Juriſdiction to cenſure Scandals can be
in a generall Councell, affirming further, that there might be ſome meerly
Doctrinall power if ſuch a Councell could be had, and that is all, Pag</hi> 482.
For if there be no Independencie of policie in any Church below a generall Councell,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114129:20"/>
one would thinke there ſhould be in the generall Councill ſome power of Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to cenſure Scandals, yea and an independant power too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or if there be not ſuch
power in the generall Councill, nor yet in the Nationall Church, nor in any Church
below the Nationall, we muſt then ſay there is no independant Power of Iuriſdiction
to cenſure Scandals in any Church upon earth. Which latter if it be not owned, as
I conceive our Brother will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, I know not how the other two can both ſtand.</p>
               <p>Though appeales be warranted both in Church and State by the light
of Nature, yet appeales to Exotique and forraigne Judicatures is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by any ſuch light, but rather the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let this be granted alſo, and are we ever a whit neerer to the point, then
before? Is this good arguing, appeales to exotique Indicatures are not warrantable,
<hi>Ergo</hi> a Synod and not the Congregation is the ſupreame Iudicature? Is this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
ſtrong and cleere? If it be not, how is our Tenent removed? If our Brother
intend it not for a removall thereof, why is it brought in for anſwer to an Objection
propoſed by himſelfe as ours?</p>
               <p>Further, let this ſentence be compared with the former immediately preceding,
and more difficulties ſtill ariſe. For in this he tels us we ſee, <hi>That appeales to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Judicatures are not warrantable;</hi> And in the other he tels us as wee
heard afore, <hi>That there is no independencie of policie within a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a Claſſicall, Provinciall, or Nationall Church.</hi> Now to find how theſe
things do agree, I am at a loſſe, for if there bee no independencie of policie in the
Congregation, nor the other Churches mentioned, I ſhould have thought, it might
have been lawfull to have appealed from them to others. For why may there not bee
appeales from them in whom no independen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie of Policie is ſeated? Yet now we are
reſtrained from ſuch appeales, for that all other Iudicatures are accounted forraigne
and Exotique. So that of two ſentences the one immediately following upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the former tels us there is no independencie of policie in any of the Churches
mentioned, which are Domeſticque and neere, and the other tels us that other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are ſo Exotique and forraigne, that appeales to them are unwarrantable: and
what to ſay for the reconciling of theſe things, I muſt confeſſe I find not.</p>
               <p>I grant it is true, Appeales to Exotique and forraigne Iudicatures are not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
But why are we not certified what Iudicatures are to be accounted Exotique
and Forraigne? For here I conceive lyes the pinch of the queſtion; and unleſſe
this be determined, the thing in queſtion is ſtill left at uncertainty. For as in civill
ſtates there are many Cities and Townes which have independent power within
themſelves, as <hi>Geneva, Strasburgh, Zuricke, Baſill,</hi> and many others, and Appeales
from any of theſe, though to the City or Town next adjoyning, would be to a Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Exotique or forraigne, ſo ſome are apt to conceive the like of Congregationall
Churches. And therefore it had need to be cleered that Appeales from ſuch Churches
is not to Exotique and forraigne Iudicatures; for if this be not cleered, the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Appeales to forraigne and exotique Powers may be granted, and the queſtion
will remaine uncleered.</p>
               <p>Church Appeales though warranted by the light of Nature, yet it is
ſuppoſed they be rationall, and grounded on good reaſon, as that either the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114129:21"/>
matter belong not to the Congregation, or then it bee certain or morally
preſumed the Congregation will be partiall or unjuſt, or the buſineſſe bee
difficill and intricate; and if appeales be groundleſſe and unjuſt, neither
Chriſt nor Natures light doth warrant them. Yea in ſuch caſe the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
from which no man can lawfully appeale, lyeth ſometime in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
ſometime in the Claſſicall Presbytery, ſo as it is unlawfull to
appeale for <hi>Illud tantum poſſumus quod jure poſſumus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſhort ſumme is thus much, that appeales are then lawfull when there
is juſt ground and reaſon for them, otherwiſe they are unlawfull. Now firſt of all
how doth this prove (for we would ſtill keep to the point) the neceſſity of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
whereof we ſpeak afore, <hi>viz.</hi> That if appeales be lawfull, then there is a
ſupremacie of Syno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s over Congregations. I conceive it is not proved hereby all;
but contrarily appeales may be granted lawfull, when there is juſt reaſon and ground
for them, and yet the ſupremacie of Synods over Congregations is ſtill uncle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red.
Nextly, it ſtill remaines a queſtion, who muſt be judge of the reaſonableneſſe of the
Appeale and of thoſe caſes that are put to ſhew when they are reaſonable, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the matter belongs not to the Congregation and the reſt that are named: and unleſſe
it be cleered to whom it belongs to judge theſe things, we are ſtill left at uncertainty,
in the maine matter, <hi>viz.</hi> In whom the ſupremacie doth lye, from whom we may not
appeale. For to ſay as our Reverend Author doth, <hi>That in ſome caſe the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
from which no man can lawfully appeale, lyeth in the Congregation,
and ſometimes it doth not: Appeales when they are grounded upon good
reaſon are warrantable, elſe they are not: when the matter belongs not to
the Congregation or the Congregation will be partiall and unjuſt, or when
the buſineſſe is diffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll and intricate, then we may appeale from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
elſe we may not,</hi> Theſe things I ſay doe not cleere the matter at all,
becauſe ſtill the queſtion remaines who muſt be judge of theſe things, whether the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appealing, or the Congregation from whom, or the Synod to whom the appeale is
made: and unleſſe this be determined, the things mentioned alledged by our Brother
do afford us ſmall help in the matter for the cleering of it. And therefore, what we
ſaid in the Anſwer doth ſtill for ought I ſee remaine ſound, <hi>viz. That there
muſt be ſome finall and ſupreame judgement that controverſies may not by
appeales after appeales be ſpun out in</hi> infinitum, <hi>and to determine where
that ſupremacie doth lye, is the maine queſtion, which unleſſe it be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
the uſefulneſſe of appeales may be granted, and yet we ſhall be ſtill
at uncertainty about the thing in queſtion and as much to ſeeke as before,
becauſe that there ought to be appeales till you come to the higheſt is one
thing, and that a Synod and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t the Congregation is the higheſt is another.</hi>
Now whether our Brother in that which we have hitherto heard have ſufficiently
cleered it unto us, that we may know where this ſupremacie doth lye, I leave it to the

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That appeales are warrantable, and warrantable by Natures light till we
come to the ſupreame judicatorie, this we deny not, but have formerly yeelded no
leſſe. But for that our Brother here aymes at, <hi>viz.</hi> Appeales from a Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Church (as not being ſupreame) to another Iudicatory, this we conceive is not
proved by the example of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> nor by any thing that we have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
concerning the ſame And the reaſon it becauſe <hi>Antioch</hi> had right and Authority to
have ended the matter amongſt themſelves if ability had ſerved thereto: and their
ſending to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for helpe may argue want of agreement, or imperfection of light,
but argues no want of Authority or right within themſelves. For it is plain verſe 2,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114129:22"/>
that <hi>Antioch</hi> did endeavour to have ended the matter amongſt themſelves, and had
much diſputation about it for that end, afore there was any ſpeech of ſending to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
Now this endeavour doth argue their right; for otherwiſe it had been ſinfull,
as being a preſuming to do that which did not belong to them. This reaſon we have
rendered afore in the place which our Author alledgeth, and he doth not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it; and therefore we are ſtill of the ſame mind as before, that <hi>Antioch</hi> was not
dependant upon the Iuriſdiction of other Churches, but had independant power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
themſelves, as many may have who yet need the help of light from others, for
their direction in uſing their power. Great Kings and Monarchs have received light
from their Councellours without any impeac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ment of their independant power,
which they have in themſelves, and without any aſcribing of that power to thoſe
their Counſellours. As we ſaid in the place alledged, <hi>Antioch</hi> may ſend to <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
for help, and yet this ſending neither prove right of Iuriſdiction in them who are
ſent unto, nor want of Iuriſdiction in them who do ſend.</p>
               <p>And therefore whereas our Brother ſaith, Antioch <hi>becauſe of the difficulty of
the controverſie, had not light to judge thereof,</hi> Ergo <hi>we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Appeales to be warrantable,</hi> We would rather argue thus, <hi>Antioch</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
light, <hi>Ergo</hi> Counſell and light is to be ſought elſewhere; and thus we conceive
the inference will hold: but to ſay, <hi>Ergo</hi> there muſt be Appeales from the

all. No more then it will follow, Kings or other ſupreame civill Rulers muſt ſeek

to thoſe Counſellours, which Conſequence none will maintain nor affirme.</p>

them of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not by them of <hi>Antioch</hi> as not belonging to <hi>Antioch</hi> but to
them of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then our Brother might have had ſome ground from <hi>Antioch</hi> to
prove the neceſſity or warrantableneſſe of appeales from Congregationall Churches
to other Iudicatories: but ſuch no ſuch thing is ſaid, we ſee not how this example can
be any ground for the eſtabliſhing of ſuch appeales, or the taking away from Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
Churches their power of Iuriſdiction within themſelves.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially, wee ſee not how this our Brother can alledge the ſame for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
conſidering what himſelfe hath written elſewhere in this learned Treatiſe of his
wherein he examines that anſwer of ours. Two paſſages in his treatiſe I propound to
conſideration, which ſeeme to me to make for that independant or ſupreame power in
Congregations, which here he is diſputing againſt, the one is that which we touched
before in his Page 413. <hi>Where he ſaith that Synods in caſe of neglect of
Presbyteriall Churches are to command the particular Churches whom it
concerneth, to do their dutie, as in other particulars there named, ſo in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
of offenders; and further that the Synod,</hi> Act. 15. <hi>Is to
remit the cenſure of Excommunication to the Presbytery of</hi> Antioch <hi>and</hi>

                     </gap>ie of theſe obtruders of Circumciſion.</hi>
Which I conceive is very truly ſpoken, and thereupon it followes that there was a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114129:22"/>
of Iuriſdiction in that Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and no neceſſity of appealing from
them to the Iuriſdiction of others. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith the Synods are only to command the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to do their duty, and to remit the cenſure of offenders to the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to whom the offenders belong, it plainly appeareth thereby where the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
of Iuriſdiction doth lye.</p>
               <p>The other place is in his Page 307. Where we have theſe words, <hi>viz.
The power of Juriſdiction ordinary intenſive and</hi> quo ad eſſentiam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae
Miniſterialis, <hi>according to the intire eſſence of a Miniſteriall
Church, is as perfect and compleat in one ſingle Congregation as in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall,
as in a Nationall. Yea as in the Catholike viſible body whereof
Christ is the head.</hi> Now if there be ſuch perfect &amp; compleat power of Iuriſdiction
in a ſingle Congregation, I know not how there can be ſuch neceſſity of Appeales
from them to the Iuriſdiction of others as he is pleading for, nor how that ſupreame
and independant power in Congregations can be denyed, which here he diſputeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.
For let this compleat and perfect Power of Iuriſdiction be acknowledged as
due to ſuch Churches, and appeales from them to other Iuriſdictions will be of ſmall
neceſſity or uſe.</p>
               <p>I know indeed this Reverend Author ſayeth in the Page laſt mentioned, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few lines of the words which I have here alledged, <hi>That a Congregation is
ſo a part of the Presbytery that it hath not a whole intire compleat inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
power over its own members to Excommunicate them—. And
therefore the conſociated Churches muſt have a power over the members of
a Congregation.</hi> Which words I confeſſe ſeeme not well to agree with the former,
becauſe in the one intire compleat intenſive Power is denyed to a Congregation, and
in the other the Power of Iuriſdiction, ordinary intenſive, is ſaid to be as compleat
and perfect in the Congregation as in the great Churches. But it is not the latter
words but the former which I do ſtand upon; and by them (as I conceive) the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
of Congregations is eſtabliſhed, and the neceſſity of appeales from them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iuriſdictions is cleerely takes away. For if the Power of Iuriſdiction be as intire
perfect and compleat in the Congregation as in the greater Churches, as our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expreſly affirmes it to be, I know not the reaſon why there muſt be appeales
from the Iuriſdiction of the Congregation unto the Iuriſdiction of thoſe other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
If the Power ſpoken of were more imperfect and incompleat in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then it is in the other Churches, then there might be more reaſon or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayrer
pretence for thoſe appeales: but ſith our Author confeſſeth it is no more intire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfect in theſe then in the Congregation, but as compleat and perfect in
the Congregation as it is in the other, I am yet to ſeeke of a ſufficient ground for the
neceſſity of appeales from the Iuriſdiction in a Congregation. For is it reaſonable to
appeale from one Iudicatory to another, and yet the power of Iuriſdiction be as intire
compleat and perfect in the former from which the appeale is made, as in the latter
to which the cauſe is brought by ſuch appeale? It ſeemes by ſuch appeales we are not
like to be much helper, nor much to mend the matter above what it was before, and
therefore the uſefulneſſe and neceſſity thereof is ſtill uncl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

               <p>I thinke the Brethren erre in this to teach that <hi>Antioch</hi> had power to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114129:23"/>
determine the controverſie, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. When the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and
<hi>Cicilia,</hi> to their knowledge were troubled with the like queſtion as verſe
24. may cleere,—I doubt much if they had power to determine a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ſo much concerned all the Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not cleere from verſe 24. nor from any part of the Chapter as farre as
I can find, that <hi>Antioch</hi> did know that other Churches were troubled with this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and if they had known it, I ſee nothing therein but they might notwithſtanding
lawfully end the matter ſo farre as concerned themſelves. For when this queſtion
was ſtarted amongſt them by ſuch as came from <hi>Judea</hi> and taught this corrupt Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the text is very cleere verſe 2, that they had much diſputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves to have ended the matter, afore there was any ſpeech of ſending
to <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> which diſputation is an argument that they had right to have ended it,
if ability had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> been wanting.</p>
               <p>And as for our Brothers reaſon for the contrary taken from their knowledge that
the other Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cicilia</hi> were troubled with the like queſtion, there is
not one word in the verſe alledged to ſhew that <hi>Antioch</hi> had knowledge of any ſuch
matter, nor is <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cicilia</hi> once mentioned therein: And though they be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
verſe 23. Yet neither doth this verſe declare that <hi>Antioch</hi> had any knowledge
that this queſtion had ever troubled thoſe other Churches. Say it be true that indeed
they had been troubled therewith, and that the Epiſtle from the Synod doth intimate
no leſſe, this may prove that when the Epiſtle came to be read at <hi>Antioch,</hi> then <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>
by this meanes might come to the knowledge thereof; but all this doth not prove
that <hi>Antioch</hi> knew ſo much afore. And therefore they might endeavour to end the
matter amongſt themſelves, as not knowing for any thing our Author hath yet
brought to the contrary, that any other Churches beſides themſelves were troubled
therewith. But ſuppoſe they had known ſo much, I ſee nothing in this to hinder but
<hi>Antioch</hi> might lawfully cleere up the truth in the queſtion, and cenſure ſuch of their
Church as ſhould obſtinately hold and teach that falſe Doctrine, notwithſtanding
their knowledge that others had been troubled with the like Doctrine and teachers.
Suppoſe a Chriſtian family be troubled with lying Children, or ſervants, or ſuch as
are diſobedient and undutifull in one kind or in another; ſuppoſe they alſo knew that
their neighbour families are troubled with the like, ſhall this knowledge of theirs
hinder the Parents or Maſters in ſuch a family from cenſuring or correcting theſe
that are under their government, according to their demerits? If not, why ſhall <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
be hindered from cenſuring offending members of their Church, only upon
this ground becauſe to their knowledge other Churches are troubled with the like
offenders? A City or Corporation is troubled with Drunkards, with theeves, or
other vicious and lewd perſons, and knoweth that other Cities or Corporations are
troubled with the like: A Nationall Church, as <hi>Scotland</hi> for example, is troubled with
obtruders of Ceremonies, Service booke, Epiſcopacie or other corruptions, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that <hi>England</hi> or other Churches are troubled with the like, ſhall <hi>Scotland</hi> now be
hindered from removing theſe corruptions, and the obtruders of them from amongſt
themſelves, only upon this ground, becauſe <hi>England</hi> to their knowledge is troubled
with the like? Or ſhall the Corporation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee hindered from puniſhing theeves and
ſuch other malefactors, only for this reaſon, becauſe to their knowledge other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114129:23"/>
are troubled with the like lewd perſons? I ſuppoſe it is eaſie to ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
and invalidity of ſuch Conſequences? And therefore if <hi>Antioch</hi> did know
that other Churches were troubled with the like offenders, as themſelves were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
withall, this needs not to hinder but they may determine queſtions that ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves, and may cenſure ſuch of their members as ſhall trouble the
Church or Brethren therewith, and obſtinately perſiſt in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>This being conſidered withall, that in thus doing they do not go beyond their line,
nor meddle with matters any farther but as they are within their Compaſſe. For when
divers Churches are troubled with the like corruptions in Doctrine or practiſe, and
ſome one of thoſe Churches by uſing the Key of Doctrine or diſcipline or both, doth
endeavour the removall of theſe corruptions, they do not hereby attempt and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to remove them out of other Churches (which might be an appearance of
ſtretching their line beyond their compaſſe) but out of their own Church, and only
ſo farre as concernes themſelves, and in ſo doing no man can juſtly ſay they meddle
further then their Power doth reach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he gives another reaſon why</hi> Antioch <hi>had not right to determine the queſtion,</hi>
And this is taken from the ſtrong party that was in <hi>Antioch</hi> againſt the
truth, which was ſuch as that they oppoſed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which he ſaith, that when the greateſt part of a Church as <hi>Antioch</hi>
is againſt the truth, as is cleere, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. He beleeveth in that they
looſe their <hi>jus,</hi> their right to determine <hi>eatenus</hi> in ſo farre; for Christ
hath given no Eccleſiaſticall right and power to determine againſt the
truth, but onely for truth; and therefore in this, Appeales muſt be
neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How is it cleere that the greatſt part of the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> was againſt
the truth? The text doth not ſay ſo much, but only this, that certain men which
came from <hi>Iudea,</hi> taught the Brethren and ſaid except ye be Circumciſed ye cannot
be ſaved, and that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had no ſmall diſſenſion and diſputation with
them about the matter, and that in the iſſue they determined that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
and certaine others ſhould go up to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> about the queſtion: Thus much the
Scripture witneſſeth, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 1, 2. But whether they that held that corrupt Doctrine
at <hi>Antioch</hi> were the major or the minor part of the Church, the text doth not expreſſe,
except we ſhall ſay that where a falſe Doctrine is taught by ſome, and greatly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and diſputed againſt by others, there it muſt needs bee that the greateſt part are
tainted with that falſe Doctrine, which wee thinke is no good Conſequence.
<hi>And therefore whereas our Author ſaith, the greateſt part of this Church
was againſt the Truth, and that ſo much is cleere from verſe</hi> 2.
I anſwer, firſt that I do not perceive this cleereneſſe, neither from verſe 2, nor from
any other place of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Nextly, ſuppoſe this were cleere, this may argue that they wanted ability and light
to end the matter, but muſt it needs argue that they wanted right though they had
been able? Or ſhall we ſay that they who want ability to doe things as they ſhould
be done, do therefore want right to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> in them at all? I conceive it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114129:24"/>
and the reaſon is becauſe this right in Churches is Naturall, or Connaturall to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Church, and this want of ability is only accidentall, and therefore this latter
cannot totally hinder the former.</p>
               <p>That light of government is Naturall or connaturall to every Church, our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
own words do teſtifie Page 341. Where he ſaith this, <hi>viz. Suppoſing that
Christ have a viſible Church it is morall that ſhe have power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alſo, in ſo farre as ſhe is a Church; yea, power of government upon
this ſuppoſition is Naturall or rather connaturall. And in Page 307,
he ſaith as was alledged before, That the power of Iuriſdiction ordinary
intenſive—. Is as perfect and compleat in one ſingle Congregation as
in a Provinciall, or in a Nationall; yea, as in the Catholike viſible body
whereof Christ is the head. And in Page 383. He ſaith, That to a
Congregation Christ hath given by an immediate flux from himſelfe a
politicall Church power intrinſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ally in it, derived from none but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> And the like he ſaith of a Presbyteriall Church. Now
whether <hi>Antioch</hi> was a Congregationall Church as we hold, or a Presbyteriall as is
holden by this our Brother, yet it is cleere by thoſe words of his here alledged, that
being eſſentially a Church; it had a politicall Church power intrinſcically within it
ſelfe, yet a perfect and compleat power of Iuriſdiction, yea and ſuch a power as was
naturall or connaturall unto her, as ſhe was a Church. But now the light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
whereby they ſhould be enabled well to uſe this power, did not adde any power
unto them which they had not before, not did the want of it, being but accidentall,
deprive them of that Power, which was intrinſcicall, eſſentiall and connaturall unto
them as they were a Church of Chriſt. Onely this want did hinder their ability to
expreſſe their power well, but their right as being a thing Connaturall did ſtill
remaine.</p>
               <p>Our Brother hath a ſaying or two about the civill Power, which by proportion may
well illuſtrate this that I am ſpeaking o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>bo it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church-power. In one place he ſaith
thus, <hi>There is a two-fold power in a King, one in a King as a King, and
this is a like in all, and ordinary regall, coactive: whether the King be an
Heathen, a Turke, or a ſound believing Chriſtian: there is another pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in a King as ſuch a King, either as a Propheticall King as</hi> David <hi>and</hi>
Solomon <hi>or as a Christian believing King. And of this latter he ſaith,
that it is not a new regall power, but</hi> poteſtas execuliba, <hi>a power or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ability to execute the Kingly Power, which he had before as a
King; Page 387. &amp;c.</hi> 388. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow why may it not be ſaid in like ſort, there is
in a Church two-fold Power, one in a Church as it is a Church, and this is a like
in all true Churches of Chriſt, whether the Church in this or that particular queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have light to diſcerne, and hold the truth, or otherwiſe: another in a Church, as
it is ſound believing Church, holding the truth in ſuch or ſuch queſtion; and this
is but only a gracious ability to exerciſe the power which they had before, not adding
to them any new Power at all? Againe, in his Page 393. he hath theſe words.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114129:24"/>
                  <hi>Though the King were not a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, yet hath he a Kingly
power to command men as Chriſtians, and it is by accident that he cannot
in that ſtate command Chriſtian duties, and ſervice to Christ; becauſe he
will not, and cannot command thoſe dutyes remaining ignorant of Chriſt;
even as a King ignorant of neceſſary civill dutyes cannot command them,
not becauſe he wanteth Kingly power to command theſe civill things, for
undeniably he is a Iudge in civill things, but becauſe he hath not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them.</hi> And may we not ſay in like ſort, though a Church want the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth, in ſome particular queſtion, yet they have a Church power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
ſuch queſtions, &amp; to command obedience therein, and it is by accident they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in that ſtate determine rightly, becauſe they will not, being ignorant of the truth
therein, not becauſe they want Church-power to determine ſuch matters, but becauſe
they have not the knowledge of them. Againe a little after in the ſame P. he tels us,
<hi>That Chriſtianity addeth no new fatherly power to a Father over his
Children, nor giveth a new husband right to the husband, once an Heathen
over his wife; for an heathen Father is as eſſentially a Father over his
Children as a Chriſtian Father, and an heathen husband an heathen maſter
&amp;c. are all as eſſentially Husband, Maſters, &amp;c. as are the Chriſtian
husbands, maſters, &amp;c.</hi> And may we not as well ſay, ſoundneſſe of knowledge
in ſuch or ſuch a particular queſtion addeth no new Church power to a Chriſtian
Church over their own members, nor giveth a new Church right over them which
they had not before; for a Church that wanteth ſuch knowledge is as eſſentially a
Church, inveſted with Church power over her members as is another Church? For
ought I perceive the caſes are alike; and if ſoundneſſe of knowledge do not give to a
Church their Church-right in this or that queſtion, how can want of that
knowledge deprive them of that right? Sure one would thinke the whole ſubſtance
of Chriſtianity might do as much for the adding of Kingly right, Fatherly right,
Husband right, &amp;c. As ſoundneſſe of knowledge in ſome one particular queſtion, for
the adding of Church right; &amp; that the want of all Chriſtianity ſhould be as available
for taking away the Kingly right, the Fatherly right, &amp;c. As the want of knowledge
in one particular point for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taking away of Church-right; and ſith we have our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
own teſtimony cleer and full for the one, it ſeems to me the caſes are ſo parallel
and proportionable, that the other is unavoidable: I meane thus, ſith in the one caſe
the whole ſubſtance of Chriſtianity doth not give power, nor the want thereof take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the ſame by our Brothers own teaching, I know not how in the other caſe ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of knowledge in one particular queſtion ſhould give power or right, &amp; want of
ſuch knowledge take away the ſame. And ſo for <hi>Antioch</hi> in particular, if it were as
our Brother ſuppoſeth that the greater part of them did hold againſt the truth in
that queſtion about Circumciſion, I ſee not how this could deprive them of their
Church right which they had before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for our Brothers reaſon that Chriſt hath given no Eccleſiaſticall
right and power to determine againſt the truth, but onely for the truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:114129:25"/>
This ſaying I confeſſe is very true, but doth not ſuffice for the purpoſe for which hee
brings it, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove that <hi>Antioch</hi> being ignorant of the truth in that queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Circumciſion, or holding againſt the truth therein did thereby loſe their
Church right to determine. For if this reaſon be good, then a man may conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that power in heathen Kings, Parents, and Husbands, to governe their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
children and Wives; which our Brother, as we heard afore, hath granted and
taught: For ſuppoſe that <hi>Antioch</hi> were ignorant of the truth in that particular is it not
cleere that the Kings, Parents, and Husbands mentioned are ignorant of the truth in
many more matters? And it <hi>Antioch</hi> do hereupon looſe their right, becauſe Chriſt
hath given no power to determine againſt the truth but for the truth, how will it be
avoided but by the ſame reaſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Kings and the others mentioned muſt likewiſe loſe
their right to governe their own ſubjects and families? For the Lord gives no right,
I hope, to Pagans againſt the truth, no more then he doth unto Churches. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the reaſon be valid and ſtrong in the one caſe, and for the purpoſe, for which
our Brother brings it, it ſeemes to be as ſtrong in the other caſe alſo, which ſhall be
contrary to what our Brother himſelfe doth teach.</p>
               <p>In a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Churches and <hi>Antioch</hi> in particular have right to determine queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and they ought to determine only according to the truth: They have formally a

will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o,</hi> but not elſe. Now our Brothers arguing doth ſeeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
theſe two; and becauſe of the latter which is freely granted, he would conclude
againſt the former, which we thinke is not good reaſoning; but on the contrary do
ſtill thinke, that though Churches ought to give out no determinations but ſuch as
are agreeable to truth, and that otherwiſe their determinations, in reſpect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them will not bind before God, yet for all this they may have right formally
and in <hi>Foro humano</hi> to judge, and to determine of ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if this were granted for true, that <hi>Antioch</hi> when they are againſt the
truth do loſe their right to determine Controverſies, yet we are not hereby much nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to an iſſue, unleſſe it be determined withall who muſt be judge whether they be
againſt the truth or no, and the reaſon is becauſe if they be not againſt the truth but
for it, then I hope, it will be granted that they doo not loſe their right at all. The
queſtion therefore ſtill remaines, who hath this Miniſteriall Power to Iudge whether
this or that Church, <hi>Antioch</hi> or any other be againſt the truth or for it; and unleſſe
this be cleered we are but where we were before.</p>
               <p>But to draw towards an end of this paſſage about the Church of <hi>Antioch:</hi> whether
they had right to determine Controverſies when ability failed, or whether they did
when loſe that right, I will here tranſcribe a few words of our Brother as I find them
in his ſecond, 331. Page. Wherein he either cleerely yeeldeth the cauſe, and ſaith the
ſame that we do or I am much miſtaken. The words are theſe, <hi>There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between ability to judge, and right or power to judge. A presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Church, (and he diſputeth in ſix Pages together to prove</hi> Antioch
<hi>ſuch a one, Page</hi> 470. 471. &amp;c. ſequ.) <hi>may have right,</hi> jus, <hi>and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

law to judge of a point, to the judging whereof they want ability:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114129:25"/>
therefore</hi> de facto, <hi>it belongeth to an higher Synod where more learned
men are, though</hi> de jure <hi>the Presbytery may judge it.</hi> Theſe words I wiſh
to be well conſidered. For whereas in the place we have been ſpeaking of, he ſaith
<hi>Antioch,</hi> the greater part of them being againſt the truth, did loſe their <hi>jus,</hi> their
right to determine, for which as wee have heard, he gives this reaſon, becauſe Chriſt
hath given no right and power to determine againſt the truth but for it, yet now wee
ſee he grants diſtinction between ability and right, and ſaith, a Presbyteriall Church
may ſtill retaine this latter of their right, even then, when they want the other of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
Which two ſayings whether they do perfectly agree, and whether in the latter
of them he do not plainly come up to us, againſt whom he hath been diſputing in the
former, I leaue it to the wiſe in heart, and eſpecially to himſelfe to conſider. For,
for my part I muſt confeſſe that theſe two ſayings, A Presbyteriall Church as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>
may have right, <hi>jus</hi> to judge a point, to the judging whereof they may want a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
and, <hi>Antioch</hi> a Presbyteriall Church wanting ability did thereby loſe their
right, or <hi>jus</hi> to determine the point, theſe two I ſay, are ſuch ſayings as are not eaſie
for me to reconcile.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if it be ſaid our Brother doth not deny unto <hi>Antioch,</hi> or a Church in error
all power ſimply to determine, but only to determine <hi>tali mode,</hi> that is, to determine
againſt the truth; for his words are, they loſe their <hi>jus</hi> their right <hi>eatenus,</hi> in ſo far.
I anſwer, he hath ſuch a word indeed, as <hi>eatenus,</hi> in ſo farre: but if any ſhall ſay he
meant no more in this diſpute, but only that ſuch a Church hath no right to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
againſt the truth, I conceive that he that ſhall ſo ſay, ſhall therein impute ſome
fault unto our Brother, even the fault of wreſting Mr. <hi>Tompſons</hi> Tenent and mine,
and ſuggeſting againſt us unto his Reader, as if we had held ſuch a thing as we never
wrote nor thought. For it is plain, that our Brother in his Pag. 424. is diſputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us; <hi>For he ſaith, that we teach the Church of</hi> Antioch <hi>had</hi> jus,
<hi>power to judge and determine the controverſie, but becauſe of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had not light to judge thereof,</hi> And ſets down Maſter <hi>Tompſons</hi> name and
mine as the men that ſo teach, in Anſwer, Page 42. And a few lines after he ſaith,
<hi>I thinke the Brethren erre in this, to teach, that</hi> Antioch <hi>had power to
determine the Controverſie,</hi> Act. 15. And then hee gives two reaſons for the
contrary. So that it is manifeſt that he intends this diſpute againſt us. Now what
have we ſaid in this matter? Have we delivered any ſuch thing, that <hi>Antioch</hi> had right
to determine againſt the truth? Let the Anſwer be viewed in the place which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
<hi>viz.</hi> Page 42. And I am ſure no ſuch groſſe Tenent will be there found, no
nor any where elſe in our writing. That which we have ſaid, is this, that <hi>Antioch</hi>
had right to have determined the matter if ability had ſerved thereto: but for right
to determine againſt the truth, we never ſpake one word that ſoundeth that way. Our
Brother therefore intending this diſpute againſt us, and plainly expreſſing ſo much,
and our Tenent being no other then as I have ſaid, it muſt therefore needs follow
that his intendment is, that <hi>Antioch</hi> had no right to determine that matter. But for
right to determine againſt the truth, he cannot confute ſuch a Tenent as ours, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
having delivered any ſuch thing, but he muſt withall be culpable of manifeſt
miſtaking and miſ-reporting of us to the World; and we are, and muſt be ſlow to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114129:26"/>
believe that a man of ſuch worth would willingly do us ſuch wrong. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that right to determine and not right to determine againſt the truth, is the thing
which he oppoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that I do utterly deny. For the places being viewed will plainly witneſſe that wee

called Independencie, do make the people (as ſome have thought of it) more defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and improvident then their Law. For this being objected againſt that way, wee
in anſwer thereto do ſhew by ſundry particulars, that it is not that way that is juſtly
culpable in this reſpect, but the way of our Brethren of the other Iudgement; one
way on the one ſide making the ſtate of Chriſtians in theſe dayes in ſome things equall
to the Iewes, and in other things more excellent; and on the other ſide the way of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114129:26"/>
our Brethren making our condition in many things more defective then was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Iewes. So that (not Iudayzing but) making our condition more defective
then the Iewes, is the thing which we here note in the Doctrine of our Brethren. Nor
do I ſee how our Brother in his Anſwer doth free their Doctrine and way from being
juſtly culpable in this reſpect. If we had intended the thing which he reporteth, we
would never have uſed ſuch a reaſon as he truly report<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> us to uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales
upon appeales cauſes according to our Brethrens way may be ſo protracted as
never to be determined nor ended. For this reaſon hath neither ſtrength nor colour
of ſtrength for ſuch a purpoſe, as he ſaith we bring it for, inaſmuch as it is well known,
that the Iewes had a ſupreame Iudicatory for the finall ending of cauſes among them.
And therefore to ſay that our Brethren do Iudaize, and then to give that for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which doth ſhew that the Iewes and they are very unlike, the Iewes having a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Iudicatory for the finall ending of Cruſes, and they having none, were to
ſhew our ſelves very irrationall or worſe: end why our Brother ſhould put ſuch a
thing upon us, we being no wayes guilty thereof, we do not know. But we deſire that
our reaſon may be applyed to our own concluſion, to which we did and do apply it,
and not to this other expreſſed by our Brother, which indeed is none of ours, and then
we are content that rationall and judicious Readers may judge whether or no there
be any ſufficient weight therein. Which that they may more readily do, I have here
recollected the ſame into this ſhort ſumme, that they may briefly behold it with one
view, <hi>viz</hi> If the Iewes had a ſupreame Iudicatory for the finall ending of cauſes, and
the Congregationall way hath the like: If the Iewes had a ſtanding Iudicatory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in readineſſe for the hearing of cauſes, and the Congregationall way hath the
like: and if the ſupreame Iudicatory among the Iewes was very farre remote from
many of them, and in the Congregationall way be more convenient and neere at
hand, then the Congregationall way is in ſome things equall to the Iewes and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things more excellent.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is true in all the particulars, and therefore the ſecond is true alſo.
Againe, If the Iewes had a ſupreame Iudicatory for the finall ending of cauſes, and
the way of our Brethren hath not: If the Iewes had a ſtanding Iudicatory alwayes in
readineſſe for the hearing of cauſes and the way of our Brethren hath not: and if the
ſupreame Iudicatory among the Iewes was very remote from many of them, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
among our Brethren are the ſame, then the way of our Brethren is in ſome
things as defective as the Iewes, and in other things more defective then theirs.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is true in all the particulars of it, and therefore the ſecond is true
alſo.</p>
               <p>Both the Aſſumptions in all the branches thereof, I conceive are cleerely proved
in the Anſwer in the Pages which our Brother doth alledge, and whether the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
be good let the wiſe judge.</p>
               <p>Having thus reduced our Argumentation to its own proper and genuine ſhape, let
us now conſider of Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> anſwer thereto.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſaith he, The ſpeedineſſe of ending controverſies in a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is badly compriſed with the ſuddainneſſe and temerity of delivering
men to Satan upon the deciſion of three Elders, without ſo much as asking
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114129:27"/>
adviſe of any Claſſes of Elders, and with deciding queſtions deepe and grave
which concerneth many Churches, which is a putting of a private ſickle in
a common and publicke harveſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If adviſe from other Churches may be had, we never ſpake word for doing
weighty matters without the ſame, but in ſuch caſes it is both our practiſe and adviſe
to make uſe thereof, And therefore this delivering men to Satan in way of temerity
or raſhneſſe toucheth not us whoſe opinion and practiſe is other wiſe.</p>
               <p>As for ſuddainneſſe, I conceive if the ſame be ſometimes accompanyed with temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and raſhneſſe, and ſo worthy to be blamed, yet not alwayes: for in the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Houſe of God in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> it is ſaid, that the thing was done
ſuddainly. 2 <hi>Chron. 29. 36. Where ſuddainneſſe doth not ſignifie any ſinfull temerity
or r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſhneſle.</hi> But contrarily doth teſtifie Gods great goodneſle that had ſo prepared
the people to ſo good a worke: for this cauſe this ſuddainneſſe was to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and
Gods people an occaſion and ground of great joy and gladneſſe, which temerity could
not have been. And therefore ſuddainneſſe and temerity muſt not alwayes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
and coupled together, as if they were the ſame.</p>
               <p>Though haſty delivering of men to Satan without due conſideration be not good,
yet overlong delay of due proceeding againſt Delinquents is bad alſo, for the Holy
Ghoſt tels us becauſe ſentence againſt an evill worke is not executed ſpeedily, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet to do evill, <hi>Eccl. 8. 11. For which cauſe
execute judgement in the morning,</hi> that is to ſay ſpeedily is ſometimes expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 12. Which being ſpoken of juſtice to be executed by civill Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
doth hold by proportion and like reaſon in Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, for as much
as ſpeedineſle is a duty, and delayes are daangerous in the one caſe as well as in the
other.</p>
               <p>Whereas our Author thinkes much that Excommunication ſhould proceed upon the
deciſion of three Elders, as we know nothing but a Congregation may have more El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
then the three, if God provide them fit men and the numerouſneſſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
ſo require, in which caſe our Author ſaith nothing to the contrary, but
they may have power to Excommunicate, ſo if they have but three, we know nothing
in this, but they may have power to Excommunicate notwithſtanding, ſince himſelfe
teacheth, <hi>Due Right.</hi> Page 61. <hi>That the Iewes had their Congregationall
Churches as we have, and had their meeting in their Synagogues, not
only for Doctrine, but alſo for Diſcipline and Excommunication;</hi>
Which if it be ſo, it ſeemes there might be Excommunication by as ſmall a number
as three, unleſſe it could appeare that in every Synagogue the Elders and Rulers in
it were a greater number then is here mentioned, which is more then I do remember
to be expreſſed in Scripture. Yea and further he tels us, <hi>That the inferiour Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures
in</hi> Iſrael <hi>had power of life and death, Page</hi> 315. Now the Iudges
in theſe inferiour Iudicatures though they muſt never be under that number of three,
yet they did not alwayes exceed the ſame, for ought that doth appeare. And if three
Iudges had power of life and death, why may not a Congregation with three Elders
have power of Excommunication? Moreover, in his Page 454. He gives us theſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114129:27"/>
words for a Propoſition, <hi>That it floweth connaturally from a Church to which
agreeth the eſſence of Church to exerciſe Juriſdiction over all its own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
to which thoſe words do alſo agree, Page</hi> 287. viz. <hi>The power and
right to Diſcipline is a propriety eſſentiall to a Church and is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from it till God remove the Candleſticke, and the Church ceaſe to
be a viſible Church: And in Page 302. Hee affords us theſe words for
an Aſſumption, that a Congregation is a Church, wanting nothing of the
being and eſſence of a Church:</hi> And hence the concluſion is obvious, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
may exerciſe Iuriſdiction over all it own members: and in as much as a
Congregation in which are but three Elders, is a Congregation, it followeth that a
Congregation in which are but three Elders may exerciſe ſuch Iuriſdiction. This
concluſion our Author cannot deny in as much as it neceſſarily and directly followeth
from Premiſes which are both his own. Yea in his Page 302. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſaith, <hi>That this
is a principle of Church policie, that every politicke body of Chriſt hath
power of Church government within it ſelfe.</hi> Either therefore a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with only three Elders is no politicke body of Chriſt, or elſe it muſt have power
of Church government within it ſelfe. <hi>Beſides, if the power of Iuriſdiction
ordinary intenſive be according to the entire eſſence of a Miniſteriall
Church be as compleat and perfect in one ſingle Congregation, as in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall,
Nationall, or Catholike Church as our Author ſaith it is P.</hi> 307.
It is then a marvell why ſuch a Congregation having onely three Elders, may not
have power to Excommunicate. Laſtly, his words are expreſſe, Page 338.
<hi>Where there are not many Churches conſociated, then Ordination and
Excommunication may be done by one ſingle Congregation.</hi> If therefore a
Congregation have not above three Elders, yet being not conſociated with other
Churches, it may lawfully Excommunicate, by his own grant.</p>
               <p>For deciding queſtions that concerne many Churches, if they decide them no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but onely as they concerne themſelves, this is no putting a private ſickle in a
common and publike Harveſt, but a medling with matters onely ſo farre as they doe
concerne themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſaith, All appeales without warrant from Chriſts will we
condemne, as the abuſe of Appeales to a Court which is known ſhall never
be, Page 425.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If appeales without warrant from Chriſt will be condemned, why are wee
not told what appeales they are, that have the warrant of Chriſts will, and what Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales
have not? For ſuch a generall word a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this, of the warrant of Chriſts will,
without ſome further and more particular explication doth leave the matter as darke
as it was before. If the meaning be, that only ſuch Appeales are unwarrantable as
are made to a Court which is known ſhall never be, and that all others are warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
then it will follow that appeales to generall Councels and all other Courts,
except only from a generall Councell are warrantable, for who doth certainely
know that a generall Councell will never be? And ſo by this meanes the Claſſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:114129:28"/>
Synod, and the Nationall Church are all deprived of ſupremacie, and independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of Iuriſdiction as well as the Congregacion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſaith, <hi>Antiochs</hi> appeale to a Synod 200 miles diſtant as our
Brethren ſay, was no Judaizing but that which <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles
were guilty of as well as we.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were 200 miles diſtant or no as we have
never affirmed ſo much, ſo I will not ſtand now to inquire. But this I ſtand upon,
that no Scripture doth witneſſe that <hi>Antioch</hi> did appeale to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the point of
Iuriſdiction, about which our queſtion doth lye, if they did appeale to them for a
Doctrinall deciſion or determination of the queſtion, that nothing hindereth our
cauſe who do not deny ſuch a Doctrinall power in Synods. But their power of Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is the thing that ſhould be proved. Laſtly, if this example of <hi>Antioch</hi> doe
prove that there may bee and ought to bee appeales from Congregations to Synods,
though thoſe Synods be 200 miles diſtant, then that which wee ſaid in the Anſwer is
here confeſſed to be true: <hi>viz.</hi> That according to our Brethrens Iudgement the ſtate
of the Church in point of Diſcipline is as defective and burdenſome in the time of the
Goſpell, as it was in the dayes of the old Teſtament. For as then the ſupreame Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory
at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was many miles diſtant from ſuch as dwelt in the furtheſt parts
of the Holy Land, and ſpecially from the Proſelites that dwelt in other Countries, ſo
here our Author ſeemes to yeeld that in theſe dayes of the new Teſtament there muſt
or may be appeales to Synods, though they be 200 miles diſtant. I hope then if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
blame our way for making the Goſpell as defective and improvident as the Law,
or more defective then it, yet this our Brother will not do ſo, but on the contrary will
acknowledge for us and with us, that the way which himſelfe pleads for, is more juſtly
culpable in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he ſaith, Matters concerning many Churches muſt be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This may be granted in a ſafe ſence without any prejudice at all unto our
cauſe, for we are well content that ſo farre as they concerne many they may be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by many, ſo that each Congregation may have liberty to deale in them ſo farre
as they concerne themſelves.</p>
               <p>And thus you have all which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath brought againſt that paſſage of
ours wherein we ſay it is not our way but theirs, that doth make the Goſpell more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
then the Law, inſtead whereof he is pleaſed to make us ſay that they doe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daize;

is ordinary, as in the Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> there is ſcarce a Congregation
to be found within 20, or 30 miles. 2. Suppoſe the caſe were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

ſubjoyneth his Anſwer.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our Authors ſcope and intention being to prove a Presbyteriall Church
at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> I cannot apprehend a good reaſon, why now he ſhould fall upon the

ſeemes he was willing to go ſomething out of his way that ſo he might have a ſaying

Anſwer might have been kept, without making alteration by leaving ſome things out,
and putting others in of his own accord, and by mentioning others with another face
then was ever intended by us. For though he is pleaſed to mention a Church in an
Iland and the firſt founded Congregation at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in his Objection which he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will find that neither of theſe are once mentioned by us at all, and why then they
ſhould be brought in as ours I do not know. And for the former part of our Anſwer,
wherein we ſhow that for a Chriſtian Congregation to want neighbour Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to whom they may with conveniency have recourſe, and not ſo unuſuall as ſome
may imagine, we do not only alledge for that end the Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> as our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth report, but alſo the remoter parts of the North, and ſpecially the ſtate of
things in times and places of generall Perſecution and generall prophaneneſſe, and
new Plantations in Heathen Countries; all which our Brother doth omit, as if wee
had not mentioned any of them. And whereas we mention the ſcarcity of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the remoter parts of <hi>Wales</hi> and of the North, as intimated by our Reverend
Brother Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> in that learned and loving diſcourſe of his, whereto we doe apply

are ſuch as wee for our parts would not willingly have made the like in any

               <p>We thinke ſaith he, a Miniſtery and Diſcipline more neceſſary to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
in a remote Iland, or to the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> before they
increaſe to ſuch a number as cannot meet for their numerous multitude
in one Congregation, then the Sacraments when there be no Miniſters to
diſpenſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Would not one thinke by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe words, and the other laid down in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that we had ſpoken ſomething of a Church in an Iland, and of the Church
in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Elſe why ſhould theſe be objected, and anſwered as ours? But th
truth is we have not ſpoken one word either of the one or the other of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
which will plainly appeare to him that ſhall view the place. Something wee
have ſpoken in the generall of a Congregation that wants neighbours, which we did
being thereunto led by our Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> but of a Church in an I<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land,
and of the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in particular, of which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> heere
ſpeaks, of theſe we have ſaid nothing.</p>
               <p>Second, the former part of our anſwer, that for a Congregation to want neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
is not ſo unuſuall as ſome may imagine, this Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> wholly paſſeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in ſilence, only he propounds it in his Objection in ſuch ſort as we have heard,
and ſo leaves it, whereby it ſeemes he yeelds the thing. And thereupon it followes,
that intireneſſe of Iuriſdiction in a Congregation muſt be yeelded frequently lawfull,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114129:29"/>
it being frequently ſeene, that Congregations want neighbours in which caſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireneſſe
of Iuriſdiction is not denyed.</p>
               <p>Third, for the ſecond part of our anſwer, we thus expreſſe our ſelves therein. <hi>viz.
That we ſuppoſe it is good to take heed how farre we yeeld it lawfull in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
caſes to tranſgreſſe and violate ordinary rules, whereof wee
render the reaſon, leaſt ſome body doe thence inferre the lawfulneſſe
of miniſtring Sacraments by non-Miniſters, in caſe Miniſters be wanting.</hi>
This is that which we have ſaid in this matter. If therefore Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> would
take away what we have ſaid herein, he muſt ſay it is not good nor needfull to take
ſuch heed, but men may yeeld it lawfull in ſuch caſes to tranſgreſſe and violate ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rules, and never need to take heed how farre they yeeld therein. This indeed
were contradictory to what we have ſaid, and if this be once cleered for truth, then I
muſt confeſſe our ſaying is cleerely diſproved. But the cleering of this we hope our
Brother will never attempt: Sure yet he hath not done it, and ſo our ſaying yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
as it was.</p>
               <p>Fourth, Whereas he ſaith he thinkes a Miniſtery and Diſcipline more neceſſary in
the caſes he ſpeaks of, then Sacraments and there be no Miniſters, though this be not
directly oppoſite to what we have ſaid, yet becauſe I would conſider of every thing
wherein he ſeemes to ayme at us, therefore I am willing to conſider of this alſo. Our
Reverend Brother thinkes Diſcipline in the caſes mentioned more neceſſary then
Sacraments: and yet in his Page 287, 288. handling that queſtion, whether Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
be a marke of the viſible Church, and laying down ſundry diſtinctions about
the ſame, hee gives us theſe ſeverall Propoſitions in termes: <hi>Firſt, care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
Diſcipline may be wanting in a true Church. Second, right Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is not neceſſary to the eſſence of a viſible Church as a City may bee
without Wals, a Garden without a hedge. Third, the exerciſe of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
may be wanting, and the Church a true viſible Church. Fourth, the
Church may retaine the eſſence and being of a viſible Church, and yet
have no Diſcipline in actuall uſe or little, in which place he cites and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
the judgement of</hi> Parker, Cartwright <hi>and others; who make
Diſcipline neceſſary only to the wel-being of the Church, as being not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
but commanded in the word and neceſſary in reſpect of its end.</hi>
Now if this be all the neceſſity that is in Diſcipline, how is Diſcipline more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
then Sacraments? For may not as much bee ſaid of them as here is ſaid of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline?
Are not Sacraments neceſſary to the well-being of the Church, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the word, as well as Diſcipline is? And ſerving for excellent ends, as
well as Diſcipline doth? I ſuppoſe it will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> be denyed, and therefore the neceſſity
of Diſcipline above Sacraments doth not yet appeare. Eſpecially if that be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
withall which our Brother teacheth elſe-where. <hi>viz.</hi> In his ſecond P. 211. <hi>&amp;

ſequ.</hi> Where he tels us, <hi>That Sacraments are not only declarative ſignes,
but alſo reall exhibitive ſeales of Grace, having a cauſality in them to make
a thing that was not, and ſo excelling all civill Seales which do adde no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114129:30"/>
new Lands to the owner of the Charter ſealed therewith.</hi> Now if Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be thus excellent and effectuall, how is it that in the place wee have in hand,
Diſcipline is made more neceſſary then they? For a greater Elogie then here hee
gives to Sacraments, I ſuppoſe himſelfe would not give unto Diſcipline. Yea in P.
302 he expreſly affirmes, <hi>That Preaching of the word and adminiſtration of
the Sacraments are eſſentiall notes of the viſible Church.</hi> But of Diſcipline
I conceive he will not ſay the ſame, ſure it is in the Page following diſtinguiſhing
betwixt notes of the Church which are neceſſary <hi>ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe, To the very being of a
viſible Church, and ſuch as are neceſſary only</hi> ad bene eſſe, <hi>to the well-being
thereof, he expreſly makes Diſcipline a worke or note of this ſecond
ſort, and as we heard ere-while, he in Page 287 expreſly affirmes it is not
neceſſary to the eſſence of a Church.</hi> And therefore it is ſome marvell why
now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> makes Diſcipline more neceſſary then Sacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he gives us two reaſons of this greater neceſſity of Diſcipline then of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Firſt, that intire power of Diſcipline in a Congregation that wants
neighbours is not extraordinary Second, that there is no ſuch morall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of Sacraments, as there is of Diſcipline, Page 455.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the former his words are theſe,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Church be
in an Iland it ſelfe alone may poſſibly be extraordinary, but that in ſuch a
caſe they have intire power of diſcipline whole and entire within themſelves
to Excommunicate Scandalous perſons is not extraordinary.</hi> Wherein firſt
of all I obſerve a difference between him and our Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> who
having granted that where there is no conſociation or neighbour-hood of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
there a ſingle Congregation muſt not be denyed intireneſſe of Iuriſdiction,
doth preſently adde that the caſe is extraordinary, and ſo fals not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of the queſtion of the ordinary rule of Church-government: Independencie of
Churches, P. 2. plainly confeſſing that the caſe is extraordinary, whereas Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi>
here ſaith it is not.</p>
               <p>Second, as he expreſly differs from Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> ſo it is conſiderable whether his
words do well agree with themſelves. <hi>For ſaith he, That the Church be in an
Iland it ſelfe alone may be extraordinary, but that in ſuch caſe they have
entire power of Iuriſdiction of Diſcipline within themſelves, to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
Scandalous perſons, is not extraordinary.</hi> Which ſaying needs
good explication. For it ſeemes hard to conceive how the power and actions of any
ſubject or efficient ſhould be more uſuall and ordinary then its very being and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance:
Which yet muſt needs bee, if this ſtand good that the being of a Church in
an Iland is extraordinary, and yet the power of ſuch a Church to Excommunicate is
uſuall and ordinary</p>
               <p>Third, If their power of Diſcipline, yea intire Power be in the caſe expreſſed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ary,
ſhall we then ſay that if the caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e otherwiſe ſo that a Church be not alone
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114129:30"/>
but have neighbours, entireneſſe of power in ſuch a caſe is extraordinary? It ſeemes
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, or elſe wee muſt ſay that intireneſſe of power in both caſes is ordinary.
If this latter be ſaid, it is as much as we deſire: for then I hope it muſt not be a ſmall

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> power being ordinary in them both. For if it be ſo in them both, in the
one as well as in the other, I know not why any ſmall or ordinary matter ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the one Church any more then the other from the uſe and exerciſe of ſuch entire
power. If we ſay that entireneſſe of power in a Church that hath neighbours is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
though in a Church that is alone it be ordinary, beſides that ſuch a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſounds harſhly and ſeemes very improbable, we ſhall by this meanes make caſes
extraordinary to be very frequent &amp; uſuall, in as much as all men know it is very u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
for Congregationall
Churches to have neighbours: and ſo if entireneſſe of power
in a Church that hath neighbours be extraordinary, it will follow that extraorninary
power is very uſuall and frequent; ſo that inconveniences on each ſide do ſeeme ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably
to follow againſt our Brothers cauſe, upon this which here he affirmeth, that
entireneſſe of power in a Church that is alone is not extraordinary.</p>
               <p>But let us here his reaſon in the ſubſequent words, why this entireneſſe of power
in a Church that is alone is not extraordinary. <hi>For it floweth ſaith he, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from a Church, to which agreeth the eſſence of a Church, to exerciſe
Iuriſdiction over all its own members.</hi> And I ſuppoſe he muſt meane this of
Iuriſdiction entire and compleat, for of this is the queſtion, and a few lines afore,
<hi>He expreſly cals it entire power of Diſcipline, whole and entire within
themſelves.</hi> Now if this be true which here is ſaid, as for my part I conceive no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of it, that it floweth connaturally from a Church, to which agreeth the eſſence of
a Church to exerciſe entire Iuriſdiction over all its own members, then it will follow
that a Church that hath neighbours as well as a Church that hath none muſt have
this entireneſſe of Iuriſdiction, ſith the eſſence of a Church doth agree to the one as
well as to the other, to a Church that hath neighbours as well as to a Church that is
alone. Our Author tels us Page 302. <hi>That a Congregation in an Iland is a
Church properly ſo called, and hath the eſſentiall notes of a viſible Church
agreeing to it, and wants nothing of the being and eſſence of a Church.</hi>
And if this be true of a Church that is alone, ſhall we thinke it is not true of a Church
that hath neighbours? Doth the acceſſion of neighbours to a Congregation take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from ſuch a Congregation the eſſence of a Church which it had before? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
none will ſo ſay. And if every Church to which agreeth the eſſence of a Church
may exerciſe entire Iuriſdiction over all its own members, as our Brother doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
it followeth unavoidably thereupon that all Congregationall Churches,
ſuch as have neighbours and ſuch as have none may exerciſe ſuch entireneſſe of Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
ſith the eſſence of a Church doth agree unto them all. Vnleſſe he will deny
the eſſence of a Church to a Congregation which hath neighbours, which hee freely
yeeldeth to a Congregation which is alone, he muſt grant entireneſſe of Iuriſdiction
unto them both, becauſe he grants it to the one upon this reaſon, that the eſſence of a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114129:31"/>
Church doth agree thereunto, which reaſon if it agree to both, how can i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be avoided
but entireneſſe of Iuriſdiction muſt be in both? And how can it be affirmed or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that a Congregation having the eſſence of a Church afore and have neighbours,
ſhould loſe this eſſence of a Church when neighbours are added to it? A family ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the eſſence of a family now it is alone, doth not loſe this eſſence by meanes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
families added. Nor doth a City that is ſuch, as it is alone loſe the eſſence of a
City by the acceſſe of other Cities: and the ſame might be ſaid of a Corporation, a
Province, a Kingdome, or any other ſociety whatſoever. And that it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with a Congregationall Church, that it ſhould loſe the eſſence of a Church as
other neighbours Churches do ariſe, doth ſeeme very ſtrange and unreaſonable. And
let the eſſence of a Church be ſtill retayned by ſuch a Congregation, as I conceive it
muſt, and then intireneſſe of Iuriſdiction muſt not be denyed to ſuch a Congregation,
ſith it doth flow connaturally from every Church to which the eſſence of a Church
doth agree.</p>
               <p>If there bee no more conſociated with that Church that is by accident,
and an extraordinary exigence of Gods Providence. As a Maſter of a
family is to educate his children in the feare of God, but if God take
all his children from him by death, he doth not tranſgreſſe the ordinary
rule of educating his children in the feare of God, as he hath none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this compariſon doe ſuit the preſent purpoſe and caſe in hand, then this
Maſter of a family is a Congregation, and theſe his children are the members of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Congregations: And ſo as a Maſter of a family needs not to educate his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in Gods feare, when they are all taken from him by death, ſo a Congregation
needs not to governe the members of other Congregation as there are no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
extant, but it ſelfe is left alone in an Iland. In which kind of arguing ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
things may be excepted againſt. As fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of all that there ſhould be ſuch power
in a Congregation as in a Maſter of a family over his own children, which needs a
good deale of proofe afore it may be yeelded, in as much as the power of the one is
plainly and plentifully taught in the Scripture, as <hi>Eph. 4. 6. Col. 3. Deut. 6. 7.
Deut.</hi> 21. And many other places. But I deſire one cleere place of Scripture, in all
the Book of God either old Teſtament or new, to ſhew the like power in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
Church, over the members of other Churches. Againe, when a Maſter of
a family hath all his children taken from him by death, he hath then no children of
his own to governe, but wants a Congregationall Church &amp; is left alone in an Iland,
the Presbytery of that Congregation is left alone, but have ſtill the members of that
Congregation whom they may and ought to guide and governe in the feare of God,
which is another particular wherein the compariſon failes.</p>
               <p>But though the ſimilitude as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath laid it down, doth not confirme
his purpoſe, yet I conceive it may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo framed and applyed as that it may well ſerve
for the weekning thereof, thus; A Maſter of a family having (when that family is
alone) entire power to governe his family in the feare of God, when other families
do ariſe that become neighbours neere adjoyning, he is not by this meanes deprived
of the power which he had before, but ſtill retaines the ſame entire and compleate as
formerly it was: even ſo the Presbytery of a Congregationall Church having
(when that Congregation is alone,) entire power of Iuriſdiction over its own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114129:31"/>
is not when neighbour Congregation do ariſe, deprived by this meanes of the
power which it had before, but ſtill retaines the ſame entire as formerly it was. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
though when God takes away a mans children by death, he is no longer bound
to educate and governe thoſe children in the feare of God, yet as long as his children
live with him in his family, it is not the ſitting down of other families neere by him
that can take away this power from him, or diſcharge him of this duty: even ſo,
though when members of a Congregation be taken away by death or otherwiſe, the
Congregation or its Presbytery doth no longer ſtand charged or bound with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
and government of ſuch members yet as long as they live in the Congregation,
it is not the ariſing of other Congregations neere to them that can free them from the
power wherewith they were inveſted, nor from the duty wherewith they were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charged towards ſuch members, Thus the compariſon runs even, and we ſee our
Brothers cauſe is not a little diſadvantaged thereby. But as he hath laid it down, it
doth ſo apparantly faile that I do not perceive how it can afford him any helpe at
all.</p>
               <p>This argument ſuppoſeth that the Congregation hath no power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
at all, either compleat or incompleate, as the Midwife hath
no power to Baptize, either compleate or incompleate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe a Congregation have an incompleate power when they have
neighbours, how ſhall it appeare that when they are alone their power is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat?
Or how will it be avoided but by the like reaſon, one Elder alone may Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
in caſe there be no other Elders to joyne with him? For plain it is,
that one Elder when their is a full Presbytery or Claſſis hath an incompleate power,
though not a compleat. And yet I hope this incompleat power in one Elder when there
are other Elders joyned with him, will not warrant him to exerciſe a power compleat
when he is alone, becauſe ſuch a power muſt be exerciſed by a Church, with one El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
alone cannot be. And if one Elder having an incompleat power when he is joyned
with others, may not exerciſe a compleat power when he is alone, how will the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat
power of a Congregation when they have neighbours (ſuppoſe that in ſuch
caſe their power were indeed incompleate) how will this I ſay warr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

power of the Congregation is no more warranted upon this ground, then the
like power of one Elder upon the ſame ground, the caſes being alike in both.</p>
               <p>Neither doth a Congregation tranſgreſſe any rule of Christ at all when
it exerciſeth entire power of cenſures within it ſelf, whereas there be no
conſociated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I grant is very true; and I deſire it may not be recalled, but may
ſtill ſtand as here it is expreſly given to us; and then I deſire to know what rule of
Chriſt is tranſgreſſed, if an other Congregation, I meane a Congregation that hath
neighbours, do exerciſe the like power. For my part I know no ſuch rule, nor any
good reaſon but if that the one Congregation may ſo practiſe, the other Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may do the like, and that the grounds (at leaſt ſome of them) which will warrant
the one, will alſo ſuffice to warrant the other. Nevertheleſſe when any rule of Chriſt
ſhal be produced that doth reſtraine a Congregation that hath neighbours of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
power, which is ſo freely and plainly granted to the Congregation that is alone,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114129:32"/>
I ſhall then grant that the former muſt have leſſe liberty to exerciſe this power, then
is here granted to the latter. In the meane time, that which here is yeelded to the
one doth amongſt other things induce me to thinke that the ſame ought to be granted
to the other, and ſo that entireneſſe of power is in them both.</p>
               <p>A Congregation <hi>(viz.</hi> which is alone) is capable of entire Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
becauſe it is a Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How will it then be avoided but a Congregation which hath neighbours,
or a Congregation which was alone and now hath neighbours added to it, how will it
be avoided I ſay, but ſuch a Congregation as this is alſo capable of entire Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
For can it be denyed but ſuch a Congregation is a Church, as well as the other?
Sure if Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his Doctrine elſewhere delivered do ſtand good, this cannot
be denyed at all. For in his Page 301 he ſaith, <hi>That is a Church, and hath
the eſſence of a Church, to which agree the eſſentiall notes of a viſible
Church, and Preaching of the word and adminiſtration of the Sacraments
ſaith he are eſſentiall notes of a viſible Church.</hi> Which if it bee ſo, then a
Congregation that hath neighbours is a viſible Church, and hath the eſſence of a
Church, becauſe Preaching of the word and adminiſtration of the Sacraments are
cleerely found in ſuch a Congregation. And if ſuch a Congregation be a Church,
then by his own Doctrine in this place which we have in hand, ſuch a Congregation
is capable of entire Iuriſdiction. For thus I argue from his own words</p>
               <p>Every Congregation which is a Church is capable of entire Iuriſdiction.</p>
               <p>But a Congregation which hath neighbours is a Church.</p>
               <p>Therefore a Congregation which hath neighbours is capable of entire Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is that which we ſtand for, and it makes directly againſt our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet I ſee not how he can avoyd it, becauſe both the premiſes are his own.
For the Propoſition is plaine from the words we have in hand, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>z. A Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is capable of entire Juriſdiction becauſe it is a Church.</hi> Now
if this be the reaſon why it is capable thereof, then looke to what Congregation this
reaſon doth agree, every ſuch Congregation muſt be ſo capable. For our Author well
knoweth that <hi>à quatenus ad omnia conſequentia.</hi> And for the Aſſumption, the ſame is
confirmed by his words, Page 302, <hi>Where he makes that to be a Church, and
to have the eſſence of a Church, to which the Preaching of the word,
and adminiſtration of the Sacraments do agree.</hi> And theſe agreeing to a
Congregation that hath neighbours, it followeth that a Congregation that hath
neighbours is a Church. Vnleſſe hee will deny to a Congregation that hath neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
power of Preaching the word and adminiſtring the Sacraments (which I am
perſwaded he will not deny at all) it will unavoidably follow from his own ground
that ſuch a Congregation is a viſible Church. And if ſuch a Congregation be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church, then by his own ground alſo, ſuch a Congregation muſt be capable of
entire Iuriſdiction: which concluſion if it bee granted we deſire no more, for it is the
thing that we hold.</p>
               <p>A woman in no caſe is capable of adminiſtring Baptiſme or the Lords
Supper, except ſhe were extraordinarily and immediately inſpired to bee a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114129:32"/>
Propheteſſe, but for the exerciſe of entire power of Juriſdiction by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
in a remote Iland, I hope it hath no ſuch need of immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nor do wee thinke otherwiſe; but (that we may keepe to the points and
bring up the diſpute to the thing in queſtio) if ſuch a Congregation having no
ſuch inſpiration may notwithſtanding lawfully exerciſe intire power of Iuriſdiction
within themſelves, and that upon this reaſon, becauſe they now are alone, which if
they had neighbours were not lawfull for them to do, then let it be well conſidered,
whether by the like reaſon in the like extraordinary caſe, Baptiſme and the Lords
Supper may not be adminiſtred the one of them by a woman, and both of them by
ſuch as are no Miniſters. For as in one caſe the plea, to make it lawfull is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch a Congregation hath no neighbours, ſo in the other the plea is becauſe
the Congregation hath no Miniſters, nor perhaps there are no men at hand. And
if the one which at other times were unlawfull, yet in ſuch an extraordinary exigence
of Gods Providence may be lawfully done, though there be no immediate inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to warrant the ſame, why doth there need ſuch immediate inſpiration to warrant
the other, the extraordinary exigence of Gods Providence being alike in both. I
deſire I may not be miſtaken in this paſſage, for I doe not affirme (nor ever did)
that the diſpenſation of Diſcipline and of Sacraments in the caſes mentioned are both
alike unlawfull, or elſe both alike lawfull. The Anſwer will not witneſſe that I
have ſo affirmed, neither yet this preſent diſcourſe t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> much leſſe do I hold that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may be diſpenſed by women or by men that are not Miniſters. All that I
have ſaid in this matter is thus much, that it is good to take heed how farre we yeeld
it lawfull in ſuch extraordinary caſes, as want of neighbours, to tranſgreſſe and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
ordinary rules, leaſt ſome body do thence inferre that Sacraments may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
by women or men that are no Miniſters, in caſe that Miniſters or men be
wanting. This I have ſaid indeed, as being tender and afraid to open a dore too far
for liberty of tranſgreſſing ordinary rules, and conceiving that keeping cloſe to thoſe
rules is the ſafeſt way. If any man be more bold and dare open the dore further then
I dare adventure to do, and thinke he can eaſily ſhut the ſame againe, to ſtop the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
and ill conſequents which I feare may thence enſue. I ſhall leave him
to his diſcretion, and the guidance of God therein, onely craving thus much for my
ſelfe that no more may be imputed to me, nor reported of me in this or other matters,
then indeed I have affirmed or expreſſed.</p>

is not alwayes annexed to the Miniſtery as an inſeparable adjunct thereof, nor are
Cenſures to be preferred before Sacraments as more neceſſary, as our Brother would
have it, for as much as here is a Miniſtery and the adminiſtring of Sacraments, the
neceſſity of the ſoules of the Congregation requiring ſo, and yet for all this not any
power of cenſures at all. Our Brother therefore may make his choyce, whether hee
will grant the power of the Keyes of Diſcipline to bee in the people, or whether he
will ſay the neceſſity of the ſoules in a Congregation doth require Sacraments more

And the one of them being the chiefe Patron of the power of Claſſes and Synods, It
is ſome marvell to me that no word of Anſwer is vouchſafed to them by Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
but that their words are thus paſſed by with ſilence, and the name of one of
them not ſo much as mentioned. How ever this is cleere, that he that gainſayes the
Anſwer in this paſſage, hath not only the Anſwer, but alſo the Reverend Author here
mentioned to be againſt him. But let us come to conſider of Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
which he ſubjoyneth in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Power of Iuriſdiction floweth from the eſſence of a Congregation in an
Iland, <hi>ergo</hi> a totall and compleat power of Iuriſdiction floweth from the
eſſence of a Church or Congregation conſociated, it followeth no wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> I deſire the reaſon may be laid down according to our true meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and in its full ſtrength; and then the former part thereof muſt not only ſpeak of
power of Iuriſdiction flowing from the eſſence of a Church that want neighbours, but
of entire power, for thereof is the queſtion; and in the latter part the termes muſt
no: be a Church conſociated but a Church that hath neighbours; Now if entire pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Iuriſdiction do flow from the eſſence of a Church, and therefore this eſſence
of a Church being found in a Congregation that wants neighbours, this entireneſſe
of power mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t thereupon be granted to ſuch a Congregation; I then demand why
the like entireneſſe of power muſt not be granted as well to a Congregation that hath
neighbours, ſith the eſſence of a Church is found in this Congregation, as well as in
the other. For ought I ſee either the eſſence of a Church muſt be denyed to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
that hath neighbours or elſe it will follow that entireneſſe of power muſt
be granted to ſuch a Congregation, Riſibility and power of reaſon flowing immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
and neceſſarily from the eſſence of a man, and power to defend it ſelfe and
purge out excrements flowing in like ſort from the eſſence of a humane body, and
power to governe it ſelf with family government flowing in like ſort from the eſſence
of a family; therefore we muſt not grant theſe powers to be entire in ſuch a man, ſuch
a body, or ſuch a family as is alone, and deny the ſame to one that hath neighbours,
but muſt grant them alike unto all, becauſe this power flowes from their very eſſence,
which is as truly found in ſuch as have neighbours, as it is in thoſe that are alone.
And the like may be ſaid in other caſes. And why it ſhould be otherwiſe in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
Church, that the power of the Iuriſdiction flowing from the eſſence of ſuch
a Church ſhould therefore be entire in ſuch a Congregation as is alone in an Iland,
and yet not entire in a Congregation that hath neighbours, though this Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath the eſſence of a Church as well as the other, why theſe Congregations I ſay
ſhould thus greatly differ in their power, and yet be alike in their eſſence from
whence their power doth flow, for my part I yet do not underſtand the reaſon.</p>
               <p>Nor doth that ſatisfy which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> here alledgeth, <hi>That one Paſtor
in a Congregation hath as a Paſtor power to rebuke ſin and to adminiſter

the Sacraments, but theſe three Paſtors have power with him:</hi>
This I conceive doth not help the matter at all: For though it be true that theſe
three Paſtors being added to the firſt have each of them the like power as the
firſt had, yet the power of the firſt for the performance of theſe things mentioned, is
as comple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t in him notwithſtanding this addition, as it was before, and not any whit
abated nor impayred thereby: And the reaſon is, becauſe matters of order flowing
from the eſſence of a Paſtor may bee ſufficiently and compleatly performed by one
Paſtor ſingly, which acts of Iuriſdiction cannot. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his own words in
this caſe are theſe, <hi>viz. A ſingle Paſtor may Miniſterially give out Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
in the authority of Chriſt, but hee cannot himſelfe cenſure or
Excommunicate the contraveners of thoſe Commandements:</hi> Due Right,
<hi>Page 387. And againe, Page 387, 388 It is proper is acts of Iuriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Eccleſiaſticall that they cannot be exerciſed by one alone, but muſt be
exerciſed by a ſociety: but a Paſtor as a Paſtor himſelfe alone without any
collaterally joyned with him exerciſeth his Paſtorall acts of Preaching
and adminiſtring the Sacraments.</hi> Now if a Paſtor as a Paſtor himſelf alone
without any collatterally joyned with him, may thus exerciſe his Paſtorall acts, then
indeed the acceſſe or addition of other Paſtors is not at all deſtructive of his Paſtorall
power, but he ſtill retaineth the ſame as compleat and perfect as before, becauſe hee
doth theſe acts as a Paſtor and remaineth a Paſtor ſtill. But how this example and
inſtance can any thing further Mr. <hi>Ruth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rford</hi> his purpoſe, I do not underſtand. For
his intention is to make good that a Congregation may have entire power when it is
alone, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d yet not ſo when other Congregations do ariſe; and for the conſuming of
this hee brings this inſtance and example from a Paſtor that hath a Paſtorall power
afore other Paſtors are added; who by the addition of others hath no leſſe power
then afore; which example I conceive rather makes againſt him then for him.
<hi>For ſaith he, Page 456. Their Paſtorall power added to him is Cumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and auxiliary, but not privative or deſtructive of his Paſtorall power,
and therefore that the firſt Paſtor ſuffereth loſſe by the addition of theſe
three to him, who, ſaith he, will ſay this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know none that will ſay it; but if their power be Cumulative and auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
to his Paſtorall power, and no wayes privative or deſtructive thereof, then
what power he had afore they were added, the ſame he hath ſtill in as great meaſure
as formerly, and ſo his Paſtorall acts are as perfect and valid as they were before.
Now let the ſame bee granted to a Congregation that hath neighbour Congregations
added, and we have what we demand: And if this be not granted, then though the
power of thoſe other Paſtors be Cumulative and auxiliary to the other Paſtor, yet
the power of thoſe other Congregations ſeemes not ſo to the former Congregation,
but rather privative or deſtructive of its power, and then how can this example con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
our Brothers purpoſe, or how can it be avoided but the example which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
doth make againſt himſelfe? Sure if the power of theſe other Paſtors bee not
deſtructive to the former Paſtors power, but auxiliary thereto, ſo that what power
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114129:36"/>
he had before, the ſame he retayneth ſtill, and in the ſame meaſure, then it muſt bee
ſo likew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe in a Congregation when neighbour Congregations are added, or elſe this
example will not ſuit: But make the examples to agree and our cauſe is advantaged
thereby.</p>
               <p>Our Brethren doe conceive the power of Congregations in its kind and
eſſence to be Monarchicall, ſo as if any power from conſociated Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be added thereunto, the Congregations power Monarchicall is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
and the eſſence of it changed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The power of Congregations we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from Chriſt Ieſus, and to be exerciſed according to his appointment; and in him
alone and in no other do we place this Monarchicall power; according to what the
Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth, that there are differences of adminiſtrations but the ſame
Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 5. And though our Brother is pleaſed to put this upon us,
that we conceive the power of Congregations to bee Monarchicall, yet in truth the
ſame is farre from us: Nor do I thinke that ſo much as one of us can be named, that
at any time hath ſo ſpoken: Nor doth ſuch a thing follow from any thing delivered
by us concerning the power of Congregations. For as for that which here he intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and elſewhere expreſſeth more plainly, ſo that the power of Iuriſdiction in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
is cloſely made void or deſtroyed by that power which ſome aſcribe unto
Claſſes, if this be holden by us, doth it thence follow that we hold the power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations

truly concluded upon that which hee affirmeth of deſtroying the power of Churches
by the power of the Pope and Prelate. And if not, how then can any man conclude
againſt us that we hold a Monarchicall power in Congregations, though wee ſhould

               <p>Firſt, the ordinary power of Iuriſdiction becauſe of neereſt vicinity
and contiguity of members is given by Ieſus Chriſt to one Congregation in
an Iſle, becauſe that Church is a Church properly ſo called: It is a little
City, and a little Kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, having within it ſelfe power
of the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

a Church to which agree the eſſentiall notes of a Church: now Preaching

               <p>Second, a Congregation is a Church wanting nothing of the being and

               <p>Such ſayings as theſe himſelfe hath delivered in the pages and places here cited, and

himſelfe And if from theſe the entireneſſe of Iuriſdiction in a Church that hath
neighbours may juſtly be deduced, as I conceive it may, and have above manifeſted,
it will then but little availe him to waſh his hands from the ſtayne of that other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
ſaying afore mentioned, which no man that I know do charge him withall. For
as long as theſe other ſayings do ſtand unrecalled, ſo long wee have cleere grounds
from himſelfe and his own words, for entireneſſe of Iuriſdiction in every Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Church, and ſo for the weakening of his cauſe, and for the ſtrengthening of
our own.</p>
               <p>A power to governe well and according to the rule of the Word added
to an other power to governe well and according to the Word, is an auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114129:37"/>
power and no way deſtructive to that power to which it is added. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a power to governe well added to a power of male-adminiſtration in a
Congregation is deſtructive of that power, and reaſon it ſhould bee ſo,
becauſe Christ never gave any ſuch power of male-adminiſtration to a
Congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here our Brother ſpeakes of two caſes, firſt of a Power of governing well
added to a power of governing well. Second, of a power of governing well added to a
power of governing ill; but beſides theſe, there is a third caſe which had need to bee
conſidered alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> A power of governing ill added to a power of governing well,
which may be the caſe when the power of Claſſis is added to a Congregation; for it
is not impoſſible but the Congregation may be in the right and the Claſſis in the
wrong. Now what ſhall be ſaid or done in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſe? Shall the Congregation now
have the free exerciſe of its power, or ſhall it not? To ſay yea, would ſatisfie the
minds of many, if the Congregation themſelves may be judge that they are in the
right, or if it were determined who muſt judge thereof. And to ſay no, and that the
power muſt ſtill be in this erring Claſſis, were to ſubject righteouſneſſe to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and truth to falſhood, and I conceive our Brother will not maintain ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in a compound or Presbytery or Claſſis. For in Page 335. ſpeaking of this very
caſe, and the greater Presbytery is wrong in their voicing, and the Elders of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall
Church are right, and have the beſt in judging of a caſe before them, he
plainly affirmeth, <hi>That the power which in this caſe the Presbytery exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth
is not of Chriſt, and that</hi> de jure <hi>the power of the greater Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
in this caſe ought to be ſwallowed up of the voices of the Elders of a
Congregation, though they be fewer in number.</hi> Now if this be ſo, then the
thing in queſtion is ſtill as uncertain as before, and ſtill wee are to ſeeke where the
power of cenſures or Iuriſdiction doth finally reſide. For in the one place our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tels us, Chriſt never gave power of male-adminiſtration to a Congregation, and
in the other he tels us the like of a Claſſis or great Presbytery, and that Chriſt hath
given no power to any Church to erre. By which ſayings we are left at great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty:
for ſtill the queſtion will be whether the Congregation doth erre or no, and
ſo whether the Claſſis do erre or no, and unleſſe it be determined who muſt judge of
this, we are ſtill but where wee were, and no neerer an iſſue then before.</p>
               <p>This indeed is moſt true and muſt be ſo acknowledged, that though the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
have given a power unto Societies, whether they bee families, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
or Churches, and have made ſundry of them ſubordinate to none other the
like Societies in the exerciſe of their power, but to have ſupremacy of power within
themſelves, yet he hath alſo given them juſt and holy rules in his word for the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them in the uſe of this Power, from which rules it is not lawfull for them to
ſwerve or go aſtray; but if they do, it will be ſin unto them, and he will ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it of them: But now between theſe two the power it ſelfe and the abuſe or right
uſe of the power, we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh, for though abuſe of their power bee
not given of God, from whom comes nothing but good, yet the power it ſelfe being
good is given of him, and is ſo to be acknowledged. And though abuſe of their power
do juſtly deſerve at his hands that they ſhould be deprived of the power it ſelfe, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God doth not alwayes forthwith deale with men according to their deſerts herein, but

who through their ignorance, infidelity, pride and other ſins, could not but in great

ſhall abuſe their power, it doth not follow that other families, may lawfully for this
cauſe take away their power from them: Or if a Corporation ſhall ſo offend, it will
not follow that other Corporations may deprive them of their power. And if it be
ſo in Commonwealths, and families, why may wee not ſay the ſame of Churches?
Or how will it follow, if a Church ſhall abuſe their power, that other
Churches in ſuch eaſes may take away the power from ſuch a Church?
For ought I ſee, this will not follow at all, no more then the other. For though Chriſt
have not given to any Church a power of male adminiſtration as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>
ſpeaks, yet hath he given to every Church a power of adminiſtration, which if they
manage not aright but do abuſe the ſame, the Lord Ieſus will be diſpleaſed with them
for this abuſe, and other Churches may and ought to adviſe them and admoniſh
them and teſtifie againſt them for the ſame; but for the power it ſelfe, as Chriſt
himſelfe doth not forthwith deprive them thereof, ſo much leſſe may other Churches
take it from them, for who gave them this authority? <hi>Per in parem non habet poteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:</hi>
and Churches are all of equall authority, and not one ſuperior or inferior to
another, as therefore when children or ſervants in a family are not governed as they
ought to be, yet neighbour families have not warrant becauſe of this male adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to invade the rights and deſtroy the power of ſuch a family, even ſo it is in this
caſe of Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this male-adminiſtration in a Church is not forthwith a ſufficient
warrant for neighbour Churches to invade the rights of ſuch a Church, and to take
away its power from it. Eſpecially if we do conſider that this male-adminiſtration in
a Congregation may poſſibly be but pretended and not reall, and that the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Claſſes may paradventure be really ſuch; in which caſe Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
ſaith the power of the Claſſis is not of Chriſt, but their voices ought <hi>de jure</hi> to
be ſwallowed up by the Congregation and the Elders thereof. This argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from male-adminiſtration of the power of a Congregation, which Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi>
ſaith, it is reaſon ſhould be deſtroyed by another power added to it, meaning the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a Claſſis is of no ſufficient force to take away the power of a Congregation at
all, not to eſtabliſh the power of the Claſſis over the ſame, being as juſtly applyable
againſt the Claſſis it ſelfe: Therefore for ought that doth yet appeare, ſupreame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall
Church power which I conceive muſt needs be ſomewhere, may as well be in
the Congregation as in the Claſſis, and can neither by this argument of male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
nor by any other that we have yet ſeene, bee placed in the Claſſis any more
then in the Congregation.</p>

theſe which are here ſet down for ours: neither do wee make any mention of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation

leaſt of all do we ſay (or report others to ſay) that it is lawfull for a ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to do that which is againſt all equity and the very light of Nature; none of
theſe things are ours. And therefore, that our true meaning may plainely
appeare as it is, I will tranſcribe a few of our words, which are theſe, <hi>viz.
Sure we cannot thinke that there can be ſuch a caſe imagined, wherein
you would grant it lawfull for a ſingle Congregation to do that which is
againſt all equity and the very light of Nature, and yet you grant that the
caſe may be ſuch that a ſingle Congregation may have entireneſſe of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
within it ſelfe; which ſeemes to us plainly to prove that for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
to bee ſo independent as to be the finall Judge of offences within
it ſelfe, is not againſt all equity nor againſt the light of Nature, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
by you.</hi> Theſe are our words, much differing from thoſe which Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi>
ſets down as ours, which I thought meet to relate out of the Anſwer, that our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114129:39"/>
meaning might appeare as it is, and no otherwiſe. And now let us heare what our
Brother ſubjoyneth for anſwer.</p>
               <p>None of us, ſaith he, Do teach that it is againſt the light of Nature
that the adverſe party be the Iudge: it might fall out in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
lawfully convened from which their is no Provocation: Yea and in a
Nationall Councell (for all Councels may erre) the adverſe party may
Judge; as it was a lawfull Councell according to a Church conſtitution
that condemned Chriſt of Blaſphemy and they were alſo his enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And may it not alſo fall out in a Provinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>all Synod, and in a Claſſis or
Presbtytery of many Churches? I ſuppoſe it cannot be denyed, but the Iudges in all
theſe may be the adverſe parties; and ſo if the adverſe party may not be Iudge, then
neither generall nor Nationall Councels, nor Provinciall Synods, nor Claſſes, nor
Presbyteries may be Iudges; becauſe there is none of theſe but poſſibly they may be
parties. And ſo this argument, parties may not be Iudges, doth make no more againſt
the Congregations power of judging, then againſt all Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies
whatſoever. Vnleſſe therefore men would overthrow the power of all Eccleſiaſticall
Iudicatories whatſoever without exception of any, they can have no help from this
Argument to overthrow the power of Iuriſdiction in Congregations. Not to inſiſt
upon that which might alſo be truly alledged, that the Objection hath the like
force, (if any at all) againſt civill Iudicatories.</p>
               <p>But is it ſo indeed as our Brother affirmeth, that none of them do teach that it is
againſt the light of Nature that the adverſe party be the judge? I thinke he ſhould
not thus have ſpoken, for I am much miſtaken if the contrary hereunto be not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true. For firſt of all, I alledge the words of Reverend Mr, <hi>Herle,</hi> in his
Book of Independency Page 5. alledged in the Anſwer: Page 6, the very Pag. which
here Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> is dealing againſt. In which place of Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> there are theſe
words, <hi>viz. That there ought to be graduall Judicatories, wherein the
agrieved party may appeale from the leſſer to the higher, that againſt the
very light of Nature the adverſe party be not the ſole Iudge and party too
in the cauſe, there can be no Ceremony or Type in this,</hi> Next of all I alledge
the words of the ſame Reverend Author in his Page 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (Which is alſo alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the forementioned place of the Anſwer) Where the words are theſe,
<hi>What if a Brother offend not a particular Brother, but the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?
What if ten Brethren offend the whole or part? Shall we thinke
the offence fals not within our Saviours remed or complaint or Appeale
here? That the offended party be not againſt all equity the ſole and finall
Judge of the offence.</hi> In which places wee ſee it is plaine, yet this Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
counts it againſt the very light of Nature; that the adverſe party ſhould bee
Iudge and party too in the cauſe, and that it is againſt all equity that the party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhould bee ſole and finall Iudge of the offence. And therefore it is marvellous
that Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſhould ſay that none of them do ſo teach: Yea, it is the more
marvellous inaſmuch as both theſe places of Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> are expreſly mentioned in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114129:39"/>
that very page of the Anſwer which here Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> is diſputing againſt. And
therefore it he had not remembred that himſelfe had read the ſame in Mr <hi>Herle,</hi> as
like enough he had, yet finding the ſame alledged by us in that Scripture of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, it is
marvell hee would not turne to the places alledged to ſearch and ſee whether the
thing were ſo or no, afore he had denyed the ſame. Whereas on the contrary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſearched or ſearched not, this we ſee that he roundly affirmes, that none of
them do so teach; to which ſaying I know not how to aſſent, our eyes having ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeene and read the direct contrary,</p>
               <p>Yea and further, it is yet more marvellous that Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſhould thus write,
conſidering not only what hath been already ſaid, but alſo what himſelfe hath written
elſewhere: I will mention a few of his own ſayings, and then himſelfe ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>If according to the Law of Nature and Nations, no man can be Iudge in

Congregation, when they are a party to the cauſed perſon, Naturall—but the former
is reaſon, Nature, Law of Nations.</hi> Ergo <hi>ſo is the latter.</hi> In the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

manifeſt that the thing which he ſaith none of them do teach is expreſly and plainly
taught by ſome of them, and among others even by himſelfe, who therefore ought
not to have denyed the ſame, nor can bee cleered from much forgetfulneſſe in ſo
doing.</p>
               <p>And if ſo great an overſight be found in him, I hope himſelf may thereby be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be tender of agravating matters againſt us or others, at leaſtwiſe not ſo farre to
agravate them, as to impute unto us matters which we do not hold: for a mans owne
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114129:40"/>
infirmities ſhould make him more equitable and favourable towards others. And
Chriſtian Readers may be warned hereby not haſtily to receive all that Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
hath written, afore they have duly examined and tryed the ſame, whether the
things bee ſo or not, for wee ſee through forgetfulneſſe or otherwiſe hee may greatly
miſtake himſelfe, and miſſe of the truth, and give forth ſuch ſayings and expreſſions
for truth, as are in no ſort to be maintained but recalled, though nevertheleſſe he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
a man of great worth, and ſo ever to be acknowledged.</p>
               <p>We teach that it is not Congruous to the wiſdome of Christ, nor
to the light of Nature, that Chriſt ſhould have appointed all the ordinary
Church Courts, ſo many thouſand Congregations, who may rather crie
then extraordinary and higher Synods to bee the onely ordinary Iudges in
their own cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe qualifications and limitations of the matter of parties being Iudges
are ſuch as to my remembrance I never heard given afore now. Now indeed it is ſaid
1. That all Congregations being ſo many thouſand. 2. May not be the only ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Iudges in their own cauſe, but it would bee againſt the wiſdome of Chriſt and
light of Nature if it ſhould ſo be; Yet formerly it was delivered abſolutely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that it is againſt the light of Nature for parties to be Iudges, without any ſuch
modifications and qualifications as now Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> gives to help the matter withall.
Nevertheleſſe by qualifying the thing in this ſort, it ſeemes thereby to bee ſtill grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that though ſo many thouſand Congregations may not ordinarily be Iudge in
their own cauſe, but the light of Nature will be againſt it, yet for ſome Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and at ſome times the thing may be allowed well enough: elſe why is the thing
denyed only to ſo many Congregations, and ordinarily, if it be not thereby implyed
that ſome Congregations and at ſome times may thus practiſe? Now hereupon the
queſtion groweth, whether ſome at ſome times may bee allowed to do contrary to the
light of Nature, though all may not: or whether the light of Nature bee changed
when there comes to be many Congregations, and be not the ſame that it was before,
when there was no more Congregations but one, whether I ſay ſome new light of
Nature do ariſe with the riſe of new Congregations, ſo that when they are many it
would be againſt this light for them thus to bee Iudges, though it was not ſo when
there was but one: or whether we muſt ſay the light of Nature remaining in the ſame,
one Congregation remaining alone may be allowed to do contrary thereto, but many
may not. It ſeemes to be inconvenient and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to affirme either of theſe; and yet the
one or the other ſeemes unavoidable by this that Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> here teacheth. For
let it be granted that a Congregation that is alone, yea a generall Councell, yea a
Nationall Councell alſo may be Iudges in their own cauſe, and that no light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is againſt the ſame, and yet many Congregations may not be ſo, but then the
light of Nature will be againſt it, let theſe things I ſay be granted, which are all of
them granted and taught by Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and then I deſire to know how the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
mentioned can be avoided; I meane how it can be avoided, but either
ſome men or Church Aſſemblies may lawfully do that which is againſt the very light
of Nature, or elſe that the light of Nature is changed when many Congregations do
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114129:40"/>
ariſe, from that which it was when there was but one. Yea the difficulty and intrica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
in this way is yet more, if it be well conſidered. For firſt of all when a Congregation
is alone, it is yeelded that it is not againſt Natures light for them to bee Iudges in
their own cauſe. Secondly, when many Congregations do ariſe, now it is ſaid it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch light, that they ſhould ſo be Iudges: Yet thirdly, when theſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do gather into a Nationall Councell, then this light of Nature will allow
them to be Iudges, as in the firſt caſe of a ſingle Congregation that is alone: And
the ſame is alſo ſaid of the generall Councell: ſo that here is ſtrange varying and
changing of the light of Nature, and of that which is againſt it, lawfull or unlawfull
thereby. And when good reaſon and ground is given for the cleering of theſe things,
we ſhall then conſider further thereof, and ſee more then yet we do. In the meane
time taking what is granted, that no light of Nature forbids a Congregation when it
is alone, to have entireneſſe of Iuriſdiction within it ſelfe, nor forbids the ſame to
the generall or Nationall Councels, I thinke it may thence be inferred, that the like
muſt be allowed to Congregationall Churches that have neighbours, and that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireneſſe
of Iuriſdiction in theſe is no more againſt the light of Nature, then in the
other. For to ſay that one Congregation may have this entireneſſe of Iuriſdiction and

yea to ſay firſt the light of Nature allowes it, and then it forbids it, and then it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

ſuch as made many Congregations and yet all but one Church (which he never ſaid
but the contrary) there is no help to be had from Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> in this buſineſſe. For
who knoweth not that there might be a numerous multitude, and yet but one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?
Sure in Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> his judgement it might be ſo, and therefore though hee
grant a numerous multitude in this Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
for many Congregations in <hi>Theſſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nica</hi> and yet all but one Church, is not gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
nor at all holpen thereby.</p>
               <p>Which will better appeare if Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> his Argumentation in the place which I
conceive Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> aymes at, be conſidered in Page 3. of his <hi>Dioceſans Tryall,</hi>
he propounds an Argument of theirs who would have many Congregations to be one
Church, taken from the example of the ancient Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
laid down in theſe words: <hi>If the multitude of Chriſtians did in</hi> Ieruſalem
<hi>ſo increaſe within a little time, that they exceeded the proportion of one
Congregation, how much more likely is it that Chriſtians in</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi>
Alexandria <hi>did ſo increaſe in 200 yeares, that they could not keepe in
one particular Aſſembly: But the firſt is true,</hi> Ergo <hi>alſo the latter.</hi>
Now when he cames to anſwer this Argument, Pag. 18, 19. What doth he then ſay.
<hi>Firſt of all he ſaith, The Propoſition is not of neceſſary conſequence, for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114129:41"/>
there were ſaith he very extraordinary reaſons of that which was effected
in</hi> Ieruſalem: And ſo he proceeds to mention 5, or 6. reaſons in particular, of
which one is this which it may be Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath an eye unto, that the ſtate of
this Church was ſuch as that it was to ſend out light to all others, a common aurſery
to the World. And therefore if the thing were granted that in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there was a
numerous multitude, yea ſuch a multitude as could not be contained in one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
yet ſaith he, <hi>It doth not follow from this particular to the ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
of theſe Churches, to wit, of</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Alexandria <hi>in tract of time.</hi>
And even ſo may I ſay, it doth not follow to the ſo great increaſing of the Church of
the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> there being ſuch extraordinary reaſons for that which was effected
in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as neither <hi>Rome</hi> nor <hi>Alexandria,</hi> nor yet <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> could alledge the
ſame. And this is his Anſwer to the Propoſition. But for the Aſſumption, where Mr.
<hi>Rutherford</hi> his help muſt chiefly lye, to wit, that the multitude of Chriſtians in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
did exceed the proportion of one Congregation, this Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> doth expreſly
deny: not to mention, ſaith he, <hi>That we do deny the Aſſumption.</hi> Therefore,
the Propoſition being by Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> not yeelded, and the Aſſumption expreſly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I ſee not how Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> can have any help to his cauſe from either of
both.</p>
               <p>He denyes not, he ſaith, What M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tompſon</hi> and I do ſay, that 5000
may meet to hear the word, many thouſands were gathered together, <hi>Luke</hi>
12 to heare Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be not denyed, then ſuppoſe there were 5000 or more in the Church
at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it doth not follow therefore that that Church was many Congregations,
and ſo our purpoſe is gained.</p>
               <p>But we, he ſaith, Leave out the inconveniences of thronging ſo all at
once, for they trod one upon another. Second, Chriſt Preached not to all
thoſe thouſands at once, for it is expreſly ſaid verſe 1. Hee began to ſay
to his Diſciples; ſo, Chriſt refuſing to Preach to ſuch a diſorderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of people, who could not heare, and his Doctrine being all for his
Diſciples, the very Sermon being Preached to his Diſciples onely—evidenceth
to me that Chriſt condemneth a numerous multitude to heare
at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Queſtion is not about the conveniency or inconveniency of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
great Aſſemblies; but whether there be an impoſſibility in Nature, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that ſo many as are ſaid to bee in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhould aſſemble and
come together in one Congregation; for this is ſometimes ſaid for the proving of
ſundry Congregations in that one Church. Now if this be not impoſſible, then the
plurality of Congregations in that one Church cannot bee concluded by thoſe great
multitudes that were therein. And that it is not impoſſible for ſuch great multitudes
to come together in one Congregation, the Scripture alledged <hi>Luke</hi> 12, doth witneſſe.
If they trod one upon another, that might argue the Aſſembly was very great, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114129:42"/>
that they were very deſirous to bee neere unto our Saviour for their better hearing,
but doth not at all prove that ſuch multitudes are ſo great as that they cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be ſpoke unto and heare in one Congregation. <hi>And therefore, whereas our
Brother ſaith, Chriſt preached not to all thoſe thouſands at once, and
that he refuſed to Preach to ſuch a diſorderly confluence of People,</hi>
With favour of ſo worthy a man, I thinke the truth is otherwiſe. For though he began
to ſpeak to his Diſciples, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. And exhorted them againſt worldly carefulneſſe,
<hi>verſe</hi> 22. Yet others who were not Diſciples were preſent, and did alſo heare his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
Witneſſe that in <hi>verſe</hi> 13. Where it is ſaid that one of the company (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
our Saviour as it ſeemes) demands of him that hee would ſpeake to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about dividing the Inheritance; to whom our Saviour makes anſwer, <hi>verſe</hi> 14.

22.</hi> But were ſome other people beſides. And what can be more plaine then that in
verſe 54. where it is expreſly ſaid, that Chriſt ſpake unto the people, rebuking them
for their hypocriſie, that could diſcerne the face of the Skye, and of the Earth, but
could not diſcerne that time? And he ſaid alſo to the people, ſaith the Text; doth
it not plainly appeare hereby that as Myriads of people were gathered together, <hi>ver.</hi> 1
So our Saviour ſpake the word unto thoſe people? I ſuppoſe the thing is manifeſt,
and that therefore our Brothers words cannot ſtand, when he ſaith, <hi>That Christ
Preached not to that confluence of people, but refuſed ſo to do, his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
being all for his Diſciples,</hi> For we ſee the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth that

the number ſuch as by no meanes could meete together in the publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, ſeeing it is apparent,</hi> Luke 12. 1. <hi>that the people which aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
unto Chriſt and partake his 'Doctrine were alſo many Myriads: and

he ſpake to all the people aſſembled,</hi> ver. 13. 15. 54. Reply <hi>P. 2. P.</hi> 90.
Wherefore though our Brother ſay Chriſt ſpake not to theſe multitudes of people but
to his Diſciples onely, yet ſith wee have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Divines of chiefe note, expreſly witneſſing the contrary, therefore we cannot aſſent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114129:42"/>
to him herein. <hi>Whereas</hi> Chryſoſtome <hi>ſaith 5000 did heare his voyce at
once in one Congregation by meanes of Scaffolds and Galleries, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi>
Mather <hi>is willing to yeeld 8120 were all aſſembled in one place to heare
the word, and that all the multitude of Converts at</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in</hi> Solomons <hi>Porch</hi> Acts 5 12. <hi>I grant 3000 could heare at once, but

<hi>Baynes</hi> his teſtimony by whom <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is alledged <hi>Dioceſans Triall,</hi> Page 16.
Then a muſt be granted that not only 3000, but a greater number, even 50<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0 at leaſt
may heare the word at once. And if ſo, then 5000 members in the Church at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
will not prove plurality of Congregations in one Church, foraſmuch as here
are 5000 people and yet no more Congregations but one.</p>
               <p>But alas this is a great uncertainty for independant Congregations, but
this is to be proved, firſt that 8000 (Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> hath not added many
other multitudes <hi>mentioned, Acts</hi> 5. 14. &amp; 6. 17.) did meete dayly in the
Temple. Second, dayly or ordinarily from houſe to houſe. Third, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Lords Supper dayly in the Temple and in every private houſe,
and there were need of many Scaffolds and Galleries, to ſit at one Table.
Fourth, to make one Judicature, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that ſhall look upon the Anſwer Page 34 will plainely ſee that I have
here ſpoken to both thoſe places of <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 14. &amp; 6 1. Shewing that neither of them
do prove a plurality of Congregations in this Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but rather the
contrary. And therefore this Parentheſis which doth intimate that I have omitted to
ſpeake to theſe places, muſt not be aſſented to, but denyed.</p>
               <p>But why muſt theſe foure particulars be proved? I ſuppoſe he meanes becauſe of
that which is ſaid <hi>Act. 2 46. They continued dayly with one accord in the Temple,
&amp;c.</hi> But this doth not cleere it, that theſe foure particulars muſt needs be proved, and
the reaſon is; Firſt, becauſe Iudicature which is one of the particulars, is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at all in that Scripture; nor is it ſaid by us, that a dayly exerciſe thereof is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in every Church or in any. Second, the Lord Supper, which is another of the
particulars, is not mentioned at all in that Text, at leaſtwiſe not in thoſe words or
termes which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſets down; much leſſe is it ſaid as he expreſſeth it, that
they did dayly celebrate the ſame both in the Temple and in every private houſe:
nor can the ſame for ought I know be proved by this or by any other Scripture, nor
was ſuch a thing ever affirmed by us, ſo farre as I know. I ſuppoſe if they had cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
it in the Temple alone, or in ſome private houſe or houſes alone, that might
have been ſufficient, without any neceſſity of celebrating the ſame in both places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one day, both in the Temple and in the houſes too. Nay it is a queſtion whether
the Lords Supper bee at all intended in this place; though I doubt not but they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that Ordinance, and verſe 42. may poſſibly teach ſo much. But for the verſe
we are ſpeaking of, <hi>viz,</hi> Verſe 46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no neceſſity that the breaking of Bread
there ſpoken of, muſt needs be meant of that Ordinance. Sure he was a judicious
expoſitor who underſtands it otherwiſe, <hi>Quod hic fractionem panis &amp;c.</hi> That is,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114129:43"/>
whereas ſome expound breaking of Bread in this place of the Lords Supper, it ſeems
to me to be farre from <hi>Lukes</hi> intention: <hi>Calvin</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. So then, of Mr <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therfords</hi>
foure particulars which he ſaith we muſt prove, there is not paſt the halfe
of them that needs to be proved at all, the two laſt being already removed. And for a
third which is of breaking of Bread dayly and ordinarily from houſe to houſe, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this breaking of Bread as <hi>Calvin</hi> doth, of their civill repaſt, and then it hurts
not our cauſe at all, though it be yeelded that they did dayly meet for ſuch purpoſe in
ſeverall companies, in their private houſes; for this they might do and bee no more
but one Congregation. There remaines therefore onely one that needs to be proved,
namely the firſt, that they did dayly meete in the Temple; and this may bee proved
with caſe, becauſe the plain words of the Text do affirme it, <hi>They continued dayly with
one accord in the Temple;</hi> ſo that yet we have found nothing that proves <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to
be many Congregations in one Church.</p>
               <p>Nay I conceive, that one of theſe foure particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt, of their dayly
meeting in the Temple, doth apparently ſhew that how great ſoever the number was,
yet it was not exceeding the proportion of one Congregation, which might come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one place; For the Temple was but one in all the City, I meane there was
but onely one individuall Temple, and not many Temples, which if there had been
then our Brethren might poſſibly have ſaid, that they met diſtributively in ſundry
leſſer companies, but were to many too meete all in one Congregation; for ſo they
were wont to expound ſundry other phraſes uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, to declare their
comming together. True ſay they, they come together, but how? Not collectively
all of them together in one place, they were too many for that; but they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſtributively, ſome of them in one place, and ſome in another, and ſo they think
they have anſwered ſufficiently. But now to this of their meeting together in the
Temple, they cannot anſwer ſo; for then there ſhould have been ſundry Temples, in
which they might have met, diſtributed into ſundry companies; but there being no
more Temples but one, and the Text affirming plainly that they all met with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
in the Temple, it muſt needs be, that they met collectively, all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one and the ſame place; and hence it followeth, that they were not ſo many
but ſtill they might be one Congregation as well as one Church.</p>
               <p>So that of the foure particulars, which he ſaith we muſt prove, ſome wee ſee need
not to be proved at all, and the firſt of them which we can prove with caſe doth make
much for the weakning of his cauſe, and for the ſtrengthening of ours.</p>
               <p>Yea Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> will have the whole containing as one independant
Congregation, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. And the many Myriads or thouſands
of beleeving Jewes, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 21, 22, 23. To meete as one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When in the Anſwer I ſpeake of theſe places, the word Independant was
not there uſed by me at all, but only is here added by himſelfe, for what cauſe himſelfe
can beſt tell. But for the matter, I conceive the thing which I there delivered is cleere
from the Texts themſelves, that the multitude of thoſe Iewes did aſſemble and come
together, in one place; for as for one of the places <hi>Act.</hi> 6. It is expreſly there ſaid
that the Apoſtles called the multitude together to propoſe unto them the choice of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114129:43"/>
Deacons, <hi>verſe 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and bad them look out from amongſt themſelves ſeaven Men, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifyed
as the Apoſtles do there deſcribe, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. whereupon it is ſaid that the ſaying
pleaſed the whole multitude and they choſe ſeaven who are there named <hi>verſe</hi> 5. and
preſented them unto the Apoſtles that they might lay their hands on them, <hi>verſe</hi> 6.
Which plainely ſhewes that the whoſe multitude how many ſoever they were, yet
were not ſo many, but they might all aſſemble in one place, to heare matters propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to them, to conſider thereof, and upon liking to put them in execution, as in other
things ſo in this particular, of making election of Officers, as there they are Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to have done. And as for the other place <hi>Act.</hi> 21. though it be a Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thoſe many thouſand Iewes, that beleeved were all members, of that one Church
at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet it cannot be any queſtion, whether they might come together in one
place, ſith <hi>Iames</hi> and the Elders do expreſly there ſay unto <hi>Paul,</hi> the multitude muſt
needs come together, for they will heare that thou art come. Nor can we ſay they
might come together onely diſtributively, in ſundry companies, but not all in
one place, for the end of their comming together will not beare that expoſition, which
end was, that they might ſee, and heare <hi>Paul,</hi> and try what ſatisfaction he would give
them, in the matter whereof they were informed of him, that he taught the Iewes, to
forſake <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to omit Circumciſion and other Iewiſh cuſtomes. Theſe things
they were informed to have been taught by him amongſt the Gentiles, and hearing
that he was come to the City, they muſt needs come together to heare what he would
ſay to the matter, and how hee would cleere himſelfe. Now if this was the end of
their comming together it muſt needs be that their comming was altogether unto one
place, and not in ſeverall companies; for this could not anſwer their end, inaſmuch
as <hi>Paul</hi> being but one perſon, it was not poſſible they could ſee him, nor heare him
in ſundry places at once; and therefore they might as well have ſtaid at home, and
not have come together at all, as come together in ſuch ſort.</p>
               <p>Plaine it is therefore, that the multitude ſpoken of in theſe two Scripures were not
ſo many but they might meete in one Congregation.</p>
               <p>Which point as ſomething hath been ſaid in the Anſwer P. 34, 35. For the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of it, ſo I am the more confirmed in it by Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his dealing concerning
theſe Scriptures. For though he make mention of them in this place, as we ſee, and
of that apprehenſion of mine concerning thoſe Scriptures, yet he doth not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the grounds, which were given for that apprehenſion in the Anſwer, but doth
wholly paſſe them by in ſilence. Now taking occaſion to ſpeak of the Scriptures, and
relating what my apprehenſion was concerning the ſame, and yet ſaying nothing at
all to the gronnds, whereon that apprehenſion was built, it ſeemes hereby to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
that indeed he had nothing in readineſſe to object againſt the ſame. So that I
may ſtill conceive of thoſe Scriptures as I did before, for any thing yet brought to
induce me to be of another mind.</p>
               <p>As for that which next followes, certainly the Apoſtles practice must
be our rule, and then 500 or 1000 being ſo farre beneath 10 or 8000, may
well ſeeme a number for fewneſſe not competent, and what ſhall wee then
thinke of 7 only, or 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, that the Apoſtles practiſe doth not at all condemn ours,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114129:44"/>
though our Congregations have not in them the like numbers, but ſometimes more
and ſometimes leſſe; for was it not ſo in that Primative Apoſtolike Church? Is it not
plain, that that Church was for number farre leſſer at the firſt, then afterward, when
they grew to 4000 or more; and yet after this they grew to be fewer againe, when
Perſecution ſcattered them all abroad except the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 1. And therefore
if 10 or 8000, being once the number in that Church, be a rule condemning out
Churches, as being for fewneſſe not competent, when they are beneath that number,
how will it be avoided but by the ſame reaſon the practiſe of that Church at one time,
ſhall be a rule, for the condemning of it ſelf at another time? For ſure it is, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was not at all times alike, but ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſſe; as in the
Sea it is not alwayes full tyde, but ſometimes low ebbe, nor is the Moone alwayes at
full, but ſometimes at the Change; Nay if the Apoſtles practiſe muſt be our rule,
then inaſmuch as their Churches, had not alwayes the like numbers of members in
them, but ſometimes the number was greater, and ſometimes leſſer, it will follow
therefore that the number of members in our Churches needs not alwayes to bee the
ſame, but though greater numbers be lawfull, yet the lawfulneſſe of leſſer numbers
may not be denyed.</p>

prove, that <hi>Corinth</hi> had their meetings and not by

in one Congregation: and it is plaine, that though they had vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety

The place ſaith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. If the whole Church come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
&amp;c. Deth evince the contrary. For the Apoſtle doth there reaſon
<hi>ab abſurdo,</hi> from a great incongruity: it were incongruous ſaith he, and
ridiculous that the whole Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and all their guifted men
ſpeaking with Tongues (ſo that they could not be underſtood by Infidels)
ſhould all Convene in one place, and ſpeake with divers Tongues: For
the unlearned and unbeleevers would ſay they were madde; therefore hee
preſuppoſeth that the whole Church ſhould not all come to one place, but that
they ſhould ſo come to one place, in divers Aſſemblies.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And is it true indeed, that this place doth evince the contrary? <hi>viz.</hi> That
the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> did not all meet in one Congregation: How ſhall we be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that ſuch a thing is evinced by the place? For as for the reaſon given, &amp;c. That
the Apoſtle d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th there reaſon <hi>ab abſurdo,</hi> or from great incongruity, this doth not
prove the thing at all, partly becauſe they might practiſe ſomething that were not
meete but had incongruity in it, and partly (and more eſpecially) becauſe the Apoſtle
doth not lay the abſurdity where Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> layes it, <hi>viz.</hi> In the convening of
the whole Church in one place, but in their ſpeaking with ſtrange Tongues when
they were convened and come together.</p>
               <p>Touching the former of theſe, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> reaſoneth to this effect. If it were
an incongruous or un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it thing that the whole Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> ſhould come together
in one place, then they did not ſo come together: but the firſt is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the ſecond
is true alſo. In which kind of reaſoning (ſuch is our weakneſſe) we thinke neither
part of the argument to be free from juſt exception. For as we wholly deny the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
ſo we alſo thinke there is no ſufficient ſtrength of conſequence in the maine
Propoſition, foraſmuch as ſundry things were practiſed in that Church which were
no wayes fit not meet to be practiſed, and which the Apoſtle doth therefore reprove,
and ſeekes the redreſſe of the ſame: witneſſe their Factions and diviſions: <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.
&amp; 3. Their neglecting Church cenſures againſt the inceſtuous perſon, and on the
contrary being puffed up, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. their going to Law one with another before the
Infidels, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. their abuſes in Prayer and Propheſying, their women uncovered
and their men covered, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. their abuſes in the Lords Supper, when they ſo
came unto it that one was hungry and another drunken, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. Now as it were
an unſufficient kind of arguing to ſay, theſe things were unfit and unmeet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Church did not ſo practiſe, even ſo Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his arguing ſeemes
to be no better, who would prove they did come together in one place, becauſe the
Apoſtle, as he thinks, did count ſuch comming together unmeet. For if it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that ſuch a comming had been unmeet, yet it doth not follow, but ſuch might bee
their practiſe notwithſtanding: and therefore as hee counts our apprehenſion in this
matter to be weak, ſo I leave it to himſelf and others to conſider, whether in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
It was not meet they ſhould all come together in one place, <hi>Ergo</hi> they did
it not, be very ſtrong.</p>
               <p>I deſire here not to be miſtaken: for I do not grant that their comming together
in one place was unmeet, nor that the Apoſtle doth reprove them for the ſame; I have
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114129:45"/>
already ſaid the contrary, in denying the Aſſumption afore mentioned, which I do
ſtill deny. But the thing I intend, is to conſider the ſtrength of Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his
reaſoning, and for that cauſe to apply it to the thing in queſtion, which I ſtill deſire
to keepe cloſe unto, if it may be. Now the thing in queſtion, being this, whether the
Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> were ſo many at that they could nor meet together in one Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
but had many Congregations, and all but one Church, and Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi>
maintaining the affirmative, and bringing this reaſon for it, taken from the Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of meeting all together, I therefore thought meet, to weigh the ſtrength of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which I do not perceive to be in any wiſe convincing: but ſuppoſing the Apoſtle
had counted ſuch meetings, inconvenient and unmeet, yet this reaſon as I conceive,
is too weak to prove Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his purpoſe, that their number was ſuch as that
they could not all poſſibly meet in one place; for they might poſſibly do that which
were unmeet to be done, in this particular as well as they did in many other things.</p>
               <p>But in this particular I do not thinke, they did any thing abſurd, or unmeet at all;
and therefore for further anſwer to this reaſon I would ſay: that the Apoſtle
doth not ſay the abſurdity, where Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> layes it, to wit, in that the whole
Church did convene, and come together, but in ſpeaking with ſtrange Tongues when
they were convened, this latter being incongruous: and abſurd indeed; for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
comming into the Church Aſſembly, and hearing them ſo ſpeake, might thinke
them madde, as the Apoſtle ſayes; but for aſſembling all in one place, I know no
madneſſe that was in that; nor ſhew thereof; nor do I yet beleeve that the Apoſtle
doth place the abſurdity there. For though Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> bee a worthy man and
learned, yet ſuch a thing as this had need of ſome further proofe then his bare word.
If a Church ſhould meet diſtributively in divers Aſſemblies, and being ſo met ſhould
ſpeake with ſtrange Tongues, I demand whether this manner of ſpeaking, do prove
ſuch a way of meeting abſurd; I ſuppoſe he will ſay no, becauſe it is the way of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
which he holds the Apoſtolike Churches did uſe; And if ſo, then ſuppoſe they
ſhould ſo ſpeake with ſtrange Tongues, when they meet collectively all in one Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
how can this manner of ſpeaking conclude the abſurdity of ſuch kind of
meeting any more then it did in the other? For my part, though ſuch kind of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
have incongruity and inconveniency in it, yet I conceive aſſembling collectively
and in one Congregation is no more prejudiced thereby, then aſſembling diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
in many.</p>
               <p>Hee (that is the Apoſtle) preſuppoſeth that the whole Church ſhould
come to one place, in divers Aſſemblies, and all Prophecy in a Tongue
known to the Infidels, as the unbeleever being convinced and judged of all
the Prophets might fall down in his face, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Prophets were met in divers Aſſemblies at once, I marvell how the
unbeleever ſhould be convinced and judged of them all; for I hope one ſingular and
individuall unbeleever was not preſent in divers Aſſemblies at once, nor convinced
and judged (as here he is ſaid to be) by thoſe Prophets, from whoſe Aſſembly he was

                  </gap> therefore the Prophets were all met in one Aſſembly and not in divers,
or elſe it is yet a Quaere how he could be convinced by them all. For ſure the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever

that beleeved, that did ordinarily meet in one place, the Text ſaith
no ſuch thing, and that is to be proved and not taken as granted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe it were true, that the whole Church was not the whole much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Corinth</hi> that beleeved, this doth nothing prejudice our cauſe, for as much as our
Queſtion is not about the whole much people that beleeved, but about the whole
Church. If therefore it be granted that the whole Church collectively did come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one place, we have what we deſire, and require no more. As for the whole
much people that beleeved, whether this be the ſame with the former or no, wee ſhall
have no need to prove or take for granted that theſe did in like manner come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for as much as our queſtion in the termes of it is not about theſe, but about the
other.</p>
               <p>But why is not the whole Church the whole much people that beleeved? Shall
we ſay the whole Church is more then the people that beleeved? Or ſhall wee ſay
it is not ſo much? I conceive it muſt be one of theſe, or elſe it muſt be the ſame. If
it be ſaid it is more, then ſtill we have our deſire, if not more then we demand. For
if a company that is greater then all the much people that beleeved, were neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
not ſo great, but they might and did aſſemble in one Congregation, then that
much people that beleeved might ſo aſſemble much more. For if there be no impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
but a company that is greater may ſo aſſemble, I ſuppoſe the ſame cannot bee
denyed of a company that is leſſer. Againe, to ſay this whole Church was a greater
number then the much people that beleeved, is directly to gainſay himſelfe, who in
Page 460, 461. <hi>Makes the much people a greater number then the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
meeting for the Word, Sacraments, and Church cenſures; becauſe
ſuch a Congregation, he ſaith, could not conveniently exceed one thouſand,
whereas the much people muſt bee much in compariſon of thouſands of
Jewes who rejected Christ, for that otherwiſe it would not have beene
much for</hi> Pauls <hi>comfort, for which end it is mentioned and brought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be ſaid the whole Church be leſſe then the people that beleeved, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that ſome of thoſe beleevers were not of the Church, and ſo what himſelfe
hath written, Page 125. 242. 251. will not ſtand. For in Page 125, hee ſaith,</hi>
That the Seale of Baptiſme and the profeſſion of the truth is that which
makes one member of the viſible Church—and by this are all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and domeſticks in-Churched, and received into a viſible Church.
And Page 242. He ſaith any who blameleſſely profeſſe Chriſt is Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtically
—<hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> a true and valid member of the Church
viſible, having Eccleſiaſticall power valid for that effect, and Page 251.
he ſaith, a viſible profeſſion of the truth and Doctrine of golineſſe is that
which eſſentially conſtituteth a viſible Church and every member of the
viſible Church. <hi>Now if theſe things be ſo, then it followes that this whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114129:46"/>
that beleeved were all of them members of the Church, inaſmuch as they were all
partakers of Baptiſme and profeſſion, which he ſaith do eſſentially conſtitute the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church and every member thereof. And they were all members of the Church,
then the Church was not a leſſer company then they.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can hee ſay it was a greater company, for the reaſons mentioned
before.</p>
               <p>And if it was neither a greater company nor a leſſer, was it not then the ſame.
And if it was the ſame, then how can this ſtand which he affirmeth in the place wee
have in hand, where hee ſaith the whole Church is not the whole much people that
beleeved? It ſeemes to me, that which way ſoever he ſhall take, his own pen will be
witneſſe againſt himſelfe; for in the place wee have in hand, hee ſaith the whole
Church is not the whole much people that beleeved: and in another place hee tels
us, that the much people that beleeved was a greater number then the whole
Church meeting for Word, Sacraments, &amp;c. And yet in a third place hee tels us,
that in effect it was not greater, inaſmuch as all Baptized profeſſing beleevers, hee
ſaith, are of the Church.</p>
               <p>Further, when the Text ſpeakes of the whole Church comming together in ſome
place, let the wiſe judge whether it be a good Expoſition to ſay, by the whole is not
meant the whole, but only a part. Which I conceive is Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who will not yeeld that the whole did come together in any one place, but part
in one place, and part in another, the whole being diſtributed into ſeverall parts,
and thoſe parts into ſeverall places. So that the whole Church comming together
into ſome place, muſt have this meaning, the whole came not together in any place,
but part in one place and part in another, which I feare is too much violence offered
to the Sacred Text, which ſhould be handled with reverence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he brings a reaſon for this Expoſition, and that is this,</hi> Becauſe elſe we
muſt ſay that at any one Aſſembly all the Prophets and teachers did Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy
at <hi>Corinth;</hi> for the Text ſaith, he is convinced of all, he is judged
of all, whereas the conſequence ſhould bee abſurd, it ſhould bee a longſome
and weariſome meeting, Page 465.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And if they Propheſyed not all in one Aſſem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly but divers, how could the
unbeleever bee convinced and judged by them all? It will not bee eaſie to conceive
how it could be, they Propheſying in ſuch a way: for the unbeleever ſure could not
be preſent in ſundry Aſſemblyes at once, but in one onely. And therefore, thoſe
words, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all, will lay as much abſurdity upon his
Expoſition of the words as upon ours, or rather a great deale more. For as for ours,
there is no abſurdity therein at all, for aſmuch as by all the Prophets is meant all
that Propheſied at the time, when the unbeleever was preſent, and not that all muſt
Propheſy upon one day as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> would have it. But the Text doth not ſo
ſay, nor any Interpreter that I have met withall. Sure I am <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, the expreſſe
contrary, for upon <hi>verſe 31. Ye may all Propheſy one by one, &amp;c.</hi> He hath this note,
<hi>Non eodem ſane die, ſed ternis &amp;c.</hi> That is indeed not all upon one day (which is
Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> Expoſition) but three at every moeing, having their turne to ſpeak
till all had ſpoken by courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:114129:46"/>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let thoſe Interpreters be named; and there words ſet down, and then by

in the meane time to ſay that interpreters ſay it, and yet neither to tell us the reaſons
nor the words of thoſe Interpreters, nor ſo much as the names of any of them, how
ſhould this prevaile with us to turne us away from our former apprehenſions in the
point?</p>
               <p>True it is in another place, &amp;c. Pag 461. Speaking of verſe 31. Yea
may all Propheſy one by one, hee there tels us that <hi>Diodatus</hi> underſtands
it that they might Prophecy, by courſe and in divers or ſundry Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
And <hi>Eſſius,</hi> ſaith he, ſaith the ſame, to wit, that theſe Prophets
were to Propheſy in divers Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For <hi>Diodatus</hi> I have him not at hand, and therefore I cannot peruſe the
place; But for <hi>Eſtius,</hi> this I may ſay, that he neither ſaith what here is reported in
his Commentary upon the verſe alledged, nor upon any verſe elſe in all the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as farre as I can obſerve, and I have read and peruſed him on purpoſe to ſee
what were to be found in him: But though I cannot find him affirming that which
Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> brings him for, yet I find ſundry places, wherein he ſeemes to me to
affirme the contrary; for inſtance, Commenting upon the verſe alledged, hee hath
theſe words as the ſence which he moſt preferres, <hi>viz. Quod ſi non unus tantum
Propheta ſed plures &amp;c. That is, If not only one Prophet but ſundry, yea
all do ſpeake in the Aſſembly in order, it will come to paſſe that thoſe all
may alſo learne, and receive exhortation, there being never a one of them,
who is not alſo a hearer.</hi> Wherein we ſee he ſpeaks not one word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying
in divers Aſſemblies at the ſame time, but that they were ſo to Propheſy that
all of them were to be hearers, and learners, as well as ſpeakers. Which doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imply, that there muſt be many Prophets in one Aſſembly at once. Againe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
verſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9, he hath theſe words as the ſenſe of the place, <hi>Quamvis forte multi
ſuit in Eccleſiae—veſtra Prophetae &amp;c. That is, Although perhaps
there be many Prophets in your Church, yet it will be ſufficient if two or
three do ſpeake at one meeting, and for others it ſhall be their duty to
judge, that is to ſay, to examine and try whether theſe things be true
and ſound which are ſpoken by them that ſpeake.</hi> Wherein he plainly ſhewes
his judgement to be that at one meeting they were to have many Prophets preſent, of
whom two or three onely were to ſpeake, and the reſt to try and examine what
was ſpoken. And to the ſame purpoſe he ſpeakes upon <hi>verſe</hi> 32. Which he counts to
be the ſame with that of judging, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. Further theſe words <hi>verſe</hi> 23. Of the
whole Church comming together into one place, he expounds thus, <hi>Alicujus loci to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
populus fidelis,</hi> That is, all the faithfull or beleeving people of a place; which is
contrary to Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> who will not have the whole Church, to be the whole
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114129:47"/>
much people that beleeved. Finally, ſpeaking of thoſe words <hi>verſe</hi> 24. if all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
he hath theſe words, <hi>Nec omnes inteligit abſoluté, &amp;c. That is, the
Apoſtle underſtands not all abſolutely but to this ſenſe, to wit, if all that
ſpeake in the Aſſembly of the Church do Propheſy, that is, if Prophets on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do ſpeake, and they that have the gift of Tongues do hold their peace.</hi>
Which is contrary to Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> who underſtands the Text ſo, that they were
all to Propheſie at one time; and becauſe at one meeting there were but two or
three to Propheſie, which two or three hee thinkes could not be all, hee will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have it that they were diſtributed into ſeverall Aſſemblies, and ſo did Propheſie
all at once, though onely two or three at one meeting. For which interpretation,
though he alledgeth <hi>Eſtius,</hi> yet <hi>Eſtius</hi> wee ſee affords him no help at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I have marvelled why <hi>Eſtius</hi> ſhould be alledged, ſometimes thinking with my
ſelfe whether his name might not bee miſ-Printed by the Printer, inſtead of ſome
other man; ſometimes thinking whether Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his memory might not
faile him in this particular, having read the thing in ſome other Author, and
ſuppoſing it had been in <hi>Eſtius.</hi> But what ever might be the reaſon of this miſtake,
he that ſhall examine <hi>Eſtius</hi> will not find in him any help at all for Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi>
cauſe in this particular, but the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Text ſaith expreſly, verſe 29, that at one time they Propheſied but
two or three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is a miſtake alſo: for the words are, let the Prophets ſpeake two
or three, and let the other judge. Now let them do ſo, doth not ſhew their practiſe,
but their duty: not what they did, but what they ſhould have done. The Text ſaith,
if there be no interpreter let him that hath an unknown Tongue keepe ſilence in the
Church, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. And let your Women keepe ſilence in the Churches, <hi>verſe</hi> 34.
Now ſhall any man ſay, that theſe Texts do expreſly prove that it was the manner
of their Women and of their men that had unknown Tongues to keepe ſilence. I
ſuppoſe no man can ſay it, the words being not a report of what their practiſe was,
but a rule of direction to ſhew them how they ought to practiſe. And ſo wee ſay of
the caſe in hand. But let it be ſuppoſed that it was not onely their duty, but alſo
their practiſe to Propheſie at one meeting but onely two or three, what can Maſter
<hi>Rutherford</hi> gaine heereby? His words following do tell us, where hee ſaith,
<hi>If two onely Propheſyed at one Aſſembly, as this Text will warrant
cleerely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo, the Text allowes three, which is more then two onely. But go on,
and let us heare the conſequence.</p>
               <p>Then how doth this whole Church conſiſting of all the beleevers at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
as is ſuppoſed by our Brethren, convince the Infidell, ſo as it may
beare this ſence, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Can two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
be all Prophets?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though wee ſuppoſe the whole Church conſiſted of all the Beleevers at
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114129:47"/>
                  <hi>Corinth,</hi> yet that the whole Church did convince the the Infidell, this wee never
ſaid nor ſuppoſed at all: For wee ſuppoſed and ſo do ſtill, that hee was to bee
convinced onely by the Prophets, beſides whom there were many others that were of
the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But for his demand, Whether two Prophets can bee all Prophets,</hi>
The anſwer is, that though two bee not all where there are more then two, yet if
there bee no more, there it is otherwiſe; and ſo where there are but two or three
that doe Propheſie at one meeting, there hee that is convinced by thoſe two or
three, may bee ſaid to bee convinced of all, that is of all that doe Propheſie.
This ſence of the place muſt needs bee received, elſe how ſhall the Apoſtles
words bee reconciled and ſtand together? For as in one verſe hee requireth,
that the Prophets ſpeake two or three at one meeting, and the reſt to Iudge,
<hi>verſe</hi> 29. And in another verſe affirmeth that the Infidell in the caſe there
propoſed, is judged of all, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. So hee doth not onely ſuppoſe in the
very ſame verſe, that they did all Propheſie, if all, Propheſie ſaith hee, and
there come in one that beleeveth not, &amp;c. But moreover in <hi>verſe</hi> 31. Hee
expreſly and plainely allowes them thus to Propheſie; Yee may all Propheſie,
ſaith hee, one by one, that all may learne and all may bee comforted. Which
places compared doe evince the ſence of the words heere given, and doe plainely
ſhew that what hee ſaith <hi>verſe</hi> 24. Of the Infidell being convinced of all and judged
of all, may bee truely made good, if hee bee convinced of all and Iudged of all
that Propheſyed at that meeting, though their number that ſo Propheſyed were no
more but two or three.</p>
               <p>And therefore whereas hee concludes, <hi>Surely for my part I thinke it
muſt unavoidably bee ſaid, that they Propheſyed diſtributively and
in ſeverall Congregations,</hi> The Anſwer is, that this needs not to bee
ſaid at all, but may bee avoided with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſe; and the contrary may bee ſafely
held; to wit, that they Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>cied collectively and in one Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>For firſt, they did ſo Propheſy, that one that beleeved not, and one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
might come in amongſt them when they were Propheſying, and by
that meanes might bee convinced of all and judged of all, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. Which
might well bee done, if they Propheſyed all in one Congregation, but otherwiſe
it could not, for as much as one unbeleever could not bee preſent in ſeverall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
at once.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they were ſo to Propheſie, that the Prophets when they Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
were to have the reſt of the Prophets to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

of that which was delivered, let the Prophets ſpeake two or three, and the reſt

The former of which ſayings Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> himſelfe doth underſtand of a Colledge
Prophets, having a power Dogmaticall of judging, and cenſuring the Doctrine of
the Prophets delivered. <hi>What they ſpeake, ſaith he, Page 467. Is to bee
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114129:48"/>
judged and put under cenſure; for the whole Colledge muſt judge;
for which he alledgeth verſe 29. And a little after, this is not a Power

                     </gap> take it a Propheticall
judging, which may warrant the Iuridicall power of a Presbytery, &amp;c.</hi>
By all which it plainely appeareth that when the Prophets did Propheſy, the
other Prophets were to bee preſent, to heare and judge of the Doctrines delivered;
and if ſo, how can it bee that they Propheſyed in ſeverall Congregations at the
ſame time? For had it been ſo, they could not have judged of one anothers
Doctrine, which they could not heare, being themſelves at that time imployed
in ſpeaking in ſome other place.</p>
               <p>And therefore it ſeemes more likely, that they met in one Congregation, where
they might all Propheſy, firſt one and then another, ſome at one time and ſome at
another, and ſo all of them might alſo heare and learne, and judge of the Doctrine
delivered by others.</p>

Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> and me, is for this, that we doe not thinke
the Chriſtians at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to be more in number then at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Corinth.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, I will not ſay much, but onely this, that as we have onely delivered
what we think in this matter, without determining or aſſerting any thing perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily;
ſo we ſhall readily imbrace the contrary, when good grounds ſhall be ſhewed for
the ſame: which though we doe not yet perceive to be performed in all that Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi>
hath ſaid; yet I will not here ſpend time in examining the ſame, becauſe I do
not count this point of ſo much importance concerning the principall thing in queſtion.
For whether the Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> were more in number then <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
or whether it were otherwiſe; there is no great matter in this as touching the maine
queſtion. For if all of them were ſuch Churches, as might uſually meet together in
one Congregation, as I conceive they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it matters not much which of them was
moſt in number.</p>
               <p>But doth not M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> prove that the one Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was more then
one Congregation? I confeſſe, he hath ſundry things in the precedent pages, which he
intendeth that way. But in aſmuch as they doe not concerne M. <hi>Tompſon</hi> and me in
particular, nor are by him applyed againſt any paſſage in the anſwer; I will therefore
paſſe them over more briefly, my purpoſe being chiefly, to conſider of ſuch particulars,
wherein he takes exception againſt the Anſwer. Only, thus much I would advertiſe the
Reader, that a good part of that which Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> brings to prove many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
in one Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> hath been anſwered long agoe by Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> in his
<hi>Dioceſans triall,</hi> pag. 5. which I the rather Commend to Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> conſideration,
becauſe, he counts him a man of worth, calling him worthy <hi>Baynes:</hi> And for the help
of ſuch Readers, as cannot readily come to the book it ſelf, I will here tranſcribe a few
lines out of the ſame worthy <hi>Baynes,</hi> as they are to be found in his <hi>Dioceſ. triall.</hi> p. 5, 6.
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was but one flock; Firſt, it is likely that it was of no other forme
then the other. <hi>(Sir,</hi> Ieruſalem, Antioch <hi>and</hi> Corinth, <hi>which he had before ſhewed to be
each of them one Congregation.)</hi> Secondly, it was but one flock, that which Presbyters
might joyntly feed: they had no Dioceſan Paſter: If Presbyters onely, then none but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhonall
Churches in and about <hi>Epheſus:</hi> theremay be many flocks, but God ordained none
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114129:49"/>
but ſuch as may wholely meet with thoſe who have the care of feeding and governing of them:
<hi>Peter</hi> indeed 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. calleth all thoſe he writteth unto one flock, but that is in regard
either of the myſticall eſtate of the faithfull, or in reſpect of the common nature, which is in
all Churches one and the ſame: but properly and in externall adunation, one flock is but one
Congregation. Thirdly, Pariſhes according to the adverſe opinion were not then divided:
Neither doth the long and fruitfull labours of the Apoſtle argue that there ſhould bee Pariſh
Churches in Dioceſan wiſe added, but a great number of Siſter Churches. But when it is
ſaid, that all <hi>Aſia</hi> did heare, the meaning is that from hand to hand, it did runne through
<hi>Aſia;</hi> ſo as Churches were planted every where, even where <hi>Paul</hi> came not, as at <hi>Colloſſe:</hi>
there might be many Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and many converted by <hi>Peter,</hi> and others fruitfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,

by worthy Mr. <hi>Baynes,</hi> who alſo underſtands the latter place as we doe, and not as Mr.
<hi>Rutherford:</hi> For in his <hi>Dioceſ. triall,</hi> maintaining this poſition, that the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted

and giving this very place and inſtance of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> for one of his
grounds, for confirming the ſaid poſition, <hi>p.</hi> 5. Hee comes imediately thereupon to
anſwer an objection, which is the very ſame that here Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> brings to the
former place, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church mentioned in that place, was the Miniſters or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
Church: for the removing whereof Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> returneth 4. things, 1. that
the word Church, is never ſo uſed: 2. He argues by analogy from that <hi>Acts</hi> 11. where
<hi>Peter</hi> gives account before the whole Church, even the Church of the faithfull, and
therefore in like ſort, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> might report before the whole Church of the
faithfull, what things God had done by them. 3. Saith he, they made relation to that
Church which had ſent them forth, with Prayer and Impoſition of Hands; and this
Church ſtood of all thoſe who aſſembled to the publicke ſervice and worſhip of God,
(which is cleere, <hi>Acts 13. 2.)</hi> 4. His fourth particular is this other place of <hi>Acts</hi> 15.
verſ. 30. where, ſaith he, the people of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> were gathered together,
to conſider of Decrees ſent them by the Apoſtles from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In all
which, we cleerly perceive the judgement of this worthy man to be the ſame with us, and
as clearly againſt Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> as can be expreſſed, which being ſo, and his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being delivered upon ſuch reaſons, as ſeem to me weighty, and which Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:114129:49"/>
doth not remove; I therefore ſee no ſufficient reaſon to think otherwiſe of the
Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> then formerly.</p>
               <p>For as for M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his reaſon to prove the place, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 27. to be meant of a
repreſentative Church, <hi>viz. That they met for a matter of Diſcipline, at leaſt for a matter that
concerned all the Churches, to wit, to know how God had opened the doore of ſaith unto the
Gentiles:</hi> The anſwer is, that this doth not evince the thing: 1. Becauſe rehearſing,
how God had opened the doore of Faith unto the Gentiles, being neither admiſſion of
Members, nor of Officers, nor any matter of cenſure, nor any thing elſe; but onely
a meer declaration of the gracious workings of the Lord, cannot be any matter of
Diſcipline, as I conceive.</p>
               <p>2. Suppoſe it were a meeting for matter of Diſcipline, muſt it needs be a meeting
for Elders alone, without the preſence of the faithfull? Will Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> deny it to
be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wfull for any to be preſent at matters of Diſcipline, but onely the Elders? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he will not deny it at all, ſure I am he hath heretofore written otherwayes; Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Plea p. 49. <hi>Where he granteth that all matters of Diſcipline muſt be done with the
peoples conſent, and alledgeth about 19. or 20. Divines old and new for the ſame Tenet.</hi>
Now if matters of Diſcipline muſt be done with the peoples conſent, then the people
muſt be preſent thereat; For elſe they give their conſent blindefold. And if they muſt
be preſent at ſuch matters; then ſuppoſe the matter mentioned in the Scripture we have
in hand, had been of that nature, yet the Church that was gathered together about
the ſame, needed not to be a repreſentative Church of Elders alone, as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>
would have it, but might conſiſt of the people alſo, who by his own grant may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſent at ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>3. Be it a matter of Diſcipline, or a matter that concerned all the Churches, or
what elſe Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> will have it? It is plain that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> when
they were at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> did declare ſuch matters as here they do declare at <hi>Antioch,</hi> not
onely to the Apoſtles and Elders, whom he perhaps would make a repreſentative
Church, but alſo to a Church beſides them, I mean beſides the Apoſtles and Elders;
for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 4. That at <hi>Ieruſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lem</hi> they were received of the Church, and
of the Apoſtles and Elders, and declared all things that God had done with them: and
verſ. 12. they declared to the multitude what miracles and wonders God had wrought
among the Gentiles by them. Now if they declared theſe things at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Apoſtles and Elders, as to a repreſentative Church, but to the Church of the
Faithfull alſo, as the Text ſaith, they did, what reaſon can be rendred that the Church,
which was gathered together at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſhould be onely a repreſentative Church? And
that the people there were not preſent? For my part, I ſee no reaſon for it, but that they
might declare theſe things to the Brethren a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Antioch,</hi> as well as to the Brethren at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi>
and as well to a repreſentative Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as to a repreſentative
Church at <hi>Antioch.</hi> And therefore ſith it is apparent that at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> they declared
theſe things to a Church, which conſiſted of others beſides Apoſtles and Elders; the
Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> to whom they declared the ſame things, might be alſo a Church of
the like kinde, and not a repreſentative Church, as our Brother conceives it to be.</p>
               <p>4. The nature of the thing, which they doe declare to this Church was ſuch, as that
it was fit enough for the people to be acquainted therewith; which the text mentions
in two clauſes; firſt, more generally, all that God had done with them: Secondly,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114129:50"/>
more ſpecially, how he had opened the doore of Faith to the Gentiles. Now ſuppoſe
the people had nothing to do in matters of Judicature by way of power therein, yet to be
informed of other peoples converſion, and how God bleſſed the labors of the Apoſtles
to that end, which are the things they declared to this Church, theſe are no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but the people may bee acquainted therewith for their comfort, and that God
might have praiſes from them all; and therefore the Church to whom <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
declared theſe things, needs not to be underſtood of the Elders alone, but may
well enough be a Church conſiſting alſo of ordinary Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it not unmeet to make known to all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the grace of
God beſtowed on the Churches of <hi>Macedonia, 2 Cor.</hi> 9. 1, 2. and declareth to them of
<hi>Macedonia,</hi> the forwardneſſe of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the grace of liberality, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2.
ſhewing the good that came hereby, in that the example of Gods grace, in ſome provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
many others to the like, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. your zeale, ſaith he, hath provoked very many;
and likewiſe in that, by this meanes, there redounded many thankſgivings unto God,
verſ. 12, 13. And if upon theſe and other good cauſes he did thus practice towards the
Chriſtians of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> I know no good reaſon why he and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
ſhould deal otherwiſe with the Chriſtians at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and conceale from them the
gracious workings of God by their Miniſtery amongſt the Gentiles; and make known
the ſame onely to a repreſentative Church of Elders.</p>
               <p>As for our Brothers anſwer to the other Scripture, <hi>Act. 15. 30. That the aſſembling
of the multitude, there ſpoken of, muſt be taken diſtributively,</hi> I conceive the text will
not beare that expoſition: for the words are that they gathered the multitude together,
then delivered the Epiſtle. Now if this multitude was gathered together not in one
aſſembly but diverſe, how could the Epiſtle being but one, be delivered to them all?
Can one Epiſtle be delivered to ſundry or ſeverall aſſemblies at one time? I ſuppoſe it
is not poſſible, except we ſhall imagine there be ſundry Coppies, one to be read in one
aſſembly, and another in another; whereof in the preſent caſe, there is not ſo much as
the leaſt hint. And if we would imagine ſuch a matter, for which there is ſmall reaſon;
yet ſince it is, <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> by whom this Epiſtle was ſent, and who were to tell the
ſame things by mouth, and who alſo upon the delivering of the Epiſtle exhorted the
breathren of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with many words, as is cleare, verſ. 22, 23, 27, 32. <hi>Iudas</hi> and
<hi>Sila<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> I ſay, being but two men could not be preſent, and ſpeak, and act theſe things in
many aſſemblies at once, but muſt of neceſſity be both in one aſſembly, or at the moſt
in two: but the text makes no mention of their being in two, but plainly enough inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
the contrary, that they were both together: and yet where they were preſent,
there was the multitude gathered together, to receive the Epiſtle by their hands, and to
heare the report and word of exhortation at their mouth. Unleſſe therefore we will
imagine that <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> could be preſent, and act in many aſſemblies at once,
there is no reaſon to think this multitude among whom they were preſent and acted,
to be many Congregations or aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>And therefore for his concluſion, pag. 475, 476. <hi>That the mentioning of one multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in the ſingular number,</hi> Acts 15. 30. <hi>can never prove that there was but one ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
at</hi> Antioch. The anſwer is, that we doe not lay the force of our reaſon in the
mentioning of the multitude in the ſingular number, and therefore it can not thus be
ſatisfied, or put off: for our words are theſe: <hi>The whole multitude of them were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114129:50"/>
together at the return of</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>from the Synod at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to heare the
Epiſtle read, which was ſent from that Synod:</hi> Anſwer p. 50. wherein it is eaſie to perceive,
that we lay the force of our reaſon not in this, that the Church is called a multitude in
the ſingular number; but in this, that the whole multitude were gathered together,
for ſuch an end, as there is expreſſed: and this we ſtill conceive may prove the point:
For a Church, which is ſuch a multitude, as is gathered together, for the receiving of
one Epiſtle, which was ſent unto them all, and which is gathered together to heare the
Epiſtle read, and alſo to heare the ſame things by mouth, the men from whoſe mouth
they muſt ſo heare, and from whoſe hands they muſt ſo receive, being no more but
two; ſuch a Church as this can be no more, but one Congregation, or Aſſembly.
Now <hi>Antioch</hi> was ſuch a Church: and therefore was no more but one Congregation.
If this concluſion be not granted, ſome way muſt be deviſed how many ſeverall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
might all be receivers and hearers of one and the ſame Epiſtle at the ſame time,
there being but one coppy of the Epiſtle, as alſo how they might at one time heare the
ſame things declared to them by mouth, when there was but two men to declare the
ſame. And when ſuch a way is found out, we may then further conſider thereof. But
in the mean time, the grounds and reaſons alledged doth induce me to think, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
where thoſe things were thus done, was indeed, but one Congregation.</p>

by their ſex, and the other for want of underſtanding and diſcretion. <hi>This paſſage
Mr.</hi> Rutherford <hi>having related (though with ſome variation) in his pag. 476: in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
thereto, he ſaith thus, p.</hi> 477. If there be no governing power in women, nor any act
at all in Excommunication, you looſe many arguments, that you bring 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. to prove
that all have hand in Excommunication, 1. Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to all. 2. All were to
mourne. 3. All were to forbeare the company of the Excommunicated: then belike <hi>Paul</hi>
writeth not to all Saints at <hi>Corinth,</hi> not to women, and women were not to mourne for the
ſcandall, nor to forbeare his company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Tompſon</hi> and I doe being ſuch arguments from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. why is not
the place quoted, where we doe bring them? I ſuppoſe there is no ſuch place at all that
can be produced; and therefore I deſire ſo much favour, that what we never ſaid, may
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114129:51"/>
not be imputed to us, nor divulged abroad, as ours. If others doe bring ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. they that bring them are able to ſpeake for themſelves, and to
give account of their own arguments; but I know no reaſon that doth require, that
we ſhould be drawn to defend ſuch arguments as we never uſed; nor that doth allow
our Reverend Brother to report ſuch arguments as ours; which having never been
uſed by us, I counted it therefore an impertinent digreſſion, to ſpend time in the defence
of them.</p>

or priviledge, or right in Church matters; yea, as himſelf ſaith in this, they have <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum

to ſpeak in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 34. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 12. which very prohibition to
women doth alſo ſecretly imply, that men may have liberty to practiſe, though women
may not. Now then, if the people have liberty, priviledge, right to conſent, and act
in Church matters; yea, to ſpeak in the Church, and yet women may not ſpeak therein,
how can this ſtand, which here M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> writes, That if the people have any liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
this liberty muſt alſo be due to women? If the Apoſtles words and our Brothers
own doctrine in the places cited do ſtand, his ſaying in the place, we have now in hand,
cannot ſtand, they being ſo contrary one to another. Thirdly, ſaith he, <hi>What privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the people have in Ordination to conferre a miniſtery, which they neither have formally,
nor virtually,</hi> I know not.</p>

not but there is a power virtuall, not formall in the Church of beleevers, to ſupply the want
of ordination of Paſtors,</hi> hic &amp; nunc; <hi>this power is virtuall, not formall, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114129:51"/>
in the place we have in hand, the virtuall power as well as the formall is denyed;
which things are not free from Interferring, or ſtrong appearance thereof.</p>
               <p>Our words are not juſt the ſame which M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſets downe, a priviledge in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
to conferre a Miniſtery; but theſe are our words, a liberty exerciſed about or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
&amp;c. And who knows not but there may be a liberty exerciſed about ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or any other Ordinance by way of conſent thereto, or deſire thereof, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any authoritative acting therein? And if this liberty about ordination be ſuch a
fault, then how ſhall he be juſtified, who doth give to the people a greater matter then
this liberty doth amount unto, even a power to do that which ſhall ſtand for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſelfe? which to do I conceive is more then to exerciſe ſome liberty about ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And when the reader ſhall have conſidered theſe enſuing words of M <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi>
then let him be judge, whether M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> do not give this power unto the
people in ſome caſes. <hi>As a roſe, ſaith he, cauſed to grow in winter by art, is of that ſame
nature with a roſe produced in ſummer by nature, though the manner of production be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
ſo are they both true Paſtors, thoſe who have no call, but the peoples election, and thoſe
who have ordination by Paſtors,</hi> p. 186. <hi>And in the page following, he gives two reaſons
to prove that in ſome caſes election by the people onely may ſtand for ordination: 1. Becauſe
God is not neceſſarily tyed to ſucceſſion of Paſtors: 2. Becauſe where men are gifted for the
work of the Miniſtery, and there be no Paſtors to be had, the giving of the Holy Ghoſt is a
ſigne of a calling of God, who is not wanting to his own gracious intention, though ordinary
means faile.</hi> Now if the people without Paſtors may do that which ſhall ſtand for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
and if their election do make a Miniſter in ſome caſes; this ſeems to be more
then onely to exerciſe ſome liberty about ordination, for as much as they may doe this
latter, and poſſibly no Miniſter be made thereby; whereas in the other caſe a man is
made a true Paſtor and Miniſter, as well as by ordination it ſelfe. Marvell it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the greater is allowed as lawfull, and not the leſſer: that ſome liberty about
ordination may not be allowed, and yet that can be allowed which may ſtand for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
it ſelf, and which makes a Miniſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

There was indeed at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the year 1643. a printed conference of ſome of the

of, and this was all. But as the meeting was not any Synod, as Synods are
uſually underſtood, ſo neither were there any Synodicall propoſitions there agreed
upon, nor any table of propoſitions agreed upon to be given forth as the Doctrine of

New England. This I am able to teſtifie, having been preſent at that meeting from
the beginning thereof unto the end: and ſundry others of the Elders of theſe Churches
can teſtifie the ſame, upon the ſame ground: And knowing full well the truth of what
I heare relate, I will not ſpend time in replying to what he hath written upon ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

per adventure ſome notes may have come to his view, which one or other might gather

of appealing from a Congregation to a generall Councell agree with ours, as we have
ſet them downe in the 16. page alledged; and therefore that our mind and meaning

Cramners <hi>appealing to Councell, related by Mr.</hi> Fox) <hi>doth ſuit the preſent queſtion, we do
not underſtand; for his appeale was not from a particular Congregation, but from the Pope: nor
was it from a Synod, but to the next generall Councell, which from that day to this hath not
yet been aſſembled nor called. If we muſt hold a neceſſity of appeales to ſuch a Iudicatory as</hi>
Cranmer <hi>appealed unto, then the ſupremacy of Synods provinciall, and nationall is utterly

               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:114129:52"/>
In matters doctrinall, ſaith he, ſome as <hi>Luther,</hi> and others have juſtly appealed from

               <p>

others have juſtly done it, and yet <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> are two of them that did it not,
theſe are ſayings which ſeem not to agree. Againe, if <hi>Luther</hi> did ſo appeale, why is no
proof alledged for Confirmation of what here is affirmed? which if there had been, we
might have conſidered thereof. But ſith there is not, we may be allowed to forbeare
aſſent, till that which is here nakedly affirmed, be further ſtrengthened by ſome proofe
or other, to make it good. Laſtly, if <hi>Luther</hi> or others have juſtly appealed from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
to a generall Councell, then why will it not be lawfull for others upon like
occaſion to do the like? And if ſo, then (as we argued in the anſwer) the ſupremacy
of Claſſicall, Provinciall, and Nationall Presbyteries is utterly taken away: and ſo,
by this meanes cauſes and controverſies may ſtill be depending, and never come to be
determined ſo long as this world ſhall endure; which whether it be agreeable to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, and good of his people let the wiſe judge.</p>
               <p>Though verily, I profeſſe, I cannot ſee what power of Juriſdiction to cenſure ſcandalls, can
be in a generall Councell; there may be ſome meerly doctrinall power, if ſuch a Councell could
be had, and that is all.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>For my part, I am altogether of the ſame minde. But here I have a quere or
two to propoſe to our reverend Brothers ſerious conſideration; firſt of all, how this
paſſage doth agree with that which himſelf hath written, pag. 387. where he ſaith,</hi> It
may be made good that a power Dogmaticall is not different in nature from a power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and that we read not of any ſociety, which hath power to meet to make lawes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
which have not power alſo to back their decrees with puniſhment. Yea, he ſaith further
that if the Jewiſh Synodry might meet to declare judicially what was Gods law in point of
conſcience, and what not, farre more may they puniſh contraveners of the law: For Anomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick
power in a ſociety, which is the greater power, and is in the fountaine, muſt preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in the ſociety <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> leſſer power, which is to puniſh. Anomothetick power miniſteriall can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
want a power of cenſuring. <hi>So that whereto in the place we have in hand, he ſaith,
there may be in a generall Councell, ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> doctrinall power without any power
of juriſdiction to cenſure, in this other place, he ſaith, theſe powers do not differ in
nature, nor can the former be without the latter; but doth alwayes preſuppoſe the ſame,
as that which is leſſer, and which it cannot want. Now how theſe things do agree I am
not able to underſtand: next of all how doth this paſſage we have in hand agree, with
that which is written p.</hi> 308, 309. Where he ſaith, it is by accident, and not through want of
inate and intrinſecall power, that the court of a Catholick Councell can not in an ordinary and
conſtant way exerciſe the power which Chriſt hath given to her; <hi>and what that power is he
expreſſeth in two or three lines proceeding, viz.</hi> A power of juriſdiction to Excommunicate
and relax from Excommunication even nationall Churches. If the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to
give the Chriſtian Churches a generall Councell this day, might lawfully in a juriſdictiall way
declare the faction of the Romiſh pretended Catholicks to be myſticall Babylon—which in
Excommunication in the eſſence and ſubſtance of the act. And againe, This of our Saviour,
Tell the Church, is neceſſarily to be applyed to all Churches and Courts of Chriſt, even to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell. And in page 304. He tells in that a power of juriſdiction (though he call
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114129:53"/>
it extraordinary and remote, and which is but rarely to be put forth in acts) is given to the
Catholick viſible Presbytery, of the whole Catholick viſible Church. <hi>In all which places
he plainly affirmeth there is a power of juriſdiction to cenſure ſcandalls in a generall
Councell, which in the place we have in hand he doth as plainly deny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if there be no power of juriſdiction to cenſure ſcandals in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
then how ſhall it appeare that there is ſuch power of Juriſdiction in the Claſſicall,
Provinciall and Nationall Presbyteries, which are farre leſſe? Yea, and that there is
in theſe Presbyteries a power Independent and Supreame, without appeale to any other.
For ſuch power there muſt be in ſome of them, if there be any power of juriſdiction in
them at all, ſith we are told there is no power of juriſdiction in the generall Councell
to appeale unto. Now how ſhall it appeare that any ſuch Independent ſupream power
of juriſdiction is given to any of thoſe Presbyteries? where are the texts of Scripture
that ſpeak of ſuch power? For our parts we know of none, but do ſtill think that this
power is placed by Chriſt in a ſingle Congregation and its Presbytery, and are the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtrengthened in this apprehenſion, for that the reaſon which is wont to be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Congregations power, and wherein our Brethren are wont to place their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
ſtrength, <hi>ſc.</hi> that appeals are <hi>juris naturalis,</hi> and that defects, in the parts are to be
ſupplyed and holden by the whole, this reaſon we ſee is now removed and utterly taken
away, foraſmuch as all power of juriſdiction is denyed to the generall Councell which
is the inevitable. Now if there be no power of juriſdiction within the generall Councell,
then there can be no appeals to ſuch a Councell for ſuch an end: and if no appeales to
that Councell, then the rule doth not alwayes hold, that there muſt be appeals from the
leſſer aſſemblies to the greater: and if this do not alwayes hold, then there may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
power of juriſdiction in a Congregation without appeals from the ſame,
though it be a leſſer aſſembly then the Claſſicall, Provinciall and Nationall Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
and thus our purpoſe is gained. For how can it be avoided, except this power
of juriſdiction (yea ſupream or independent power) which is denyed to the generall
Councell, could be proved to be in the Claſſes, Synods, or nationall Presbyteries,
which we think cannot be done. Indeed to ſay on the one ſide, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is no indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
power in the Congregation, and to ſay on the other ſide, that there is no power at
all of juriſdiction in generall Councells, this doth inevitably lay a neceſſity of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
power in theſe intermediat aſſemblies of the Claſſicall, Provinciall and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Presbyteries; except we ſhall ſay there is no ſuch power at all appointed by
Chriſt in any Church aſſemblies on earth. Now if ſuch independent power be given
to the Presbyteries mentioned, (as it needs muſt if it be neither in the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
nor in the ſingle Congregations) then I deſire to know upon what ſcripture or ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſuch power in the ſaid Presbyteries is grounded and built; and whether the ſaid
power belong unto them all, or only unto ſome of them, and which they be, and why
not to the reſt as well: yea, why not to the ſingle Congregation, nor yet to the generall
Councell, as well as to any of them. When this quaere is anſwered, and the anſwer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proved by ſcripture, then we ſhall ſee more reaſon for the juriſdiction of ſuch
aſſemblies over the particular Congregations then yet we have ſeen. In the mean, time
this quaere with the reſt I leave to our Brethrens conſideration.</p>

                  </gap> they depend upon one viſible Monarch? It is an unjuſt conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> With favour of ſo worthy a man, he greatly wrongs our words (and thereby
wrongs the reader) by leaving out thoſe words wherein the plaineneſſe and ſtrength of
our argumentation lyes. Therefore I am forced here to relate the order and progreſſe
of the diſpute in that ſcript of ours, and to ſet down our words there uſed, becauſe as
Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath ſet them down, the ſtrength of conſequence is ſuppreſſed from the
Readers knowledge, and ſo indeed his anſwer is made eaſie: but the naked truth lyes
thus. Our reverend Brother to whoſe Treatiſe we return anſwer in that ſmall piece of
ours, having ſaid, that communion and aſſiſtance in government is taught by the very
light of nature to all ſocieties whatſoever, whether Commonwealths, or Armies, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
or Navies; he preſently addeth by way of prevention. <hi>Not that therefore this
government of Churches ſhould (as thoſe) end in a Monarchy upon earth.</hi> In anſwer whereto,
beſides other things, we have theſe words, pag. 21. <hi>If Churches muſt be dependent on the
government of Synods, becauſe the light of nature teacheth a communion and aſſiſtance in
government to all ſocieties whatſoever, then we ſee not how it will be avoided, but by the ſame
reaſon, Churches muſt end in a Monarchie on earth, if it were once cleared, that the light
of nature doth teach all ſocieties whatever ſo to end; ſo there is as good reaſon for this as for
the other.</hi> Which laſt words, if it were once proved &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> wholy leaves
out and ſuppreſſeth, and ſo makes his own anſwer more eaſie. But I deſire ſo much
favour, which I think is but reaſonable, that he that will undertake to anſwer our
writing, would repreſent our words and arguing as it is, and no otherwiſe, and then I
am content that the ſame may come under tryall. Now our arguing is this; If Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
muſt be dependent upon the government of Synods upon this reaſon; becauſe the
light of nature teacheth a communion and aſſiſtance in government to all ſocieties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114129:54"/>
then by the like reaſon let it be once proved (which is by Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> affirmed)
that the light of nature teacheth all ſocieties to end in a Monarchy, and it will thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
follow that Churches muſt likewiſe end in the ſame manner. If we yeeld thus much
that what the light of nature teacheth other ſocieties, the ſame muſt be obſerved in the
government of Churches: I think it will then follow, that if the light of nature teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſocieties to end in a Monarchy on earth, the government of Churches muſt do ſo
alſo. This is our manner of arguing, in which the conſequence is the ſame with that
which our Brethren think ſo ſtrong, <hi>viz.</hi> that becauſe the light of nature teacheth a
communion and aſſiſtance in government, therefore there muſt be in the Churches a
government of Synods.</p>
               <p>If any ſay the conſequence is not alike neceſſary in both caſes, becauſe the ground
doth not hold alike in both, for the light of nature doth not teach all ſocieties on
earth to end in a Monarchie, as it doth teach a communion and aſſiſtance in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
The anſwer in that we have plainly ſaid the ſame, in the place of the Anſwerer
alledgeth, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 20, 21. But the main queſtion lyes not there, whether other ſocieties
do end in Monarchies, (for though the reverend author whom we there doe anſwer,
do ſeem ſo to judge; yet we have there plainly declared, that we conceive of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
otherwiſe:) but here doth lye the main queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Suppoſe it were granted, that
light of nature doth teach all ſocieties to end in a Monarchy on earth, whether would it
not then follow that Churches muſt alſo ſo end: And that this is the thing in queſtion wil
plainly appear to any that ſhall peruſe the place. And to this queſtion, our anſwer is
that the conſequence for the affirmative is as good as in that other caſe, in which our
Brethren do think it ſo ſtrong: <hi>viz.</hi> for the government of Synods over congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
from the communion and aſſiſtance—government taught by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to other ſocieties: and our reverend brother granting that the light of nature doth
teach the one as well as the other unto other ſocieties, that is, that they ſhould end in
Monarchies, as well as have communion in government, our anſwer is that thereupon
the conſequence will be as ſtrong for the one as for the other in Churches. In which
arguing it is eaſie to perceive that we go upon the ground which was laid and given us
by our author: and therefore for M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> to ſuppreſſe this ground which we have
there ſo plainly expreſſed, and to repreſent and ſet down our arguing as if there had been
no ſuch matter; this indeed may make way for himſelf to give anſwer to us with eaſe,
but whether it be candid and faire thus to deale, I leave it to himſelf, and the godly wiſe
to conſider.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſame pag. 482. he alledgeth the anſwer pag. 26. and ſets down theſe words
as ours,</hi> viz. The Graecians and Hebrews made not two Churches, but one Congregation;
they called the multitude of the Diſciples together, verſ. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here againe our words are ſet down unperfectly: for the queſtion being,
whether thoſe Graecians and Hebrews, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. were two ſeverall Congregation in one
Church, or both but one Congregation, we for this latter do not onely alledge that one
particular which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> mentioneth, that the Apoſtles called the multitude of
the diſciples together, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. but moreover that this multitude muſt look out ſeven
men duely qualified, whom they might appoint over that buſineſſe, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and that the
ſaying pleaſed this whole multitude, and that they thereupon choſe ſeven who are there
named <hi>v.</hi> 5. and ſet them before the Apoſtles, <hi>v.</hi> 6. who laid their hands on them: <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:114129:54"/>
In all which, ſay we, there is no hint of two Congregations, one of Graecians and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Hebrews, but all the buſineſſe of chuſing and ordeyning theſe Deacons, ſeems
to be tranſacted and done in one Congregation. For when the text ſaith that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
called the multitude of the diſciples unto them, and made a ſpeech to this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
being aſſembled, and the whole multitude did hear what the Apoſtles ſpake, and
well liked the ſame, and thereupon joyntly concurred in one act of chuſing ſeven,
and preſenting them being choſen before the Apoſtles, it ſeems to me more rationall to
look at theſe things as done in one Congregation, then to imagine there were two, one
of Graecians another of Hebrews: for of two Congregations wherein this choiſe of
Deacons ſhould be made, the text for ought I perceive doth not afford the leaſt hint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let us hear Mr.</hi> Rutherford <hi>his anſwer.</hi> That the chiefe, ſaith he, of both Graecians
and Hebrews were contained in one, to give their conſent to the admiſſion of the Deacons, I
conceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The chief are not ſo much as once mentioned in the ſtory: but contrarily
the text expreſſely mentioneth the multitude, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. and the whole multitude, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.
Now to exclude the multitude, whom the text doth expreſly mention, and to attribute
the aſſembling and acting only to the chiefe, of whom the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks not one
word, this (to ſay no more) ſeems a violent forcing of the text.</p>
               <p>And if ſomthing had not forced him to it, I think he would not have uſed it; for elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<hi>(viz.</hi> p. 495, 496.) he alledgeth this very ſcripture, and that three ſeverall times,
within the ſpace of a doozen or ſixteen lines, to prove that the people, yea the multitude
are to have the choiſe of Officers; and ſaith he, <hi>If it pleaſe not the whol multitude,</hi> Act. 6.
verſ. 5. <hi>it is not a choiſe.</hi> And in pag. 190. <hi>He tells us, that the multitude</hi> Act. 6. <hi>are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to chooſe out ſeven men, as being beſt acquainted with them; and that accordingly they did
look out ſeven men and choſe them.</hi> In which places we ſee he can attribute this choiſe to the
whole multitude, without any mention of the chief, or ſo much as the leaſt intimation
of the action to be performed by them, the multitude being excluded or abſent; yea,
he gives a reaſon of this choiſe, which will reach the multitude, and not the chief only,
except we ſhall ſay, that the chief only were acquainted with theſe ſeven: whereas in the
place we have in hand, he would exclude the multitude, and aſcribe the action to the
chiefe onely.</p>
               <p>But that all the thouſands of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were here as in one ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
I judge unpoſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For aſmuch as the text tells us that the whole multitude of the diſciples were
gathered together to act as here is recorded about the election of Deacons, therefore we
judge that it was not unpoſſible for them ſo to do; for how ſhould we judge the thing
unpoſſible, except we would judge the words of God to be unpoſſible to be true? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
how many ſoever they were the text tels us <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. that they continued daily
with one accord in the Temple: Now Temples we know there were none but one;
and therefore that they ſhould all aſſemble in one Congregation, we dare not judge a
matter unpoſſible, leaſt in ſo judging we ſhould ſeem to queſtion the truth of Gods
Teſtimony.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet againe our words are ſo imperfectly related, as that our ſcope and intent
doth not ſufficiently appear to his reader. I muſt therefore for the readers underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
relate the paſſage according to the true and plain meaning thereof. The queſtion
between reverend Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> and us being this, whether Congregations muſt depend on
the government of Synods, and this reaſon being brought for the affirmative, that Chriſts
remedy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. Tell the Church, muſt be as large as the maladie, offence; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there ariſe offences between Congregations, there muſt be a Church of Synods
above Congregations, and thoſe Synods muſt judge and redreſſe thoſe offences: to this
we there anſwer that all offences do not fall within the compaſſe of this rule and remedy,
tell the Church; and ſo no dependency of Congregation upon the juriſdiction of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
can be ſufficiently proved by this text. Firſt of all, we inſtance in the offences of
nationall Churches, of which we ſuppoſe our Brother will not ſay that they fall within
the compaſſe of our Saviours rule, Tell the Church, for then the independency of nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Churches and nationall Synods is overthrown, as well as the Congregations; which
we ſuppoſe he will not grant; and yet it cannot be avoided if his reaſon for the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of Congregations upon Synods do ſtand firm. And next of all we inſtance in
the offences of Turks and Indians and other heathens, who may offend Chriſtians and
yet are not to be complained of to the Church, the Apoſtle expreſſely teaching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
1 <hi>Col.</hi> 5. This being the ſcope of that paſſage in the anſwer, which here Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford,</hi>
excepteth againſt, let us now hear what it is, which he ſaith thereto.</p>
               <p>Becauſe, ſaith he, ordinary communion faileth when you go higher then a nationall Church,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114129:55"/>
and Chriſts way ſuppoſeth art ordinary communion, as is cleare, If thy brother offend, &amp;c
therefore I deny that this remedy is needfull in any Church above a nationall Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this remedy be not needfull in any Church above a nationall, then the
rule doth not univerſally hold true, that the remedy, complaint to the Church, muſt be
as large as the malady, offence: and ſo our purpoſe is gained; For our purpoſe in that
place is to prove this very thing, by this ſame inſtance of the offence of a nationall
Church; wherein Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> we ſee doth come over to us, and affirms the ſame
that we do. To what end therefore was it to make ſhew of removing or weakening
what he had ſaid, ſith when it comes to the iſſue, he plainly concurs with us? For by
this means our tenent is not confuted, but confirmed with his atteſt thereto.</p>
               <p>2. Though here he ſaith, this remedy is not needfull in any Church above a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
yet I am miſtaken, if elſewhere he ſpeak not otherwiſe. For in pag. 311. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
this objection, viz. <hi>Chriſt here ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>keth of a preſent and conſtant removall of
ſcandalls—A Catholike councell of the whole viſible Church is farre of, and cannot be
had,</hi> he returneth this for anſwer thereto: <hi>That Chriſt, ſaith he, ſpeaketh of a preſent and
conſtant remedy only, and of no remedy againſt the ſcandall of whole Churches, is denyed. He
ſpeaketh of all remedyes to gain any offenders, perſons or Churches. And in</hi> pag. 322. <hi>he
ſaith, Chriſt giveth an inſtance only in an offending brother; but the doctrine is for the curing
of an offending Church alſo, and for all perſons to be gained, Thou haſt gained thy Brother:
and ſaith he, we are to gain Churches, as we are not to offend Churches:</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 32.
<hi>Again in his ſecond</hi> pag. 332. <hi>ſpeaking of five ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rts of Synods, of which he cals the fifth the
generall and Oecuminick Councell, he ſaith, that all theſe differ not in eſſence but in degrees,
and what word of God, as</hi> Matth 18. 16, 17. <hi>proves the lawfulnes of one, is for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of all the five ſorts of Synods. Laſtly, nothing can be more plain then thoſe words</hi>
pag. 39. <hi>This of our Saviour, Tell the Church, is neceſſarily to be applyed to all Churches and
Courts of Chriſt, even to a Catholike Councell:</hi> (The ſame is alſo to be ſeen in the <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Plea</hi> p. 86.) In all which ſayings, he plainly underſtands the text we have in hand,
to ſpeak of a remedy, for all that are to be gained, yea a remedy for the offences of all
perſons and Churches that may give offence; which Churches he ſaith may do, and
expreſly affirms that it is to be applyed to generall Councels, and that neceſſarily: and
how theſe things do agree, with the place in hind, where he ſaith, he denyes the remedie
is needfull in any Church above a nationall, let the wiſe and himſelf judge. For, for
my part, except there be ſome difference between <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>needfull,</hi> the ſayings to
me do ſeem inconſiſtent, one affirming the place is <hi>neceſſarily</hi> to be applyed to all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Courts of Chriſt, even to generall Councells; and the other denying that the
remedy there mentioned is <hi>needfull</hi> in any Church above a nationall</p>
               <p>2. Chriſts remedy, ſaith he, is a Church remedy for offences among the brethren, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the viſible Church. And Indians are nomembers of the viſible Church, and ſo being
without they cannot be judged, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Indians cannot be judged by the Church is very true, but nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us: for the very ſame that here is ſaid by Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> was ſaid by us before,
in the place which himſelf doth alledge, where we alſo brought the very ſame text of
Scripture which himſelf doth bring. Now why ſhould theſe things be brought as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of us, which are nothing but a reception of that which we had delivered afore
as our own judgement? May not his reader be induced hereby to think that we had
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114129:56"/>
ſpoken otherwiſe? But to let this paſſe. If Indians cannot be judged by the Church,
then ſtill our purpoſe is gained; for by this it appeareth that an offence may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
where Chriſts remedy, Tell the Church, may not be applyed for the redreſſe
thereof; and ſo that univerſall propoſition, Chriſts remedy is as large as the maladie,
and where an offence may be committed, there to tell the Church, is the remedy for the
redreſſe of the ſame, which our brethren do lay as the foundation on which to build the
juriſdiction of Claſſes and Synods, the univerſality, I ſay, of this propoſition is utterly
overthrown by this inſtance of Indians; and ſo that ſcripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. appears to
be too weak a bottome, to bear the building which our brethren would erect upon it.</p>
               <p>Nor is the matter much amended by that which our brother here brings for the
helping and clearing of it, <hi>That Chriſts remedy is a Church remedy for offences among bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
members of the viſible Church.</hi> For let this be granted, as I know none that denies
it, yet ſtill the queſtion remains, what is that Church to which our Saviour here gives
power to remove and redreſſe ſcandals by excommunicating the offenders? we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this Church is only the particular Congregation, and its Presbytery; and our
brethren think it is alſo the Claſſes and Synods: but this apprehenſion of theirs is not
confirmed by ſaying our Saviours remedy is a Church remedy for offences amongſt
members of the Church, inaſmuch as the members of a nationall Church, as ſuch are
members of the viſible Church in our brethrens judgement, and yet our brother holds
here is nor remedy preſcribed for a delinquent nationall Church.</p>
               <p>And if he can ſo underſtand this Church remedy, as that for all this, the nationall
Church muſt not partake thereof, ſo as to be cenſured and excommunicated by any
Church above it, why may not others underſtand it ſo, as that Synods and Claſſes,
yea and Congregations too be exempted from the juriſdiction of Churches? For my
part, I know no reaſon, but if the Congregation be lyable to the cenſure of Claſſes and
Synods by this Scripture; becauſe our Saviours remedy is a Church remedy, by the
ſame reaſon the Claſſes and Synods muſt be lyable to cenſure alſo; yea, and the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Church likewiſe, becauſe this reaſon is applyable to all theſe as well as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
So that this notion of a Church remedy doth not help his cauſe at all, nor
hurt ours, any more then it hurts himſelf. If this reaſoning be good, it is a Church reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
therefore the Congregationall Church muſt be lyable to cenſure for their offences,
then this reaſoning is as good, it is a Church remedy, therefore the Claſſes, Synods,
yea and the nationall Church muſt be lyable to cenſure for their offences: but this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at leaſt, for the nationall Church, our brother ſpeaks againſt, and therefore he may
not preſſe nor urge the former.</p>
               <p>If he or other ſhall ſay, that this Scripture contains a remedy even for a nationall
Church, then it will follow that the juriſdiction of a nationall Church is not indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but depends upon the Oecumenicall: but this our brother cannot ſay, unleſſe
he will gainſay himſelf, becauſe he hath already ſaid the contrary, and ſeriouſly proteſted
it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

be in a generall Councell: onely a meer doctrinall power in all the power that he can ſee in

and this rule of Chriſt affords no remedy by way of cenſure for the ſcandalls of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Church. Beſides, if the juriſdiction of a generall Councell be eſtabliſhed by

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The queſtion between Mr. <hi>Hefle</hi> and us, as it is ſpoken to, by us, in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114129:57"/>
is ſtill about the meaning of our Saviours words, Tell the Church: which will
plainly appear to him that ſhall look upon Mr. <hi>Herles</hi> Treatiſe and our Anſwer, and
compare them together. And though we ſpeak ſomthing of the Churches renewing a
a Covenant with God, when the magiſtrate is an enemy to Religion, yet the queſtion
lyes not meerly ſo and no further; but firſt, this Church is called the Land or the whole
Church therein, or the whole number of Beleevers. Secondly, The thing inquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
concerning this Church, is whether they have not power to enjoyn a ſolemn renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of the Covenant. In anſwer whereto we firſt of all ſay, that in caſe the magiſtrate
be an enemy to Religion, the beleevers in the land are not like to be ſo many, as that
they ſhould bear the name of the land or nation, but of a ſmall part therein. Second,
that in ſuch caſe, it is not like they can have ſuch liberty as ſafely to meet in ſuch great
aſſemblies as nationall Synods: and hereupon we conclude that renewing of Covenant
and enjoyning the ſame in national Synods, being not in the power of ſom few beleevers
in a land, is not then required at their hands. This being ſaid for clearing the ſcope and
ſumme of that paſſage in the anſwer, let us now hear what Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſaith thereto.</p>
               <p>This ſaith he, is a weak anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Sat magiſtrabiter:</hi> would it not do well firſt to diſprove and confute, and
then to cenſure, rather then to cenſure firſt? But if it be ſo weak, it will be more eaſie
to overthrow it: let us hear therefore why it is ſo weak.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians under <hi>Nero</hi> were not like their Prince: and its not like, but ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
will be ſincere Chriſtians and profeſſe truth, even when the magiſtrate is an enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And what of this? doth this ſtrongly overthrow that ſaying, which was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
for ſo weak? If ſincere Chriſtians be ſincere Chriſtians, when the magiſtrate is
an enemy, ſuppoſe as bad as <hi>Nero,</hi> doth it follow thereupon, that in ſuch times the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Chriſtians will be ſo many in number as to bear the names of the land or nation,
where they are, (for there lyes the queſtion) and that it is not like to be otherwiſe? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
no man can juſtly affirm it. For were they ſo many in <hi>England</hi> in the dayes of
Queen <hi>Mary?</hi> were they ſo many in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the dayes of popiſh Princes, afore the
reformation? Are they ſo many in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Turkey</hi> at this day? doth not the
Scripture ſay, that when <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> forſook the Lord, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> did the ſame with him?
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 1. And that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did not only ſinne, but made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſinne?
and that when a ruler hearkneth to lyes, all his ſervants are wicked, <hi>Prov. 29. verſ.</hi> 12.
which ſayings and many more that might be alledged, beſides common experience do
abundantly witneſſe, that when the ſupream magiſtrate is an enemy to religion, often
times (if not alwayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) ſincere beleevers in thoſe dayes are the ſmaller part of that land.
If M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> can prove this apprehenſion weak, he muſt then prove the contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that when the ſupream magiſtrate is an enemy to religion, it is not
like that many of the people will be of the magiſtrates mind, but contrarily the greateſt
part of the land will be ſincere beleevers, though the magiſtrate be an enemy. And
when he hath confirmed this poſition which ſtrong and convincing proofes; he may
then more freely take his liberty to condemne the other for weak: In the mean time,
I think it were weakneſſe in us to depart from this apprehenſion without ſome better
grounds then yet are given to diſcover the weakneſſe of it.</p>
               <p>2. Saith he, If your meaning be, it cannot be conceived how they ſhould aſſemble in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
aſſembly, when the magiſtrate is an enemy, becauſe it is not ſafe for feare of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114129:57"/>
then you ſay nothing to the argument, becauſe the argument is drawn from a duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Are thoſe things duties, which are in nature impoſſible? If not, how is it a
duty of a few beleevers in a land (for when the magiſtrate is a profeſſed enemy, I
doe ſtill conceive the beleevers in that land to be but few, a ſmall part of the land)
how is it a duty, I ſay, for theſe few beleevers, in a land to aſſemble in a nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
and there to enjoyn a nationall Covenant, to be entered into, not onely by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which are but a few in compariſon, but alſo by the reſt of the land which are
farre the greater number? If this be a duty, it is more then I yet underſtand? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it be their duty to enter into covenant with God for their own part; Suppoſe alſo
it were the duty of others to doe the like, yet when the greater part will not ſo doe, but
are enemies to the truth of God like their magiſtrates, is it nevertheleſſe a duty of this
ſmaller number to aſſemble in a nationall Synod, and there to enjoyne a ſolemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to be taken by the land? I mean not onely by themſelves; but alſo by others,
who are farre more in number then they? do they fall ſhort of their duty, if they do
not thus aſſemble, and impoſe the Covenant? In the dayes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the land walked after his wicked commandement, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 11. who made <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
to ſin, yet then there were ſome in <hi>Iſrael</hi> who retained their integrity, and ſet their
hearts to ſeek the Lord, who alſo for that end came to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to ſacrifice to the Lord
God of their Fathers, 2 <hi>Chron. 11. v.</hi> 16. But I doe not remember that theſe few that
were ſincere in worſhip, did ever come together in a nationall aſſembly in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the Covenant with God, and to enjoyn the ſame to that great multitude of the
backſlyding <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> nor that ſuch a duty was required of them, nor that they are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

                  </gap> Lord, nor any of his Prophets for the neglect thereof. And the caſe we
have in ſtand is the ſame.</p>
               <p>If you mean that becauſe the Princes power is againſt the Synodicall meeting, this is nothing
againſt the power of the Synods that Chriſt hath given to his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We mean as we have ſaid, that thoſe few beleevers in a land, being overpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered
with the Prince and People that are enemies, therefore this aſſembling of thoſe
few in a nationall Synod, and there enjoyning a nationall Covenant is now not in their
power, and ſo not required at their hands.</p>
               <p>If your meaning be that, it is not lawfull to them to conveen in a nationall Synod to renew
a Covenant with God, againſt the ſupreame magiſtrates will; I hope you minde no ſuch
thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be our meaning, how can it be hoped that we do not mind it? Can our

the word Church <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 27. is not an aſſembly for Word and Sacraments, but to hear how

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reverend Sir, keep to the point, we never ſaid that diſcipline, and all other
acts, whether performed by a Church, are Word and Sacraments: and therefore there
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114129:58"/>
was no need to prove they are not, and then to triumph as in a great victory: The
thing in queſtion is this, whether the name or word Church, be given in ſcripture to a
ſingle Congregation: and if this be proved (as the inſtances given, I hope, do prove it
ſufficienly) then it matters not what that particular ſpirituall Church action is, for
which they do meet: For whether it be that they meet for Word and Sacraments alone;
or whether it be for the Word and Prayer alone, and not at that time for Sacraments at
all, or whether it be for diſcipline, or for any other Church duty, yet ſtill if they come
together into one place, be it for all or for any of theſe ends, they are then a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
(for what is a Congregation but a company ſo aſſembled in one place) and ſo
our tenet ſtands good, and our purpoſe is gained: For if they that come together into
one place for Church actions and ends, be called in ſcripture by the name of a Church,
then the word Church is given to a company that ſo came together; and ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being a Congregation, it follows that the word Church is uſed for a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What this Congregation doth when they are come together, is not the queſtion:
but if a Congregation coming together for Church duties be in Scripture called a
Church, we have our intent.</p>
               <p>If the word Church, be a meeting of perſons aſſembled to one place for Spirituall duties,
ſometimes for Word and Sacraments onely, ſometimes for acts of juriſdiction onely, then is the
word Church by our brethrens argument taken both for the Congregation, and for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of one, or of divers Churches, and ſo we have our intent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let the antecedent be granted, yet the conſequence is denied: For the word
Church may be a meeting aſſembled, ſometimes for Word and Sacraments onely, and
ſometimes for acts of juriſdiction only, and I adde, ſometimes for the Word and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
only, without exerciſe of juriſdiction or Sacrament, and ſomtimes for ſome other act
or acts, then any of theſe that are named, and yet for all this, it may not be taken for the
Elders alone of one Church, and much leſſe for the Elders of divers Churches;
the reaſon is, becauſe all theſe acts may be performed by the Congregation aſſembling
ſometimes for one of them, and ſometimes for another. And therefore your intent is
not yet attained; who would have the word Church to be taken ſomtimes for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and ſometimes for the Presbyters or Elders alone?</p>
               <p>We deſire our brethren to prove (which they muſt if they oppoſe our principles) that the
word Church is never taken for the Elderſhip alore, in all the word of God.</p>

now become unreaſonable, unneceſſary, or of no force? For my part I am ſtill
of the mind, that he that affirms, muſt in equity and reaſon prove what he affirms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
for our ſelves we have this to ſay further, that If we prove what we undertook, we
have done as much as can in reaſon be required of us, though we do not prove this that
Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> would impoſe upon us: And what was that which we undertook to
prove? nothing in this place, but onely this, that the word Church is taken for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
in other Scriptures beſides, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and this we have performed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
already. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> himſelf allowing ſome of our proofs for good: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having performed this point, it is more then needs to be required of us, to prove
another alſo, which we never undertook to prove, as being quite beſides our queſtion,
which we were and ſtill are deſirous to keep cloſe unto, and not to wonder or be diverted
from it by any means.</p>

Whereas our brethren ſay, a company gathered into one place (which is nothing elſe but a
Congregation) are called by the name of a Church, I anſwer ſuch a company is only (I ſuppoſe
this is miſprinted, for is not onely) called by the name of a Church, for a company meeting for

               <p>It is falſe that a company gathered into one place, are nothing elſe but a Congregation.</p>

a company met, is a meeting, a company convocated, a convocation; ſo a company
gathered together or congregated, had been a Congregation: But this is peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
now condemned as falſe: yet let us hear why.</p>
               <p>As you take the word Congregation: for ſo your Congregation is an aſſembly of men and

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And what if they meet for prayer alſo, what if for the Word and Prayer
without Sacraments, for this or that time? what if they meet for the admiſſion of
members alſo, or for cenſuring delinquents? Can Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> prove that either of
us, I mean either Mr. <hi>Tompſon</hi> or my ſelf, or indeed any man elſe of that judgement,
which he oppoſeth, have denyed an aſſembly meeting for ſuch ends, as theſe to be a

others are there named to the like purpoſe) be a Congregationall Church aſſembled for Word

other actions and duties, muſt it needs follow that the Churches ſpoken of in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
did aſſemble for Word and Sacraments? may not one and the ſame Church aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for diverſe ends and actions? yea, poſſibly for diverſe upon one day? At the leaſt
wiſe it cannot be denyed, but at ſeverall times of aſſembling a Church may attend to
diverſe duties and actions, and yet ſtill be one and the ſame Congregation or Church,
at one time which they were at another. Or otherwiſe we muſt ſay (which were a very
unwiſe ſaying) that a Church meeting for diverſe actions to be performed upon one
day, as the Word, Prayer, Pſalms, Sacraments, &amp;c. is not the ſame Church is one
of theſe actions, that it was in another, but is one Church when they are at Prayer,
another when they are ſinging Pſalms, another when they are in exerciſe of the Word
or Sacraments, &amp;c. Or if they meet one day, for Word and Sacraments, and another
day for Word and Prayer without Sacraments, that n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w they are diverſe Churches,
and not the ſame upon one of theſe dayes, that they were upon another, the nature and
kind of their Church being altered according to the ſeverall duties wherein they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed.
This arguing I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> would not own for good, and yet for
ought I ſee, it is no worſe, but the very ſame with that which himſelf doth here uſe, who

becauſe the Church mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 1 Corinth. 5. and other places by him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
is ſaid to meet for diſcipline or other duties, would thereupon have it thought,
that the Church mentioned in thoſe places was not a Church that did ever meet for
Word and Sacraments, but was ſome other Church of another kinde: which arguing
may be good, if theſe which I have here above expreſſed be good, but otherwiſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

for that paſſage of his in the following page, where he ſaith, <hi>What if there be no

except ſaith he, there were no Elders in the land, or nationall Church to lay on hands.</hi> Now
had our words been delivered and ſet down by him as they came from us, this ſpeech
and paſſage of his would have been uſeleſſe, and apparently brought in without cauſe:
For to what purpoſe ſhould he bring in this exception, ſaying, <hi>Except there be no Elders
in the land &amp;c.</hi> when our ſelves had prevented him in this, by putting ſuch an exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
expreſly into the prohibition, which we deduce and gather from that ſcripture of
<hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 10. Sure this had not needed, but might have been ſpared, if our words had
been fully related: But by this omiſſion and concealement, his own ſpeech hath more
appearance of ground and reaſon in it, then otherwiſe it would have had, and our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
doth not appear to his reader as indeed it is, nor as himſelf received it from
us in that our anſwer. Which we have reaſon to take ſomwhat unkindly from him, and
the rather becauſe it is not only once, but twiſe at the leaſt, that we have thus expreſſed
our ſelves in that anſwer: once in the words which I have here above repeated and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
and again in <hi>pag.</hi> 49. where ſpeaking again of this ſame ſcripture, Numb. 8.
v. 10. <hi>We ſay thus, that we have ſhewed from that ſcripture, that if there be no Elders as
at the firſt, nor any that can conveniently be gotten from other Churches, then impoſition of
hands may lawfully be performed by others:</hi> Nevertheleſſe though we have thus expreſſed
our ſelves, once and a ſecond time, yet M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> doth not once give notice hereof
unto his reader, for ought that I can find; but ſtill paſſing by theſe words of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Elders from other Churches, doth take advantage of the want thereof, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are not wanting in our Churches, which he deals againſt, but twiſe at the leaſt are
plainly expreſſed therein, and would not have been wanting in this paſſage, which here
he ſets down as ours, if himſelf had not concealed and ſuppreſſed the ſame. Now to
leave out thoſe words of ours, which we have plainly expreſſed two ſeverall times at the
leaſt, and then to make advantage for himſelfe againſt us for want thereof, whether
this be not ſuch meaſure as we have cauſe to take unkindly, let himſelf and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.
The third particular of adding words which never came from us, I will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſſe over, becauſe it is of leſſe moment, as not ſo much miſrepreſenting our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
yet I conceive thoſe words, <hi>it (by Ordination) is not to be tyed to the Presbytery
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114129:60"/>
alone, which here are preſented to the Reader as ours, are not at all to be found in our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi>
but I will not inſiſt on this, but come to conſider of his anſwer.</p>
               <p>There is not, ſaith he, a place in all the word of God, where people conſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Ordination to
the Paſtors of the New Teſtament, therefore our brethren flee to the Old Teſtament to prove
it from the Levites, who received Impoſition of bands from the Children of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have given a reaſon, why no ſuch ſcripture can be expected in the New
Teſtament, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe in thoſe times Elders were not wanting; for there were the
Apoſtles and Apoſtolike men, who were Elders in all Churches: and ſay we, <hi>we do
willingly grant, that where Elders are not wanting, Impoſition of hands is to be performed
by the Elders: Anſ.</hi> p. 49. Now for our brethren to require of us an example of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of hands performed without Elders in the Apoſtles times, in which times there
were Elders to be had, this we think to be unreaſonable, firſt it is our opinion, that when
Elders are to be had, Impoſition of hands is not to be performed without thoſe Elders,
but by them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if it be ſuch a diſparagement to our cauſe, that the ſcripture of the New
Teſtament affords no example of Impoſition of hands by the people, how will Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi>
free his own way from another objection, which we think as ſore and weighty
againſt the ſame, as this which they think of ſo much weight againſt us? The objection
I mean is this, that there is not any place in all the ſcripture of the New Teſtament,
where ordinary Paſtors or Elders Impoſed hands on ordinary Paſtors or Elders; but
all the examples in ſcripture concerning this matter are ſuch, where either the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Impoſing, or the perſons on whom hands were Impoſed, or both, were officers of
extraordinary note and degree, ſuch as now are not extant in the Church, but are
ceaſed long again: Not that I deny, but an argument may be taken from thoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for Impoſition of hands in theſe dayes: but the thing I ſtand upon is this, that no
example can be given from ſcripture directly parallel, to the way which our brethren in
theſe dayes do practiſe and allow, but ſome diſſonancy will be found therein: from
their way as well (and perhaps as much) as from the way of Impoſition of hands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the people in ſome caſes: let them tell us of <hi>Act.</hi> 6. v. 6. and 14. 23. and
<hi>1. Tim.</hi> 5. 22. and we anſwer the perſons impoſing hands in thoſe places were Apoſtles
and Evangeliſts, ſuch as our brethren are not, nor do ſo account themſelves. Let them
name <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 3. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. and we anſwer, the perſons on whom hands were
there laid were the like, even Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, whatever the impoſers were,
and therefore neither will theſe places perfectly ſuit the caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that if we could give
no example in the New Teſtament of Impoſition of hands performed in ſome caſes
by the people, we think Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> and out brethren of his way might be favourable
to us for their own ſake.</p>
               <p>Yet for the juſtification of our way, and for further anſwer to this paſſage of Mr.
<hi>Rutherford,</hi> we have this to ſay further, that an example in the Old Teſtament of a
practiſe not aboliſhed in the New as ceremoniall, typicall, or of ſome peculiar reaſon
ſpecially concerning thoſe times and peoples, but of morall equity and reaſon; ſuch an
example we think a ſufficient warrant unto us, for the like practiſe upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in theſe dayes: This I thinke Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> muſt acknowledge, for elſe he ſhall
looſe many arguments which he frequently uſeth in this Treatiſe, from the example of
<hi>Aſa, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> and others in the Old Teſtament, for the proving of things to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114129:61"/>
be practiſed in the New: And elſe himſelf and we all ſhall looſe the argument for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſme
which is taken from Circumciſion. Yea, and which is more, if it were not
thus, the Apoſtles arguing would not be ſtrong, who do frequently argue from the
examples of the Old Teſtament to confirm and prove truth and vertue, and to reprove
and to condemn the contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y in the New: to inſtance in no more but 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 10. 2.
Heb.</hi> 3. 24. which examples, together with that ſaying, <hi>Rom. 15. 4. Whatſoever was
written in former time, was written for our learning;</hi> and many more that might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
do abundantly and plainly prove the point in hand: And therefore Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
ſhould bear with us, if we ſomtimes argue from examples of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>As for that which followeth, where he ſaith, <hi>But our brethren hold that the calling of
the Levites and of the Paſtors of the New Teſtament are different, as the officers and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches are different;</hi> the anſwer is, that I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that we have ſpoken one word of this matter, either one way or other; nor
doth he mention any place where we have ſpoken ought of theſe things. And for the
thing it ſelfe, though many differences may be aſſigned between the Levites and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
of the New Teſtament, and between the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches, yet I
know no ſuch difference between them, but that in things which are of generall and
common nature concerning them both, in thoſe we may lawfully argue from them
and their times, unto our ſelves and our times. If Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> know we have given
any ſuch difference as will not ſuffer us thus to argue, when he ſhall expreſſe the ſame,
we may conſider further thereof.</p>
               <p>Our brethren grant <hi>pag.</hi> 49. that it wanteth all example in the New Teſtament that the
people lay on hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And we have alſo in the ſame pag. 49. rendred the reaſon hereof, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Elders then were not wanting: Why then did not our brothers ingenuity ſo farre
prevaile with him as to mention this, when he mentioned the other? however yet this
he may be pleaſed to obſerve, that as we grant the thing he ſpeaks of, ſo themſelves, I
think muſt grant alſo, that it wanteth all example in the New Teſtament, where
ordinary Elders do Impoſe hands on ordinary Elders: for my part I remember none,
nor do I remember that themſelves have yet produced any.</p>
               <p>Theſe who laid on hands on the Levites <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. were Elders, and our brethren ſay it is
like they were; but 1. They did not as Elders: 2. But as repreſenting the people; not as
Elders Civill, for that belonged to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. elſe it will follow that
where a Church hath no magiſtrates to lay on hands, there the Church may doe it: Nor did
they lay on hands as Eccleſiaſticall Elders, becauſe what theſe which laid on hands did, they
did as from the Congregation: For 1. theſe Levites were taken in ſtead of the firſt born of
Iſrael, and not inſtead of the firſt born of the Elders only, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 40, 41. 2 They
were preſented to the Lord as an offering of the Children of Iſrael, not of the Elders onely.
3. When the multitude brought an oblation, the Elders put their hands on the heads of the
ſacrifice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 15. inſtead of all the multitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In relating this paſſage, our meaning is exceedingly miſtaken, and both
our meaning and our words repreſented farre amiſſe unto the reader: the particulars
which in this reſpect may be excepted againſt, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>1. That reporting us to ſay, it is like they who laid on hands were Elders, he there
breaks off the ſpeech; and ſo ſuppreſſeth that which follows; wherein we firſt of all do
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114129:61"/>
give an explication in what reſpect they might be ſaid to be Elders, <hi>viz.</hi> as being the
chiefe and principall members of the Congregation; and next of all we do adde, that
nevertheleſſe therein example doth prove the point, if two things be conſidered which
there we do expreſſe. But both theſe particulars, I mean, both the explication and the
addition or exception, are wholly ſuppreſſed by Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and ſo the conceſſion;
It is like they were Elders, is left ſtanding alone by it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>2. He reports us to ſay, <hi>they did it not as Elders civill: for that belonged to Aaron and
his Sons;</hi> wherein he fathers on us a palpable errour, of accounting <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his
ſonnes to be Elders civill, or magiſtrates, which never came into our thoughts: nay
it was ſo farre from us that we plainly ſaid the contrary, in that very place, to wit, that
they were Elders Eccleſiaſticall. Our words are theſe, If they, (that is, the children
of Iſrael) <hi>did it as Elders, then either as Elders and governours eccleſiaſticall, or as civill
governours: but not the firſt, for that charge belonged to Aaron and his ſonnes:</hi> Levit. 8.
<hi>and theſe Levites now ordained.</hi> In which words we plainly aſcribe to Aaron and his
ſonnes the charge of Elders and Governours Eccleſiaſticall, but not of civill gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
as Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> is pleaſed to report.</p>
               <p>3. In theſe words, <hi>Elſe it will follow, that where a Church hath no magiſtrates to lay on
hands, there the Church may do it;</hi> our words are ſo miſerably mangled, that no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſence can appeare: for here is expreſſed an inference or conſequence, that muſt
follow, and yet no ground or antecedent at all from which it ſhould follow, which is to
repreſent us to the world as men that were <hi>loeſi cerebro.</hi> For men that were in their right
wits, I conceive, would ſcarcely ever argue in this faſhion, as here we are reported
to do: But our words are theſe, <hi>If the ſecond be ſaid, viz. that the children of Iſrael
did lay on hands as civill governours, then it will follow that civill magiſtrates, though
no Church-officers may Impoſe hands in Ordination of Church-officers, and ſo the point is
gained: (viz.</hi> that Church-officers may be ordained by thoſe that are no Church-officers)
which we do further manifeſt in the following words in this manner:
<hi>If the magiſtrate may doe it, then it will follow that a Church that hath no magiſtrate may
perform this action by other the fitteſt inſtrument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhe hath;</hi> For which we there give this
ground, <hi>for that this is not a work properly tyed to the magiſtrates office, becauſe then
the Church in the Apoſtles times wanting magiſtrates, could not have had officers; the
contrary whereof we ſay is manifeſt in the Scriptures,</hi> Act. 14. 13. Tit. 1. 5. This
is our manner of arguing in the place alledged, which is farre different from that which
Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> reporteth as ours.</p>
               <p>4. Whereas he reports us to ſay, <hi>Nor did they lay on hands as Eccleſiaſticall Elders,
becauſe what theſe which lay on hands did, they did as from the Congregation;</hi> in this he
alſo reports us to ſpeak quite beſides our plain meaning and expreſſe words. For
whereas, he ſo ſets down this ſentence, as that the latter clauſe or branch therein is made
the reaſon of the former; the truth is this, that theſe clauſes in the anſwer, have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
the one upon the other at all; but the former hath another reaſon given for
it, which here is not mentioned, and the latter which is here mentioned as the reaſon of
the former is not ſo mentioned by us, but for another end and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Touching the former of theſe two, when we ſaid that the children of Iſrael, did not
impoſe hands on the Levites as eccleſiaſticall Elders, the reaſon we give for this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is this, becauſe that charge was onely belonging to Aaron and his ſonnes, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114129:62"/>
thoſe Levites now ordained: which reaſon Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> never mentions, but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
another ſpeech, as our reaſon, which was delivered by us for another purpoſe.
The like meaſure doth he afford to us in the ſecond branch of the ſentence by him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed:
For whereas we give two reaſons of the main thing in queſtion, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the children of Iſrael, impoſing hands on the Levites doth prove that in ſome
caſes, non-officers may impoſe hands upon Church officers, the one becauſe what theſe
children of Iſrael did, they did it not as Elders; the other that what they did, they did
it not for themſelves alone, but for all the Congregation, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> applies not
theſe two reaſons to the thing in queſtion as they were applyed by us, but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
makes one of them to be a reaſon of the other, which was no part of our meaning,
nor could juſtly be gathered from our words.</p>
               <p>This being ſaid for clearing this paſſage of ours from his manifold miſtakes, let us
now heare his anſwer.</p>

were aſſumed, Numb. 3. 40, 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Elders were but a part of the firſt born, then how could all the firſt
born be Elders by office? or if all the firſt born were by office Elders, then how could
the Elders be but a part of the firſt born? Theſe things ſeem not to be here. But be it
ſo, that the Elders were a part of the firſt born as here is affirmed, how doth this prove
that they who laid on hands did it as a work peculiar to the Elders? Is there any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
or clear conſequence in ſuch a propoſition? For my part, I ſee it not: but on the
contrary, I ſuppoſe it is certaine, that the Elders might be part or all of the firſt born,
and yet they who did the work of impoſing hands might neither impoſe as Elders, nor
of neceſſity be Elders. Though in the ſenſe expreſſed in the anſwer, I will not deny
but there might be Elders, that is chiefe and principall members of the Congregation.
But if this were granted in the ſenſe expreſſed, muſt it needs follow that they impoſed
hands as Elders, and as Elders by office too? Can a man ſuſtain no relation, but
all his actions muſt be actions of that relation? Cannot a man be an husband, or a
parent, &amp;c. but his actions of plowing ſowing, &amp;c. muſt needs be performed by him,
as he is a husband, or parent? Cannot a miniſter pray in his family, inſtruct his
children, or receive the bread and wine in the Lords ſupper in the Congregation, but all
theſe things muſt be performed by him as a Miniſter? I ſuppoſe that none will ſay that
this doth follow: and if not, then ſuppoſe that theſe who impoſed hands were Elders,
how doth it follow, that when they impoſed hands, they did impoſe as Elders?</p>
               <p>Elſe the Church of Iſrael being a conſtituted Church before this time wanted officers, which
is againſt all truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Elſe, elſe what? let the antecedent or ground of this inference be taken from
the words preceding, or from any of them (and whence elſe to take it I cannot tell) and
no neceſſity of conſequence I think will appear. The words preceding are no more but
theſe, <hi>Theſe who laid on hands, did it as a worke peculiar to the Elders, becauſe the Elders
were a part of the firſt born, who by office were Elders, and in whoſe ſteed the Levites were
aſſumed, and then comes in this inference, elſe the Church of Iſrael wanted officers.</hi> Now
how this muſt needs follow upon any or all of thoſe preceding, I ſee not. Not that
I deny the truth of all thoſe preceding words, for of ſome of them I think otherwiſe,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114129:62"/>
but ſuppoſing that were all true, which is more then doth yet appeare, yet here is that
which I am doubtfull in, whether this inference muſt needs follow upon the ſame?
For ought I ſee, the Church of Iſrael might have officers, and yet the particulars here
mentioned not be all true, but ſome of them falſe notwithſtanding. At leaſt wiſe if
they were true, yet the reaſon here uſed would not inferre ſo much. For, to conſider
a little of the particulars: The Church of Iſrael had officers, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Elders were a
part of the firſt born (which is one of the particulars) The Church of Iſrael had offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
<hi>ergo</hi> the firſt born were Elders by office; (which is another) The Church of
Iſrael had officers: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Levites were aſſumed inſtead of the firſt born (which is
another of them) is there any neceſſity of conſequence in any of theſe? For my part I
ſee it not: but ſuppoſe they were in themſelves true, yet, the medium here uſed doth
not proove them ſo to be. And for that which is the firſt, and as I conceive the cheif, to
wit, that theſe who impoſed hands did it as a work peculiar to Elders, muſt this needs
be granted, if it be granted, that the Church of Iſrael was not without officers? I ſee
no neceſſity of granting this neither, but the contrary to me ſeems poſſible enough, that
thee might be officers afore this time in that Church; and yet what was now done by
them who impoſed hands, not be done by them, as Elders by office, but as prime and
principall members of the Congregation.</p>
               <p>For the clearing whereof a little further, we may obſerve that they who impoſed hands
on the Levites are not here called Elders, nor rulers, nor officers, nor firſt born, nor
any ſuch like, but the term whereby they are expreſſed is this, the children of Iſrael;
<hi>The children of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, ſhall put their hands upon the Levites,</hi> Numb. 8. 10.
Now this term being uſed in the 9. verſe imediately preceding, and in the 11. verſ. ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
following, yet in neither of both can it be meant of Elders and officers alone,
but in both verſes is undoubtedly meant of all the body of the Congregation: and
therefore if the context and circumſtances of the place be regarded, theſe children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
who impoſed hands on the Levites, v. 10. cannot in that act be conſidered under
the not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on of officers. Sure it is when the verſe before tells us that the whole aſſembly
of the children of Iſrael muſt be gathered together, and the verſe following tells us that
<hi>Aaron</hi> muſt offer the Levites for an offering of the children of Iſrael; in neither of theſe
can the children of Iſrael be underſtand of the officers alone, but the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is meant hereby in both verſes: reaſon therefore requires that this tenth verſe
ſtanding in the midſt between the other two, the word children of Iſrael, being uſed
therein ſhould be taken in the ſame ſenſe in this verſe, in which it is taken in the verſe
before, and in the verſe that comes after.</p>
               <p>Nay and further, he that ſhall peruſe this chapter <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. may eaſily finde that this
word, the children of Iſrael is uſed therein no leſſe then fifteen or ſixteen ſeverall times;
and ſometimes foure or five times in one verſe; and yet of all theſe, I think here is not
ſo much as one, where it can be underſtood of the Elders and Officers as ſuch, but
is uſed to ſignifie all the Congregation. And therefore to give ſuch a ſingular inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of this word, in <hi>v.</hi> 10. ſo far different from the ſenſe of the ſame word, in all the
reſt of the verſes both before and after, and thoſe being not only one or two, but ſo very
many; this kind of practiſe and interpretation had need to be builded upon very plain
and pregnant, very cleare and cogent reaſon and demonſtration, or elſe our brethren
may excuſe us if we be not over haſty and forward to receive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:114129:63"/>
Again, the ninth and eleventh verſes tell us plainly, that theſe Levites were to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to the Lord for an offering, not of the Elders alone, but of the children of Iſrael,
even of all the aſſembly of the children of Iſrael, and other ſcriptures tell us as plainly
that all offerings were to be preſented with the impoſition of his hands, whoſe the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
was, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 3, 4, and 4. 24, 29, 33. whereby it ſeems evident, that theſe children
of Iſrael, who impoſed hands on theſe Levites, at this time when they were offered for
an offering, were the whole Congregation or ſome in your name and ſtead, ſith theſe
Levites were an offering of the whole Congregation.</p>
               <p>Wee grant the magiſtrates laid not on hands, but they who laid on hands, did it as Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
Elders.</p>
               <p>Reconcile this with that pag. 188 l. 1. where tis ſaid, <hi>the Princes and heads of tribes
laid hands on them:</hi> now what were theſe Princes and heads of tribes, but magiſtrates?
and if they were Princes and Magiſtrates how could they be conſidered in this act as
Eccleſiaſticall Elders?</p>
               <p>The reaſons againſt this conclude not. <hi>The firſt reaſon concludeth not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here again our meaning is preſented amiſſe to the reader; for thoſe three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of ours were given by us to prove another point, and not this to which Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
applyes therein, as is plainly to be ſeen in anſwer, <hi>pag.</hi> 46, 47. where the reader
may perceive that thoſe reaſons were brought to ſhew, that when the children of Iſrael
impoſed hands, if theſe children of Iſrael were not all the Congregation, yet what they
performed herein was for the Congregation, and not for themſelves onely: And if
thoſe reaſons prove this, as I hope they doe; it is no great diſparagement to them not
us, if they prove not another point for which they were never intended. But let us hear
the anſwer.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon concludeth not, becauſe thoſe who laid on hands were the firſt born, who by
office were Church-men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How ſhall we be ſure that thoſe who laid on hands were the firſt born?
though I deny it not, yet a bare affirmation proves not.</p>
               <p>Again, ſuppoſe what here is affirmed were alſo ſufficiently confirmed, how is the
point in queſtion proved hereby? for, ſay they were the firſt born, they might notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
do what they did for all the people, and not for themſelves above.</p>
               <p>The other two reaſons proves nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let them be applyed to the thing, whereto they were intended and applyed by
us, and then let the reader judge. The poſition was, that thoſe who impoſed hands on
the Levites, did it for the Congregation or in their ſtead. The firſt of the two reaſons
is, that the Levites were the Congregations offerings, and all offerings were to be
preſented with the impoſition of his hands, whoſe the offering was: The other is
this, that it was an uſuall thing when the Congregation were to preſent an offering,
that the Elders ſhould impoſe hands on the Congregations offering, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
ſtead, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. verſ. 14, 15. Now let the Prophets judge, whether theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
prove what they were brought to prove, to wit, that they who impoſed hands on the
Levites did it for, or in ſtead of the Congregation: or whether it be as our reverend bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affirms, that theſe two reaſons proves nothing: yet let us hear why they prove nothing.</p>
               <p>Becauſe theſe who laid on hands, did lay on hands as repreſenting the whole Congregation.
Alas it doth no wayes conclude that they laid not on hands, as it is a worke peculiar to them

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If it doe not, yet if our reaſons do conclude that they did it inſtead of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
we have our intent: But to follow Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> a little in digreſſing
from the point; why, do not our reaſons conclude this other?</p>
               <p>The High-prieſt offered ſacrifice, firſt for his own ſins, and then for the peoples; <hi>Heb. 7.
v.</hi> 27. and ſo did repreſent the people; but I hope it followeth not that therefore the Prieſt
did not ſacrifice as a Prieſt, and by virtue of a peculiar office, but only as a principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Congregation.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Mr.</hi> Rutherford <hi>himſelf gives us a diſtinction which may be ſufficient for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this paſſage.</hi> A repreſenter, ſaith he, ſtandeth for another either objectively or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively.
The former of theſe is he that doth a buſines for another, or in <hi>rem ejus,</hi> for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
and good, as the eye ſeeth and the eare heareth for the whole body; and thus objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Presbytery doth repreſent the people, that is, for your good and ſalvation of the people.
The other repreſenting another ſubjectively is when the repreſenter hath its power from that
which it repreſenteth, as he who carrieth the room and perſon of a King as an Ambaſſadour:
but thus, ſaith he, the Presbytery or Elderſhip doth not repreſent the People. Due right of
Presbyt. p. 316, 317. <hi>Now as the Presbytery repreſents the people, ſo may it be ſaid
of the Prieſt,</hi> viz. <hi>that he repreſented the people only objectively, for their good, but
not ſubjectively in their room and ſtead, and therefore the caſes are not alike; for we
think that what was done by thoſe who impoſed hands,</hi> Numb. 8. <hi>was not only done
for the good of the children of Iſrael, but alſo in their room and ſtead, which he will
not ſay of the Prieſt ſacrificing for the people, having already ſaid the contrary of the
Presbytery.</hi>

if the people elect him, and there be no Elders to ordain; I anſwer it is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be true, then what becomnes of that which was ſaid in the precedent

without it, yet for Ordination it is otherwiſe, this being the authoritative calling of
a Miniſter, and the other but a rite annexed to the calling. In which place he counts ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
ſo eſſentiall, as that a Miniſter can be no Miniſter without it, and yet in the very
next page confeſſeth, as we ſee, that in ſome caſe one may be a Paſtor without ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
whereupon it muſt needs follow either that one may be a Paſtor without any
authoritative calling or elſe that ordination is in effect, but the ſame with impoſition
of hands, and ſo there is no ſuch difference between them as is pretended.</p>
               <p>But ſo many Paſtors ſend a Paſtor to a Congregation, though that Congregation never
chuſe him.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Take your own words for anſwer pag.</hi> 496. We never read that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Church a man was obtruded upon the people againſt their will and therefore Election by
the people in the Apoſtolike Church as <hi>Act. 1. 26. Act. 6. 2, 3, 4. Rev. 2. 1, 2. Act. 20.
v.</hi> 28. muſt be our rule. Any election without the peoples conſent muſt be no Election, for
if it pleaſe not the whole multitude as <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 5. it is not a choiſe. And in <hi>pag.</hi> 465. he
tells us that all incorporations have power by the law of nature to chuſe their own rulers and
officers, and that Chriſt hath provided the ſame in an eminant manner for his Church. And
therefore for this paſſage that many Paſtor may ſend a Paſtor to be Paſtor to a Congregation,
though that Congregation never chooſe him, we deſire that he would take his own money for
payment.</p>

then gives anſwer thereto in theſe words, Ordination is the more and Election the leſſer; for
Ordination is an act authoritative of the Presbytery, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.</p>

or the firſt that have ſo thought: For to omit others, he that wrote the book, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the unbiſhoping of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Tytus</hi> affirmeth pag. 114. <hi>That it is no eſſentiall, but
a ceremoniall part of Ordination, which may be ſufficiently made without it, and ſaith that</hi>
Angelus de Clavaſio, Peter Martyr <hi>and others both Papiſts and Proteſtants affirm
the ſame. And in pag. 116. he ſaith it is an act of ſervice or Miniſtery, not of Authority,
and no more then an externall complement or Ceremony, alledging Dr.</hi> Ames <hi>&amp; others for
the ſame tenent.</hi> But now election is more then a ceremony that may be omitted, Mr.
<hi>Rutherford</hi> himſelf being judge: for in his pag. 496. <hi>He tells us, that in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Churches, a Miniſter was never obtruded upon the people againſt their will, but that they
ſtill had the election of their Miniſters, and this he ſaith muſt be our rule, ſo that any election
without the peoples conſent muſt be no election, for if it pleaſe not the whole multitude it is not
a choiſe. And in p. 202. he tells us out of Chryſoſtome that all Election of Paſtors is null with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the conſent of the people.</hi> Whereby it ſeems that Election is ſomething eſſentiall; and ſo
conſequently more then impoſition of hands, which is but a Rite or Ceremony, which
may be abſent, and yet a man have all the eſſentialls of a Miniſter notwithſtanding.
As for 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. the impoſition of hands of the Presbytery there ſpoken of, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
could not be any act of ſuperior authority but onely an approbatory ſigne or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114129:64"/>
rite which might be uſed by inferiours towards your ſuperiours. For <hi>Timothy</hi> being
an Evangeliſt, how could any ordinary Presbytery have authority over him, or give
office or authority to him? Beſides it is not ſaid that <hi>Timothy</hi> received his gift by the
laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, but by the Propheſie, and by the laying
on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, and with the laying on the hands of the Presbytery. Now between
thoſe two phraſes, by the laying on of hands, and with the ſame, there is great difference,
the one importing ſome cauſe or authority or power, the other importing no more but
an approbatory rite, or a ſigne uſed in a ſolemne commending of one to God by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:

not onely afore in reſpect of priority of nature, but alſo in reſpect of time; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
how could the Apoſtles ſay as they doe unto the multitude; brethren look out
ſeven men among you whom we may appoint over this buſines? Can any man imagine
they would thus have ſpoken, if themſelves had already found out the men, and likewiſe
had impoſed hands upon them? for my part, I ſee no reaſon for ſuch an apprehenſion;
but think it is undenyably plain in the text, that the election of theſe ſeven by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was prior to their Ordination, by Impoſition of the Apoſtles hands, not onely in
the relation of <hi>Luke</hi> as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> would have it, but alſo in nature and time, and
that the contrary cannot be ſaid without violence to the text, and injury and wrong
unto the Apoſtles, who by Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> expoſition are made to have bidden the
multitude to look out for the men amongſt them of honeſt report, &amp;c. with a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that when the multitude had ſo done they would then appoint the men to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
when as by this expoſition they had already appointed them thereunto, and had

impoſed their hands on them, which kinde of dealing had been ſuch, that I think that
Apoſtles were farre from it.</p>
               <p>It cannot be that Election of the people is the whol calling of a man to the Miniſtery, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination

an Evangeliſt, how could an ordinary Presbytery giving him either the gifts or the

that treatiſe of <hi>Altare Damaſcen.</hi> then if we require more may be ſaid of this place. In
the mean time I proceed to the next.</p>
               <p>By this Impoſition of hands <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> were ſeparated to preach to the Gentiles,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.</p>

extraordinarily, ſo neither could they appoint them to any certain imployment or place, for the
holy Ghoſt did direct the Apoſtles in their troubles, and here it is expreſly ſaid, that they were
ſent forth by the holy Ghoſt <hi>Altare Damaſcen. pag. 160. and then ſpeaking of certain
words of</hi> Spalato, <hi>who ſaith, this Impoſition of hands was a pious ceremony, and uſed
at that time as a certain part of an efficatious Prayer; he addeth,</hi> Rectius diceret fuiſſe,

of Iſrael ſhould lay their hands upon the Levites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 9, 10. Although the Lord
had commanded to conſecrate theſe Levites unto the Miniſtery; yet he commands the Iſraelites
to lay their hands upon the Levites, as if they had of their own accord in their name given them
up to the Miniſtery, <hi>as</hi> Junius <hi>in his Analyſis doth fitly interpret it: Thus far Mr.</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood
<hi>whoſe judgement of this ſcripture Numb. 8. whether it be not the ſame with

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> addeth that by Impoſition of hands the Deacons were ordained, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.
and that this is enjoyned with the right manner of acting it to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim. 5. 22. and
2.</hi> 2. 2. as a miniſteriall act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whereas, he ſaith, it cannot be that laying on of hands ſhould be onely a
conſummatory rite or benedictory ſigne, and brings the example of theſe Deacons,
<hi>Acts.</hi> 6. for proof, I deſire no more, but that he would accept his own words for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
Now in pag. 169. his words are theſe; <hi>It is not ſaid that the Deacons were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
with Faſting and Prayer, as hands are laid upon</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, Act. 13. 3, 4.
<hi>but ſimply that the Apoſtles prayed and laid their hands on them; which ſeems to me to be
nothing but a ſigne of praying over theſe Deacons, and no Ceremony or Sacrament conferring
on them the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now if it was nothing but a ſigne of Praying over theſe Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
then 1 the ſubſtance of their calling conſiſted not in this laying on of hands,
but in ſome thing elſe; and what ſhould that be but their election by the people? 2. If
it was nothing but a ſigne of praying over then, then why is a conſummatory rite and
a benedictory ſigne gainſaid and oppoſed? For what great difference is there between
a ſign of prayer and a benedictory ſigne? And how ſhall he be reconciled with himſelf,
that ſaith it was nothing but ſuch a ſign of praying, and yet will not yeeld that it was
onely a benedictory ſigne?</p>
               <p>And for the other particular where he ſaith, <hi>this laying on of hands was enjoyed to</hi>
Timothy <hi>as a miniſteriall act,</hi> if by miniſteriall act he mean an act that could be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performed by none, but onely by a Miniſter; then I deſire ſome proof that this
was ſo enjoyned to <hi>Timothy.</hi> That it was enjoyned to him I grant, but that it was ſo
enjoyned needs ſome better proof then a bare and naked aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rmation; ſpecially ſith
many things were enjoyned to <hi>Timothy</hi> in thoſe examples, which were and are juſtly
applyable to all Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Furthermore ſuppoſe it were true that Impoſition of hands were enjoyned to <hi>Timothy</hi>
as a miniſteriall act, how doth this reach to make good the thing in queſtion? what
ſhould hinder but the peoples election might contain the ſubſtance of a Miniſters calling
notwithſtanding? or how doth it therfore follow that Impoſition of hands was not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatory
rite or benedictory ſigne, but ſomthing more? Is there any ſuch neceſſary
conſequence here, that the one of theſe muſt needs follow upon the other? For my
part I ſee it not, nor ſee any thing to the contrary, but if Impoſition of hands were ſuch
a miniſteriall act, as he ſaith it is, yet it might ſtill be meerly a conſummatory rite or
benedictory ſigne, and the ſubſtance of the calling conſiſt ſtill in the peoples Election.
Himſelf doth ſay, as we hear even now, that Impoſition of hands <hi>Act.</hi> 6. though here
he call it a miniſteriall act, was nothing but a ſigne of praying over the Deacons. And
therefore theſe two, to be a miniſteriall act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet to be nothing but a ſigne of prayer
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114129:66"/>
or benedictory ſign (which to me are the ſame) are not ſo inconſiſtent by his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but that they may well ſtand together; And himſelf doth alſo hold that the
laying on of hands mentioned <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 10. was a miniſteriall act, and that they who
did it, performed the ſame as Eccleſiaſticall Elders; and yet I hope, he will not deny
that the ſubſtance of the Levites calling was in the immediate deſignement and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, and not in the performance of this laying on of hands. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it follows, that if laying on of hands were granted to be a miniſteriall act, yet ſtill
it may be meerly a benedictory ſigne, and the ſubſtance or eſſence of the Miniſters
calling not conſiſt in it, but in ſome thing elſe.</p>

and make way by his providence thereto, then who can deny, but ſuch a man is ſent of
God unto that people? And then if that people obſerving Gods ſending of him in

Lord, what is there now wanting to the ſubſtance and offence of ſuch a mans calling to
ſuch a people? and yet the man is not ſent by them to themſelves, but ſent by God,
and received and choſe by them: <hi>Parcus</hi> underſtands this ſending, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. of Gods
ſending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo doth <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and who not? And to underſtand it otherwiſe would be
to condemne the Prophets and Apoſtles, who were not ſent by men at all, and yet did
truely anſwer this ſcripture, in that they were ſent of God: True it is, ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are not ſent of God in ſuch an extraordinary way as the Prophets and Apoſtles
were, but in an ordinary way, and by ordinary means; which way and means if they
doe obſerve, they alſo may be truly ſaid to be ſent of God unto the people.</p>
               <p>But peradventure our brother means that the people may not lawfully chooſe a man
for miniſter unto themſelves, except he be firſt ſent unto them, in an authoritative way
by ſome other men, and that otherwiſe he is not ſent unto them of God; which if it were
true, then it would follow, that the Apoſtles and Prophets, as I ſaid, were not ſent of
God: for plain it is, that men ſent them not. It would alſo hereupon be requiſite to
be cleared, that ſome men beſides the Church have authority to ſend Miniſters to the
Church, and who theſe men are that have ſuch authority had need to be cleared alſo;
which I for my part think will not be done in haſt. And till this be done, I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but I may ſtill retain this apprehenſion, that men who are qualified according to
the rule of the word and duly elected and choſen to ſome office of the Miniſtery by
Gods people, are truly ſent of God unto that people.</p>

be denyed, or the concluſion muſt be yeelded: what then brings he to overthrow the
conſequence? <hi>Nothing but this, that there is a two fold knowledge, one of Chriſtians not

the Presbytery doth.</hi> But what the other knowledge is he doth not plainly tell, except any
thing may be gathered from the words following, where he ſaith, <hi>But for trying of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
if they be the ſonnes of the Prophets apt to teach, able to convince the ſubtill hereticks,
and gainſayers, and to put them to ſilence, there muſt be in a conſtituted Church a Colledge of

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> would have ſpoken to the point, he ſhould have given
ſome reaſon why the people may diſcern a mans fitnes for election, and yet not diſcern
his fitnes for ordination, for this is the conſequence of our argument which he denyes.
But in all that is here ſaid about a two fold knowledge, one of Chriſtians, and the other
of ſome body elſe, what is there in all this, that hath ſo much as the leaſt ſhew of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing

                  </gap>e nothing at all that I can finde: For as
for that which is intimated, that Chriſtians have not ſo much knowledge as to try Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
whether they be apt to teach, &amp;c. this makes nothing to the point in hand, that
they can diſcern whether a man be fit to be elected, but not diſcern whether he be fit to
be ordained; but if it have any ſtrength in it at all, it is as much againſt the ability of
the people, which he expreſſely grants, as againſt that which he would deny; as much
againſt their ability of diſcerning his fitnes for ordination. And therefore how this
ſhould overthrow the one and not the other, I do not know: for to any mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it makes no more againſt the one then againſt the other; but either againſt
both, which he will not grant, or elſe againſt neither which I conceive is the very truth?

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Scripture 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. doth ſhew that <hi>Timothy</hi> had a gift given him by
Propheſie with the laying on the hands of the Presbytery; but how doth it hence appear,
that not only <hi>Timothy</hi> but <hi>Titus</hi> alſo was to dothings with the Presbytery? <hi>Titus</hi> is not
at all mentioned in that Scripture. And as for <hi>Timothy,</hi> Scripture tells what the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
did to him, but what he muſt doe with the Presbytery it tells us nothing at all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if the bulk of the Epiſtles be written to them as Elders, and the Churches be no
otherwiſe concerned therein, but only finaliter and objectively, the Epiſtles being
written for their good, then what ſhall be the meaning and reaſon of theſe words in the
concluſion of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> and of the latter to <hi>Timothy,</hi> where it is ſaid, grace be
with you, and grace be with you all? doth it not plainly appear hereby, that more then
Elders, even all the Saints in thoſe places are written unto in thoſe Epiſtles? Thirdly
if there be rules in the Epiſtles that doe belong to Elders alone, yet ſith it is confeſſed,
and may not be denyed, that other things therein doe concern all Chriſtians, how ſhall
we be aſſured that ſuch paſſages, as concern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aying on of hands are of the former ſort,
and not of the latter? For to ſay it is ſo, and it is clear, we think doth not clear it at all,
unleſſe ſome further proofe be added. Laſtly, if all this were granted, which here is
ſaid by Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> yet for ought I ſee, our anſwer is not removed thereby, but
ſtill ſtands fair and good: For in that place of the anſwer alledged, we ſay two things,
1. That theſe rules about ordination in <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> may with as fair a colour be
appropriated to one man, as to Presbyteries and Synods. 2. That the Epiſtles and
the rules therein are not to be appropriated to Biſhops alone or Miniſters alone, but are
indeed of generall concernment for all the Chriſtians. Now neither of theſe two is
diſcovered by Mr. <hi>Rutherford.</hi> For as for the former of them, he ſaith nothing thereto
at all; and the latter he doth in a manner grant, not only by ſaying that all here is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for the Churches good, but alſo by ſaying that ſomethings are written to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> as Chriſtians which is in effect the ſame that we had ſaid before. And
how our anſwer can be diſproved or ſatisfied, either by ſaying nothing at all thereto, or
by ſaying the ſame that we had ſaid before, I leave it to the Judicious reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
