            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>SLaves to Debauchery and Lustful Rage,</l>
            <l>That drein the Streets and prostitute the Stage,</l>
            <l>Begot in heat of Lust on <hi>Hackney</hi> Whores,</l>
            <l>Souls wrapt in Excrements of common Shoars.</l>
            <l>Standing for patterns, 'fore the Limners Eye</l>
            <l>To draw the Lustful God <hi>Priapus</hi> by.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pox take 'em all!</hi> This Curse I doubt's too late,</l>
            <l>It long has been, 'tis like, your Whoring Fate;</l>
            <l>Then all the Curses ever <hi>Sodom</hi> knew,</l>
            <l>Or pocky Jilts, light on your Race and You;</l>
            <l>Inflam'd by Lust, may you with Passion move,</l>
            <l>And have the Pox return'd instead of Love,</l>
            <l>May you with stinking Breaths pass Unador'd,</l>
            <l>And Breath a fulsom Clap at every Word;</l>
            <l>May Dreams disturb by Night, and Whores by Day,</l>
            <l>And Ravenous Shankers eat your Flesh away;</l>
            <l>May Sores without, and Fervent Heat within,</l>
            <l>Consume and wast away your Loathsom Skin;</l>
            <l>May you be so debaucht, so vilely Lewd,</l>
            <l>'Till grown so great, Lust cannot be Renew'd;</l>
            <l>'Till one sad Ach expels another pain,</l>
            <l>And Claps in Circles meet with Claps again;</l>
            <l>'Till Stone, and Gout, and Stranguries Contend,</l>
            <l>Which to <hi>Old-Nick</hi> your Lustful Soul shall send;</l>

            <l>Condemn'd to Stews above, and Hell below;</l>
            <l>May Bawling Bawds about your dwellings roame,</l>

Having spent all your Wealth in Leachery,</l>
            <l>May you unpittied on a Dunghil die;</l>
            <l>May all these Curses, and ten thousand more</l>
            <l>Then all the Angry Gods have in their Store,</l>
            <l>Light on you; then may Darted Vengeance come,</l>
            <l>With hoorded Bolts of Wrath to raise your Tomb.</l>
            <l>Gods! why o'er Nature did you take such Care,</l>
            <l>In making Women exquisitely Fair?</l>
            <l>Why build you dazling Altars like the Skies,</l>
            <l>And do provide no better Votaries</l>
            <l>Then men? Lascivious men! whose Lustful frown</l>
            <l>Spoils all that's fair, and pulls what's Sacred down;</l>
            <l>Will all enjoy, and Married be to none,</l>
            <l>Though Nature dictates only to use one:</l>
            <l>In broken Language Beasts by pairs do prate,</l>
            <l>The cooing Dove bills but his Single Mate;</l>
            <l>But man, unbounded man! Attempts all ill,</l>
            <l>His Lust is grown as Boundless as his Will;</l>
            <l>That Name call'd <hi>Husband</hi> is of Terror full,</l>
            <l>The State Uneasie, Melancholy, Dull;</l>
            <l>The Kennel, Kitchin, Oyster, rampant Whore,</l>
            <l>Before a Wife, 's the Creature they Adore.</l>
            <l>What Sot would Wander? that has by his Side</l>
            <l>The Powerful Charms of a Smiling Bride,</l>
            <l>Cool as the coldest Night, and Chaster far</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Anchorets</hi> or <hi>Vestal Virgins</hi> are,</l>
            <l>Whose equal Love, do's equal Heat Inspire,</l>
            <l>Prompted by Kindness not a base Desire;</l>
            <l>In whose Embraces gladly pass away</l>
            <l>Whole tedious years in but one Halcyon day.</l>
            <l>Fate Favours him, that makes him spend his Life,</l>
            <l>Doom'd to those Golden Chains, to please a <hi>Wife.</hi>
