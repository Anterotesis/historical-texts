         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

mee on to becom ſerviceable, ſo much as of your Lordſhip's favor and affection. For as you were the firſt that took notice of my inclination, to bee encouraged in the waies which I have followed; ſo your eye hath been all along upon mee therein. In my straights, whereinto my forwardneſs hath from time to time brought mee; I have found the tenderneſs of your ſenſ, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to bee like unto that of a Father. You have in private put to your hand, and ſet your heart to free mee from them; &amp; in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick you have owned mee towards the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, and procured an aſpect from that High and Honorable Court towards mee, to ſet mee apart as an Agent for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Univerſal Learning and the Publick Good, which I confeſs is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, whereunto from my youth God God hath naturalized my affections. And ſince this Publick deſignment of my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, it hath been your influence upon, and concurrence with other noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Inſtruments, whom you have quickned, which hath made that ſettlement, which

doth promiſe ſo much inlargement to my ſteps, in my future courſes effectual. All this I am bound to obſerv and acknowledg with moſt heartie thankfulneſs unto God not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon of the refreſhments, which the Lord hath thereby conveighed unto mee from your hand, but by reaſon of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which moved you hereunto, and the Aim which you have had therein, which I know to have been none other but the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and therein the advancement of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that the hope which wee have to partake of the Salvation of Iſraël, which ſhall com out of Sion by a Goſpel-Reformation of this Age and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, hath been the Center wherein our Aims have alwaies met. For I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the ground of all the good will, of the Bountie and of the Care, which abundantly hath been beſtowed upon mee, hath been none other, but the freeneſs of your ſpirit in the love of the things, which are moſt excellent, wherein you found mee converſant, and which you are delighted to ſet forward. Whence it is that I conceiv

it my dutie, to preſent unto your Lordſhip in a more direct and eminent waie then unto others, the fruits of my Negotiation, chiefly ſuch as relate immediately unto the great Object of our Hope; of which kinde this preſent Treatiſe is a ſpecial and ſignal Diſcoverie. Therefore give mee leav to make of it a publick offer unto your Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, not onely as a Teſtimonie of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Obligations, by which my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the ſight of Chriſt is entirely engaged towards his Grace in You; but as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my Agencie to ſolicite, that by the countenance of your Autoritie it may bee recommended to ſuch, as know what the Communion of Saints doth mean in the Kingdom of Heaven, that there may bee a reciprocation of love in the gifts of the Spirit, between us and others the Members of Jeſus Chriſt abroad; and that the things mentioned in the Preface, as means to accompliſh our hopes, which yet lie under deck, by the building up of the walls of Jeruſalem in the mindes of Believers, may bee drawn

of the Revelation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, drawing to an end (God grant they may not bee loſt, nor fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other hands) but upon this condition, that you ſhall let us know your Judgment thereof; for to this effect, hee that is the autor of them cauſed them to bee communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto us, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ëver ſhould read, ſhould alſo judg and cenſure. I have heard a little while ago of this book, that it is the true Revelation of the Revelations; and that which will bee moſt comfortable (if hee hath hit right) is, that wee are ſo near the terme prefixed. I praie you communicate this to your men, if yet you have anie <hi>Joſeph Medes</hi> amongſt you; but it muſt firſt bee tranſlated into Engliſh.</p>

And in theſe words I take notice, not onely of the opinion which ſom among them have of this book in approving of it; and of the Autor's Modeſtie, and Ingenuitie who ſent it to him; in concealing his own name, and ſubmitting it to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36648:7"/>
the cenſure of others, that by the communion of Saints the meaſure of light, which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to everie one may becom ſerviceable unto all; but chiefly of the good hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, reaching forth this Treatiſe unto them at this time: for it is a manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration<note place="margin">Obſervation of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God to cauſ this book to bee publiſhed at this time.</note> of the Fatherlie care of God over them, to ſupport their hearts in their approaching trials, that they may not faint under the burden thereof. It is a true ſaying of the Apoſtle, whereunto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all Saints, in all ages doth bear witneſs; <hi>That God is</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>faithful, who will not ſuffer us to bee tempted above what wee are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a waie to eſcape; that wee may bee able to bear it.</hi> And as this is a truth in God's waie towards particular Saints, in their ſeveral occaſions; ſo wee may conclude, that in the univerſal diſpenſation of trials, towards the whole Bodie of his Church, his courſ will not bee different, but altogether conſonant unto this promiſe, that as <hi>the ſufferings</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>of chriſt abound in the Church which is his Bodie; ſo the conſolations of the church ſhall alſo abound in chriſt who is her head.</hi> So that if the trials whereunto particular Saints are put, <hi>ſhall bee found unto praiſ, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36648:7"/>
of the Holie ones, whoſe names are written in Heaven.</p>
            <p>I look then upon this book which<note place="margin">For the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles with comfort.</note> doth open to the <hi>Bohemian</hi> exiled, and <hi>Germane</hi> Churches, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God foretold ſo long ago in the Revelation, and now ſhortly to bee accompliſhed; as a ſpecial cordial ſent unto them from heaven, in their preſent affliction, and to ſupport their hearts againſt the approaching viſitation, wherewith God's Providence will farther viſit thoſe parts, before hee make an end of his work amongſt them. And that it is now alſo at this juncture of time ſent from thence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, to mee it doth fignifie, that which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable in ſeveral reſpects, which I ſhall briefly point at before I com to ſpeak of the Treatiſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt then wee may obſerv from<note place="margin">For ſeveral uſes to us alſo.</note> hence, that the ſame ſpirit who doth raiſ the exſpectation of the Saints in theſe parts, doth alſo work the like thoughts elſwhere: as it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that about the time of Chriſt's comming in the fleſh, there was much waiting for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Iſraël, and looking for the Redemption of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> doth intimate, <hi>chapter</hi> 22. <hi>verſ</hi> 25. 33. So it is now worth our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there is more then an ordinarie look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for the accompliſhment of the promiſes, wherein the Revelation of 1. <hi>To confirm us in the exſpectation of the fulfilling of the Apocalyptical promiſes.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:36648:8"/>
Jeſus Chriſt hath cauſed us to hope. You know that ſom moneths ago, one came of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as he ſaid) out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> through the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> into this Citie, to make enquirie, whether anie were here, who did look after the fulfilling of the Revelation; his deſign by this enquirie was, that ſom ground of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and good intelligence might bee entertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt us, for the better underſtanding of God's waies, and the obſervation of his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, in working out his great work for the Churches; and to this effect hee left ſom books here with him whom you know, and ſince his return into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> hee hath by Letters promiſed a further communication with us, upon that Subject, in the name of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue. Thus wee have had a call both from <hi>Germanie,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> to entertein theſe thoughts; is for the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> you know that there are manie there, whoſe eies are opened to look this waie; and in <hi>France</hi> I know ſom (though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo manie as elſwhere,) whoſe heads are lifted up, becauſ their deliverance is at hand. Not do wee Chriſtians onely exſpect ſhortly ſom great change of affairs, but even the Jews, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt everie where, are alſo made ſenſible of the approaching change of their condition. So that ſeeing there is an univerſal concurrence of thoughts towards this object, wee may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conclude, that the Lord is haſtening to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his work in righteouſneſs: and becauſ it is apparent, that on all ſides the enemie is about to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36648:8"/>
lift himſelf up like a flood, wee may alſo ſee it herein manifeſt, that <hi>the Spirit of the Lord</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, is preparing<note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 19.</note> 
               <hi>to lift up a Standard againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this Call which is given to us from ſo far, doth ſignifie unto mee two things; Firſt, ſomwhat of God's waie to accompliſh his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: Secondly, ſomwhat of our dutie in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination thereunto. God's waie<note place="margin">2. To put us in minde of God's waie, by which hee will finiſh his work.</note> to accompliſh his deſign, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures, is, and will bee the communion of Saints in the myſterie of Godlineſs, when everie member acted by the ſame Spirit towards God, and each to other; ſhall draw from him, and ſupplie one to another; that which hee will give to everie one, for the edifying of the whole in love: and although they have not ſuch an exact contrivance of correſpondencie ſetled one with another, as the politick Jeſuits have in their waie; yet the Spirit by which they are led, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing in them all, will make the effect of their counſels, and actings to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond, without anie ſpecial contrivance of their own; that the work in the iſſue may appear to bee of God, and not of men: for <hi>Sion aſſoon as ſhee travelleth, nay, before ſhee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> travelleth, and her pain come's: ſhee ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our dutie in ſubordination to this waie of God is cleerly this;<note place="margin">3. To put us in minde of our dutie, in order to God's work.</note> that wee ſhould with all readineſs of minde, applie our ſelvs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertein all ſpiritual motions, tending to mutual and univerſal edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: not onely by praiers, to ſtrive for all the Saints; and with them to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the fight againſt all ſpiritual adverſaries; but by counſel and endevors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the occaſion is offered to reciprocate with thoſe that provoke us to love, and to good works, and to react with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual zeal towards them by imparting unto them the Manifeſtations of the Spirit, and the fruits of all the grace which God hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; wee know not how much an occaſional and ſmall concurrence may do in God's waie, when hee is pleaſed to make it ſeaſonable, and bleſs it; one ſingle act of correſpondence at an adventure, will do more to make his deſign effectual, then a whole years contrived and ſetled intelligence, and agencie of manie States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for politick deſignments.</p>
            <p>The third thing, which the ſending of this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36648:9"/>
book from <hi>Poland</hi> hither to bee tranſlated, and the calling upon us to communicate our thoughts to them concerning it, doth ſignifie unto mee; is a warning unto us, as from the Spirit of God, to waken us from<note place="margin">4. To warn us not to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wee know that no man ſhall bee crowned, but hee that firſt ſtrive's lawfully; and that none ſhall reign with Chriſt, but hee that ſuffer's with him: as for mee, I cannot ſee that our warfare is yet, as ſom would have it (and to their own particular Station think it to bee) at an end; thoſe upon that account having embraced the pleaſures of brutiſhneſs, and ſenſualitie in this preſent world, have alſo made it a part of their happineſs, to dethrone God and Chriſt in their ranting, and blaſphemous Imagination: and ſo are juſtly given over unto a Reprobate minde; but as I have cauſ to griev at the diſhonor which they do to God, and to the Holie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, and at the certaintie of their endleſs miſerie under the notion of a preſent perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and felicitie; ſo I am awakened thereby to wait for the overflowing ſcourge, and the ſtorm of Hail, which ſhall ſweep away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of ſuch lies, and the flood of waters which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36648:10"/>
ſhall drown the hiding places thereof. I am therefore inclined to exſpect ſtill before the times of refreſhmentt (which ſhall com from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord) the laſt aſſault of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkneſs, and of this world againſt the Saints; which ſhall bee of all other the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and fierceſt; and this I am induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev from the Analogie, which is to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſufferings of Chriſt in the fleſh; and the ſufferings of his members, under the power of Antichriſt, before hee com's to his end. Chriſt's laſt ſufferings, immediately before his unchangeable ſtate of glorie, were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt which befel unto him in all his life; nor was hee raiſed by the power of God, to ſit at his right hand till hee was firſt laid in the grave: ſo muſt it alſo fare with his Bodie the Church, it muſt bee conformable to him in his death, as it ſhall bee in his reſurrection; therefore the laſt conflict which it ſhall have with the Beaſt, ſhall bee the moſt grievous, and before it can bee raiſed to ſit in glorie, it muſt in ſom ſort bee triumphed over, and trampled upon by the world. Let us therefore not deceiv our ſelvs with carnal fancies, as the humor of thoſe is, who feed greedily upon preſent enjoyment, and make themſelvs drunk therewith; but beeing watchful and ſober, let us take this call from our brethren, as a warning, to prepare to ſuffer with them, the laſt encounter of our and their enemies; and readily to communicate unto them, at their deſire, the graces of the ſpirit,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36648:10"/>
which are given to us to profit withal, that wee may bee all fitted for the comming of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, and the wedding of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations upon the paſſages of <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's</hi> letter in reference to this book, areupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in my thoughts, and obviouſly incident to the contemplation of our preſent condition; and of God's counſel manifeſted unto us in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>

            <p>Now to ſpeak ſomwhat of this Expoſition of the Apocalyptical<note place="margin">Concerning the Treatiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Revelation, what eſteem is to bee had of it.</note> Propheſie, I ſhall confeſs that it come's neerer to my ſenſ, then anie which I remember, I have read upon that part of God's word: And to us I conceiv it ought to bee the more commendable, and of better acceptance, by how much it come's neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to that which God hath heretofore made known to our own men before others: for in effect I finde that it is an abridgment of our friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>Mede</hi> to obſerv, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are demonſtrable, and a true keie to the opening of the Myſterie; and hee hath taken

            <p>The means by which the manifeſtation of

Chriſt is put forth to this uſe are, <hi>that hee ſent and ſignified it by his Angel unto his Servant John,</hi> by all which wee ſee, that here nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, it tell's us of what uſe and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance this record of <hi>John</hi> is, to all that read, and hear, and keep the things declared therein; <hi>viz.</hi> it will make them bleſſed. <hi>v.</hi> 3. all which is again fully relative to the fore-mentioned Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Godlineſs, and our Salvation thereby.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36648:23"/>
of the conditions of Profeſſors, and all the fundamental defects of Church-ſocieties, in all the Churches which have been ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's times, are ſet forth; and that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made unto them, all the degrees of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction atteinable in this life by ſingle believers, or Societies, are expreſſed; but this would bee a matter of inlargement beyond my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: I ſhall therefore leav it till another ſeaſon; onely this may bee further obſerved as a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this firſt to the ſecond<note place="margin">The difference of the first and ſecond vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> viſion: that in the firſt, <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Adminiſtration of Chriſt's Kingdom, as then it was on earth: but in the following viſion which begin's <hi>chapter</hi> 4th, hee is taken up from earth into Heaven, to ſee the adminiſtration of the Kingdom there alſo, and from thence how it ſhould bee managed over the whole world for the Churche's ſake in time to com: So that wee ought to take notice that the Manifeſtation of Chriſt, and in him the Myſterie of Godlineſs doth fill not onely the Churches on Earth, but the Church alſo in Heaven; and that God by him, as hee is in the Church, both in heaven and earth, doth govern the world for Chriſt's intereſt, towards the fulfilling of his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; which tend's mainly to reveal the glorie of Chriſt over all, and the felicitie of thoſe that partake with him in his glorie; as alſo by what means the world is ſubdued under him, and conquered by him for the good of his Church;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36648:23"/>
for this is the iſſue of all, as in the cloſe of this Propheſie doth appear by the coming down of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> from Heaven, and the making of all things new, to give unto the Saints their inheritance.</p>
            <p>The ſecond viſion then doth ſhew diſtinctly four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what the frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution<note place="margin">The ſubſtance of the ſecond viſion.</note> of the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is; How it is ordered round about the throne of God, and ſet in his preſence that it ſhould take notice of the paſſages of his glorie, to acknowledg and declare the ſame. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what the adminiſtration of affairs in heaven, and Government of the Church is over the world; how the decrees and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God, and by whom they are brought to an iſſue? Here it is ſhewed unto the Prophet; that the whole adminiſtration of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is put into the hand, and upon the ſhoulder of Jeſus Chriſt alone; who by the Sacrifice of himſelf, as of a lamb without ſpot, did merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly purchaſe to himſelf this honor; and by his ſeven eies of wiſdom, and ſeven horns of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie power, is alone able to diſcharge ſo great a Truſt, as to open all the Seals of God's decrees in their due times and ſeaſons, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the government of the whole world for the good of his Church. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what changes are brought forth in the affairs of the world, and what the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36648:24"/>
of the Church and Saints is therein; by the opening of ſix of the Seals, where is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how after the preaching of the Goſpel through the world; great troubles and terrible wars ariſe in the earth amongſt men: in which the witneſſes of Chriſt are ſlain, and lie as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices at his Altar; but they are comforted with the hope of juſt vengeance to bee exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon the earth for their ſakes after a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and the enemies of Chriſtianitie are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at the beginning of the execution of Chriſt's wrath againſt them. <hi>chap.</hi> 6. And leſt the Judgments which were to bee executed againſt the enemies, ſhould take hold of the friends of Chriſt; there is a careful Proviſion made for the preſervation of theſe from danger, and the Hopes of future glorie are aſſured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the firſt fruits thereof. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, what the deſtruction is which at the opening of the ſeventh Seal is brought upon the world; and what the glorie and ſettlement is, which is brought unto the Church of Saints therein: for the ſeventh Seal doth contein, and produce all what ever doth follow till the end of the Revelation. Here then ſeven Angels with ſeven Trumpets, are appointed to ſound and declare the Judgments of God over the Earth, which accordingly are executed, where the four firſt trumpets are remarkably diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the three laſt; becauſ to the laſt three, a warning of great wo is promiſed by an Angel over the inhabitants of the Earth.

            <p>Thus then by the ſecond viſion is ſhewed what in heaven is ſealed in the hand of God, and what from thence is publiſhed to all the world; by the progreſs of the Goſpel; by the ſufferings of the Saints and their comforts; and by the Judgments befalling to the world for their hatred to the Goſpel: for their Idolatrie, and for their other ſins of Murder, witchcraft, fornication and theft: of which they repented not: and therefore the third wo is to bee brought upon them, when the ſeventh Angel ſhall ſound: for at the time of his ſounding,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36648:25"/>
there ſhall bee no time of forbearance of anie more; but the full myſterie, both of wrath againſt the wicked, and of Mercie to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſhall bee fulfilled towards the world, and towards the Church, both in heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>Here then to ſhew this the<note place="margin">Concerning the third viſion.</note> third and laſt viſion is given to the Prophet; which hee again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth on earth by the hand of the mightie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, which come's from heaven with the open book; and ſtand's both upon the Sea, and upon the earth where I obſerv</p>
            <p>Firſt for a Tranſlation from the two former to this laſt viſion; that as there are but three ſubſtantial differences of things<note place="margin">And wherefore the whole Book is to bee reduced to three viſions.</note> revealed to the Prophet: ſo there are but three ſubſtantial diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of places mentioned, where they are revealed, and three main changes in the frame of his Spirit in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. The firſt ſubſtantial matter of viſion is Chriſt's adminiſtration of his offices on earth amongſt his Churches. The ſecond is his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of his offices in Heaven, over all the world, to propagate and preſerv his Church. And the third is his adminiſtration both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, to make an end of all wickedneſs in the world, and to perfect the glorie and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his Church; each of theſe matters are ſhewed to the Prophet, in the places where they were chiefly to bee tranſlated; for to leav the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36648:25"/>
ſight of the firſt hee was on earth, as amongſt men: at the ſight of the ſecond, hee was in Heaven, as in the preſence of God, and of the Saints perfected, and of Angels. At the ſight of the third hee is on earth again; but ſo, as communicating ſtill with Heaven, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it back again, as one com down from thence, and having ſtill a relation to it. The frames of his ſpirit appear to mee diverſified ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably unto theſe matters and places. For in the firſt viſion hee is meerly paſſive, as a dead man to bee quickned. In the ſecond hee is Actively paſſive (as I may ſo ſay) that is, as one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the buſineſſes, which are tranſacted: hee is an inquiſitive obſerver of the paſſages thereof. And in the third hee is effectually emploied as a coagent, to help to fulfil the Myſterie of God by the ſpirit of Propheſie: and in each of theſe Manifeſtations Chriſt is repreſented to him, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to the adminiſtration which is revealed. In the firſt as a Man in dealing with men; in the ſecond, as a Lamb offered up to God in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God; and in the third, as a mightie Angel, in dealing with Satan and his Angels, and with the powers of darkneſs in the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the opening of the matter of this viſion, I obſerv,<note place="margin">And what the ſumme of the third viſion is.</note> that the ſumme of all is, to ſhew when and how the Myſterie of God, which hee bath ſpoken by the Prophets ſhould bee finiſhed; and to ſhew
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36648:26"/>
this. Firſt two means are uſed to lead <hi>John</hi> to the knowledg thereof: then ſecondly, the thing it ſelf is ſummarily related, by word of mouth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and afterward thirdly it is repreſented in ſeveral viſions. The means leading to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the finiſhing of the Myſterie, are two. Firſt, an open little Book inable's him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. Secondly, a Reed given him like unto a Rod, to meaſure the Temple, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and thoſe that worſhip therein.</p>
            <p>The ſummarie relation of the whole buſineſs by word of mouth, doth concern the time of the treading of the utter court under foot, the power of propheſing given to the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes during that time; the war which the Beaſt ſhall make with them while's they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and the iſſue of that war ſet forth in the circumſtances of their death and reſurrection; and that which immediately doth follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, both in earth and in Heaven. In earth, there was an earthquake which made the tenth part of the Citie to fall, and killed ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, and frighted the reſt. The ſecond wo doth paſs; and the ſeventh Angel doth ſound his Trumpet. In Heaven there is great joie and and thankſgiving offered unto God, becauſ hee hath taken the Kingdom to himſelf, and doth reign over the Kingdoms of the world, to give rewards unto his ſervants. <hi>chap.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the whole <hi>Series</hi> of matters concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Myſterie of God, hath been related in plain terms; to ſhew the things by which it

            <p>By <hi>the name of the Beaſt</hi> I underſtand, the names which for diſtinction's ſake, the falſ Prophets everie where take unto themſelvs, that they may thereby ſet up themſelvs to bee followed, and owned by their Diſeiples; which how this is practiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no man can bee ignorant of.</p>
            <p>And by <hi>the number of the beaſt's name,</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the partialitie of reckoning, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie of account, which the falſ Prophets oblige their followers to make of men, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their parties; for according to the relation which men are thought to have to this, or that faction and pattie; ſo they are eſteemed of, more or leſs, for that name's ſake where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are characterized, and under which they are numbered; nay, in theſe our unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fractions, by the zelots of parties it is reckoned upon, as a Dutie; not to account of anie man (let his worth bee otherwiſe what it will) further then as hee doth own them, and the name of their partie; and this I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe amongſt manie other things, included in the number 666. may bee repreſented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in reſpect that this number is nothing elſ, but a threefold repetition of it ſelf in units, in tenths and in hundreds: and cannot bee mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by anie ſquare root without a fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36648:33"/>
and in it ſelf ſix is but the half of twelv, which is the number of the Tribes of Iſraël; but upon theſe numerical Myſteries I love not to ſtand I ſhall therefore conclude with this one word; that all, who pretend to have a miſſion from the Lamb, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs his true Prophets; ſhould do well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine by theſe characters the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſtand, and the waies wherein they walk, leſt they miſtake themſelvs in their account of themſelvs and bee found in the end the Prophets of the Beaſt, and not of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As for the two Witneſſes,<note place="margin">The diſcoverie of the two witneſſes.</note> they are ſet forth as oppoſites unto the Beaſt, for it is ſaid, that <hi>the Beast doth make war with them. Chap.</hi> II. 7. their Character is, that they propheſie in Sackcloth as mourners, that their deſign is nothing elſ, but to bear witneſs unto Chriſt, by the manifeſtation of the Truth without humane Intereſts; and conſequently, that they ſtudie not by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, to ſet up themſelvs, or gain fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers who ſhould bee in ſubjection to them, and under their ſpiritual juriſdiction; nor do they applie themſelvs to the fancies of their hearers, to work ſom ſtrange impreſſions upon them, by raiſing them to the admiration of their Notions, of their Eloquence or parts; but ſpeaking the plain truth in love; a word of fire to melt the Conſcience of ſinners doth go
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36648:34"/>
out of their mouth, which doth ſlaie the wicked ſpirits, who ſet themſelvs againſt them, and according to their word, the Heavens are ſhut up in the daies of their Propheſie from ſending anie ſhewers of bleſſings upon men's ſouls; and the earthlie and outward eſtate of men is ſmitten with all manner of plagues, for not receiving the word of their teſtimonie, as <hi>Egypt</hi> was by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Theſe two Witneſſes are ſaid to bee the two Olive trees, and anointed ones, who ſtand before the God of all the Earth, <hi>Chapter</hi> II. <hi>verſ</hi> 4. which beeing compared with <hi>Zach. chap.</hi> 3. and 4. tel's us, who are meant by theſe two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: for there <hi>Jehoſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> are anointed, and eſtabliſhed to bring back the captivitie of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> which they were to do not by the might and power of men, but by the Spirit of the Lord, and the efficacie of his grace.</p>
            <p>The difference then of theſe two Witneſſes from the falſ Prophet is in this.<note place="margin">The compariſon of the falſ Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and of the two Witneſſes.</note> Firſt, that hee is but one who doth exerciſe a twofold power; that of the Beaſt, and that of his own deviſing, which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended one of Miracles; theſe are two whoſe teſtimonie is one and the ſame, and the effect thereof towards men, but one from them both. Secondly, that hee taketh upon him a Coërcive power; and to bring people under
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36648:34"/>
his yoke, hee ſet's up differential tokens, <hi>viz.</hi> the Beaſt's Image, his mark and name; but theſe make uſe of none other power, but of that which is properly prophetical; nor do they preſs anie diſtinct and particular notes of ſubjection to themſelvs upon anie coërcively; but have power onely to plague ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv not the Teſtimonie of Jeſus. Thirdly, hee doth work upon the ignorant imaginations of ſillie people, ſtrange impreſſions of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning the Divinitie of his own waie; by deceitful perſuaſions which are a kinde of witch-craft, whereby people are made to cleav unto his worldlie intereſt, as a ſlave unto the ſame; but theſe labor not to gain to themſelvs, the affections and fancies of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but to gain their underſtandings to the knowledg of the Truth, and their conſciences to the Subjection which is due to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus without partialitie. So then fourthly, the falſ Prophet in a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exalt's and ſeek's to ſet up himſelf in the ſpirits of men; but the two Witneſſes humble and denie themſelvs, that the Croſs of Chriſt may bee exalted over their ſpirits, and hee onelie ſet up in the hearts of men. Fifthly and laſtly, the falſ Prophet med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with State-matters, take's both the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie and Magiſtracie upon him, making the one ſubordinately to ſerv the other's turns, in reference to men; but the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes who are faithful Magiſtrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36648:35"/>
join their Teſtimonies in their places coordinately; to make out one waie of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and truth, to the conſciences of men, in reference to God in Chriſt. And this much concerning theſe.</p>
            <p>The third thing to bee ſpoken of; is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Whore, and of the Bride.</p>

            </p>
            <p>By the woman is underſtood the Romane Hierarchie, which hath born Rule over all the world, and rid in triumph upon the mindes of all men, as upon Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Her decking and raiment of purple, of Scarlet, of Gold, of precious ſtones, and of Pearls, is the outward viſible magnificence of that worſhip which ſhee ſet's up, which hath none other beautie, but ſuch ornaments to amuſe the Imaginations of fooliſh people, and bewitch them with the formalities of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>Her Fornications are the love of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, whereunto ſhee doth allure men to commit Whoredom with her: by the enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of power, of profit, and of pleaſures, which ſhee ſtudieth to furniſh her lovers withal, and to deprive other men off.</p>
            <p>Her abominations are all manner of ſinful, and unconſcionable practices which ſhee doth allow of in all who ſerv her ends thereby, whereof ſhee make's a trade, although they bee never ſo abhorrent from the light of Chriſtianitie, and of Nature; theſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the Idolatries which ſhee hath ſet up;

            <p>The Cup which is in her hand, whereby ſhee cauſeth all Nations to drink, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down theſe abominations; is her pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Autoritie, as the unerring Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power to binde and looſe all things in Heaven, and on Earth, in order to men's Conſciences; and to manage all the reaſons of State, and publick affairs of the world; with ſupreme Juriſdiction, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia.</hi> And the Fornication which the Kings of the Earth have committed with her, hath been their compliance and correſpondence with her, to make uſe of her power and influence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their neighbors and Subjects, to gain credit thereby unto themſelvs; together with the ſtudie of her Policies, to learn from her the maximes of deceit, which are the reaſons of State-advantages, to get power, by which means ſhee hath intelligence of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Princes, becauſ they are brought to drink them out of her Cup, and make uſe of her embraces and favors to bring them to paſs: and her whoriſh ſtudie is onely to keep

                     <p>The Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſ Prophet are three companions, and fellow-Commoners, who, from the beginning of the demutation (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the thirteenth chapter) have ſtuck cloſe one to another, and have been equally honored and worſhipped

                     <p>But the time here, when the Beaſt and the falſ Prophet ſhall bee caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, and the Dragon ſhall bee ſhut up in the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit, is called: <hi>That great daie of God Almightie:</hi> Above in the 11. ch. V. 18. at the ſound of the Trumpet of the ſeventh Angel, it is called <hi>the time of the dead, that they ſhould bee judged, and to give a reward, &amp;c.</hi> By the Prophets in the Old Teſtament, and by Chriſt and the Apoſtles in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is frequently called, <hi>that daie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to ſhew what properly is meant,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36648:103"/>
and underſtood by this <hi>great daie of God,</hi> would require a large and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar expoſition.</p>
                     <p>And becauſ the Holie Scripture, eſpecially the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St <hi>John,</hi> and the Prophets do not agree with the common opinion, uſual to prove, and to make out at large at this time, is contrarie to the ſcope and intention of this preſent Treatiſe; Therefore it is is thought expedient to defer it till another time.</p>
                     <p>Verſ 15. <hi>Behold, I com as a thief, Bleſſed is hee that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, leſt hee walk naked and ſee his ſhame.</hi>

                        <p>1.

                        <p>2. Secondly, becauſ by the diviſion of the old Romane Empire into two parts, in the three hundred ninetie fifth year, the Romane Eagle got two wings, and becauſ in the verie ſame year the Septentrional Barbarous Nations inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Romane Empire; whereby the

                           <hi>Woman</hi> (the Chriſtian Church) fled into the Wilderneſs, wherein ſhee ſhould bee preſerved and nouriſhed, during the ſpace of one thouſand two hundred ſixtie years, or 3½ times, chap. 12. verſ 6. till the 14.</p>

                        <p>4. Fourthly, becauſ by this invaſion, the <hi>Beaſt with ten horns roſe up out of the Sea:</hi> That is: becauſ by this war, which began in the three hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fifth year, the Romane Empire was by little and little ſo divided, that in the four hundred third year alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſom horns, and in the four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fiftie fifth year fully ten horns, or Kingdoms appeared in it.</p>
                        <p>5. All the Hiſtorians generally do agree, that the ruine of the Romane Empire did begin in the three hundred

That the Antichriſt ſhould then com, when the Romane Empire ſhould begin to fall. As wee read in <hi>Tertulliano in Apologetico c.</hi> 32. <hi>Item de reſurrect. carnis.

The <hi>Beast with two horns,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> came out of the Earth quietly, about the time of the three hundred ninetie fifth year, <hi>Revelations</hi> 13. verſ 11. when hee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated unto himſelf the Primacie and preeminencie, over the Eccleſiaſtical

                           <hi>By the words in caſe the Chriſtians in the ſeventh year ſhall not draw their ſwords, &amp;c.</hi> is ſignified, that under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Emperor, namely <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third, who <hi>Anno</hi> 1595. came to the Imperial Crown, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhall bee in danger.

alſo obteined at firſt the victorie neer <hi>Erla;</hi> where the Turkiſh Emperor, and <hi>Ibrahim Baſſa</hi> were put to flight, and if the Chriſtians had not neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their opportunitie, by plundering and dividing the ſpoil, in the Turkiſh Camp; then this Propheſie might have been accompliſhed. Wherefore it ſhall com to paſs under this childe, <hi>as beeing the twelfth,</hi> whereof wee ſhall know the certaintie by the event.</p>
                        <p>Now ſeeing theſe two Propheſies may bee verie well applied to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I could not but relate them here, eſpecially, becauſ the Turks do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſame very often, with great trouble and lamentations, and men of note do put much weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as things of great moment. But wee ſhall leav them for what they are, becauſ none can ſee upon what grounds, theſe and ſuch like Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies are built.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the motives and reaſons, which lead to a conjecture, that the time
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36648:118"/>
which God hath determined, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to the rage and furie of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church, is now running to an end with the one thouſand ſix hundred fiftie fifth year of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>Whereby it doth evidently appear:</p>
                        <p>1. That the application of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, at the beginning of the two numbers of years (one thouſand two hundred ninetie and one thouſand two hundred ſixtie, is punctually and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie force incident to the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixtie fifth, and three hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fifth year of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>2. That the beginning of the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred ninetie years cannot bee applied to anie other year, neither before nor after, then the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixtie fifth year of our Lord, in which the foundation of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroied by God himſelf: As it appeareth in <hi>Clavi Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. That when the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the one thouſand two hundred ninetie years is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36648:119"/>
referred to the three hundred ſixtie fifth year of our Lord, the one thouſand two hundred ſixtie years muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie begin from the one thouſand three hundred ninetie fifth year, becauſ both numbers muſt together run to an end, as may bee read in <hi>Daniel</hi> chap. 12. v. 7. and 11.</p>
                        <p>4. That the Characters and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments formerly alleged do ſufficiently prove, that the one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixtie years muſt begin in the three hundred ninetie fifth year.</p>
                        <p>5. That the <hi>Beast with ten horns is riſen up</hi> from the three hundred ninetie fifth until the four hundred fiftie fifth year. Becauſ <hi>Anno</hi> 395. the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Romane Empire hapned, whereby the Beaſt got two horns, and in the year four hundred fiftie five all the ten horns in the Beaſt appeared.</p>
                        <p>6. That in the Romane Hiſtories, not anie year betwixt the three hundred ninetie fifth, and four hundred fiftie fifth year of our Lord can bee found
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:36648:119"/>
out, where the Characters may bee ſo punctually and ſuitably applied, as to the three hundred ninetie fifth year.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore wee have good reaſon to ſtand to the three hundred ninetie fifth year, and to exſpect the iſſue with the one thouſand ſix hundred fiftie fifth year of our Lord; eſpecially, becauſ the killing of the two Witneſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, doth eventually prove the thing.</p>

                        <p>For the <hi>Revelation</hi> is a book of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Acts. Wherein is foretold, how, and what things ſhall befal to the Church of God, and to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, under which the Church doth ſubſiſt; Now manie things have
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:36648:122"/>

                        <p>But why manie learned men of note (wee do not ſpeak of all) have been much miſtaken in their expoſitions; The cauſes amongſt others have been theſe.</p>
                        <p>1. That the antient Interpreters in the primitive times have applied to their times, manie things, which yet as then had no relation to them. The Modern Interpreters do follow their ſteps, (not minding ſo much the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, as the Autoritie of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereby they lead themſelvs and others out of the waie.</p>
                        <p>2. Secondly, the Method and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is not obſerved. In the <hi>Revelation</hi> all things are ſet down in good order, what from time to time ſhould com to paſs, the Synchroniſmes or concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies of times are ſet down, one after another, and the Revolutions and changes in the Eccleſiaſtical and civil States, are exactly and punctually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed; even as an excellent and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:36648:123"/>
well-verſed Hiſtorian is wont to do in the deſcription of humane actions; but contrarie to all this the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do pervert, overturn, and diſturb the Method, ſeek and finde out by-waies of error the things as <hi>relata</hi> belong to one and the ſame time, they ſet down as following one another. What ſhall com to paſs after the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they do place before it, oftentimes not knowing themſelvs, where they ſtick, or how they ſhall winde themſelvs out.</p>
                        <p>3. Beſides they miſtake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the States one with another, not obſerving where mention is made of the Eccleſiaſtical, or civil State; ſo that manie times they applie Monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal matters, and the actions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, to that which in the <hi>Revelation</hi> is ſpoken of the civil State. And hence it is, that the more one doth read Expoſitors, the more one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
                        <p>But that therefore the <hi>Revelation</hi>
