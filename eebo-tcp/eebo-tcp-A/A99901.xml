            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance their imaginations, they that haue vvrit Fables are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vvith the reſte: for they haue not onely vvonderfully delighted the harts of men, but alſo haue more allured them to doe thinges both good and profitable vvith their Fables, than Philoſophers vvith their preceptes. For they vvith ſuche a ſvveet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe do ſo pierce the hartes of the Readers, and by ſimilitudes do declare (vvhich are of muche force to moue affection) vvhat me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to take, and vvhat to refuſe, that thereby they are compelled, againſt their vvils to agree vnto them. For the minde is diſdaynfull to heare, neyther vvill it eaſely abyde things profitable and honeſt, excepte they be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vvith ſome merry ieſte. Hereunto beareth vvitneſſe a certein Orator of <hi>Athens,</hi> vvho on a tyme ſpeaking to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> vvhen he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued them leſſe attentiue, required them that they vvoulde vouchſafe to heare a Fable: they vvere contented: then he began thus: Ceres, the Svvallovve and the Egle ſometyme iorneyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, vvhen they vvere come to a riuer, the
<pb facs="tcp:23511:3"/>
Svvallovve flue ouer, and the Eele ſvvam through the ryuer: vvhen he had ſo ſaide he helde his peace: then they asked him vvhat Ceres did? Your Gods (quod he) are offended at you vvhich vvil not hear them that counſell you for your profit, but if they tell any tales yee heare them vvillingly. VVhat force fables are of to moue affection, I coulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by many examples, yet vvill I propound but three. The inhabitants of <hi>Samos</hi> vvould haue put their ruler to death, vvhome <hi>Aeſope</hi> diſſuaded, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: As a Fox paſſed ouer a riuer he vvas driuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ditche vvhere he ſtucke faſt in the mudde, that he could not eſcape, vvhome the Flies ſtinged, the hedgehog ſeing him ther, moued vvith compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, asked him if he shoulde driue the Flies from him. No (quod he) for theſe are full vvith my bloud and can litle trouble me, but if thou shouldeſt driue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> avvay, other hunger ſterued flies vvil occupie their romes, and ſuck out al the bloud that is lefte vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me. The like shall happen to you O <hi>Samians,</hi> for if ye ſlay your Ruler vvhich is ſo vvealthie, ye muſt needs choſe others, vvhich vvhiles they enriche the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, shall poll you of all that this man hath lefte: vvherevvithall the <hi>Samians</hi> being moued, lefte off their purpoſe. By the like meanes vvas <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> perſuaded, vvhen he appointed for euery day Magiſtrates, vvherevppon (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> telleth) the countrie of <hi>Jurie</hi> vvas gouerned by <hi>Cratus</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus</hi> onely by the ſpace of tvventie yeares. For
<pb facs="tcp:23511:3"/>
(as <hi>Statius</hi> ſayth) hee that ruleth but a litle vvhile, shevveth ſmall fauour to the people. The <hi>Himeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſometime minded to chooſe Captaine of their armie, <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> vvhom <hi>Steſichorus</hi> the Poet vvith this Fable diſcouraged from their purpoſe, ſaying. A horſe fed alone in a medovve, at length came a Harte thither and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it: vvhervpon the horſe toke the aduiſe of man, by vvhat meane he might be reuenged, to vvhome the man ſayde: If thou vvilt take a bit in thy mouth and ſuffer me armed to get vpon thy backe, vvhoſe counſel he follovved, and by his helpe put the harte to flight and became the conquerer, but from that time forth he could not rid his mouth from the bit nor the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his backe. Euen ſo (ſayde <hi>Steſicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) the like shall happen to you, if ye choſe <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> your captaine, for your enimies ye shall ſubdue but ye shal be in bondage to this Tyraunt for euer: vvith vvhich vvordes the <hi>Himerians</hi> being diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, forſoke the counſel to choſe ſuch a captaine. VVhat time the people of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeparated them ſelues from the Senators, bicauſe they payd tribute and vvere combred vvith vvarfares, did not <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa Minenius</hi> turne them from their purpoſe vvith this fable? Sometime (quoth he) ye <hi>Romaines,</hi> the members of man perceiuing the belly to be ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, fell at variance vvith hir &amp; determined to giue her no longer any ſuccor. It happened, that bicauſe they denied her nourishment, they became faynt,
<pb facs="tcp:23511:4"/>
vvhervpon they vver at one again. In like maner the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> are as the belly and members, vvhich neede one of anothers helpe, and as by diſcord they perishe, ſo by concord they are of ſtrength: By vvhich tale the people turned from their purpoſe and became friends againe vvith the Senate. Therfore not vvithout good cauſe both the Greeke and Latin Poets, as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> haue mingled ſuche Fables amongſt their vvorkes, and alſo the chiefeſt and famous Philoſophers, as <hi>Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Plutarche,</hi> vvith many moe, haue highly commended them, vvhoſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvas, that they much auayled to the inſtruction of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ciuill life: vvherfore <hi>Leouicenus</hi> and <hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Wolfe, the Foxe, and the Aſſe ſometime iournied togither towards <hi>Rome,</hi> to obtayne remiſſion of their ſinnes: In the way (bycauſe they thought the Pope would be otherwiſe occupied, that he might not intende them) they agréed to be ſhriuen one of an other, and to ſuffer penance at their diſcretion. The Wolfe therefore made hys confeſſion to the Foxe in this maner: That he ſaw a Sow which had .xij. Pigges, the which walked alone in the fields, walowing in fatnes, and ſuffred hir Pigges at home to ſtarue: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deuoured the ſow, bicauſe of hir heinous offence in forſaking hir yong ones: and after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued to pitie, he killed alſo the pigs, to rid them out of their paine, and ate them vp: This he tolde with teares, deſiring to knowe what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he ſhould do therefore. In fayth (quod the Foxe) thy fault is not great, ſay once a <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and then thou ſhalt be pardoned.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman had a Cocke of the game, which bet and vanquiſhed al other cocks néere about, who with

his ſhrill crowing, troubled in euery quarter, not onely the hole, but alſo the ſicke perſons, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe which hadde the headake, whoſe pride I could not well away with: as I founde him therefore on a time abroade with the hens, I caught him, and caried him away to my hole, where I deuoured him: for whiche déede the Hens kackled againſt me, and troubled me with their crying: I therefore to reuenge the iniurie done vnto me, tore many of them in péeces and ate them: herein I confeſſe that I offended, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I require pardon. Herevnto the Wolfe ſayd: Thou diddeſt wel in qualifying the noyſe and pride of the Cocke and Hens, and therefore it is but a ſmall fault, yet will I ioyne thée this penance, That the thrée frydaies following thou eate no fleſhe, if thou canſt get none: for I will ſhew thée as much fauour as thou diddeſt to me. Wel now Syr ſaid they to the Aſſe, let vs heare thy confeſſion, who beganne thus: My moyling and drudging which I endure, is not vnknowen to you my Lords, as in carying of corne ſackes, ſtone, woode and water, yet once I offended, whereof I repente me full ofte: For a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of my Lordes, appoynted ruler ouer me, béeing once a colde, a ſtrawe appeared oute of hys ſhoo, which I ſnatched away from hym, whereby he tooke greate harme and colde of his

                        </gap>che,</hi> where they determined to ſéeke fitte logding for their purpoſe. The Spider tooke little héede but turned into the houſe of an excéeding ryche man, where on euery ſide he ſette vp his ſtreamers. Then were ſtraight at hande, thoſe like Diuels in a play, which caſt downe his webbes, and as faſte as he ſet them vp in any part of the houſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23511:11"/>
they were ſwept downe: he could not worke ſo cloſely, but it was founde out: ſuche was his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, that in a houſe of ſo muche wealth and abundaunce, he onely wanted and was thruſt downe. But the Goute wente lyke a begger, (which cauſed him to be the longer without lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging) at length he gotte him to the cottage of a poore man, where when he had laide him downe to reſt, it is not to be tolde what miſerie he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured: his ſupper was coorſe bread, and a Cup of colde water to drinke, when he was dry: his bed to reſt his wéerie bones vppon, was a harde boorde ſtrewed without either boughs or graſſe, but thinly with a little ſtrawe. I néed not ſhew, howe ill agréed ſo harde a bedde and ſo rude an hoſte, to ſo tender limbes, and to his ſkin as ſoft as ſilke. When the day ſtarre was ſcarſe riſen, the Goute and the Spider mette agayne. Then the Spider firſt declared his nightes ill reſt, and how oft he ſhifted his place: ſometime vpbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Maiſter with too muche niceneſſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with the double diligence of the ſwéepers. Ah (quod the Goute) the pouertie of mine hoſte is incredible: for if I had leiſure, I could ſhewe thée ſpottes blacke and blew, that my bedde as hard as the Adamant, hath imprinted in my ſoft ſkin. Then they tooke counſel thus once agayne, That the Spider ſhould goe to the poore mans
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23511:11"/>
cottage, and the Goute to the riche mans houſe, where vnto they bothe agréed. When it waxed darke, they came néere to a Citie, and the Goute remembring well his appoyntment, faire and ſoftely went into an excéeding rich mans houſe, where he hid him ſelfe: whom when the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had ſcarſe ſéene, Ieſu God with what harty good wil, what kindneſſe, and with what names dyd he entertayne him: ſtrayghtway he was layde vppon beds of Doune, his bolſters ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with ſoft Partrich feathers. I wil not ſpeake of the wines, as ſwéete and darke wines, wines of <hi>Leſbus</hi> and <hi>Campania,</hi> birdes that féede on grapes, Pheſants, and party coloured birdes: to conclude, there was no kinde of pleaſure that his fantaſie lacked. The Spider wente into a poore mans cottage and began his webs on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, from wall to wall he hanged them vp, he followed his buſineſſe with hande and féete, he brake it downe and ſet it vp agayne, and that he began he ended: and to tell you at a worde, he was Lorde and King alone, crafte and polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie he feared none, for his buylding was ſo high, that he was without the reache of a broome. Not long after the Goute ſpake with the Spider, to whom he magnified his pleſures, his happineſſe and riches: The Spider likewiſe wonderfully prayſed his kingdome and libertie in buylding:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23511:12"/>
They concluded therefore, that whyther ſo euer they iorneyed, the Goute ſhould lodge at the rich mans houſe, and the Spider at the poore mans cottage.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:23511:74"/>
were in a miſerable bondage, bicauſe it was impoſſible to pleaſe euery one, ſéeing they are of ſundry iudgements. To which opinion one tolde, that there was an olde man which went to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kette, with his ſonne to ſell an Aſſe, whiche he draue vnladen before him. As he paſſed on his way, there were men labouring by in the fields, which blamed the olde man, bicauſe that neyther he nor his ſonne did ride on the Aſſe which went emptie, ſéeing the one for his age, the other for his infancie had néede to be caryed. Then the old man ſette his ſonne on the Aſſe, and himſelfe went by on foote, which thing other ſéeing, ſayde that he doted for letting his ſonne ryde whiche was ſtronger, and he being olde woulde followe on foote: forthwith he chaunged his minde, and ſette off his ſonne, and ridde him ſelfe. When he hadde ridden a little further, other mette hym, who blamed him, that he hadde no regarde to the age of his little ſonne, but would let him followe him as a drudge, and him ſelfe being his Father, did ride on the Aſſe: wherwith he being moued, ſette his ſonne alſo on the Aſſe. Not long after he was aſked by other, whoſe the Aſſe was: Mary (quod hée) it is mine: then they rebuked hym that he had no pitie on his poore Aſſe, but to ſette two on him, ſéeing one was ſufficient.
