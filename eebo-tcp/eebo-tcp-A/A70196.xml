            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>This uſeful Manual which hath been ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, now offers it ſelf to your hands, the Engliſh Iliads in a nut-ſhel, being comprized in ſuch an Epitomy and Abridgement; yet with ſo much perſpicuity, faithfulneſs and truth, as would be allowance enough for a reaſonable volumn.</p>
            <p>Even ſame ſmall and minute actions, where (like little wires that give motion to the grand Engine) they had to the main deſign, are here regiſtred, with a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Chronology of their time; but as to paſſages of greater moment, the actions of the Field, Leagures, Stratagems, ſtorming of Towns and Caſtles, they have roomy place here, without that buſtle they made in the Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And that the memory of thoſe Noble and Valiant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who fell, and who ſurvived this fatal War, might be orderly tranſmitted to poſterity, we have alſo inſerted them in their ſeveral ſtations of Command, Life and Death, the irreparable loſs of whom fell chiefly on the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and juſteſt ſide.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55447:3"/>
            <p>Abundance of Engliſh blood hath been ſhed profuſely in ſeveral Quarrels, both at home and abroad before, but never ſuch a ſlaughter as this, ſo that it paſſeth eaſie Arithmetick, which cauſeth that the groſs of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſlain, is as much (of the multitude) as could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>But behold the greateſt miſery of this War, the iſſue of it when it was paſt, was ten times worſe then the War it ſelf, like the Viper, that expires in the production of many: The Meduſa of War, brought forth a Hydra of Peace, in a Serpentine Commonwealth, and Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Anarchy, we had loſt what was pretended to be fought for, as ſoon as we had done fighting: ſuch our fury, ſuch our ſtrange fate.</p>
            <p>This obliged the Collector of this Chronicle to proceed in the tracing of thoſe (till then) untrodden ſteps of Government, through all the changes and variations during the Uſurpation; wherein you ſhall finde all the moſt conſiderable paſſages and remarks of State, of the War and Treaties abroad with Forreign Princes and Commonwealths, particularly ſet down, ſo conform to the Originals, that herein you will have the pleaſure to ſee all over again, which with ſorrow you ſo lately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, with the happy reſtitution of His Majeſtic, and other paſſages deduced to this preſent day.</p>

            <p>Theſe conceived abuſes in the menage of the State, like ill Humors, where they finde an equal reſiſtance, or over power of Nature, ſunck and deſcended upon the Eccleſiaſtical regiment too impotent to ſuſtain thoſe general aſſaults which were given it. The firſt complaint of the people was male-adminiſtration and delinquency of ſome about the King; this terrified but a few, though it reached the life of that incomparable Stateſman the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> ſome others dreading more the popular fury then their objected crimes, withdrawing and abſenting themſelves from the preſent ſtorm impending.</p>

               </gap> will be ſeen in the ſeries of our late unhappy troubles.</p>
            <p>When this fatal buſineſs was over, then began the cry, <hi>No Biſhops, no Biſhops,</hi> who were at laſt by an Act of Parliament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from the King devoyded and barred from ſitting and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Houſe of Lords, or exerciſing any remporal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; to this the Parliament were the better induced, and the more ſtrongly inclined from ſeveral complaints made to them, which were before famous through the Nation, of their haid and barbarous uſage of ſeveral Miniſters and others, for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of non-conformancy: Amongſt the reſt the caſe of Mr.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55447:4"/>
               <hi>Pryn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Baſtick</hi> were very notorious.

            <p>Many honeſt Patriots there were no doubt of that party which inclined to the clipping and abridging the power of the Hierarchy which they ſo unhappily miſtook, the importunities of the people made others, otherwiſe principled to ſwim with the ſtream; but no ſooner this Fit was over, but we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eiſed all over with the diſeaſe of a Civil War.</p>
            <p>The King had been ſo affronted with the daily tumults which thoſe for Juſtice againſt <hi>Straford,</hi> and <hi>No Biſhops</hi> brought with them, &amp; had ſo often moved for the prevention and remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in vain, that having certain intelligence who the Grandees were that abetted thoſe riotous Aſſemblies, and alſo had had a hand in the Scorch Troubles, whoſe untoward iſſue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion lay heavy upon his heart, he reſolved to ſeiſe them in the Parliament-houſe, and ſo bring them to a ſpeedy Trial.</p>
            <p>This was attempted by the King, but the birds were flown, notice being given the Houſe of Common by one <hi>Langriſh,</hi> a Servant of the Queens, of the Kings coming thither to demand the Five Members: But the buſineſs ended not ſo, the Houſe vote it a breach of priviledge, and complain o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This added fuel to the fire, that was now ready to flame; nor could another combuſtion in the ſiſter Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which broke forth in <hi>October</hi> ſome two moneths before give them caution to look to this at home.</p>

               <p>ON the 23. day of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. that horrid Rebellion broke forth there, that day they intended to ſeize the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Iriſh being every where elſe riſen and in arms, but the deſign was diſcovered by one <hi>Owen Conally,</hi> an Iriſh Gentleman by birth and family, but a retainer to Sir <hi>Iohn Clotworthy,</hi> who being acquainted with the plot by one of the Rebells leaping over a ſet of pales, whether he pretended to go and eaſe himſelf, eſcaped by the favour of a dark night, ran away, and informed the Lord Juſtice <hi>Parſons</hi> with the whole deſign.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall be very little heard of any body elſe, I ſhall therefore ſpeak a word to you here: Indeed I could have held my peace very well, if I did not think, that holding my peace, would make ſom men think, that I did ſubmit to the Guilt, as well as to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But I think it is my duty to God firſt, and then to my Country, to clear my ſelf, both as an honeſt man, a good King, and a good Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Shall begin firſt, with my</hi> Innocency; <hi>and, in tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ath, I think it not very needful for me to inſiſt long upon this: For all the world knows, that I did never begin a</hi> War <hi>with the</hi> two Houſes of Parliament; <hi>and I</hi> call God to witneſs, <hi>unto whom I muſt ſhortly make an account, that I did never intend to incroach upon their</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges: <hi>They began upon me; it is the</hi> Militia <hi>they began upon: They confeſs the</hi> Militia <hi>was mine, but they thought it fit to have it from me. And to be ſhort, if any body will look to the dates of Commiſſions, of their Commiſſions and mine, and likewiſe to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will ſee clearly, that they began theſe unhappy</hi> Troubles, <hi>not I. So as far the guilt of theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes that are laid againſt me, I hope that God will clear me out. I will not (for I am in charity) and God forbid that I ſhould, lay it upon the</hi> two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, <hi>there is no neceſſity of either, I hope
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55447:20"/>they are free of this guilt; but I believe, that ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments between them and me, have been the chief cauſe of all this blood-ſhed: So that as I find my ſelf clear of this, I hope (and pray God) that they may too; Yet for all this, God forbid, that I ſhould be ſo ill a Chriſtian, as not to ſay, that Gods Judgements are juſt upon me: Many times he doth pay Juſtice by an unjuſt Sentence, that is ordinary: I will only ſay this,</hi> That unjuſt Sentence that I ſuffered to take effect, is puniſhed by an unjuſt Sentence upon me. <hi>So far I have ſaid, to ſhew you,</hi> that I am an innocent man: <hi>Now to ſhew you,</hi> that I am a good Chriſtian; <hi>I hope there is a good man that will bear me witneſs, that I have forgiven all the world, and even thoſe in particular, that have been the chief cauſers of my death: Who they are, God knows, I do not deſire to know, I pray God forgive them. But this is not all, my charity muſt go further, I wiſh that they may repent, for indeed they have committed a great ſin in that particular; I pray God with</hi> S Stephen, that this be not laid to their charge: <hi>And withall, that they may take the right way to the peace of the Kingdome; for my charity commands me, not only to forgive particular men, but to endeavour to the laſt gaſp, the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So (Sirs) I do wiſh with all my ſoul: (I ſee there are ſome here that will carry it further:) that they endeavour the peace of the Kingdome. (Sirs) I muſt ſhew you, both how you are out of the way, and put you in a way. Firſt, you are out of the way, for certainly all the wayes you ever had yet, as far as I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conqueſts: Certainly this is an ill way for Conqueſt, in my Opinion, is never juſt, except there he a juſt and good cauſe, either for matter of wrong, or a juſt title; and then if ye go beyond the firſt quarrel
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55447:20"/>that ye have: that makes it unjuſt at the end, that was juſt at firſt: for if there be only matter of Conqueſt, then it is a great robbery; as a Pyrate ſaid to</hi> Alexander, That he was the great Robber himſelf, himſelf was but a petty Robber. <hi>And ſo, Sirs, I do think, for the way that you are in, you are much out of the way: Now, Sirs, to put you in the way, believe it you will never go right, nor God will never proſper you, until you give God his due, the King his due (that is, my Succeſſor) and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their due; I am as much for them as any of you. You muſt give God his due, by regulating rightly his Church, according to the Scripture, (which is now out of order.) and to ſet you in a way particularly, now I cannot; but only this, A National Synod freely called, freely deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among themſelves, muſt ſettle this: When every Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is freely and clearly heard. For the King, indeed I will not, the Laws of the Land will clearly inſtruct you for that; therefore becauſe it concerns mine own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I only give you a touch of it. For the People, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I deſire their liberty and freedome as much as any body whomſoever: But I muſt tell you, that their liberty and their freedome conſiſt in having Government under thoſe Laws, by which their lives and theirs may be moſt their own; it is not in having a ſhare in the Government, that is nothing pertaining to them: A Subject and a Soveraign are clean different things; and therefore until you do that, I mean, that you put the people into that liberty, as I ſay, certainly they will never enjoy themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sirs, it was for this that now I am hither come, for if I would have given way to an arbitrary way, for to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I need not have come here; and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge) that I am the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55447:21"/>Martyr of the people. Introath Sirs, I ſhall not hold you any longer, I will only ſay this to you, that I could have deſired ſome little time longer, becauſe I would have put this, what I have ſaid, in a little better order, and have had it a little better digeſted then I have done; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope you will excuſe me; I have delivered my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, I pray God you take thoſe courſes, that are beſt for the good of the Kingdome, and your own Salvation.</hi>

               <p>Now the King and his company being departed, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a Woodbill into his hand, went out with <hi>Richard</hi> into the adjoyning wood, called <hi>Spring Coppice.

You muſt note here, that theſe Brothers had taken into their aſſiſtance one <hi>Frances Yates,</hi> their Siſters Husband, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with the King in the wood, they being by profeſſion wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutters: But the King had not been an hour in the wood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a party of horſe, in purſuit of him, was come to <hi>White-Ladies,</hi> and had enquired, and ſound out by ſome of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, that the King with a party had been there, as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but they affirmed directly, that he was gone away with all ſpeed from thence in the ſaid company Northwards. Upon which words, ſpurr'd on by the expectat on &amp; greedineſs of their prey, ſuppoſing the King and his Lords were all together, they made no ſtay, or further inquiſition or ſearch (ſave only in the houſe) and rode away as faſt as they could poſſible.

               <p>This Thurſday the King continued all day in the wood, upon the ground, <hi>Richard Pendrill</hi> being conſtantly with him, and ſometimes the other three: It proved to be a very rainy day, and the King was wet with the ſhowers; thereupon <hi>Francis Yates</hi> his wife came into the wood, on whom the King at firſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55447:24"/>lookt ſomething dubiouſly, yet reſolutely askt her, whether ſhe could be faithful to a diſtreſſed Cavalier: To which ſhe reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sir, I will die rather then diſcover you: She brought with her a blanket to keep the King dry, and his firſt meat he eat there, <hi>viz.</hi> a meſs of milk, eggs, and ſugar, in a black earthen cup, which the King gueſſed to be milk and apples, and ſaid he loved it very well. After he had drank ſome, and eat ſome in a Pewter ſpoon, he gave the reſt to <hi>George,</hi> and bid him eat it, for it was very good. There was nothing of moment paſſed this day in Court, but only his Majeſty exchanged his Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill for <hi>Francis Yates</hi> his Broom-hook, being ſomething lighter.</p>
               <p>The King was hardly brought to faſhion himſelf to their gate, or to bend his ſtreight body down to his feet, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in his ſtay and paſſing to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he could tune pretty well; moſt of the day was ſpent in conforming him to their words, till about five a clock that evening, the King with his gallant Retinue of <hi>Richard, Humphry, George,</hi> and <hi>Francis Yates,</hi> left the wood, and betook himſelf to <hi>Richards</hi> little houſe, where he went under the name of <hi>William Iones,</hi> a Woodcutter, newly come thither for work. At his coming, the good wife for his entertainment at ſupper, was preparing a Fricaſs of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con and Eggs, and while that was doing, the King held on his knees their Daughter <hi>Nan:</hi> He eat very little, ruminating and pauſing on his intended paſſage into <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſupper ended, the Mother of the <hi>Pendrills</hi> came and kneeled, and took her leave of the King; ſo did the reſt of his poor mean attendants, only <hi>Richard</hi> went along with the King, to conduct and guide him, it being then dark, and the way troubleſome.</p>
               <p>Their intended journey was to Mr. <hi>Wolfes</hi> of <hi>Madely,</hi> ſome 5 miles diſtant from <hi>White-Ladies,</hi> of whom the King had a good character from his ſervant <hi>Richard.</hi> By the way they were put to a fright at a Mill-water, by a Miller that had taken into his protection ſome of the ſame undone party, ſo that <hi>Richard</hi> was forced to wade through, and the King to follow him by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was late at night before they got to <hi>Madely;</hi> wherefore <hi>Richard</hi> very confidently knockt at Mr. <hi>Wolfes</hi> door, which his Daughter opening, he deſired to be let in, telling her the King was with him: So they both entred, till Mr. <hi>Wolfe</hi> came and welcomed the King, who though wearied, and his feet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55447:25"/>ſore, yet held it not convenient (of which Opinion Mr. <hi>Wolfe</hi> was alſo) to lodge in the houſe. Here he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (which was his main buſineſs) that there was no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to be had over <hi>Severn</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> the river being ſo guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and watched, that there was no attempting of it without extreme hazard and peril. After ſome other diſcourſes of the like tendency, the King was conveyed to an Heyloft, where he and <hi>Richard</hi> repoſed themſelves (though the Kings ſore feet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much troubled him) that night, and next day, being Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and on that night, the ſame hour they arrived, they ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Boſcabell,</hi> having had proviſion, and ſome money from the ſaid Mr. <hi>Wolfe,</hi> his Daughter alſo bringing the King into his way ſome two miles, and then ſhe returned.</p>
               <p>At his coming to <hi>Boſcabell,</hi> the King was ſo wearied, his feer being bliſtered with travelling in ſuch courſe and ſtiff accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he had on his legs, and lying in them, that he was ſcarce able to ſtand or go, which <hi>Will.</hi> wife perceiving, ſhe ſtript off his ſtockings, and cut the bliſters, and waſhed his feet, which gave the King ſome eaſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame time Colonel <hi>Carelos,</hi> one that made good the Kings Rear at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and gave the King time to eſcape, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen the laſt man killed in that lamentable fight, was alſo come to <hi>Boſcabell,</hi> a refuge he had uſed before, where the King met him, the Colonel moſt humbly and joyfully welcoming him to that moſt ſure retreat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After a ſhort conference together, it was judged by them both, as the probableſt means of ſecurity, that the King ſhould betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again to the wood: Accordingly, Saturday the ſixth of</hi> Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>in the morning, they went into the wood together, the Colonel leading the way to that ſo much now celebrated Oak, where before he had been lodged himſelf:</hi> William Pendrill <hi>brought a Ladder, by which they got up into the boughs and branches of the tree, which were very thick, and well ſpread, and full of leaves, ſo that it was not poſſible for any to ſee through them.</hi>

               <p>All preparations were therefore made by the <hi>Hollander,</hi> to recover not only their credit, but their livelihood and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which was to drive the Engliſh from the coaſt; and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Van-Trump</hi> having fitted himſelf with the choice of his Country, both for men and ſhips, reſolved for to effect it; whereupon on the ſecond of <hi>Iuly</hi> he ſailed from the <hi>Weylings,</hi> and ſoon after joyned with a Fleet from the <hi>Texel,</hi> at the ſight of which Fleets the Engliſh weighed, and on the 23 in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, part of the Engliſh under General <hi>Monk,</hi> then Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, charged through them; the next day the whole Fleet came up, but being bluſtrous weather could not ingage, but on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday both Fleets fell to it, and made an end, the Dutch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſted, and miſerably ſhattered, thirty ſix ſhips taken, burnt, and ſunk, the reſt eſcaping into the <hi>Texel,</hi> from whence were lately ſome of them equipped.</p>

               <p>Being alſo now proclaimed by his Councel, with the ſtile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, endeavours were uſed every where to countenance it with Addreſſes, but the main one, was the invitation of the City for him to dine at <hi>Grocers Hall,</hi> which they ſumptuouſly

               <p>But what honour was loſt here, was ſomething compenſated
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55447:31"/>by the valour of General <hi>Blake,</hi> who at the ſame time that this Fleet went for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> was ſent with another into the <hi>Straits</hi> to repreſs the violence of the Pyrates of <hi>Algiers,</hi> who had ſo infeſted thoſe Seas, that commerce was not free for any Nation: Therefore having anchored before <hi>Algiers,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſtitution, and had a civil anſwer, from thence to his ſatisfaction; thence he arrived at <hi>Tunis,</hi> demanding as before; to which the Dye or Vice-King returned anſwer, that there were the Caſtles and Ships of the Grand Seignior, that he might do his worſt, they were not to be ſcared with his Fleet: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Councel of War being called, it was reſolved, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque the Caſtles and Port of <hi>Ferino,</hi> wherein lay nine Frigats of War, and to burn them, which accordingly, and in deſpight of all their Ordnance and Caſtles they effected, with a very ſmall loſs: The news hereof was carried to the Grand Seignior, to the glory of the Engliſh Nation.</p>
               <p>About this time a maſſacre was committed in <hi>Piedmont</hi> on the Proteſtants there (many ſay not for Religion, but Rebell on) and vaſt ſums of money were raiſed by a Declaration of the Protectors, reſenting their miſerable eſtate, moſt part of which came into his own purſe at the Concluſion; yet while he was taking money in one hand for the Chriſtians accompt, he had another open for the Jewiſh, who about this time had offered large ſums for their readmiſtion into this Kingdome, this could not be done without an odium, and yet the Protector kept what he had in hand as earneſt from them.</p>
               <p>The next deſign was a Turkiſh one, having erected the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and power of Major Generals, equal to Baſhaws, for the ſeveral Counties, but they being upſtarts, and ſomething eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his own entire greatneſs, he ſoon after laid them aſide, (but never totally abrogated them) having made uſe of them to levy his new extortion of Decimation.</p>

                  </gap> Government, by which he was to declare his Succeſſor, was by his Fathers Councel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Lord Protector of theſe three Nations, with the uſual ſolemnities, and accordingly owned by ſeveral addreſſes from moſt parts of the Kingdome, but drawn and ſubſcribed by ſome particular perſons of the times, who obtruded them upon the reſt. He was courted alſo by the French, Swediſh, Dutch Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, who all condoled him for his Fathers death.</p>
               <p>After a little reſpit of time, <hi>Richard</hi> was adviſed to call a Parliament, the Courtiers thinking, that what with the Army and the Lawyers, they ſhould make their party good for the Protector in the Houſe of Commons, being ſure of their other Houſe of Peers, and in the mean time took care for his Fathers Funerals; which were ſolemnized in moſt ample manner, above the expences uſual to any of our Kings deceaſed, <hi>November</hi> 23. 1658.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being convened on the 27th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> the Protector and his new Lords gave them a meeting in the Lords Houſe, where he made a ſpeech to them, which was ſeconded by the Keeper <hi>Fiennes,</hi> and ſo departed to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the Lords keeping their ſeats, and the major part of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, not vouchſafing audience, betook themſelves to their own houſe, and elected <hi>Challoner Chute</hi> for their Speaker.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being in ſome meaſure, fuller then it uſed, by reaſon of Knights and Burgeſſes from <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> began with the old Trade of queſtioning the power. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the debate came to this reſult, that they would recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the Lord Protector, but ſo that nothing ſhould be binding, till all other Acts to be prepared by the Parliament ſhould likewiſe paſs and be confirmed: For the other Houſe alſo, that no ſtop might be put to the great deſign of ſetling the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55447:33"/>which was then aimed at, and that queſtion of owning them being but a baulk to their proceeding, they reſolved to tranſact with them for this Parliament as a Houſe of Peers, not excluding the right of other the Peers of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Protector, at the inſtance of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> had rigg'd forth a Fleet for the <hi>Sound,</hi> which being ready to ſet ſail, the Parliament ordered that for this time the Protector ſhould have the mannagement of the Militia in this expedition, reſerving to themſelves the Supreme right thereto; that Fleet, after ſix moneths time, returned back again, <hi>re infecta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the debates flew high in the Houſe of Commons, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the leſſening the power of the Sword, which was grown ſo exorbitant; therefore the Army being ſenſible whereto ſuch conſultations would finally tend, reſolved to break up the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and accordingly, having ſecured the Protector, made him ſign a Commiſſion to <hi>Fiennes</hi> to diſſolve it, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was done, though the Houſe of Commons, to prevent it, adjourned themſelves for three daies; but then out came a Proclamation, forced likewiſe from the Protector, whereby he declared that Parliament to be abſolutely diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Now the Army, and ſome of the tail of the Parliament which were turned out by <hi>Oliver</hi> in 1653. joyn their heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo make way for their free Commonwealth again. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Protector is laid aſide, the Officers of the Army playing ſome eight daies with the Government, and then reſigning it to thoſe men, who very readily imbraced the motion, and met <hi>May 7.</hi> in the Houſe the Old Speaker, and ſome forty more making up a <hi>Quorum,</hi> and forthwith publiſhed a Declaration, how that by the wonderful Providence and goodneſs of God they were reſtored, which to moſt ſeemed the ſaddeſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could befall the Nation.</p>
               <p>Preſently they fall to their old trade of ſqueezing money, and providing ſure for themſelves againſt any more attempts of the Army, leiſurely purging out thoſe that had been active with <hi>Oliver</hi> againſt them, but by all means refuſe to admit thoſe Members that by the like force were formerly ſecluded in 1648. They depoſe the Protector, and make him ſign a Reſignation, yet promiſing him the yearly allowance of 10000 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <hi>per annum,</hi> and the payment of his debts, ſo that they thought themſelves now cock-ſure, levying money by taxes before hand, to gratifie the Army, for the peoples love they never expected, and then ſettle the Militia in confiding hands.</p>

To try him therefore, the Rump having been denied moneys by the City, and therefore offended with them; to ruine both, by their expreſs Command, the General was ſent with his Army into the City, pulled down their Gates and Portculliſes, ſeized ſeveral Citizens at the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> and ſent them to the Tower; this ſeemed to portend ſome dreadful concluſion: But in the interim, the Rump voted, that the Government of the Army ſhould reſt in five perſons, making the General one of thoſe; which procedure of theirs, preſently drew the Curtain to the Scene and deſign enſuing.</p>
