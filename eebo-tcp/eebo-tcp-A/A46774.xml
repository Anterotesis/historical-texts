         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Firſt LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' this comes not from one that
can pretend to the Honour of your
intimate Acquaintance; yet one,
nevertheleſs, your Friend in the
greateſt Sincerity; yea, much more your
Friend, than ſuch as can be unconcern'd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further, than to make a Game of that
which threatens the Ruin of a Gentleman
ſo well accompliſht with more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Parts and Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>To deal freely with you, Sir, (ſince I have
lately heard you make ſo bold with One that's
infinitely more your Superiour, than you are
mine) That which you might reckon the
Grace and Emphaſis of your Talk, was to
me ſo extreamly Noiſom and Grievous, that
I found it a very difficult Task to be your
Patient ſo long as I was. And becauſe I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33112:3"/>
then ſpake ſo little to interrupt the prophane
Humour, I think my ſelf obliged in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to ſignifie the more in this Paper; yea,
the rather did I prevail with my ſelf ſo much
to ſtifle my Reſentments at that Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I reſolved now to pour them out more
fully in this manner, as hoping I might do
it with leſs Offence, and better Effect, to
propoſe the Matter to your calm Thoughts,
when cool and retired, than if I had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Ruffle before thoſe, who might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
have ſtomach'd me as injurious to
their Meeting, had I there ſolemnly entred
the Liſts to diſpute that Cauſe, which I am
going to plead with you at preſent.</p>
            <p>'Tis to me, Sir, a moſt aſtoniſhing thing,
to ſee one whom the Bounty of Heaven has
rais'd ſo much above the Common Level,
both for Endowments of Mind, and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World, ſo far forget himſelf,
as to fly in the Face of his Sole Founder,
and Supream Benefactor, and at the moſt
daring rate, Tear and Blaſpheme that Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
Name, which He has declar'd, <hi>He
will not hold him guiltleſs that takes in vain.</hi>
When 'tis not only the moſt irregular invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end of your Creation, (as if you were
made only to diſhonour God) but the very
height of Ingratitude, ſo to turn the noble
Faculty of <hi>Speech</hi> againſt him, without whom
you could not ſo much as <hi>ſpeak at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33112:3"/>
Can you chuſe, Sir, but diſcern what an
Abſurdity it is to own the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name;
yea, and bow at the very mention of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi>
and yet ſo ſlight and play upon the
Great Lord of Chriſtians, as to Swear even
altogether, when he Charges every one of
his, <hi>not to ſwear at a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l.</hi> And what does it,
but ſtill add to the Abſurdity, when 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
confeſt to be a ſcandalous Evil, which
you ought to renounce, and yet you will as
confidently perſiſt in this Guilt, as if you
believ'd it harmleſs, or a Matter of nothing.</p>
            <p>What ſort of Chriſtian is that, who acts
as 'twere in ſpight of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> And I may
askt, What kind of <hi>Subject</hi> too, that is ſo
croſs to his <hi>Soveraign,</hi> as boldly to keep up
that horrid Ungodlineſs, which our truly
<hi>Christian Prince</hi> has uſed the utmoſt Care to
ſuppreſs? Letting all the World know, 'tis
after another rate now, he would have Men
expreſs their Loyalty to him, than to <hi>Swear</hi>
and <hi>Drink</hi> for him. As being a great deal
Wiſer, than to expect they ſhould ever be
true to him, who ſtick not ſo notoriouſly
to Rebel-againſt an infinitely Greater. And
were it at all poſſible, they could thus be Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
yet how would he abhor their Service at
the Coſt of God's diſhonour; counting it no
commendable Reflection at all on his Sacred
Perſon, to own ſuch bold Pretenders to his
Grace and Favour: Who (if his Signal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33112:4"/>
Example will not at laſt ſhame them into
better Manners) muſt go ſtigmatized as
worſe Affronters of his <hi>Laws and Majesty,</hi>
even than any that take upon them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the Right of his Royal Authority:
For tho' I do not think, that this admits of
any juſt Scruple at all; yet as to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Cuſtomary Swearing,</hi> there's not the
leaſt Controverſie with any Men of Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
whatſoever, But that he, who allows
himſelf in ſuch a known Wickedneſs, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Reſiſts, and Deſies the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Earth</hi> both together.</p>
            <p>Whatever, Sir, be your Station, Revenue,
Titles, and Dignity, you cannot imagine,
ſure, that you have any Authority to be a
<hi>Common Swearer,</hi> as you are a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> a
<hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or a <hi>Souldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, As a <hi>Gentleman, How utterly ſhould
you ſcorn</hi> ſuch Boariſh Manners as infinitely
below you! That which is a Badge of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
to the very ſcum of the People; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
no better Rank and Quality, than to
be of the Hiſſing Lineage of the Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
who is for Spitting his Venome moſt
againſt him that is abſolutely the Beſt. Can
it become your Dignity, or ever be be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
as any of your Bravery? Be ſure,
that Lamp of Reputation which is fed with
God's Diſhonour, will caſt but a very ill Whift
in any Noſtrils, except ſuch as prefer the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33112:4"/>
naſtieſt Dunghill before the ſweeteſt Garden.
The <hi>Swearing</hi> which I now make bold to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
with you concerning, but like an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume
iſſuing out of a dead Mans mouth,
ſpeaks you even <hi>Dead in Sin,</hi> and ſo rots your
Name, and lays all your Honour in the duſt.</p>
            <p>But the moſt unaccountable thing it is, that
ever <hi>Swearing</hi> ſhould be reputed a Mark of fine
Breeding; or any gentile, graceful Property,
which in truth is ſo contrary to all good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and a rude Entrenching upon all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlineſs
and Common Civility; a Nuſance
and Affront to every Ingenious, Sober Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and the greateſt Offence to all that
fear God, and make any Conſcience at all of
his Word; who had rather you ſhould ſpit
in their Faces, than ſo outragiouſly abuſe and
mock the Sovereign Object of all their deareſt
Love, and higheſt Regard.</p>
            <p>Next as a <hi>Magiſtrate;</hi> Are you not oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Sir, to Check and Puniſh this very thing,
which your ſelf have been ſo deep in the guilt
of? And which your own Practice ſo tends to
Countenance and Embolden, that the <hi>Vulgus</hi>
take no ſmall Pride to be in your Faſhion,
thinking to ingratiate themſelves with their
Betters, by licking your Ulcers; yea are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to be hiſſed off the Stage as Squeamiſh
<hi>Preciſians,</hi> ſhould they be ſo Cowardly as not
venture to Copy out ſuch Preſidents; and ſo
even to ſave their Credit, it ſeems neceſſary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33112:5"/>
to tranſplant your Shame into their Soil. Thus
inſtead of exerting your Power and Intereſt to
quaſh that Prophaneſs and Blaſphemy, which
<hi>makes the Land to mourn,</hi> and cries aloud for
Vengeance; How do you ſadden the Souls of
the Righteous, ſtrengthen the Hands of the
Wicked, and expreſs the greateſt Spight and
Enmity to your Country, in doing ſtill ſo
much the more Miſchief, by how much the
larger is your Influence? For this makes the
<hi>Wicked</hi> Swagger, and tumultuouſly <hi>walk on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſide, when the vileſt Men are exalted.</hi> When
ſuch poſſeſs the Places of Honour, Truſt and
Power, as not only ſtand for Cyphers, to let
the moſt obnoxious eſcape with Impunity;
and dare not ſhame that which Diſhonours
God, leaſt it ſhould recoil in their Faces, and
put themſelves to extream Confuſion; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſerve for a Back and Skreen to the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Rout, to make them ſcorn the <hi>Parſon,</hi>
and ſet every Reprover at defiance, when as
they have ſuch big Names to quote for their
Juſtification and Warrant. O! Sir, How do
you think the Eternal Judge of Quick and
Dead, will in the final Audit, look upon this
ſort of <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> that gave ſuch ſingular
aid and furtherance to his <hi>Miniſters:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as a <hi>Souldier;</hi> Can you think it your
Valour, Sir, to hector God Almighty? And
that you are a ſtout Man, becauſe you dare
make ſo bold (as no one in his right Wits
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33112:5"/>
would do) with the Supream Majeſty? Whom
to contemn, the very Heathens have counted
it no better than Fool hardineſs and Madneſs:
Or is there any thing like a wiſe Conduct in
the Caſe, when as you are engaged againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Enemies, to go <hi>ſtrive with your Maker,</hi>
and ſo make him your Enemy too? O! Sir,
if you would approve your ſelf truly Great
and Couragious, here's a Combat worthy the
faithful <hi>Souldier and Servant of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> even
to encounter with all your might this <hi>reigning
Sin of Swearing,</hi> that like another <hi>Mighty Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
ſends out Challenges againſt <hi>Heaven,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
not only the <hi>Hoſts of the Living God,</hi>
but even the <hi>God of Hoſts</hi> himſelf; yea, that
Marches through the World, Great and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying,
Inſolent and Domineering, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten,
even, the Zealous for their Lord's
Intereſt, from venturing to reſiſt it.</p>
            <p>When this Party of Rebels is grown ſo big,
that the Injuſtice of the Cauſe even ceaſeth to
be queſtioned, and their Numbers paſs for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
on their ſide; and therefore do ſo
many take the boldneſs to liſt themſelves into
the Helliſh Regiment; taking it for a piece of
Cowardice to <hi>fear an Oath;</hi> when he that will
not <hi>Swear at all,</hi> is ready to be pointed at, with

               </gap>) yonders he! ſtar'd at as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy,
and ſcoffed for a Pedant. When you
hear your Company, Sir, grow Malapert and
Sawcy with God himſelf, to toſs in their unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Mouths, as a thing of nought, his Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33112:6"/>
Name; and at every turn cite the
Glorious Majeſty, and Dreadful Judg of all the
World, to vouch all their impertinent Prate;
as if their Tongues were touch'd with a Cole
from <hi>Hell,</hi> and their Conſciences ſear'd with
an hot Iron out of the ſame Fire; that even as
faſt as they fetch'd Words out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of their Hearts, ſo faſt this putrid Scum
boils up into their Mouths from the ſame cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Fountain: yea, when they can <hi>Swear</hi> and
<hi>Rant,</hi> not only out of inadvertence, but avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
for the Gallantry of the buſineſs, as if
they were the braver Men, becauſe they dare
be ſuch Sinners with a Witneſs, and <hi>take Hell
by violence,</hi> ſcorning to be ſtopt or reſtrained,
trampling under foot the <hi>Blood of Chriſt;</hi> if
but to make themſelves ſport, piercing his
Side afreſh with <hi>Oaths,</hi> ſharper than the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Spear; and playing away the Virtue of
that <hi>Name,</hi> which alone is able to ſave them
from the <hi>Damnation</hi> they imprecate. Here!
here's a Field, Sir, wherein to acquit you as
a Man, and approve your Conduct and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſs
in making a worthy Oppoſition, and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to appear for <hi>God,</hi> when ſuch multitudes

where you have the beſt Cauſe, and the

Do but think with your ſelf, Sir, what an
unpardonable Affront would ſuch a one as you
account it, to be call'd a Baſtard? And the
moſt indelible Brand of Cowardice, not to
ſtand up in your own Vindication, under ſuch
a vile Imputation. But, truly Sir, <hi>if a Son
honours his Father,</hi> and cannot endure to ſee
him expoſed, or hear him ridicul'd; I muſt
be bold to tell you, that you give ſhrew'd ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
you are but of a Spurious Brood, and
no true Child of the <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> when
you can find in your heart, ſo <hi>unnaturally,</hi> and
even of ſet purpoſe, to load his <hi>Name</hi> with
Scorn; yea, when you can but be a tame and
ſilent Witneſs of his Diſhonour, and your
Blood not riſe, and <hi>your Spirit not be ſtir'd
in you,</hi> to put you upon the Vindicating
and Aſſerting of his Right and Glory.</p>
            <p>Should one offer to give you the Lye, I
know, Sir, you would think your Honour ſo
touched, there were not only Apology enough
for a Quarrel, but even neceſſity of a Duel.
And yet if you are a <hi>Swearer,</hi> pray what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
Man will you ever induce to believe
that you are no <hi>Lyar?</hi> For what ſhould make
him ſtrain ſo much at a <hi>Lye,</hi> who has ſo
glib a Swallow for <hi>Oath upon Oath?</hi> When
the very ſame <hi>Lord</hi> that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not
forſwear thy ſelf;</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi>
He that ſticks not to thwart him in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is hard truſting him in the former.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33112:7"/>
And to tye <hi>Truth</hi> to ſuch Mens <hi>Oaths,</hi> how
fond and ſenſeleſs is it? It is true, ſay you,
for I heard ſuch a one <hi>ſwear it:</hi> Pitiful Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick!
When the right Inference from the
Premiſes is juſt on the other ſide, It's falſe,
or nothing like to be true, becauſe a <hi>Swearer</hi>
affirmed it. For what's ſaid by the <hi>Swearers,</hi>
be ſure comes from none of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Scholars,
who is <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf; they are better Taught,
and <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> It muſt then come
from them, who are of his training up, that
is, the <hi>Father of Lyes,</hi> and is to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
thereafter. And ſuch muſt never hope
to recover their Credit among the <hi>Wiſe,</hi>
till they ceaſe to be found among the <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
their <hi>Word</hi> then, will indeed go a
great deal further than now their <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do but ſee then here, Sir, how miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to the World, and what an irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wrong to humane Society, is the weakning
theſe Sacred Bonds of Conſcience, by the
frequent uſe of <hi>Oaths</hi> in ordinary Chat, ſo
to render them cheap and contemptible;
when the <hi>Awe and Reverence of an Oath</hi> is
quite loſt and gone, by debaſing it to every
toyiſh purpoſe; And when Men can play
with <hi>Oaths,</hi> even every where; alas, who
can expect they ſhould be punctual and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
therein any where? And after this
rate, what the more ſatisfaction can you
have, when you give Men their <hi>Oaths,</hi> that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33112:7"/>
they do not make a <hi>Lye</hi> as well as make
<hi>Oath?</hi> And how can the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> be
ſure of ſuch Mens <hi>Allegiance,</hi> or any one elſe
of their true <hi>Teſtimony</hi> or <hi>Fidelity</hi> to their
Promiſe? And ſo Kingdoms are ſhaken, and
all <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> among Men deſtroyed,
by the idle, trivial uſe of <hi>Swearing.</hi> And
for all ſuch Damages accurring to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
from this horrid Abuſe of Speech, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>Common Swearer</hi> is reſponſible; and
much more thoſe of Eminent Station, who
by their Examples ſhould teach others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>How like a Ruler then, that <hi>Rules for God,</hi> as
well as <hi>Reigns by him,</hi> does the King's moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Majeſty now urge the hampering thoſe
<hi>unruly Beaſts of the People</hi> with Penal Inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that will not be wrought upon to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
ſuch a Barbarous Practice, by any more
fair perſwaſive Methods? And as they are
the deadly Enemies of their Country, who
will not abridge themſelves of this Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Pleaſure, tho' it were to ſave a Church,
to ſave a Kingdom, and to pleaſe <hi>God and
the King</hi> both together; So I dare refer it
to your ſelf, Sir, (when you do but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any ſerious Thoughts) what true Friends
they can be to the <hi>Publick,</hi> who in ſuch a
Caſe as this, will Heal and Connive at the
Offenders, and not dare, what in them lies,
as far as they are bound, to bring ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33112:8"/>
Criminals to Shame and Suffering.
But this, alas, we are not like to have the
pleaſure of ſeeing, till the Leſſer Wheels
move yet more regularly under the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For the Vulgar will not think it good
Manners to lead their Betters the way, till
<hi>yea, yea;</hi> and <hi>nay, nay;</hi> become the Mode
of their Landlords and Maſters, as well as
of their King and Queen; and not only <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi>
on the Throne, but <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> alſo
on the Bench, <hi>fears an Oath.</hi> But, O! how
happy then would it be with us, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one concern'd would act as <hi>Good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
under the <hi>Beſt of Rulers,</hi> who are not
<hi>for bearing the Sword in Vain,</hi> but would be
(as the Rejoycing of them that do well, ſo)
<hi>a Terror to Evil-doers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, this, Sir, I cannot but think moſt
pertinent for your Conſideration, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
ſo much <hi>Love to your Country, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary. They
are both indeed excellent Pretenſions, and 'tis
great pity you ſhould be therein guilty of any
Self contradictions.</p>
            <p>For how can you ſincerely <hi>Love your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
when you Patronize the curſedthing
that bodes nothing but its Ruine? As His
<hi>Sacred</hi> MAJESTY, moſt truly and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
like himſelf, has laid down the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>That our Religion, Peace, and Happineſs,
are all endangered by reaſon of that overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33112:8"/>
of Vice, which is too notorious in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what <hi>Loyalty to Their Majeſties,</hi> when
ſtill you are ſo much for the thing, which
they have declared themſelves ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt:
'Tis, methinks, a ſtrange ſort of
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> only to Croſs and Provoke them.
Though the Ranting Loyalty of Debauched
Ruffians, it's true, was ſometime ſince in
Faſhion; yet, pray good Sir, remember,
that now it's another Reign, and ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(bleſſed be God) we are under, as do
not make a Jeſt of all Serious Religion.
And the pretence of honouring them with
God's Diſhonour, is growing ſo fulſome,
that nothing more uncovers the Nakedneſs
of the Authors; when the <hi>King</hi>'s publiſhed
Letter again acquaints us, <hi>That He moſt
earneſtly deſires, and will endeavour a General
Reformation of the Lives and Manners of all
His Subjects, as being that which muſt eſtabliſh
His Throne.</hi> What Supporters then are they
of the <hi>Throne,</hi> who think ſtill to teſtify their
Loyalty by the moſt prophane Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
And what Honour and Deference do
they pay to the <hi>Royal Pleaſure,</hi> who inſtead
of ſtriving to promote it, only give broad
Significations, how much they Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
it?</p>
            <p>I have heard you declare, Sir, That you
are no Papiſt, Phanatick, nor Diſaffected to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33112:9"/>
the Preſent Government. Yea, I perceive
too much, you are very forward, uncall'd,
to <hi>Swear,</hi> when ſome will not <hi>Swear</hi> now,
though called to it. But in good truth, Sir,
I think it is to little purpoſe, what you do
call your ſelf, as long as you abide under
this <hi>Heinous Guilt;</hi> for at the bottom they
can be of no Religion at all, but are the
fouleſt Scandal to the <hi>Chriſtian Name,</hi>
and a heavy Plague to the World, who
Name <hi>God</hi> in their <hi>Oaths,</hi> oftner than in
their <hi>Prayers;</hi> and have little to do with
Him, but only thus to provoke him. See
that you do not here ſymbolize too right
with <hi>Rome,</hi> before you are aware, in poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning
the <hi>weightieſt Matters of the Law, to
the Mint, Anniſe and Cummin;</hi> while you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
moſt bitterly againſt all that (to a
hairs breadth) conform not to the Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
and in that mean time your ſelf can
ſwallow the Camels of ſuch Monſtrous <hi>Oaths,</hi>
as make the greateſt Violation, and the rudeſt
Attack upon <hi>God</hi>'s own expreſs Command.</p>
            <p>One would think you owed the <hi>Church of
England</hi> no real Kindneſs, Sir, when you ſo
eagerly lay claim to its Memberſhip, only to
Reproach it; as if it gave you a Protection for
that open Ungodlineſs, which the very <hi>Light
of Nature</hi> utterly Shames, and Condemns:
And you would prove your ſelf a <hi>Son of the
Church,</hi> by acting like a <hi>Child of the Devil.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33112:9"/>
Sir, you too much Credit thoſe, whom you
ſo divert your ſelf to Beſpatter; yea, you
change Names with them, while you Rant at
them. For who in earneſt is the bigger Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and Madcap, he that boggles at an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Ceremony, or he that makes no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
at all of the moſt notorious Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Iniquity? Do you think to Convert Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
with your hairbrain'd <hi>Swearing and
Damning?</hi> Or to invite them into our Holy
Communion, with ſuch leud Communication?
Indeed, no wonder this ſhould make the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of the Lord abhorred;</hi> and bring a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
and Prejudice on the beſt Cauſe it ſelf,
for the ſake of ſuch kind of Patrons and Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
appearing in it, only to turn the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
Stomacks more, and open their Mouths
wider againſt it.</p>
            <p>Be it known to you, Sir, The <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is no Mother of ſuch Abominations: 'Tis
the ſillieſt miſtake in any, that think to find
<hi>Swearing</hi> in her <hi>Litany.</hi> And he as obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhuts his Eyes againſt the Light, who ſees
not all irreverent Abuſe of <hi>God's Name,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down in her <hi>Homily.</hi> But when you can
ſo defile your own Neſt, and Blemiſh the moſt
<hi>Excellent Profeſſion,</hi> as well a deſperately fling
at the <hi>Glory</hi> of Him that made you; Here, if
ever, <hi>The Righteous Judge of all the Earth</hi> is
concern'd to ſhew himſelf, and take ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33112:10"/>
Criminals in hand, to make them feel
it in <hi>Judgments</hi> worthy of <hi>God,</hi> who will not
leave off, ſo to dare him to it; but carry on
the Affront ſtill, though their Sin hath not
ſo much as the face of any Worldly Intereſt,
or Fleſhly Pleaſure in it; and there's no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Inclination, or Impetuous Appetite to
it, not ſo much as to make the Plea of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Infirmity for it. But the mad <hi>Swearer
ſwears</hi> even for pure <hi>Swearing</hi> ſake; Sins <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
in Contempt of Heaven; and ſells his
Soul for no Conſideration at all, but out of a
Fantaſtick Humour, to follow an inconſiderate
Herd to his own Eternal Ruin.</p>
            <p>Good Sir, you have Reaſon to Judge and
Conſider in Caſes much leſs plain than this;
what Lethargy then has ſeized your Senſe,
that it does not befriend you here? To reflect,
what a <hi>fearful thing it is to fall into the Hands
of the Living God, who is a Righteous Judge,
Strong, and Patient, and wretchedly provoked</hi>
(you know it) <hi>every day.</hi> But think you not
that he could Command the Earth to open her
Jaws, and take the <hi>Swearers</hi> down quick into
Hell, as once it did <hi>Corah</hi> and his Crew? Or
think you not, that he could Rain a Hell down
even from Heaven, as he did on <hi>Sodom,</hi> and
the Cities of the Plain? For certain <hi>his Arm
is not ſhortned, that he cannot;</hi> but his Bowels
are ſo tender, he waits, and gives ill Men
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33112:10"/>
ſpace to Repent and Turn; which if after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all
his <hi>Goodneſs that ſhould lead them to Repentance,</hi>
they will not, it's time for him then to lay to
his Hand, and <hi>whet his Sword, and bend his
Bow, and make ready his Arrows, and prepare
for them the Inſtruments of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your ſelf, Sir, I am ſure, would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to have ſuch Contempt caſt upon you,
and ſuch Affronts offered you: And muſt he,
that is ſo beyond all Compariſon more Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
be thus put upon, and take all the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Indignities from you? All the Patience in
the World elſe, would never bear at this rate.
And abundant Experience indeed, Sir, you
have had of it, that God is <hi>Long-ſuffering;</hi>
But yet he that endures ſo long, will not do
it always: Abuſed mercy muſt be righted, and
will have Vengeance. Though the prophane
<hi>Swearer</hi> may be ready to think himſelf hail-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
with his <hi>Glorious Maker;</hi> yet be ſure his
Sin will find him out. God has his Book of
Accounts, in which all the <hi>Oaths</hi> ſtand upon
Record; and he hath ſaid, <hi>He will not hold
him Guiltleſs:</hi> And the Blaſphemous Wretch
will be like to find a <hi>Meioſis</hi> too in that Threat,
which imports thus much more than is expreſt,
that ſuch ſhall be proceeded againſt as the
moſt guilty. And 'tis as if he ſhould ſay, I
will be ſure to puniſh them, whoever elſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape;
becauſe of my <hi>Name,</hi> I am moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33112:11"/>
even as the <hi>Apple of mine Eye;</hi> ſuch ſhall
therefore take my <hi>Name in vain</hi> another day
too, and in the laſt Judgment, cry <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi>
but I will not hear them. And after all their
time of <hi>Swearing</hi> and Slighting me, I will take
my time to caſt them off, and <hi>ſwear they ſhall
never enter into my Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is the <hi>Swearer</hi>'s Doom gone out alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
And he does but Antedate his own Eternal
<hi>Dirges,</hi> as he ſo often Anticipates the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of his own <hi>Damnation;</hi> beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to Exerciſe himſelf in that <hi>Curſing and
Blaſpheming,</hi> which is like to be the beſt Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
of his Torments for ever; and ſo well
may <hi>Orcus</hi> ſignify, both an <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi>
when they are ſo near a kin. The place rings
with ſuch ſounds, and it gapes for ſuch Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants,
as uſe to belch out this Poyſon, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pleaſe a Deviliſh Humour.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, will you cry, <hi>Damn him, he
Preaches Damnation?</hi> Though you ſhould ſo
vent your Indignation; you know a Reaſon
why I am not to wonder at the very worſt you
can ſay againſt your <hi>Fellow Creature.</hi> But with
your leave, Sir, if I do predict the <hi>Wrath to
come,</hi> that you may <hi>flee from it,</hi> I think I do
but offer you a Bleſſing for your Imprecation;
and let my Charity find only the contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Return, <hi>He Preaches!</hi> I ſhall as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33112:11"/>
to be made the <hi>ſcorn of the Swearers,</hi> as
the <hi>ſong of the Drunkards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hope better things yet, Sir, from ſuch
a Temper and Reaſon as yours. I hope that
you, who can be ſo obliging to others, will
not preverſly ſhake off a Servant of his, you
call your <hi>Saviour,</hi> only <hi>Praying you in Chriſt's
ſtead to be Reconciled unto God.</hi> I hope that
you, who know ſo much more than many of
your poor Inferiors, will be Wiſer than to
make the ſad purchaſe of <hi>more ſtripes,</hi> for ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo madly at God himſelf, when as Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
cannot chuſe but tell you all the while,
'tis nothing but <hi>kicking againſt the pricks,</hi> and
Strugling with Him, who will certainly prove
quite too hard for you.</p>
            <p>Your fair Reception of a late Friendly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
ſpeaks you to be of another nature
than thoſe Beaſts that <hi>turn again, and rent</hi> their
Reprovers. And it is a thouſand pities, that
a Diſpoſition and Ingenuity capable of the
moſt Excellent Impreſſions, ſhould be ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run
with rank Weeds, and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Briars.</p>
            <p>Alas, Sir, What can you ever propoſe to
your ſelf, in adhering to a ſcandalous Haunt,
that hath no manner of Satisfaction, even to
the Carnal Appetite; pleaſeth never a ſenſe?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33112:12"/>
You know what the Ingenious and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> ſays, <hi>Were I an Epicure, I
could bate Swearing;</hi> 'tis Pleaſure that drills
on the Drunkard; filthy Lucre that's the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
bait; and the Ambitious tow'rs after the
Lure of Honour; all have ſome Colour, tho'
falſe, for their Evil; only the Diabolical
<hi>Swearer</hi> embraces Wickedneſs even for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Let me beſeech you then, Sir, for pity to
your own Soul, (if not for the Fear and Love
of God) Reſcue it from the Bonds of this Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining
Cuſtom, and do not yield your ſelf to
be <hi>taken Captive by the Devil at his will.</hi> But
after all your impious <hi>Oaths,</hi> will you make
one <hi>Religious Vow,</hi> never ſo to <hi>Swear</hi> again;
and <hi>Fear an Oath,</hi> even as you would dread
a Chain that will bind you to Fire Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable.
O! let him that gave you a
Tongue, and Power to uſe it, have the Praiſe
and Glory of it. And do not make it the
Weapon ſo to Fight with your Maker, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>Can it chuſe, Sir, but grate hard upon

of ſpeaking, which ſets you ſo much above

which you can trample in the dirt; ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Muſt beg your Pardon, if I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
any juſt Cauſe of Diſpleaſure
given, That a <hi>Copy</hi> of the Former was
Publiſhed for the ſake of others; when
as the Name is ſtill concealed, for the ſake
of one beſt known to your ſelf. It being
upon no <hi>Perſon</hi> at all, but meerly upon the
Thing which moſt groſly Diſhonours any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that I would caſt the <hi>Diſgrace.</hi> And
when it is to be feared, There are many
equally concerned as your ſelf in the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage:
I cannot be ſorry, they ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33112:15"/>
all take their Share in this Publication:
Which carries no Deſign to <hi>Libel</hi> any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Gentleman;</hi> but to diſperſe a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Admonition to as many as will be no
kinder to themſelves, than to make it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to their own Caſe. At leaſt I would
Perſtringe, whom I cannot Reclaim: And
throw my <hi>Bucket</hi> upon that Flame, which is
too Outragious for me to Flatter my ſelf
with the Hopes of quite Extinguiſhing.</p>
            <p>YOU may think your ſelf out of my
Thoughts, as well as out of my Reach, Sir,
now you have croſs'd the Waters, to abide in
Parts more Remote: But as all the Waters
in that Channel you have paſt, cannot quench
my Concernment for you; ſo the Kindneſs
of a <hi>Noble Friend</hi> who divides with me the
Cure of your Welfare, (That theſe Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which carry ſome Heat, may not
find you as the Clay, but the Wax;) has
aſſured me of ſuch a Conveyance, that this
ſhall not fail to find you out: Yet, Sir, I
had no Thoughts of ſending after you the
<hi>SECOND ADDRESS</hi> till I perceived
you took along with you ſome Reſentments
occaſioned by the Former: Which I know,
told too much Truth to Pleaſe any, but
ſuch as in Earneſt hate the Rebuked Evil:
and count it no Expoſing of themſelves, to
ſee that which Diſhonours <hi>God</hi> put to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:33112:15"/>
THAT I take upon me agen to Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
you, Sir, of a domeſtick Enemy, which
I fear may prove more pernicious to you,
than you are apt to imagine, and threatens
you with bigger Dangers, than any from
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> (let them do the worſt that
God ſhall ſuffer them:) If my <hi>Calling</hi> does
not give me Warrant to do it, I am ſure
my <hi>Conſcience</hi> would not give me Quiet till
I did it. And I had rather be Blamed as
too Officious, for tendering a Rejected piece
of Service and Friendſhip; than lye under
ſome other Frowns and Rebukes, more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to be born, than any I fear from Men.
However, I apprehend it a Bold Attempt,
not only to Hazard the diſpleaſure of any
above me, but alſo to Engage againſt me a
whole Band of Sticklers for their <hi>Diana,</hi>
who peradventure upon ſuch an Occaſion,
may add to their former Scores, and Bind
themſelves in ſome New <hi>Oaths</hi> of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
Yet this to me gives Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough to Ballance whatever's diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
or frightful in the Undertaking, That
I am but perſuing the Service which I have
<hi>Vowed</hi> to God, and the Loyalty which I
have <hi>Sworn</hi> to Their <hi>Majeſties:</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
have not any manner of <hi>Perſonal Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi>
to incite me; nor a deſign to defame
ought in the World, but the moſt Odious
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33112:16"/>
Impiety it ſelf: and what I can to <hi>Enervate</hi>
the Force of that which I have more than
a ſingle Engagement upon me to Fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
            <p>NOR is it at the <hi>Gentry</hi> that I have the
leaſt Pique at all: than among whom I do
not know more Excellent <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the
World: And to whoſe Kindneſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
I have ſo many particular Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
(more than are fit for my Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
as well as above my Expectation:)
Enough to tempt me to Pride and Boaſting,
rather than to any other ſort of Ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
And I muſt leave others to judge,
What Room there can be for the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That I ſhould invidiouſly derogate from
that which I have nothing to ſhew for my
ſelf, (though I am ſenſible how inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is the Honour derived from a Family,
to add one <hi>Cubit</hi> to <hi>Onos Stature.)</hi> And
<hi>I count it but Loſs,</hi> &amp;c. But therefore to the
<hi>Gentleman</hi> do I make my Application, both
as ſuppoſing him Maſter of the Quickeſt Senſe
to take the Impreſſions of Reaſon; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to have the biggeſt <hi>Influence,</hi> to Credit
whatever ſuch a one as He Eſpouſes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
And, by that <hi>Medium,</hi> the more to
Hurt or Benefit many others. Now for the
Succeſs, I muſt leave it in his Hands, who
<hi>Faſhions all Hearts;</hi> hoping it will not be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33112:16"/>
utterly Fruſtrate and Loſt upon all: Tho'
to ſome it ſhould prove no better than a
New Verification of the <hi>Prophets</hi> Old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
<hi>I will get me to the Great Men, and
will ſpeak unto them, for they have known the
Way of the Lord, and the Judgment of their
God: But theſe have altogether Broken the
Yoke, and Burſt the Bonds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, As I cannot be eager to live in the
Fire, ſo 'tis far from my Deſign, to be a
<hi>Man of Contention:</hi> Yet you know there is
a Warfare wherein I am full as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
as you, which engages us, upon ſome
Occaſions, to Contend, and that <hi>Earnestly
too.</hi> Who ever call ſuch Zeal and Fidelity
to our Lord, nothing but Pragmaticalneſs
and Enmity to our Neighbours: Theſe are
the ſame kind of Judges among whom that
paſſes for the only Charity, which the ſacred
<hi>Oracles</hi> call <hi>Hating our Brother in our Heart,</hi>
who think every one <hi>hates</hi> them that does
not rightly <hi>humour</hi> them: And cry out of
the Reprover for a Turbulent Wrangler;
though he breaks no Peace, unleſs that which
the <hi>Prince</hi> of Peace himſelf tells us, <hi>He did
not come to ſend:</hi> The Peace which nuzzles
Men up in thoſe Sins that Ripen them for
Hell; crying, All's well, till all be Undone.
But whenever I muſt be ſo unhappy to loſe
Friends, or procure Foes, I ſhall count it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33112:17"/>
none of the moſt opprobrious, (as I am
ſure it's none of the worſt) ways to do it,
in the Conſcientious Diſcharge of that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and Charity which I owe to my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Soul. And I cannot think there's much
occaſion to droop under the Indignation of
thoſe that ſhew no ſuch <hi>Antipathy,</hi> either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Ghoſtly Enemies which they have
Vowed to <hi>GOD,</hi> or againſt the Worldly,
which they are paid by Their <hi>Majeſties,</hi>
ſtrenuouſly to Oppoſe; as againſt the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Reprover</hi> whom they ſtomack as the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Offender; and take none for ſuch a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deadly Foe, as him that would bereave
them of that Darling, which our <hi>Saviour</hi>
calls, <hi>The Right Hand and the Right Eye:</hi>
And who would much regard the Slander
or Clamour of their Mouths, that can ſo far
forget and debaſe themſelves, as to act not
only the Clown, but the Fiend, to fly in the
very Face of Him that made them?</p>
            <p>IF you thought, Sir, that I ſaid too much
to the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;</hi>
I muſt beſeech you to excuſe me, that
herein I am ſo far from being of your Mind,
that I do not think I have ſaid enough; And
therefore this comes as a ſupplement, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to urge thoſe things which many may
judge fit for you to hear; though I am far
from Judging my ſelf the fitteſt to ſpeak:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33112:17"/>
yet having my hand in, I will do as I can,
where I cannot as I would.</p>
            <p>AND to begin again with the <hi>Gentleman,</hi>
(who may expect to be firſt ſerved, though,
if Guilty, he might better like ſome other
Service:) It may be thought a <hi>Solaeciſm</hi> in
Manners, for an ordinary Man to make ſo
bold as mention Decency to ſuch as have
had Opportunities better to know the Laws
of Polite <hi>Breeding.</hi> Though it was one of
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that ſeconded his <hi>Lord,</hi> in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Charge, <hi>Above all things, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Swear not.</hi> Who knows but ſome
Huffing Gentlemen, (ſhould we direct this
towards them,) might Quarrel both his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and his ſtrictneſs in the Point. What,
no more but <hi>my Brethren?</hi> Hold Friend,
We are your Maſters. And Swear not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things?</hi> Why is that the Worſt
Thing you can name? What do you think
of the Diſſimulation and Hypocryſie of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Cheats?</hi> Truly Sir, I think as bad as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you can of them, wherever they are
found: But I hope this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was not one
of 'em, for giving ſuch a Check to the Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Practice. I profeſs I am under a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Miſtake, if a Man may not rebuke odious
Impiety, without being a <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> Yea,
when upon occaſion he does not teſtifie his
Deteſtation of it, I ſee not how he can
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33112:18"/>
be the Faithful Servant of his LORD,
with a <hi>Heart Right in the Sight of God:</hi>
When one of the beſt Churches that ever
was in the World, <hi>(Rev. 2. 2.)</hi> tho' among
other Parts of her high <hi>Elogium,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for her <hi>Patience,</hi> yet) <hi>could not bear
them that were Evil.</hi> And the meek <hi>Moſes</hi>
himſelf (you know) was Hot in <hi>GOD</hi>'s
Cauſe. Yea, even the Pacifick <hi>Lamb of God,</hi>
who, for his ſweet obliging Temper, heard
<hi>Friend of Publicans and Sinners,</hi> yet could
not forbear to Laſh out of the Temple its
<hi>Profaners:</hi> And had he met with another
ſort of <hi>Prophane,</hi> that make ſo Bold with a
far <hi>Greater</hi> than the <hi>Temple,</hi> I cannot believe
he would have thought them deſerving of
any Fairer Quarter.</p>
            <p>But though 'tis no New Shift of Prophane
Men, to put off their Admoniſhers with the
Retort of <hi>Hypocriſie:</hi> And you may take
it for <hi>Paradox,</hi> That Hypocriſie and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanneſs
ſhould ever Cohabit in the ſame
Breaſt: Yet the Solution is obvious to a
duller Apprehenſion than yours, that will but
obſerve it. For in Conſcience, Sir, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Name than <hi>Hypocrite</hi> belongs to him that
takes on him to be what he is not, yea what
really he hates to be? Now does not the
rudeſt Swearer and moſt ſcandalous Liver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, own himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> And
would be much aggrieved not to be ſo repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33112:18"/>
and called: A <hi>Chriſtian!</hi> That is,
A Profeſſor of the Holieſt Religion in
the World: And yet if he openly act,
as it were in ſpight of that moſt Holy
Profeſſion, and makes but a meer Scorn
of its Excellent Rules and Precepts, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
thoſe againſt <hi>Swearing:</hi> To
what purpoſe does he profeſs it, but to
play the Hypocrite, and Diſgrace it?
Pretending to Chriſtianity, and yet when
warn'd to Forbear thoſe very Works of
the <hi>Devil,</hi> which as a Chriſtian, he has
ſolemnly <hi>Vowed to Renounce:</hi> (And which
indeed common <hi>Morality</hi> as well as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi>
cries ſhame of:) He is only
exaſperated, and moved much more to
<hi>Choller,</hi> than to Amendment. As you
know ſome, Sir, that can ſo ill bear to
be dealt with upon this account: They
do not very <hi>Genteelly</hi> uſe ſuch, as even in
the faireſt manner, offer them the kindeſt
Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>And ſuch you know that look ſo big,
as if all of Inferiour Rank were quite
below their Notice: Or at leaſt very
Sawcy and Pragmatical, if they Offer
at more Service to <hi>GOD,</hi> than Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
That can <hi>Rip</hi> and <hi>Tear,</hi> like
thoſe that would <hi>Banter</hi> Heaven it ſelf,
and Run down the ever Bleſſed <hi>Majeſty</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:33112:19"/>
that there inhabits. As if the poor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
<hi>Worm</hi> which can but juſt crawl a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Ground, ſhould think to ſully
or put out the Glorious Sun, with ſquirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little <hi>Dirt.</hi> Thus do they go to
<hi>force</hi> themſelves a Reputation by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with a High Hand towards their
<hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> as nothing afraid of
Him, nor caring at all what his Word
ſays to 'em. This, Sir, is Pure <hi>forcing</hi>
things indeed; even as if they ſhould
ſtrive to make the Stream of a River
run upwards. For the World (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it <hi>Lies in Wickedneſs,)</hi> is not yet
grown ſo Degenerate, as to count this
Carriage <hi>Lovely and of good Report.</hi> Or
what if it ſhould be never ſo Highly
<hi>Eſteemed among Men,</hi> when 'tis <hi>Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in <hi>the ſight of God?</hi> And I may be
confident that not one of the <hi>Knot</hi> can
ever Believe that <hi>God</hi> thinks well of it:
or can expect to hear at laſt from Him,
<hi>Well done good and faithful Servant,</hi> for
it. Though the Cry of his Companions
is, <hi>A good honeſt ingenuous Fellow!</hi> The
moſt Authentick Records in the World
call him, <hi>The Wicked, who through the
Pride of his Countenance will not ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God.</hi> And expoſe him for no better
than an arrant <hi>Fool</hi> that ſcorns the fear
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33112:19"/>
of the Lord. Let them be the greateſt
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges of the Earth,</hi> they are
very ill inſtructed, and far from Wiſe,
if they ſerve him not with more <hi>Fear.</hi>
Were ſuch aſſuming Wickedneſs Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
enough for a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> How
cheap a thing would Gentility be? When
even the vileſt Wretch that's good for
nothing, can ſoon get the Knack, to be
an Egregious <hi>Bold-fac'd</hi> Sinner, luſtily to
Tun in his <hi>Drink,</hi> and Belch out his <hi>Oaths:</hi>
And, it may be, Blaſpheme <hi>GOD,</hi> and
Bleſs the <hi>King,</hi> both in a Breath: <hi>Glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Shame,</hi> inſtead of giving God
the <hi>Glory;</hi> and the worſe he does, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf the Better to paſs.</p>
            <p>But how eaſie is it, Sir, to ſhew you <hi>A
more excellent Way?</hi> He that would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
his Claim to a <hi>Brave Mind,</hi> muſt
not count Religion, but ſuch Impiety,
far Below him; eſteeming it the Higheſt
Birth to be <hi>Born of God,</hi> and ask the
King of Heaven Bleſſing: And ſeeing
more Excellence even in deſpiſed <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
than in all the Gallantry of this
World: <hi>In whoſe Eyes a Vile Perſon is
contemned,</hi> though never ſo Gay: But
he <hi>Honours them that Fears the Lord,</hi> be
they never ſo mean. The Mark of a
truly Great Spirit, is to aſpire after that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33112:20"/>
Nobleſt Attainment, to be Great with
the <hi>Moſt High</hi> himſelf. Not <hi>Lucifer-like,</hi>
to Rival with him; and think to ſet up
for a Great <hi>Some-Body,</hi> for daring to be
exceſſive <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly:</hi> Nor to huff and ſtorm
as the Lofty <hi>Pharoah,</hi> who, (though ſo
big a Man,) was but a ſilly Rebel for
asking, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould
Obey him?</hi> As if it would too much have
undervalued his Worth, to own any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him. So would ſome be thought
more than Men, who perhaps of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
have the leaſt of Men in them.
For let a Man appear never ſo Splendid
abroad, (if the TONGUE be any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi>
of the Mind, and he may diſcover
that Heart to the Ear, which our Eyes
cannot ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) As the Stinking Breath
makes us ſuſpect ſomething Corrupt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
His <hi>Speech Bewrays him</hi> more than
his Face. And the <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> Mouth
ſpeaks his Soul to be even as Black as
Hell: And then he muſt not think it
much, that he is no more honoured, who
will make himſelf ſo Cheap. Or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Caps and Knees and Complements
come in, he may look on all the Reſpect
Men give him, as owing meerly to his
Worldly Appendages about him; out of
which <hi>Theatrical</hi> Gear if he were ſtript,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33112:20"/>
he might, (for any right Worthy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
of his own,) look as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
even as <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Jay.</p>
            <p>METHINKS, Sir, ſuch as have been
Well-Bred, do very ill uſe it, when they
Scurrilouſly Abuſe their Betters, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Him, who is ſo tranſcendently <hi>the
Beſt,</hi> to whom they are Debtors for all
the Advantages that ever they Enjoy above
others. But how can it in truth deſerve
the name of <hi>Good-Breeding,</hi> that does not
ſo much as teach <hi>Good Manners?</hi> And
what Worſe Manners can there be, than
moſt rudely to Treat the Nobleſt Friend
and Benefactor we have in the World?
Has any <hi>Gentleman,</hi> think you, a Licence
to make bolder with God than his pooreſt
inferior ſhould? When <hi>of a Truth, God
is no reſpecter of Perſons; but in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he Accepts the Man</hi> (though of the
loweſt Rank) <hi>that Fears Him and Works
Righteouſneſs;</hi> and in no place will he
accept the Gentleman, or other, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Deſpiſes him, and works Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p>From Noble Organs, Sir, we expect
Harmonious Sounds: and <hi>Veſſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
ſure ſhould not be proſtituted to the
baſeſt uſes. The Foul mouth can never
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33112:21"/>
at all become the fine <hi>Gentleman.</hi> Indeed
no Gentleman can ever Credit ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Sin, which does ſo extreamly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
any man. To feed on the courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Fare, or filthyeſt Traſh, and Carrion
it ſelf, how baſe and unworthy your
<hi>Quality</hi> would you account it? And yet,
if you will abide by the Determination
of the Beſt <hi>Judge</hi> in the World, you muſt
acknowledg that no <hi>Meat which goes</hi> into
the <hi>Mouth,</hi> does ſo much <hi>Defile a man,</hi> as
the Wicked Words which come out of it.
Pardon the Freedom, Sir, of ſuch as make
bold to tell you, That they who count
themſelves ſo much better <hi>Perſons,</hi> ought
to ſet much better <hi>Patterns,</hi> and excell
their Neighbours in Generous Vertue, and
Heroick Piety, as well as in outward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and Dignity, elſe they are Perſons
of ſuch <hi>Quality,</hi> as is little to their Honour.
And many whom they ſcorn for their vile
Parentage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may really prove much the <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Men;</hi> becauſe the more <hi>Sober, Juſt, and
Holy Chriſtians.</hi> Indeed the Better men
are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo much the Worſe they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by doing thus ill: For that nothing
is ſo Bad as the <hi>Corruption</hi> of the Beſt.
And when the <hi>Gentleman-Swearer</hi> ſhall
come to undreſs for another World, he
may wiſh, That not only his Gentility, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33112:21"/>
all Remembrance of it too, were put off
with his Mortality, rather than find it Riſe
up to <hi>Enflame</hi> his Reckoning, that ſuch a
one as he ſhould do ſo naught, whom God
ſo deeply engaged to do better.</p>
            <p>NEVER think then, Sir, That can
at all Excuſe, which does but ſtill Aggrand
the Crime; for the more you are a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi>
the more ſhould you abhor the
thing which Taints your Blood, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the moſt unbecoming thing in the World,
which is, inſtead of paying Honourable
Reſpects where <hi>Honour is due,</hi> to caſt a
rude Contempt on the very <hi>Head Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
of all Honour. If no injury exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſo much as Contempt, and no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
ſo much as that of our Superiors;
(who as they ſhould be moſt Deſerving of
Reſpects, ſo are moſt Senſible of Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement:)
O! what is it then to Deſpiſe
the Great <hi>God</hi> himſelf? The <hi>calling all men
Lyars,</hi> and engaging the whole World
againſt us, were leſs Rude, as well as leſs
Unadviſed than to Affront the Supream
<hi>Majeſty</hi> of the World, and grow upon
him, as if he were a God of Clouts, that
neither Saw, nor Heard, nor would ever
<hi>Viſit</hi> for theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:33112:22"/>
Be not deceived, Sir, As <hi>God is not
Mocked,</hi> to be impoſed upon by the cloſeſt
Hypocrite; ſo neither will he be Braved
to Arreſt Judgment againſt the moſt Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Son of Pride. Such, you know, God

NOW, caſting my ſelf at the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Feet for this <hi>Parrheſia:</hi> That I may
not be miſtaken, for too bold with <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,</hi>
which none can in truth more highly
Honour and Reverence, as the <hi>Ordinance
of God,</hi> and for which I conſtantly do
Bleſs his Name, as one of the eſpecial
Tokens of his Love to the World, in
ſetting up theſe <hi>Shields of the Earth,</hi> to
ſecure us from Wrong and Rapine; to
whom, under God, we owe our Lives,
and all the Good things we can call our

of attaining to live for ever Bleſſed

continual Care and Burden they undergo
upon our Account, and the ſundry Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits

            <p>Let me beg you'll believe me, Sir, That
my Freedom of ſpeaking to you in this
your <hi>Worſhipfull</hi> Capacity, is rather from
an Exceſs, than any Defect of Honour to
your Eminent Station; as being ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned for any thing which to me
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33112:23"/>
ſeems derogating from the Dignity of your
Office, and to weaken that <hi>Authority,</hi> which
I know to be moſt uſefull and neceſſary
for the good of the World, that indeed
my fear of your bringing the ſame into
Contempt, is that which has given me all
this boldneſs, to offer ſomewhat that might
be cautionary to your ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and though every one will not tell
you ſo much, and but few, it may be, go
ſo far with you; yet am I well aſſured,
that herein I ſpeak the ſenſe of many,
much more conſiderable than my ſelf.
The Celebrated Author of the <hi>Gentlemans
Calling</hi> Reaſons to the ſame effect, when
he tells you, That <hi>the Zealous Endeavour of
Reforming your ſelves and others, will reſcue
your Reputation from that</hi> Fouleſt Blot, <hi>of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Agent for Satan; and advance it to the</hi>
higheſt Dignity <hi>of being Serviceable to God:</hi>
So Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> long before; <hi>Fear not
to ſay to the Wicked,</hi> Lift not up your Horn,
<hi>ſo ſhall you preſerve your Perſons and your
Places from being</hi> Baffled and Blurted <hi>by
every Lewd Companion.</hi> Yea, wonder not,
Sir, if upon ſuch in Authority as are your
Partners in this <hi>Guilt,</hi> all Thoughtful men
do charge the Blame of that Impudent
Domineering Wickedneſs, which gives
ſo full a check to the Compleating of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33112:23"/>
thoſe Mercies, wherewith God has been
pleas'd ſo far to Bleſs us already. When
he has Graciouſly opened ſuch a <hi>Fountain
of Juſtice</hi> Above, where does it ſtick, but
at the <hi>Miniſters of Juſtice</hi> Below, if <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Run not down as Waters, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
as a Mighty Stream?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did all the Kings <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> but
Repreſent alſo his Sobriety, Piety, and
every thing in his <hi>Sacred Majeſty,</hi> which
is ſo Highly Praiſe-worthy; ſuch Reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<hi>Mirrors</hi> every where would ſtrike
that Awe and Confuſion into the Wild
Prophane Generation, as might make even
thoſe who <hi>hate to be Reformed,</hi> yet afraid
and aſhamed to be ſo avowedly Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But this ſo much breaks the <hi>Royal</hi>
Deſign for <hi>Reformation of Lives and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
when many of thoſe whom the
King Entruſts and Adjures to Aſſiſt him in
it, (if not obnoxious themſelves, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to abide Cenſure than Inflict it, yet)
are ſo Remiſs in doing their <hi>Lords</hi> Will,
to make the Vile Impious Gang feel their
Power; that theſe dare Swear and Curſe,
and act worſe than the Bruit even juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Faces; and <hi>the Men of Might
can find no Hands,</hi> nor ſo much as a Tongue
or Frown, to make them ſenſible of their
Evil doings: Yea would to God we had
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33112:24"/>
none <hi>Diſaffected</hi> to the Higher Powers
upon this very account; becauſe (in the
Opinion of ſuch) they <hi>take too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them,</hi> in attempting to amend ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as they judge not only tolerable, but
even the Trim Ornaments, and Piquaint
Reliſh of Society.</p>
            <p>Have we none who give Suſpition, that
they would much better like their <hi>Prince</hi>
if he were not ſo ſtiff a Back to the Edge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which he Commands us to turn againſt
this Sin; for how can they, who are ſo
incenſed at their Reprovers, be very well
pleas'd with ſuch as ſet us on, whether
the <hi>Heavenly Majeſty</hi> or his <hi>Vicegerents</hi>
on Earth? The ſnapping at us, does
reflect ſomewhere elſe. And 'tis not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be expected, that ſuch a <hi>Reign</hi>
as caſts diſgrace upon them, ſhould be
heartily liked by them; if we were in worſe
Hands, it might better ſerve their Turns;
But if Scandalous Wickedneſs ſhall not
ſtill be in Requeſt, there's a mighty <hi>Crew</hi>
will hold themſelves aggrieved: Rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doggedly too and fro, and <hi>Grudging
if they be not ſatisfied,</hi> to have it as they
have had it. And no Wonder if Pious
Rulers be Maligned and Stomached by
them; when alas, any ſtrict Regularity is
not only as Shackles, but even <hi>Death</hi> to 'em:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33112:24"/>
To be curtail'd and abridg'd of their lewd
Ranting Liberties, they cannot bear it.</p>
            <p>YOU may have heard of a Time, Sir,
when the fouleſt Extravagancy was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Expreſſion of <hi>Loyalty:</hi> And ſome
of the worſt Mens Wickedneſs was to
paſs for a piece of Allegiance: Yea,
ſuch as boaſted themſelves the KING's
beſt Friends, were ready to break the
Heads of thoſe that refuſed (with Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking) to break the <hi>Kings
Laws:</hi> Speaking againſt ſuch, whoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
put them to ſhame, after the Drink
had put themſelves almoſt paſt ſpeaking.
And all that were againſt their Ryot,
were againſt the <hi>King</hi> ſtreight, and who
would not be of the Confederacy, to be
Traytors to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt down in their
Black Book, for ill Members of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
(The old Nonſence of ſuch
as are hard put to it, ſtill to keep their
hold of thoſe Favourite Sins, which God
and his Meſſengers call them to Turn
from.) Some may hang the head, and
bewail their Misfortune, that thoſe days
are now paſt. But I dare not tell you,
Sir, that I am ſorry for this their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
I muſt rather tell you, I take it for
the great Greivance of all that are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33112:25"/>
and Orderly in the Land, that ſuch
<hi>Evil Doers</hi> are no more ſnub'd and curb'd:
Now they are driven out of their old
<hi>Fatneſs,</hi> and cannot ſhelter their Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Pranks, under the <hi>Kings Name,</hi> can
have no Protection, but from looſe <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi>
when they offer to ſet up again.</p>
            <p>But ſhould we yet after all Miſcarry,
where but at the doors of ſuch Cyphers
and Supine Rulers, (the Pictures of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that repreſent the King but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Effigie)</hi> muſt lye the Blood of a
loſt Nation? When it was put into your
very Hands, to Maul the Topping Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
in Executing thoſe <hi>Good Laws</hi> we
have againſt ſuch Incorrigible Offenders;
and you could not find in your Hearts to
do us ſo much Good, as to Act that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Part: No, the Church might call long
enough, <hi>Who will riſe up for me againſt
the Evill Doers? Who will ſtand up for me
againſt the Workers of Iniquity?</hi> And you
would not be pleaſed (to bear a ſhare
with thoſe truely Great and Senſible <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,</hi>
which, Bleſſed be God we have,
and Rejoyce in them, as ſome of our
Richeſt Treaſure, and look upon them
with Veneration, as Stars of the <hi>Firſt
Magnitude,</hi> and for <hi>Ruling well, count
them Worthy of more than Double Honour.</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:33112:25"/>
And we hope they are not ſo thin ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

an Oſcitant Slackneſs, and Lax Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<hi>(Bearing the Sword in vain,</hi> and
never reflecting on the impudent Sinners,
to expoſe them for Exemplary Sufferers,
nor making them that <hi>do ſo Evil afraid:)</hi>
You even bid the Lewd Companions, <hi>be

            </p>
            <p>LET me beg your Patience, Sir,
while I inſert here ſome Bigger <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi>

That the very <hi>Turks</hi> have the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
Blaſpheming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Execration, and

<hi>Jews</hi> (in their Speculations of the Cauſes of

Backs or in their Purſes, if not in the very

            <p>O! that you would ſet your <hi>Souldiers</hi>

there is no real Kindneſs at all in the caſe,

            <p>Sir, You know better things than to

their Valour in Challenging the

no Cowards, becauſe they can ſo Reſiſt

alone. But they that can be ſo ſottiſh to
think the Great <hi>God even altogether ſuch a

but their Subject: Alas, how will this
their mad Courage be cool'd, when the
Holy one and Juſt, the irreſiſtible Judge of
all the Earth, <hi>(from whoſe face Heaven

viſit and avenge, to <hi>Reprove and ſet all

his <hi>Wrath ſhall be poured out like Fire,</hi>

NOW <hi>knowing theſe Terrors of the Lord,

How many hardned Hearts, that like

            </p>
            <p>To ſlight their Sins, and deride the

are called, only with Patience, and ſome
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33112:34"/>
ſerious Thoughtfulneſs, to Weigh the
Conſiderations, that I have made bold
here to ſet before you. And ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſharpneſs of Expreſſion, herein poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
offend you; would you look upon
it, only as an Overflowing of earneſt
Zeal, you would not deny me your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
Nor for the ſake of ought, that
may not be thought ſo fitly ſaid, deny
your ſelf the Benefit of all the reſt, which
may be neither impertinent nor unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
for you to beſtow a few of your
beſt Thoughts upon.</p>
            <p>O how happy, Sir, ſhould I count my
ſelf, could I but prevail with you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
and abhor the thing, which I am
ſure never did you any good; yea, which
if you ſtick to it, will certainly do you
the moſt great and irreparable Hurt. I
ſpeak to one quick and ſharp to diſcern
between Right and Wrong: O do not,
for want of a little ſober <hi>Recollection,</hi>
degrade your ſelf to a Level with the
dulleſt; ſuffering all your Acuteneſs to fail

becauſe it has nothing but

When God has given you Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33112:34"/>
and many fair Accompliſhments,
to render your Company and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo acceptable: O why will you
ſoyl and deſecrate all your Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Properties, with the Allowance of
that filthy Habit, like a frightful <hi>Bear-Skin,</hi>
to cover 'em? Away with it, Sir,
I beſeech you, and fling it from you
with the greateſt ſcorn and deteſtation.
Let me beg of you by all that ought to
be moſt dear to you, give me not the
trouble of a Repulſe, where, to grant
my Requeſt, you may do your ſelf ſo
great a Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>I am the more importunate, Sir, as
upon your own particular Account, that
I might be inſtrumental, by your leave,
to do you ſome of the beſt ſervice; ſo
for the ſake of the <hi>Publick</hi> too, becauſe,
I moſt heartily concur with you in the
<hi>Deſign,</hi> wherein you are at preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged:
On which our Peace and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and all our happyeſt Intereſts ſo much
depend: And becauſe I take the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Iſſue</hi> of that deſign, ſo much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon our <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
Majeſty of Heaven; eſpecially as
to the Notorious Offences, that ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affront him, and even bid <hi>Defiance</hi> to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33112:35"/>
his Holy <hi>Word.</hi> However, the ſecuring
of your own Soul, (which you know
not how ſoon may be diſpatch'd away
to its Eternal Dwellings, after ſo many
whom you have ſeen cut off before you)
is for certain extreamly concern'd in
your cheerful Complyance with theſe my
earneſt Solicitations.</p>
            <p>IF for <hi>Conſcience</hi> it be, Sir, that you take
up Arms, What is it but evident ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
to ſtruggle ſtill againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in harbouring ſo <hi>known</hi> a Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
And if you enter into War, for
the ſake of Peace, the Divine Promiſe,
is, That <hi>when a Mans Ways pleaſe the
Lord, he will make even his Enemies to be
at Peace with him.</hi> This as far as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Wiſdom ſees fit and Good: But
thus, in any Caſe, you ſhall be ſure of
a far better <hi>Peace,</hi> even that of <hi>GOD:</hi>
And the moſt refreſhing ſerenity and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
of your own Breaſt; which in
vain you may expect, till this curs'd <hi>Make-Bate</hi>
be turned out. And if you go into
the Field ſeeking <hi>Honour;</hi> the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I am ſo urgent for, will bring you
in the Eſteem and Praiſe of all, whoſe
Good Thoughts and Good Words are
worth the having. Yea, 'twill make you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33112:35"/>
Great and <hi>Conſpicuous</hi> in the ſight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it ſelf, where nothing looks big and
renowned, but what is ſubſervient to the
<hi>Divine Glory.</hi> Thus, you ſhall get the
Nobleſt of all <hi>Victories,</hi> That over your
ſelf; and over the Scoffs and Railleries
of that <hi>Embittered Pack,</hi> who ſnarl moſt
at the thing which pleaſes <hi>GOD</hi> beſt:
(Growing to regard their Noiſe no more,
than that of the <hi>Barking Animals.)</hi> And
thus ſhall you Fight, not only for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
of the <hi>People,</hi> or the Favour of
your <hi>Prince,</hi> or the Fulneſs of the World;
but for a <hi>Crown</hi> and a <hi>Throne:</hi> And that
ſuch, to which all the Crowns and Thrones
on Earth are no better than the Fainteſt
<hi>Shadows.</hi> For the Heavenly Glory admits
of no <hi>Hyperbole;</hi> and is too bright for
<hi>Mortal Eye</hi> to behold, too vaſt for Heart
of Man to <hi>Conceive.</hi> How worthy then
of the beſt <hi>Gentlemans</hi> Ambition? And
who can ever do wiſer and nobler, than
to take the <hi>Excellent Way</hi> which leads to
that <hi>Bleſſed End?</hi> Even ſo to Glorifie
<hi>GOD</hi> now, that <hi>GOD</hi> may Glorifie
him forever.</p>
            <p>THAT you may ride on ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
Sir, till you have hewed <hi>Agag</hi> in
pieces, trodden under foot this inveterate
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33112:36"/>
Foe, and every deadly Enemy of your
Soul; and become the Favourite of God,
and triumph in the Everlaſting Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Conquerors</hi> Joy and Glory;
is the worſt, Sir, that I wiſh you, and
