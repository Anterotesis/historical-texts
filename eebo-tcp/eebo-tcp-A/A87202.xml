         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Ireland's Declaration: Being a Remonſtrance of the Generality of the Good People of <hi>IRELAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE need not inſiſt much upon the ſo generally known Calamities of this deplored Iſland, by the want of, or fault in the regiment of our affairs in Church and State, ſince the depoſing firſt, and after (we wiſh we could not ſay) murther of our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good King. Only, as we cannot but aſcribe the paſt, preſent, and impending diſtractions in the three Nations, to the juſt judgment of God upon us in general for our Treaſons and Rebellions againſt his Annointed: So (being truly ſenſible that this Nation was firſt in the wickedneſſe) we think it a duty impending us in particular, firſt to endeavour the expiation of thoſe dreadfull crying ſins of Rebellion and Murther, we ſtand ſo hainouſly guilty of, by doing penance in this ſheet (being at preſent capable of bringing no better a Peace-offering) that ſo we who led others to wickedneſſe, may be likewiſe an example and inducement to their repentance. And therefore (though briefly) moſt ſeriouſly remonſtrate.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That (having duly conſidered the preſent ſtate of Affairs in the three Nations; The Confuſion of Church and State; The Oppreſſion of the People in general, by the Ambition and Avarice of ſome inſatiable, aſpiring perſons that preſide us; The continual ſlavery we have groaned under for theſe Nineteen years, and the viſible and more dreadful Judgements of an angry God ſtill impending, with the true Cauſe, and moſt probable Remedies for the averting Judgement, and healing our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, (We do from our hearts and conſciences diſown, abhor, and deplore that wicked Murther committed upon the late King</hi> Charles <hi>under the ſpecious pretences of Law and Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That we do diſown, and will to the hazard of our lives and fortunes, oppoſe all Authorities whatſoever as uſurp'd and ſacrilegious, but that of King and Parliament, conſiſting of Lords and Commons, according to the ancient fundamental, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, Laws of this Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That we do heartily and abſolutely own</hi> Charles <hi>H. Crowned King of</hi> Scots, <hi>to be rightfully, both by the Laws of God, and the three Nations, undoubted King of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>And that we hold our ſelves engaged by conſcience, duty, and Allegiance, not only to the utmoſt of our power to defend him from the violence and treachery of his Enemies, but withall to endeavour his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration to that Right and Enjoyment of the three Nations he is ſo unjuſtly debarr'd of, under theſe, or ſome other Qualifications of the like nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That he ſhall abſolutely and without exception grant his gracious pardon in general to all and every of his and his Fathers enemies, as to life and Member, for all and all manner of matters and things acted or done in oppoſition to his Father or himſelf, before his eſtabliſhment in the three Nations, be their offences or crimes of what nature ſoever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That a reaſonable reſpect be had to the Purchaſers of Crown or Church-lands, ſo that they may not be damnified by the laying out of their purchaſe-money.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all the Soldiers who ſerve under the Parliament in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or elſewhere, may have ſpeedy ſatisfaction for their Arrears by ſome way and means to be conſider'd of, before the Kings Introduction, and to be ſpecified in certain Articles to be tender'd him upon the ſame. That ſo as far as may be there may be an accommodation with all perſons whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And as we are fully perſwaded that this is the only means under God left us for the healing our breaches and diviſions in ſome meaſure, reſtoring Peace, Trade, and Plenty to this miſerably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and almoſt undone Realm, reſcuing the loſt honour of theſe formerly ſo renowned Kingdoms from reproach and infamy among the neighbour Nations, and averting the ſo viſibly revenging hand of God: ſo we do with all carneſtneſs poſſible invite all thoſe in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> who have any ſpark of Religion, Conſcience, Juſtice, Loyalty, Ingenuity, or common Honeſty, to return with us to their Allegiance, which is the aſſerting of the <hi>Good old Cauſe</hi> indeed, which we firſt generally declared for, but have ſince been biaſſed by Ambition and Intereſt ſo much to Apoſtatize from.</p>
            <closer>Conſented unto, and agreed upon by many thouſands of the good people and honeſt Soldiers of the Kingdom of <hi>IRELAND.</hi>
