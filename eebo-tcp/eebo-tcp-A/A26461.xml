            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Advice to the Confuter of Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
with ſome Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Antiquity of
the Church of England.</head>
            <p>I Apprehend 'tis much eaſier Confuting <hi>Bellarmin</hi> over
a Pot, than by taking Pen in hand and Writing an
Anſwer. And yet I fear, 'tis poſſible by the Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Influence of an Ill Habit, that a Man may have ſo
often knock'd down that <hi>Roman Champion</hi> with a
<hi>Bellarmin thou Lieſt,</hi> under a <hi>Buſh;</hi> that he may be blown up
with a Vanity, of being as Able to meet and overthrow him
in the <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Controverſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I don't pretend, that this is the caſe of him, who has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to Anſwer <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s <hi>Marks of the Church;</hi> but
becauſe I am ſenſible, he has engag'd himſelf in a Task of
ſome Difficulty, I preſume he would willingly ſo diſcharge
himſelf, as not to be thus cenſur'd by Adverſaries; and
upon this ſcore I make bold to preſent him with a ſhort
Advice, which are ſome Obſervations upon his <hi>Second Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
wherein he Examins the <hi>Second Note</hi> of the Church,
<hi>viz. Antiquity;</hi> for the Firſt I had not the luck to ſee.
If they prove ſerviceable in his Undertaking, he'l be oblig'd to
an Unknown Friend; if not; there's only a little Good
Will loſt, and half a Sheet of Paper.</p>
            <p>My Firſt Remark and Advice is, that when he is upon
<hi>Confuting Bellarmin,</hi> he would take care, that what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
to <hi>diſprove,</hi> ſhould be ſomething that <hi>Bellarmin aſſerts;</hi>
otherwiſe 'twill be almoſt impoſſible to Confute him. And
therefore I apprehend, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will be apt to think, that
in the Firſt of the Three things he undertakes to demonſtrate,
viz. <hi>That the Plea of bare Antiquity is not proper to the Church,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64420:3"/>
he has not at all Confuted <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> becauſe <hi>Bellarmin</hi> no
where aſſerts, that it is. He ſays indeed, that whoever at
this time will find out the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> profeſs'd in the
<hi>Creed,</hi> amongſt ſo many Pretenders, muſt not apply himſelf
to any <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtart Congregation,</hi> which was never <hi>Viſible</hi> in the
World but of late Years; but to ſuch a Church, which has
been of as long ſtanding as ever ſince Chriſt and the Apoſtles
days, and conſequently ſuch a Church, to which <hi>Antiquity</hi>
of neceſſity at this time belongs. This <hi>Bellarmin</hi> aſſerts;
but he no were ſays that <hi>Bare Antiquity</hi> is a Note of Truth.
And ſo the Confuting of this, will be thought only a knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of an <hi>Imaginary Principle</hi> of the <hi>Anſwerers</hi> own
raiſing, but no Confuting of <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> And this leads me
to my,</p>
            <p>2. Advice, That when he Confutes <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> he would
not ſay the <hi>ſame thing</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> do's: Which yet he
ſeems unluckily to do in this Paper, <hi>p.</hi> 45. where having
own'd, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> by the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Church,
means that the <hi>True Church muſt neceſſarily be Ancienter than
the Falſe; as God was before the Devil;</hi> he takes pains to
explicate and prove the very ſame thing, and thus ſtrangely
ſeems to Anſwer <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> by ſhewing from <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> that what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays is true; and that <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
as by him explicated, muſt of neceſſity belong to the True
<hi>Catholic Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That he would be Cautious, not to Fight againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
while he's earneſt upon Confuting <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> And
therefore when he thinks he has made it out, <hi>p. 42. That
Antiquity is not a Note proper to the Church, becauſe there was
a time when the Church was New.</hi> He do's not do prudently
within three pages after, (<hi>p.</hi> 45.) to aſſert, That the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
are the <hi>True Antiquity.</hi> Becauſe every one of his <hi>Freſh
Men in Learning,</hi> will begin to argue, That if with this Man,
<hi>Antiquity</hi> cannot belong to the <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe there was a
time, when the Church was <hi>New;</hi> How can he ſay, it truly
belongs to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſince there was a time when the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> were <hi>New</hi> as well as the <hi>Church?</hi> This will not
ſeem proper Arguing for a <hi>Confuter</hi> of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> eſpecially
ſince every body knows, that the <hi>Church</hi> was before the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64420:3"/>
               <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Written Word;</hi> and that if <hi>Antiquity</hi> do's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to what was <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'twill be very difficult to make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the <hi>Latter,</hi> which was not in being till ſome years
after.</p>
            <p>4. That he would be careful not to <hi>Contradict</hi> himſelf: And
therefore, methinks, when he has aſſerted <hi>abſolutely</hi> p. 42.
<hi>That Antiquity is not a Note proper to the Church,</hi> it does not
make good Muſic with <hi>p.</hi> 45. where he has found out an
<hi>Antiquity,</hi> which <hi>is</hi> proper to the <hi>Church. This laſt ſort of
Antiquity</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is the ſame with what is,</hi> Firſt: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto
which we are deſirous to go, to which we are willing to ſtand, and
by which we would be judged:</hi> Is not this ſomething like ſaying,
<hi>Antiquity IS, and IS NOT proper to the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That in Quoting <hi>Fathers,</hi> he would only make choice
of ſuch as ſeem to be <hi>againſt</hi> his Adverſaries, and not Thoſe
which <hi>Favor</hi> them. And therefore when he is drawing up his
Plea againſt <hi>Antiquity p.</hi> 47. he might very well have omitted
one, which Supports his Adverſaries, and is the very ground
of what they maintain, and he oppoſes. The words are
theſe; <hi>There is a ſhort way for Religious and Simple Minds to
find out what is Truth; For if we return to the Beginning and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of Divine Tradition, Human Error ceaſes. Thither let
us return to our Lord's Original, the Evangelical Beginning, the
Apoſtolical Tradition: And hence let the Reaſon of our Act ariſe,
from whence Order and the Beginning aroſe.</hi> Is not this plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>Antiquity,</hi> inſtead of writing againſt it? Is not this
the very Doctrin of <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> and the ſetting up the very
<hi>Tradition,</hi> which <hi>Catholics</hi> appeal to, whilſt the way to find
out the Truth, according to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> is by following
<hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition?</hi> What's this againſt <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
or his <hi>Antiquity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to the Second thing he intends to prove, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vainly pretends to True
Antiquity, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>Ancient Truth.</hi> And in the Peruſal of
this I muſt adviſe him,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That when he treats of any <hi>Church</hi> or Body of Men,
he would not forget <hi>Good manners,</hi> and <hi>Ordinary Civility:</hi> As
he ſeems to have done <hi>p.</hi> 49. where he is not contented to
charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Errors</hi> only, but, in plain
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64420:4"/>
Engliſh, with <hi>LIES</hi> too. As if he thought an Argument
would not ſound well in <hi>Controverſie,</hi> unleſs 'twere put in
the <hi>Billings-gate-phraſe.</hi> But he proves the whole Charge
thus <hi>Ib.</hi> That Church has not the Mark of True Antiquity,
which does not hold the ſame Chriſtian Doctrin, it did at
the beginning, but has introduc'd Errors and Lies, under the
pretence of Ancient Truth. But this is the caſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as is evident by that Alteration they
have made in the Antient Creed: Unto which they have
added as many more Articles as there were at firſt: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
Upon the Conſideration of which Proof I adviſe him,</p>
            <p>2. Not to be ſo blindly earneſt in kicking down the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to overthrow his own at the ſame Blow. For if
the Addition of Articles to the <hi>Ancient Creed,</hi> takes off all
claim to the Ancient Truth, what becomes of the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> which beſides the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds,
has another of a latter date of <hi>Nine and Thirty Articles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
another <hi>Plot-Creed</hi> call'd the <hi>Teſt?</hi> Can ſhe be the <hi>Ancient
Church,</hi> which had only one <hi>Creed,</hi> and but <hi>Twelve</hi> Articles?</p>
            <p>3. That he would not advance Abſurdities, whilſt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to ſhew <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Ratiocination to be but Sophiſtry.
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhews, that in all <hi>great changes of Religion,</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
of the <hi>change</hi> may be aſſign'd, the <hi>New Doctrin</hi> that
was brought in, the <hi>Time</hi> when it began, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſince theſe cannot be ſhewn in any change pretendedly
charg'd upon the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> there was never any ſuch
change. This the Confuter undertakes to prove Notoriouſly
Falſe; becauſe, ſays he, <hi>the Body Spiritual, is like the Body
Natural,</hi> and therefore as a Man may be worn away with a
Conſumption to Skin and Bone, tho' no body can tell the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
time, when or where his Blood began to be tainted: So
the whole Body of the <hi>Church</hi> may be corrupted with <hi>Error</hi>
and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> tho' it crept in ſo ſecretly at firſt, and ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably,
that 'twas not ſuſpected. And what's this to the
purpoſe? This ſhews indeed that a Great Change of Religion
may be unknown as to it's <hi>beginning,</hi> while as yet 'tis work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Secret</hi> and <hi>Indiſcernable;</hi> for what wonder for things
while <hi>Indiſcernable</hi> not to be ſeen? But dos it prove, that
when the <hi>Change</hi> or <hi>Alteration</hi> began <hi>publickly</hi> to be Abetted,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64420:4"/>
Maintain'd, Propagated, appearing in open Contradiction and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to the True Church, condemning it's Doctrin, and oppoſing
the Articles of her Faith as Erroneous and Heretical; that then ſuch
an <hi>Alteration</hi> in Religion could ſpread it ſelf over the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World, and yet the Authors, Promoters, Abetters, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracers
of it, not to be known, or taken Notice of? Let him prove
but this, and he'll come to the Point. We don't doubt, but the
<hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Innovation</hi> may, like the <hi>Tares</hi> in the Goſpel, lie for ſome
time <hi>under ground,</hi> and not be taken notice of, while in all outward
appearance they are not diſcernable from the <hi>Good Corn.</hi> But that
they ſhould <hi>grow up, choke</hi> the <hi>Wheat,</hi> every where <hi>break it down</hi>
and <hi>conſume</hi> it, and yet not be ſeen or diſcern'd, this he'll never prove
out of the Goſpel. What kind of Servants muſt the Houſholder
have, to ſuppoſe this Abſurdity? And yet upon this ground ſtands
our <hi>Confuter</hi> and his Whole Church of <hi>England.</hi> She to wipe off
the ſoul guilt of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> crys out; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has Err'd,
and made Innovations; therefore we left her. And what Errors
and Innovations are theſe? <hi>Why She has brought in an Idolatry worſe
than that of the Heathens, Infinite Superſtitions, Abominations; coyn'd
New Articles of Faith, contrary to all Senſe and Reaſon, Stupid Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,
Abſurd and Senſeleſs Doctrins, Fooliſh Doctrins, Monſtrous
Doctrins,</hi> &amp;c. This is a very ſevere Charge, and the Crimes of
which ſhe ſtands Endicted, are obvious to every <hi>Ordinary Reaſon,</hi> and
<hi>Weak Chriſtian.</hi> Well, but how long has ſhe been polluted with
theſe Doctrins? <hi>With ſome, Six hundred years, with others Nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
Eleven hundred, Thirteen hundred years. And theſe Errors ſhe
propagated over the whole Chriſtian World, and with them infected all the
Kings of the Earth.</hi> Well, but did not the <hi>True Church of Chriſt</hi>
ſtand up againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> while ſhe thus left the Faith,
and corrupted the Faithful? Where was the <hi>Church of England</hi> all
this time? Did not ſhe withſtand theſe Abominations, <hi>Preach</hi> and
make <hi>Laws</hi> againſt them and the Abetters? Did ſhe aſſemble no <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
Synods</hi> or <hi>Convocations</hi> to Cenſure and Condemn them? No,
there was no Church viſibly appear'd to oppoſe the Growth of <hi>Popery,</hi>
it ſpread <hi>Inviſbly,</hi> it infected all Chriſtians <hi>Inſenſibly,</hi> and ſo came
down all over Chriſtendom <hi>Imperceptibly</hi> to the days of <hi>Luther,</hi> who
oppos'd it vigorouſly; tho' neither He, nor the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
(as many are apt to think) have ſo proſecuted thoſe Errors, but
they continue <hi>infected</hi> with a great many of them ſtill, and don't
know it or perceive it. Strange and Wonderful News; What's the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64420:5"/>
               <hi>Forty thouſand Pilgrims,</hi> and the <hi>Army in Incognito</hi> to this Relation?
<hi>Oates</hi>'s <hi>Narrative</hi> is not half ſo big with Abſurdities, as this Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Story of Changes and Alterations over the whole Chriſtian
World, and yet <hi>Inviſible</hi> and <hi>Inſenſible.</hi> The Errors, it ſeems,
brought in and propagated by <hi>Papiſts</hi> in thoſe <hi>Alterations of Religion,</hi>
are now ſo <hi>Palpable,</hi> ſo <hi>Evident,</hi> ſo <hi>Clear;</hi> that 'tis not only every
<hi>Beardleſs Divine</hi> can diſprove them, and ſhew them to be Ridiculous;
but every Smatterer in Controverſie, every Tinker and Cobler ſees
them to be againſt Senſe and Reaſon forſooth, and undertakes to
prove them Abſurd and Fooliſh. And yet theſe ſo <hi>Palpable, ſo Plain
and Evident Errors</hi> were receiv'd over the whole Chriſtian World
without the Oppoſition of the <hi>True Church</hi> of Chriſt for above a
Thouſand Years. What! Never a <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Diſputant
never a Cobler, Tinker, never a Divine,</hi> all this time, to ſhew and
Confute theſe Errors? Where was this <hi>Pure Church of</hi> England all
this while? This Church, which our <hi>Confuter of Bellarmin,</hi> is ſure
is the <hi>True Ancient Church;</hi> where was ſhe, when theſe <hi>Errors,</hi> were
every where taught, publikly profeſs'd and propogated? Could ſhe
not then <hi>See</hi> Errors ſo Plain and Obvious? But how ſhould ſhe <hi>See,</hi>
when her <hi>Nine days</hi> were not out till a Thouſand years after? But
the Confuter has found out Changes in Religion which grew <hi>inſenſibly;</hi>
as the <hi>Communion in one kind:</hi> And concerning this,</p>
            <p>4. I adviſe him in his next, to prove that a Diverſity of <hi>Practice,</hi>
is an <hi>Alteration in Religion.</hi> And eſpecially of ſuch a Practice, which
Chriſt left <hi>indifferent</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Laity,</hi> and without any <hi>Poſitive
Command</hi> of their receiving it in <hi>both kinds;</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> owns, who
ſays, that <hi>in this Point Chriſt has left no Neceſſary Precept.</hi> In Ep. ad
Bohem. And in his Book <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>traque ſpecie. If you come</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>to a place where the Sacrament is given only in One kind, receive it in one.</hi>
The like Indifferency is acknowledg'd by <hi>Melancthon. Centur. Ep.
Theol. p. 252. Spalatenſis</hi> too, for whom I preſume the <hi>Confuter</hi> has
ſome reſpect, <hi>l. 5. c. 6. de Repub. Eccleſ.</hi> has theſe words; <hi>I affirm
that the Receiving the Sacrament in Both kinds is not ſo under a Precept,
but upon a conſiderable cauſe, tho' Private and of Private Perſons, it may
profitably and lawfully be receiv'd under the Species of Bread alone.</hi> And
certainly what <hi>Private Perſons</hi> may <hi>lawfully</hi> do, when they judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
as this Author <hi>Ib.</hi> ſays, <hi>Exempla Antiqua docent, is evident
from the Practice of the Ancients,</hi> cannot be unlawful in the <hi>Church:</hi>
And may be done without any <hi>Alteration in Religion.</hi> Beſides this he
has found another <hi>change in Religion and Faith,</hi> viz. concerning the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64420:5"/>
               <hi>Papal Authority;</hi> and here he pretends to ſhew, by whom this was
brought into the Church. <hi>Victor,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p. 53. Began the Dance,</hi>
Zozimus <hi>followed it;</hi> Celeſtine <hi>carried it on:</hi> And in relation to
this,</p>
            <p>5. I adviſe him to be cautious for the future, how he goes ſo far
back into the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> to look for <hi>Authors</hi> of pretended <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations</hi>
in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Becauſe it being Generally believ'd,
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncorrupt</hi> in thoſe Firſt Ages,
his Readers will be apt to think, that what was then Practis'd and
own'd by thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, was no Error or <hi>Alteration,</hi> but
an <hi>Apoſtolical Truth;</hi> and that he that comes above fifteen hundred
years after, and urges ſuch a Charge againſt thoſe times, muſt have
no ſmall ſtock of <hi>confidence.</hi> For how can Men poſſibly think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
when they conſider, that Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> who is here endicted,
liv'd in the Second Century, and was choſen to that See of <hi>Rome</hi> in
the Year 203. which was above an hundred and twenty Years before
the Firſt General Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> The <hi>Some Others</hi> he there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as Maintainers of the <hi>Papal Authority,</hi> together with <hi>Zozimus</hi>
and <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> were all Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> either before or in the time
of the Firſt Four <hi>General Councils</hi> Receiv'd and acknowledg'd here
in <hi>England.</hi> And can any Man think, that if the Excerciſe of that
<hi>Authority,</hi> as maintain'd by thoſe <hi>Popes,</hi> was ſuch an <hi>Alteration,</hi> ſuch
an <hi>Innovation,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Tyranny,</hi> as 'tis now pretended, that thoſe <hi>Firſt
Councils,</hi> of ſo many Learned and Orthodox Prelates, would have
taken no notice of it? Is it not likely, in thoſe Aſſemblies there
were ſome as Zealous for preventing <hi>Innovations,</hi> ſome as Wiſe and
Learned, and Underſtanding in the Scriptures as our <hi>Church-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
are now a days? Or did there want in thoſe <hi>Councils,</hi> ſome
<hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Lay-men,</hi> a Learned Tradeſman, ſome Quick-ſighted-penetrating
Barber, or perchance a <hi>Lecturer</hi> or <hi>Confuter of
Bellarmin,</hi> to put thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> in mind of their Duty, and tell 'em
of the <hi>Alteration</hi> brought into the Church; to ſhew 'em Victor <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Dance,</hi> Zozimus <hi>following it, and</hi> Celeſtine <hi>carrying it on?</hi>
Well, theſe are very hard things; and certainly, he that believes
theſe, and afterwards pretends to boggle at <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> muſt
needs be a Diſſembler. And the Abſurdity of this pretence ſtill
grows the more Monſtrous, when we reflect that St. <hi>Irenaeus, Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Auguſtin,</hi> and other Antient Fathers, urge the continu'd Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of theſe very Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as an Argument of the True,
Orthodox Faith and Religion profeſs'd in that Church; without
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64420:6"/>
the leaſt mention or hint of any ſuch pretended <hi>Alteration.</hi> And
<hi>Fulk, Calvin,</hi> with other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſay that theſe Fathers ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nam'd the Succeſſion of Biſhops in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> continued all that time in the Doctrin of the
Apoſtles, as it was founded by them. And yet now at laſt, when it
is to ſerve the turn, theſe ſame Biſhops muſt be branded, as the
Setters up and Promoters of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi> But what
better ſhift can thoſe make, who cannot juſtifie themſelves, but in
condemning the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> The only way they have to look
<hi>Fair</hi> is by Blackning her, and what wonder they are ſo induſtrious,
in throwing dirt in her Face? Beſides this the <hi>Confuter</hi> has brought
a Third Inſtance of Alteration in the Church of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> The
creeping in of <hi>Images</hi> into the Church; And in reference to this,</p>
            <p>6. I adviſe him to conſider better for the future, what Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he charges upon the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> eſpecially not to mention
ſuch, which, if to the purpoſe, would as certainly lay his <hi>own Church</hi>
and <hi>cauſe</hi> upon their backs, as he thinks he dos the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
For here among the <hi>Alterations</hi> relating to <hi>Images,</hi> he ſays the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
uſe</hi> of them came not into Churches till above 300 Years after
Chriſt; and the <hi>Rhetorical uſe</hi> of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtirring up De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
not till 300 Years more, and for this reaſon, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he condemns the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Innovation</hi> in Religion.
And yet theſe very <hi>Practices</hi> are allow'd too by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> confeſſes in his <hi>Appeal to Caeſar,</hi> c. 19. 20. 21.
who likewiſe beſides this, <hi>Ib.</hi> approves the giving <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi>
to them, as was done by <hi>Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>in Rememoration, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
repreſentment of the Prototypes.</hi> Now if this uſe of <hi>Images</hi>
leaves the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without all Title to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> what
better has the Church of <hi>England?</hi> If this be enough to un-church
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> dos it not at leaſt make the Church of <hi>England</hi>
Stagger? But if theſe <hi>Practices</hi> and the like be enough with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer,</hi>
to charge a <hi>Church</hi> with the Guilt of <hi>Innovation</hi> and <hi>Alteration</hi>
in Religion, I believe againſt the next Edition, he may eaſily find
more of the like Nature to add to his Margin; <hi>viz.</hi> the wearing the
<hi>Surplice,</hi> the <hi>Cope</hi> and <hi>Lawn Sleeves;</hi> the ſaying of <hi>Litanies</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer,</hi>
with many others, which were not all practic'd from
the time of the Apoſtles, but are of a more modern date.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the chief Remarks I obſerv'd in the peruſal of this Paper;
if the <hi>Confuter</hi> will but conſider them well, I may expect his next
to come out more exact, at leaſt as far as his <hi>cauſe</hi> will bear. I have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64420:6"/>
only one thing more to obſerve, and that is his Concluſion; in which,
after he has Confuted (as he thinks) all the claim of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> he aſſerts the <hi>Church of</hi> England, <hi>as eſtabliſh'd by
Law,</hi> for the only True, <hi>Antient, Primitive Church.</hi> And this is a
thing I cannot tell poſſibly which way to make Senſe of. For how
can this Church of <hi>England,</hi> which ſtarted into the World only an
hundred and fifty years ago, be the <hi>True, Antient, Primitive Church
of Chriſt,</hi> which has been viſibly extant in the World, above theſe
ſixteen hundred years, ever ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles? Where
were her <hi>Paſtors,</hi> her <hi>Teachers,</hi> her <hi>Prelates,</hi> for a thouſand years
before <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth? Where were her <hi>Nine and Thirty Articles,</hi>
her <hi>Homilies,</hi> her <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> her <hi>Teſt?</hi> Don't every body
know, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles had never a hand in theſe, they
being all fram'd of late years; the <hi>Where,</hi> the <hi>When,</hi> the <hi>By Whom,</hi>
and the <hi>Wherefore</hi> being as well known, as the way to the <hi>Parliament-houſe.</hi>
Tis true, the <hi>Act</hi> in Confirmation of the <hi>Firſt Common-Prayer
Book</hi> ſays, that this Book was compil'd by the <hi>Aid of the
Holy Ghoſt:</hi> But the Great <hi>Alterations</hi> and <hi>Additions</hi> that were made
by the ſame Parliament, in the ſame Kings Reign, even in things of
Weight and Moment, are enough to make any Man Jealous; and to
ſuſpect that that Holy Spirit which is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable,</hi> was not very
particularly aſſiſtant in ſuch a <hi>Changeable</hi> Matter; and that if the
Parties concern'd had ſeriouſly thought, it had been effected by his
<hi>Aid,</hi> they had not ſo ſoon applied themſelves to the mending it.
As to this <hi>Church</hi> therefore, as far as concerns it's being <hi>Eſtabliſh'd
by Law,</hi> the World knows when 'twas done; and that as <hi>Eſtabliſh'd
by Law</hi> it ſometimes <hi>Pray'd for the Dead,</hi> and as <hi>Eſtabliſh'd by Law</hi>
it dos not <hi>Pray for the Dead.</hi> But where this Church was before
'twas Eſtabliſh'd by Law, that is not ſo eaſie to tell. We know that
<hi>this Church ſeparated</hi> from the whole Body of Chriſtians, and that it
<hi>joyn'd</hi> to no <hi>Congregation</hi> of Believers or <hi>Church</hi> then in being; if it
did, let it be ſhewn, to which: If it did not, we muſt judge it as
<hi>Modern</hi> and <hi>Novel,</hi> as the <hi>Separation;</hi> and if She be True, that there
was before that time no <hi>True Church</hi> of Chriſt in being throughout
the whole Chriſtian World, which is as <hi>Abſurd</hi> as well can be. Let
not the <hi>Confuter</hi> therefore boaſt too much of his Church's <hi>Antiquity;</hi>
'tis not enough to pretend, that She believes the <hi>Creed,</hi> but 'tis to be
prov'd, that She believes it entirely and fully in that Senſe, as 'twas
taught by the Apoſtles and profeſs'd by the Primitive Church; this
ſhe muſt ſhew as to thoſe Four Articles, <hi>He deſcended into Hell, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64420:7"/>
The Holy Catholic Church, The Communion of Saints, The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of Sins:</hi> She muſt ſhew likewiſe, that beſides believing the
<hi>Creed,</hi> She <hi>Denies</hi> nothing of what was taught by the Apoſtles, and
was the Belief of the Pure and Primitive Church. He that denies
all the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> may ſay he believes the <hi>Creed,</hi> and yet he is
not of the Church of Chriſt. He that ſhou'd ſubſcribe <hi>Negative
Articles,</hi> in the denial of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Neceſſity of God's
Grace,</hi> may boaſt he believes the <hi>Creed,</hi> and yet is nothing better
than a <hi>Pelagian.</hi> He that will be a True Member of Chriſts Church,
muſt believe the Catholic Faith <hi>Wholly</hi> and <hi>Entirely,</hi> as we profeſs
in the <hi>Athanaſian Creed.</hi> Let him prove this of the <hi>Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and then he'll ſhew her to be the Antient Church. But alas!
When this Pure and Entire Belief is denied to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
notwithſtanding her Continu'd Succeſſion of Biſhops and Paſtors
from Chriſt's time to this, and her determining nothing, but in a
<hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of thoſe <hi>Prelates,</hi> whoſe charge it was to do it:
Who can believe, that this is found in the <hi>Church of</hi> England, who
awaking out of a thouſand years ſleep, of <hi>Ignorance, Errors,</hi> and
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> as they own; in a confuſion and hurry of affairs jump'd
into this <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Entire</hi> Faith of Chriſt in the <hi>Parliament-houſe,</hi> by
the help of a few Biſhops, Divines and Laymen? Certainly if the
Biſhops of the whole Chriſtian World err'd for above a thouſand
years, notwithſtanding their frequent Meetings and Conferences
about Faith and Religion, 'tis very hard to believe, that our <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
did not <hi>Err;</hi> eſpecially when the <hi>Spirit</hi> that mov'd in thoſe
times of <hi>Reforming,</hi> had ſo much of <hi>Luſt, Avarice, Rapine, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and Sacriledge,</hi> that 'tis not likely it ſhould <hi>protect</hi> from <hi>Error,</hi>
but rather lead them to it: And if it did not, let thoſe believe it
that can.</p>
