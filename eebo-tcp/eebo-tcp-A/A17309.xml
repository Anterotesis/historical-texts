         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Also throughout the Book, where he finds the word <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,</hi> he would haue <hi>Priest</hi> put in stead thereof; such an enemy is he to the very name of <hi>Minister,</hi> as if he would haue the world belieue, he had rather be a popish Priest, then a Minister of the better Testament, as Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is called, or a Minister of <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Apostles were called,<note place="margin">2.

But Madam (if I may be so bold with your Ladiship) will your honour be stirring so soone, as by eight in the morning?</p>

               <p>Madam, I am possessed with an exceeding wonderment, that this Booke should find such entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and approbation in the Court, especially among (pardon my rudenesse) you Court-Ladyes, being so full, I say not of complements, but of many imployments, chiefely your selfe. Yea the verie curiosities of Courtly attires, and the varieties of fashions, which not onely must be followed with the first, but studied also to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Court credit, are they not enough to take vp all one forenoone? And then Madam where will you find time for your Matins, and other houres of Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which this Booke imposeth vpon you? What? Will the Author of this Booke make the Court a Monasterie, or Nunnerie? Would he haue the Ladyes and Mayds of Honour to turne Nunnes? What? Nothing almost, but euerie houre of the day, to turne ouer and ouer your Beads? This were a strange Metamorphosis, for Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers


<pb facs="tcp:21729:9"/>
thus to keepe holy day. And therefore Madam, I wonder, that the Court, of all other, cryeth not downe such a Booke as this. Nay Madam, seeme to approue it as much as you will, yet you can neuer perswade the simplest Rusticke, that you Courtiers are, or can be euer a whit the deuouter for all this Booke. For it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to practice one quarter of it. And taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you the obseruation of such canonicall rules, as stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with possibilitie to keepe, either you must get a dispensation to remit the rigour of them, and to admit of such a practise of deuotion, as either your Court-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or disposition can conueniently, or but indifferently performe: Or otherwise you must be driuen of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie either daily to goe to shrift for absolution, or to chawke vp all your defects and failings for your generall shrift: Wherein, and for which, such penance may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon you, as you shall hardly determine, whither of the two is more grieuous, to obserue the rules for your deuotion, or to satisfie for the penaltie.</p>

But Madam, what would you haue vs to doe in this case? We poore Ladyes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of the Court, are in a great strait. We are pressed on the one side with importune impossibilities, as you say: On the other, with the vrgent examples of Romane-Catholicke Ladyes, among whom we conuerse, who presse vs with their exemplarie practise of pietie and</hi> deuotion <hi>in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, putting vs and our Religion to shame, if we doe not equalize at least, if not outstrip them in point of</hi> deuotion.</p>

Therefore Madam, if I may aduise you, away with this idle Apish Booke of Popish <hi>Deuotion</hi>; suffer not either your Court, or your Christian libertie so to be imposed vpon with such obseruations, as are either impossible, and at the best, perhaps vnprofitable; as whereof it may be said, <hi>Who required these things at your hands?</hi> But I feare I am too bold with your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship.

for the <hi>Spanish</hi>-faction, working by his <hi>Indian</hi>-Gold, the Storie sufficiently toucheth. But this by the way.

Onely that King caused to be published sundry Bookes of <hi>Deuotion,</hi> yet all of one meale: But this Booke hath no fellow, must alone be published for a singular and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Platforme of all Deuotion, silencing and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing all other Bookes of the like n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that we had now already at <hi>London</hi> a Booke of <hi>Seuen Sacraments</hi> publickly allowed.

First for the ancient Church of CHRIST; No Church did anciently obserue, or precisely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe these Seuen houres of prayer, duely and daily to be vsed, as the Authour or Athours would beare vs in hand. How ancient I pray you is this Canonicall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation? Forsooth Pope PELAGIVS the Second was the first instituter of the Seuen houres; and that was towards 600 yeeres after CHRIST. This some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ancient. But what authoritie haue we for it? PAMELIVS vpon CYPRIAN saith, <hi>They say so,</hi> that this PELAGIVS was the first instituter. Onely, <hi>They say so.</hi> Though POLYDOR VIRGIL speake a little more confidently. <hi>Satis constat, It is apparant enough</hi>; but tells vs not whence. Nor doe I find this <hi>Septenary</hi> to be more ancient, then Pope GREGORY the Ninth,<note place="margin">

He indeed sets downe the Seuen houres, in the Title of his Chapter (iust as truly, as our Authour in the Title of his Booke) deriuing the same from some spring of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and namely,<note place="margin">

morning, and euening. So that the best authoritie, and hoariest antiquitie for your Seuen canonicall houres, is GREGORY the Ninth, Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is that ancient Church, wherein this practise appeareth first to be decreed, and solemnely obserued. This Pope then first decreed the Seuen canonicall houres. But of whom to be obserued? Namely, of the <hi>Priests, Friers, Monkes,</hi> and such like holy-day-persons, for the most part <hi>Male feriati homines,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> could afford <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of others he saith nothing, saith the glosse; although it say, <hi>Others seeme not to be bound, but surely they are.</hi> But the <hi>Priests, Monkes,</hi> and other <hi>Votaries</hi> were speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bound to keepe them constantly. Which seemes to be the reason why it is probable, that some haue coniectured PELAGIVS the Second to haue beene the first institutor. For about his time did all kind of Monkes, and such like Orders begin exceedingly to be multiplyed; many of them taking vpon them such a strict discipline, as might admit, yea in some sort neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily require so many Canonicall <hi>Houres of Prayer,</hi> at least to refresh the tediousnesse of that austeritie, wherewith they exercised their extreame patience. Some Monkes were called <hi>Insomnes,</hi>

Others coopt themselues vp, in such short and narrow, and low Cells, as vneath they could either lye along, or stand vpright; so that the best and easiest posture for them, was to be on their knees praying. Others forsaking humane societie, and liuing among the wild Beasts, called therefore <hi>Armenta,</hi> Droues, or Heards, feeding on roots and grasse, and lodging <hi>sub Dio,</hi> or in the Caues, what could they doe else, but (if they had so much sense left them) pray?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21729:14"/>Now, seeing our Authour will needs reuiue and recommend to the Church of <hi>England</hi> these his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Canonicalls: Vpon whom will hee impose their obseruation? Vpon Courtiers? Alas, they are taken vp with a thousand thoughts, perhaps, how to rise higher; perhaps, how to keepe their standing; perhaps, how to preuent and take off enuie; perhaps, how to appease such an Opposite; perhaps, how to purchase such a Friend; perhaps, how to compasse such a preferment; but specially the Female sex, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combred with a thousand womanish Ceremonies, if not <hi>State-proiects,</hi> or their owne honours (as I heard once a great Lady of the Court say, there was neuer a day went ouer their heads, but once at least their heart aked) so as they cannot attend such tedious Canonicall Seruice. Or Citizens, or Countrey-men? They haue their vocations to follow, which if they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit, to say ouer this Booke of Deuotion daily, and duely, as it prescribes, how should they liue? Except ye could perswade them to a thinner diet and courser habite, too good an allowance for an idle life. Or will you impose it vpon the Priests, or Ministers of the Church? But you know our golden Priests (I meane in the best sense) are not like those woodden Ones in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hauing little else to doe, but to say ouer their Masse, or a few Mattens, had need to be exercised with Canonicall houres, to keepe them at least from worse exercises. But you know, most Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are labourious in their calling, who if they should precisely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uerie day say ouer your Booke of Deuotion, they should haue little time left to prepare conuenient Food for their Flockes on the <hi>Lords day.</hi> Although perhaps you could be content to dispense with that; Nay rather, if yee will needs inforce your <hi>Houres</hi> vpon vs, lay them vpon dumbe Priests, such as either cannot, or


<pb facs="tcp:21729:15"/>

               </gap>ast will not preach the Word to their people. These being the men, that cry so much for long prayers, and short preaching, you might doe well to bring them to a <hi>Canonicall obedience</hi> of your <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall houres,</hi> and that they performe the same not by Proxie, or Curacie, but in their owne persons. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if you cannot find Holy-day-men enough to take your Booke to taske, what doth it import else, but a necessitie of bringing in Monkerie, and so of erecting Cells againe, for the practise of your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion?</hi> Which I trust all your Deuotion will neuer bring to passe.</p>
            <p>In the second place, from the practise of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, the Authour descends to defend his <hi>Septiformious Deuotion</hi> to be <hi>Much after the manner published by authoritie of Quéene</hi> ELIZABETH, 1560. <hi>Much after the manner,</hi> is indeed a prettie qualification of the matter: Much-what, not so altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But for your <hi>Much, Distingue tempora</hi>; Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the times. That <hi>Horarie</hi> the Authour speakes of, was set out neere the first yeere of her Raigne, when as Poperie was not buried, nor the Gospell out of her Cradle. That noble Queene of euer blessed memorie, in the beginning of her Raigne, did for the present prudently conniue at, and act some things, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by degrees she suffered to vanish. For the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: In the verie beginning of her Raigne, before her first Parliament, she set forth a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> inhibiting all Ministers in and about <hi>London,</hi> and else-where, to preach at all, lesse or more, but onely to read Seruice, vntill further order from her Maiestie. Is this a good argument for the Author, or any his Fautors by his see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>deuotion</hi> of making many long prayers, to sholder preaching out of the Church, or to wayne the people from hearing, because forsooth, QU. ELIZAB. once by Proclamation prohibited preaching, and allowed onely reading of Seruice? But how long lasted this restraint?


<pb facs="tcp:21729:15"/>
No longer then the Parliament approaching, wherin was most happily established the liberty of preaching the Gospell, and administring the Sacraments. Take another example, in the dawning of the Gospell in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her time, in King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. his raigne: The Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> in his English Primer 1535. in the Preface be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Letany, apologizing his leauing out of the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in his former Primer, saith, <hi>wherefore, for the contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such weake minds, and somewhat to beare their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, I haue now at this my second Edition of the said Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, caused the Letany to be printed, and put into the same, &amp;c.</hi> Marke, <hi>for the contentation of weake mindes.</hi> Thus in the Primitiue Church some things were tolerated during the infancy of it, which afterwards were quite abolished; as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. The abstaining from <hi>blood, and strangled,</hi> was inioyned the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for a time. And why? for saith S. <hi>Iames,</hi> verse 21. <hi>Moses of old time hath in euery City them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues euery Sabboth day</hi>: so that for offending the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> among whom they liued, must for a time forbear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:21729:16"/>
these times of the cleare light of the Gospell, and full growth of the Church would be ridiculous. <hi>When I was a child</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>I did as a child, I imagined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a child; but being a man, J put away childish things.</hi> Were it not absurd and ridiculous for a man growne, to fall to his old childish sports and toyes againe? And we know that suddain changes from one extreme to another, euen from euill to good in a State, are difficult, if not dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not discretly carried. Nor could it be expected, that the Church hauing beene long pent vp as it were in a dungeon, and comming suddenly forth into the broad light, but it should at first bee tender-sighted, till after a while her eyes were better inured to looke vpon the light. Or being but newly pulled out of the puddle of Popery, that by and by she should bee washed cleane from all spots. As <hi>Luther</hi> intreats his Readers, if they finde in his writings any thing smelling of the old Caske of Popery, that they would remember, he was once a poore Monke. And for any in these dayes, of a long and well setled Church, to plot the bringing in againe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, they know it well enough, their way is not to doe it forthright, but by many insinuations, and winding wayes, as, to suppresse all printing of bookes against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, to print and publish such bookes, as doe in part maintaine our Church, and in part comply and symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize with Popery, and by seeming to slight Popery, slily to bring it into credite; to restraine preaching as much as may be, by laying burthens vpon the Ministry; to suffer none to come to any place of eminency in the Church, but through Simony gate, or ambition, and such by-wayes, to make sure if possible a corrupt Clergy; if any bee sincere and bold in lashing of sinne, especially raigning sinnes, to snap him vp, and muzzle him for bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and such like. But to conclude the former point of the Authors allegation of that <hi>Horary</hi> set forth 1560.


<pb facs="tcp:21729:16"/>
and for the further making good of the answer thereunto; it will not be impertinent here to insert, what he addeth in his Preface, pag. 7. quoting in the margent together with that 1560. another set forth by the same authority, 1573. Ouer against which words, his text hath these words; <hi>These prayers, which for the most part, after the same manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diuision of houres, as here they are, hauing heretofore béene published among vs by high and sacred authority, are now also renewed, and more fully set forth againe, &amp;c.</hi> Where he confesseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that he followeth these former precedents, but <hi>for the most part</hi>: No, nor that neither; for examining the copies well, we finde great difference: For besides many other good things, he hath left out the himne, wherein is, <hi>Pellit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Max. non solum Antichristum, &amp;c.</hi> But what he leaues out against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee puts in for it; as a faire Iesuiticall frontis-peece, <hi>Seuen Sacraments of the Church,</hi> and the like. It would fill a whole booke, to note all the differences. But herein lyes the maine matter, that he couples the booke of Deuotion set forth 1573. with the other 1560. as if they were all one. For he quotes in the Margent, <hi>The Horary set forth with the Queenes authority,</hi> 1560. <hi>and renewed</hi> 1573. <hi>imprinted with priuiledge at London, by William Seers.</hi> It is well that the copies of those Moth eaten bookes are yet extant, at least to be an evidence, how farre forth the Author herein speakes truth. Yet, if he had inquired a little more diligently, hee might haue found another set forth by the same sacred authority, imprinted by the same foresaid <hi>William Seers,</hi> in the yeere 1564. being the 7. of that blessed raigne. Now comparing these three Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies together, I find the two last very different from the first, not onely in their forme and matter, but in their


<pb facs="tcp:21729:17"/>
Title. For the first, in 1560. is inti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ces priuata, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Horarium</hi> indeed setteth downe the <hi>houres of prayer</hi>; but the two latter bookes recommend onely Morning and Euening prayer, with their matter and forme, together with a short forme of prayer at rising, and going to bed; but without prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing at what houres. Obserue then in the first place a notable difference. The first booke of Deuotion, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neerest to the time of Popery (the Gospell being yet but as it were in the dawning) bore some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to those Canonicall formes of prayer formerly vsed in time of Popery; and so was called <hi>Horarium.</hi> Yet this was in Latine, seruing chiefly for the vse of all Clerkes, or old Cloysterers, to content them for the time, till better prouision might be had, and till their stomakes could digest stronger meat, and their eyes indure the clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er light. So that within 4. yeeres, the <hi>Horarium</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming further affinity or Cosen-head, so much as in name with the Popish <hi>Horaria</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the next Edition, and so forward, put on the name of <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Note againe, that the third Edition of those prayers, 1573. was yet more exact, then the former in 1564. and much more different, as the more distant still from the <hi>Horarium. Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

backe at least to the brinke &amp; borders of Popery againe, by his Canonicall houres, and the like? Being now men of ripe yeeres, would he haue vs to become children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?

As the <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremonies had a time, euen after the establishing of the Gospell, for their solemne <hi>obsequies.</hi> But to conclude, the plaine truth is, to such a passe is Popery now come in these our dayes, that if euer, the Church of <hi>England</hi> ought henceforth to haue the least correspondence and conformity with it; yea to be so farre from renewing any old acquaintance with it, as vtterly to shake hands; and if any ragges or reliques of that Whore haue beene patched to our Mothers Robe, we ought to rip it off, and strip our selues of it. <hi>Rome</hi> is now fully reuealed to be the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Pope, the head thereof, to be that man of sinne, that grand <hi>Antichrist</hi>; which for any learned man not to see in these dayes of the Gospell, is to stumble at Noone-day, yea to be strucke blinde at the cleare light.</p>
            <p>It followeth in the Title: <hi>Taken out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the ancient Fathers, and the diuine Seruice of our owne Church.</hi> Here be three authorities, the least whereof not to be contemned. The first is, that he saith his houres are taken from the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi> His quotations are strowed all along the booke; but so, as if we amasse all the generall precepts and particular practises of prayer in Scripture into one <hi>Canon</hi> or rule, there should not be one <hi>houre,</hi> or minute, throughout the day and night, which we should not spend altogether in prayer.

               </gap>ne, the other about three in the afternoone, which our Church followeth; these two were called the <hi>Morning</hi> and the <hi>Euening Sacrifice.</hi> Hence it is, that Christ began to bee offered from the Morning Sacrifice, to the Euening Sacrifice, as sanctifying all our Sacrifices of Prayer and Prayse, Morning and Euening, in that <hi>Sacrifice of himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he speakes here of <hi>Priuate houres of Prayer.</hi> And where will he find in Scripture any such practise, as the obseruation of his <hi>Seuen Canonicall houres</hi>? DANIEL prayed three times a day. Yes DAVID saith, <hi>Seuen times a day will I prayse thee.</hi> But that's of <hi>Prayse.</hi> And though it may be meant also of Prayer, it signifieth onely his frequent praying, farre from a superstitious obseruation of Canonicall houres, in those dayes not hatched, or heard of. But of Prayer he saith, <hi>Euening and morning, and at noone day will I pray, &amp;c.</hi> But for all this mans colouring the matter with <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> he hath no other Scripture for his <hi>Canonicall houres,</hi> but the Popes Scripture, in his<note place="margin">Compare this with pag. 86. in his later edi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, where he mentioneth the <hi>Decrees of the Church.</hi>

            <p>Indeed the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth so command this excellent dutie of Prayer to vs, as that no time should exempt vs from it, but that we should be diligent in the practise of it vpon all occasions, and especially keepe constantly ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Heere consider, whether your seuen <hi>Canonicalls</hi> be not of the number of those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which haue had their beginning by the institution of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 9. as we haue shewed, and perhaps for a good intent and purpose, yet at length haue turned to vanity and superstition, as is manifest both by the doctrine and practise of the Church of Rome; or such, as hauing entred into the Church by vndiscreet deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and zeale without knowledge, and for because winked at in the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and growing dayly to more and more abuses, our Church not onely for their vnprofitablenesse, but because of their much blinding of the people, and obscuring Gods glory, hath thought worthy to cut away and cleane reiect.

               </hi> he doth say) <hi>They charge vs falsely, in saying that we cast behind vs the blessed Sacraments of Christs Catholicke Church;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Authors owne words in is Preface.</note> 
               <hi>alas, silly simples: these men do little else, but bewray their owne infirmities, and haue more violence or will, then reason or judgement, for what they say: the common accusations, which out of the abundance of those partiall affectious that transport them the wrong way, they are pleased to bring so frequently against vs, being but the bare reports of such people, as either doe not, or will not vnderstand vs, what we are. Doe we cast behind vs the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christs Catholicke Church; Who told you so, I pray you at Rome?

            <p>His third reason for his 7.

               </gap>se his <hi>houres</hi> to men earnestly imployed in worldly affaires? Indeed the obseruation of these houres is proper (if for any) for such as liue a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall life, <hi>Abbey Lubbers,</hi> as we say, such as haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to attend, but to be busied with their beads. And againe, for all sorts of persons in our Church, blessed be God, we haue plenty of <hi>Psalters,</hi> and <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> wherein they may as profitably (I trow) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their vacant houres, as in these consarcinated and new moulded prayers. And in the third place, doth not this new <hi>Rubrick</hi> of our Author trench &amp; intrude


<pb facs="tcp:21729:22"/>
vpon those formes of prayer both publicke and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which by our Church are generally prescribed for all persons in the daily practise of their Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

            <p>Againe, in the same Clause, he glancingly giues a sound by-blow to those, that stand vp in maintaining the quarrell of Gods truth against Popish perturbers, and Pelagian innouators; the <hi>continuall and curious disquisition of many vnnecessary questions among vs, being nothing else, but onely the new seedes, or the old fruits of malite, and by consequence the enemy of godlinesse, and the abatement of true deuotion.</hi> This man would willingly fold his hands, and wrap vp all his <hi>Deuotion</hi> in the mantle of ignorance, the <hi>Mother</hi> of his <hi>Deuotion.</hi> Like to the glowo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent herewith but this blind <hi>Deuotion</hi> of his he dare call <hi>that true deuotion wherwith God is more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and a good soule more inflamed, then with all the subtilties in the world:</hi> when at one dash he interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>God,</hi> as an approuer of his superstitious, and blind <hi>Deuotion,</hi> and a disallower of his owne fundamentall diuine Truthes, as <hi>busy</hi> needlesse <hi>subtilties,</hi> yea <hi>as new seedes or old fruits of malice,</hi> and as <hi>the enemy of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and abatement of true Deuotion.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21729:22"/>His last reason is, that this his booke of Canonicall houres, might stirre vp all those, <hi>who are coldly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the like heauenly dutie of performing their daily Christian deuotions,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>But whatsoeuer our Authour may pretend for the time of solemne fasting and prayer, as not seasonable for marriage: Yet to restraine men from marriage in times of <hi>Festiuitie and ioy,</hi> may seeme to be verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.

And if <hi>Holy,</hi> is the celebration of it vnsutable for <hi>Holy times?</hi> But <hi>Marriage</hi> (it seemeth) is an <hi>vnnecessarie auocation,</hi> as our Authour termes it.


<pb facs="tcp:21729:24"/>
An <hi>vnnecessarie auocation?</hi> And is it not a necessarie vocation? How then an <hi>vnnecessarie auocation?</hi> But why should <hi>Marriage</hi> (if rightly vsed, <hi>according to Gods Ordinance</hi>) be either a necessarie or <hi>vnnecessarie auocation?</hi> Was the <hi>Marriage</hi> in <hi>Cana,</hi> whereat it pleased CHRIST himselfe to be present, any <hi>impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>auocation</hi> to him from working a gracious <hi>Miracle,</hi> whereby all the guests had abundant cause and occasion to prayse GOD, and his Disciples especially to belieue more firmly in their MESSIAS? And I pray you, when was this <hi>Marriage in Cana?</hi> When? Not (I hope) within any of the holy times exempted from Marriage. And least of all within <hi>Fourtie dayes</hi> of the <hi>Passeouer,</hi> the <hi>Holy time of Lent.</hi> Yet if wee may belieue all those that haue written and calculated the verie time of that <hi>Marriage,</hi> they say all with one vnanimous voyce, for the most part, that it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little of the <hi>Passeouer,</hi> or <hi>Easter,</hi> yea within lesse then 40. or yet twentie <hi>dayes.</hi> But we hope then, that the married couple had procured a <hi>Licence</hi> out of the <hi>High Priests Court.</hi> Alas, they were a poore couple, not able to prouide Wine, as the vsuall manner of the Countrey required, but water onely; and scant of that too: For there were sixe water-pots of Stone, but wanting filling vp: But no Wine at all. And <hi>ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> or more, for a <hi>Licence,</hi> would haue said well to the filling of those <hi>Pots</hi> with <hi>Wine,</hi> as <hi>Wine</hi> went in that plentifull Countrey. But neither doe we read, that on any such time, or times, <hi>Holy,</hi> or <hi>Sacred,</hi> or call them what you will, were marriages euer prohibited to bee celebrated, no not in that present corrupt state of the Church of the Iewes, where notwithstanding the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie High Priests office was ordinarily bought and sold; enough to haue put them to their wits to improue all meanes to scrape vp their disbursments again by hooke and by crooke, by pilling and polling as well the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the inferiour Priests.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is an easier matter to find which way it crept in, then (it seemeth) how it may be swept out. It lurked among some rubbidge of Romish Reliques, and so escaped shipping away with other of <hi>Romes</hi> trinkets. Yea, it may well (in my iudgement) be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That it is not professed or auowed in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> but in certaine Courts onely. And it were to be wished, that the Authour with all his Deuotion could perswade those Courts, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the times prohibited for Marriage are holy and sacred, fit for <hi>fasting</hi> or <hi>festiuall ioy,</hi> they would by these reasons disswade their Suters from taking Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Marriages also being an <hi>vnnecessarie auocation,</hi> and the like. Thus by putting a difference betweene the times sacred, and common, the Courts may either disswade from Licences for the time, or pully vp such Licences to a higher rate, so putting a pecuniarie mulct vpon such Delinquents. But a light gaine makes a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie purse. And <hi>Licenciâ sumus omnes deteriores.</hi> And <hi>Auri sacra fames</hi> can easily dispence with the most <hi>Sacred times,</hi> whether of <hi>Fasting,</hi> or solemne <hi>Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie.</hi>

And whether the Popes <hi>Canon Law</hi> bee cancelled in <hi>England</hi> to be frustrate <hi>de iure,</hi> at least, though not, <hi>de facto,</hi> I cannot say. But enough, if not too much, of this matter.</p>
            <p>But come wee to the body of the Booke, wherein we purpose not to insist, but to touch vpon some points and passages lightly, according to the moment of each.</p>
            <p>Vpon the Second Commandement hee glosseth no otherwise, in some particulars, then a Iesuite may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe for the defence of <hi>Romes</hi> Doctrine of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images. <hi>Offenders of the second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (saith he) <hi>are they, that make any other Images</hi> (to wit of the Creatures) <hi>or the likenesse of any thing whatsoeuer (be it of Christ and his Crosse, or be it of his blessed Angels) with an intent to fall downe and worship them.</hi> Now a <hi>Iesuite</hi> with a distinction can easily make this good for his Doctrine, to wit, not to worship those <hi>Images</hi> with the <hi>worship of Latria,</hi> nor otherwise simply, but with relation to the <hi>Prototype.</hi> So that, for ought we know, the Authour implyeth, that some kind of adoration may be either giuen to the <hi>Image</hi> respectiuely to the <hi>Prototype,</hi> or at least before the <hi>Image,</hi> to the <hi>Prototype.</hi> Againe he saith, <hi>They that are worshippers of Idols, or representments of false Gods.</hi> This clause is wholly Iesuiticall. See the <hi>Doway translation</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. where the <hi>Iesuites</hi> allow none other <hi>Images</hi> to bee forbidden in the second <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> but onely <hi>Idols,</hi> and those forsooth are (say they) the <hi>Images of false Gods.</hi> Iust so our Author here. As if <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> being worshipped in and by their representations, were not turned into <hi>false Gods?</hi>

            <p>Againe, <hi>They that are worshippers of Saints Images, and out of a false opinion of promeriting the protection of the blessed Uirgin, or any other Saint of God, doe giue a religious adoration to those vsuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentments, which be made of them.</hi> Now in all this, he speakes nothing against Poperie, and so all his flourish is but a meere froth, while he would seeme to say something against it. For howsoeuer Popish pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is, yet they teach not that <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> in them, is <hi>meritorious.</hi> So that the Authour leaues it as granted, that a man may vse <hi>Images</hi> in their <hi>Saint-inuocation,</hi> so he account it not <hi>meritorious.</hi> Thus he is rather for Poperie in this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then against it.</p>

But the maine marke his enuie and malice shootes at, is, especially, <hi>Hearing and meditating of Sermons.</hi> By this verie speech, a man that neuer saw nor knew the Authour, may easily conclude, whether he be a <hi>Resident</hi> vpon his <hi>Cure,</hi> or no, a faithfull Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, or no. <hi>Hearing and meditating of Sermons</hi> hee

God,</hi> saith our <hi>Church.</hi> Therefore our Author crosseth the doctrine of our Church expresly. Onely he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that these, <hi>the other fiue haue not</hi> (in generall) <hi>the like nature, that the two principall and true Sacraments haue.</hi> If in this his speech their lurke no equiuocation (for he may closely meane by <hi>The like nature,</hi> that these are not <hi>generally necessarie to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as the first <hi>two</hi>) hee must needs inferre that these his <hi>other fiue are no true Sacraments</hi>; therefore false and bastard <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And if we take the word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> in the largest sense, as those fiue are, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that reckoning, the number of <hi>Sacraments</hi> will quickly amount from <hi>other fiue,</hi> to fiue hundreth.

            <p>To conclude this point of difference, there is some oddes betweene their naming of these Sacraments: Our Church calls them, <hi>Confirmation, Penance, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Matrimony, and Extreame vnction:</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is pleased to call his fiue, thus, <hi>Confirmation, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, Orders, Matrimony, and visitation of the sicke, or Extreme vnction.</hi> In two of his fiue hee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; hee calls <hi>Penance, Penitence,</hi> and <hi>Extreme vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he calls, <hi>Visitation of the sicke.</hi> In which two new names of his new Sacraments there lurkes not a little of Serpentine poyson.

It prayes against Antichrist, contrary to those, that would raise vp againe the throne of that Beast in this our Church. It prayes against all hirelings, such as in these dayes for preferments will sell soule and body to the Diuell, turne time-seruers, and mens seruants. It prayes against men possest with a reprobate sense, who are Authors of sects, and schismes, heresies and errors, whereof this present age is full. Although the ring-leaders of sects and schismes, who make a pitifull and rufull Rent in the Church of England, by Siding with Popery &amp; Arminianisme, yet forsooth cry out vpon the true Ministers and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Gospell, as the onely sectaries and schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes. And if this were true then, no lesse now, when Ignorance, if not hath, yet at least striues to get the vpper hand, seeking to cast the blacke mantle of blind Deuotion ouer all mens eyes, and that by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Ministers seeking by all meanes to quench the light of the Gospell? Therefore, what great need haue we euer to take in our mouthes this worthy prayer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended vnto vs by our reuerend Mother-Church of England, and to pray heartily, <hi>Wee beseech the O Lord to mainetaine thy cause against all rauening wolues, and strengthen thy seruants, &amp;c.</hi>

For as nothing displeaseth God more, then the worship which we frame to him out of our owne fancifull braines: So no deuotion is of more value with vs, doth more please our humours, then such as we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent our selues. So that it fareth with our Lent deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as with the young Ape; we so dote vpon it, so claspe and hug it, as, being the barne of our own braine we strangle it, so that such Lenten deuotion seldome suruiueth the time of Lent, but is dead all the yeere after. And what I pray you is all the Lent-fast, as it is generally vsed, but a meere apish imitation and mocke-fast? The example of CHRISTS Fast fourtie dayes and fourtie nights is brought by our Authour for vs to imitate. Well. Let our Authour begin to imitate CHRIST: Let him fast fourtie dayes, and fourtie nights, without eating and drinking, as CHRIST did; &amp; if he be able to endure such a Fast, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is. Nor doe I see any reason, why such a keeping of Lent, as our Authour prescribes, should haue the name of a Past. For a Fast, is to eat nothing, and drinke nothing during the Fast. Nothing at all. If our Fast be for a day, we are to eat nothing till night, when the Fast is ended. Such was <hi>Nineueh</hi>'s Fast. Nor can that be a Fast of fourtie dayes, in which space any thing is eaten or drunke. But is that a Fast, to eat no Flesh, and to fill the stomacke with good Fish, and the best Wine? To eat no Butter, but the purest Oyle?<note place="margin">

            <p>And why should our Authour impose vpon vs such a Lent-Fast, as a matter of Religion, and a speciall part of his Deuotion? Whereas this Noble and Religious STATE doth not prescribe or inhibite the vse of any Creatures, but out of a ciuill regard, and for a ciuill end. In that case doe not men take Licences from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer? And doth not the KINGS Proclamation inioyne forbearance of Flesh during that time of the Spring, and that expresly for the increase of Cattle? But if our Authour will needs vrge the Authoritie of the Church for the Lent-Fast, I doe but referre him to the Order of Pope VRBAN the third afore cited.

with the seeming sanctitie, and superstitious solemnitie of a pretended Lenten Fast, which indeed is no Fast, as men doe vse it. And yet, for all it is so abused, it hath monopolized and ingrossed to it selfe all other true Fasts, wherein Gods people in time either of any present publicke calamitie, or eminent danger ought to be humbled, in making their peace with God, deprecating as the sinne, so the punishment, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fruit of it. But the<note place="margin">As the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, who will neither enter into Heauen himselfe, nor suffer those that would to enter in.</note> Lent-Fast must keepe out all, beat downe all other Fasts.

               </note> Indeed we read of one ABDIVS, who tells strange Tales of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> MATHEVV the Euangelist, and among the rest, that he taught that Saints must looke to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heauen by their Merits: That the time of Lent must be kept with abstinence from Flesh, from coniugall beneuolence, or else a man becomes polluted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a haynous offence, which must be washed away with many teares. These, and other the like, be so likely to be true, as it may be lawfull for vs to belieue S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> MATHEVV wrot one thing, and spake another. But we must know, that the <hi>Misterie of Iniquitie</hi> began to worke euen in those prime times, while Satan want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his Instruments to lay the foundation thereof in superstitious Deuotions, the strongest supporter of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> As for S.

Neither is it necessarie, that we should either labour in all things to cleare the Fathers, nor in euerie thing to follow them. But howsoeuer our Authour would draw down the Lent-Fast from the obseruation of the Church:


<pb facs="tcp:21729:38"/>
although he still meanes the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet wee know that the ancient Churches, which were no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but as all then were, ioynt members of the Catholike, did obserue their <hi>Quadrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima</hi> after a different sort, both for the time and manner. <hi>Socrates,</hi>

And because none can shew any precept vpon Record concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lent, it is euident that the Apostle therein left free power to euery mans mind &amp; will, that euery one might do that which is good and honest, being induced thereto neither by feare, nor by necessity.

Of the manner of it, or how the Article in the Creed is to bee vnderstood, he makes no question, but comes with an actuall downe right Descent. But he grounds this his time of Christs Descent into Hell, vpon the Epistle and Gospell for Easter Euen. Indeed the Epistle is taken out of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.27, &amp;c. where the words of <hi>Peter</hi> are thus translated, according to the corrupt vulgar Latin, <hi>In which spirit hee also went and preached to the spirits that were in prison, &amp;c.</hi> Now, the Author hereupon inferreth, that this place of <hi>Peter</hi> is to be meant of Christs Descent into Hell; contrary to all sound Interpreters; the Text it selfe no way bearing it. And vpon the same ground, according to the corrupt translation, wherein is added (contrary and besides both the Originall Text, and our last and best English Translation) these words, <hi>That were</hi>: whereas the Text is, <hi>To the spirits in prison,</hi> that is, now, still in prison; not, that were in prison, as if vpon Christs descent into Hell, and preaching vnto them, hee had deliuered them thence, as out of some Limbo; which the Author (if well examined) must needes meane. And indeed he is too much helped by the corrupting of the Text; so that it were to be wished, that vulgar English Translation of the Epistles and Gospels in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion booke were corrected, yea and wholly made vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to our last Translation of the Bible, that so no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish spirits may haue any such starting holes for their lurking and sly old Popish and mopish doctrines.</p>

But what promise of acceptance hath our Authour of such Mediation of Angels, if they should presume to present our Prayers? Much more, when they doe it without warrant. And warrant they haue none in GODS Word. And without the Word we haue no warrant for any seruice we doe to GOD. But contrarily the Word alloweth vnto vs but one onely Mediatour as well of Intercession, as of satisfaction. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <hi>If any man sinne, we haue an Aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our sinnes.</hi> The same must be our Aduocate and Intercessor, who is also our Propitiation. Therefore our Authour here commits high Sacriledge, if not Blasphemie against the Sacred Maiestie of GOD, and the honour of IESVS CHRIST, to assigne GOD the appointing of a new way, whereby we may come vnto him, namely another way, then by IESVS CHRIST.</p>

How then? <hi>Though (to saue the labour and trouble of writing Copies, to be sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated to some few friends) a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, by leaue and warrant of the Ordinary, were printed at the charge of the partie, for whose onely vse the same was collected.</hi> Good. Pitty, but such a Booke, with such deuout prayers collected, should be copied out, and rather then faile, for more expedition, to be printed; but to be sparingly (O warily spoken) to some (and but some) and those but a few friends. One of the best reasons you gaue hitherto, to extenuate the fault: for the fewer were printed, and the more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and to the more few communicated, the better. But how comes it to be printed againe and againe, and so lauishly communicated and dispersed euery where? Is it not, but by leaue and warrant of the Ordinary? I assure you the author had extraordinary fauour to get the Ordinaries leaue and warrant for such a Popish Booke; for beleeue me, Orthodox Bookes, and such as impugne Popery and Heresie, and propugne the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> cannot haue the fauour to obtaine ordinary leaue and warrant to be printed, but vpon (to speake mildely) extraordinary tearmes. But goe on. <hi>It hath therefore seemed good to AVTHORITY to giue leaue to the reprinting thereof, and permitting the same to be sold, to such as please to buy it, onely for priuate vse, as in former times way hath beene giuen to the printing of priuate Prayer-Bookes.</hi> Stay there, Me thinkes, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Printer, you begin to gather a great deale of confidence already. I pray you (if I may be so bold) what authority is that,


<pb facs="tcp:21729:41"/>
which you so boldly build vpon, and which you put in such Capitall Characters, as if you would affright the Reader withall. But good Subiects, and honest men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, honour, reuerence, loue <hi>Authority,</hi> are not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it.

But if thou dost euill, feare.</hi> Did you neuer heare of one <hi>Tucker</hi> a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, who, for printing a Booke of Popish Deuotion, was arraigned, and though the Queens mercy saued his life, yet he was confined to perpetuall imprisonment? Yet you feare not, not only to print, &amp; reprint, but to sell your booke to euery buyer, &amp; to some who exchange it also for all other bookes, which a little before was thought fit onely to communicate and but sparingly to some few friends, being set forth at first onely for the vse of the party, that bore the charge. But do you make no more difference betweene this Popish booke of priuate <hi>Deuotions,</hi> and other priuate prayer bookes formerly printed by <hi>Authority</hi> (and as good <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> as you can bring any) in this Church?

But all this while (for I cannot but bee iealous of the honour of mine Ordinary in this

kind) I pray you in what maner was the Licence giuen? Speake the truth: For I heare, that you had onely a loose Paper for your warrant, not affixed to the booke, much lesse (as the ordinary maner is) the Licencers hand to the booke. So that, were ye not deceiued? Was it not some other booke of priuate <hi>Deuotion,</hi> mentioned or meant in the Approbation? Or if this were meant, yet hath not the Author added or altered at his pleasure. For the loose paper, did it set downe how many sheets it contained? A loose Approbation it was. And I suspected that your <hi>Authority</hi> was none of the best, or most authenticke, you doe so braue it out in your capitall Characters. But yet forasmuch as you had no other <hi>Approbation</hi> of this booke, but onely an <hi>Indiuiduum vagum</hi> written in a loose Paper; who (I pray you) gaue you <hi>Authority</hi> to set it so fast vpon the booke, with the whole strength and waight of your Presse? Doe you know what you haue done? you haue hereby affixed and impacted such an Aspersion of dishonour vpon our Reuerend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore if you had had such a reuerend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Ordinary, as you ought, you might both haue fauoured his honour, and saued your owne stake, keeping the <hi>loose Paper</hi> by you in your box, as your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance or discharge.

Well: for the care you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, we must take your word.

               <pb facs="tcp:21729:44"/>Now Mr. Printer, I will not alone take vpon me to judge of these your escapes; but rather I referre you to the whole Bench of the most judicious and learned, yea and those graue and honourable Sages of the Councell-board. Onely this I dare say peremptorily, that in the first impression there is an expresse and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall prayer for the Dead: but in the second it is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and corrected, and the case quite altered. And yet is all this but an escape of the Printer, or ouersight of the Corrector; But was not the Author himselfe the Corrector? was not his naturall affection ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly busied in licking his young Beere while it past the Presse, and receiued the perfect forme. Or being an escape of the Printer, how came not the Author himselfe, or some of those his neere and deare friends for him, first to espy the faults, and so to haue them corrected, before they came to be found out by others? For surely he and his had reason first to read ouer that priuate first impression, before it should come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen view; it being a booke not of an ordinary stampe, and which for the admirable ouerdaring of it, was like to runne a most desperate hazzard. But it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth they would put it to a hazzard. They imagined, that haply it might passe vnespied; and then all would haue beene well enough, and you might haue spared your labour of printing your <hi>Epistle</hi> Apologeticall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the second Impression.</p>
            <p>But yet, Mr. Printer, you should haue done well (which would the more haue cleered the credit of your excuse, taking all the blame from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) to haue cancelled all that Paper, beginning, <hi>O Lord with whom do liue, &amp;c.</hi> Vnto these words, <hi>Wee most meekely &amp;c.</hi> Putting all those first six lines among your Errata,<note place="margin">See the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:21729:44"/>
stand still in force for a prayer for the Dead, as it was in the first Impression: it is very improper for your second and corrected Booke. For euen your owne reason, Mr. Printer, may induce you to thinke, that it is improper to vse a Collect for a mans buriall, for him that is yet aliue, vnlesse you would bury the man quicke. And therefore me thinkes you were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill aduised, and seeme to haue for hast committed another fowle escape, in that you did not thorowly aduise with your Author about a more exact correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your escapes, that so the booke, vpon second and more mature cogitations, might haue passed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, aboue all exception, to the better satisfaction of all well disposed Christians. But did you consult with your Author, before you set vpon your corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? It may be feared noe. Otherwise it is hoped that the Author and his learned friends would haue thought better of the matter, then to haue suffered such an absurdity to stand still in the Booke, and that vpon a solemne correction. And therefore, what if they come vpon you, and disauoning it themselues, lay a further blame vpon you, then hitherto you haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to your selfe? For besides, that such an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie brings their judgement in question, they may seeme to take vpon them to be Innouators, turning the Collects, which the Church of England hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the publike buriall of the dead, to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate visitation of the liuing sicke.

It will then be the more tollerable to borrow a peece of the Church Collect, being a thankesgiuing at the buriall of the Dead, &amp; turne it into a prayer (pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate at least) for the dead, then to vse it for the liuing. But how it was shuffled vp among you, you can best tell.</p>
            <p>But tell me in good sadnesse, Mr. Printer, are you perswaded, that any man but of common sense giues any credit to your Epistle? Or do you thinke your selfe euer a whit the wittier, or learneder, that like a Parrot you haue powred it out, being infused into you: But <hi>Dignum patellâ Operculum.</hi> Will any, trow you, take these grosse alterations, and cobled breakes, for Escapes of the Printer?

            <p>Notwithstanding one thing remaines vnaltered: that in the same prayer he placeth the soules of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jsaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in a certaine place, which he calls, <hi>the region of light,</hi> but at the resurrection he allowes them Gods glorious Kingdome.

            <p>O good God. What a packe of hypocrisie, and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse absurdities, and shamelesse impudencie is here; All their damnable foysting in of popery, and that no lesse then infidell prayer for the dead, must be excused (for sooth) and all the blame laid vpon the maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of some dispositions of these times. And who are those, and why maleuolent? surely those, that es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying the craft of Iesuited spirits in these our dayes in broching grosse and palpable Popery, dare oppose themselues, and cry out against such bold attempts. These be the men of a maleuolent disposition in these times, and all because these times doe breed such Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted spirits. And therefore no maruaile if the author

of this booke cannot but greeue, that his Popish booke cannot finde a generall approbation. <hi>But they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuolent, as with whom a slip, or misprision of a word or two, &amp;c.</hi> But a word or two, at the most, misprinted, or misplaced, the matter of all this maleuolency. Nay, but a slip, or misprision of a word, or two. Why, we know that in Coyne, he that is the author of a slip, and would vent it for the Kings Currant Coyne, is guilty of treason. Now much more a slip, or false doctrine foysted in for Gods Currant siluer? such a slip once broched is an errour: but stiffly maintained, it becomes an heresie. And is not this such a slip here? A most wicked Popish doctrine was published by the Author, or Authors, in print; namely <hi>Prayer for the Dead,</hi> against the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and yet the Authors will not acknowledge it an errour, but put it vpon the Printer. But the thing it selfe cryes shame vpon the authors of such iuggling tricks. And if there had not beene some maleuolent dispositions in the world, to quarrell such impious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts giuen to Christ and his blessed truth maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of England, there had not beene so much as one word amisse, being all so exactly waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goldsmiths ballance, before it came to bee minted for currant; then, prayer for the dead would haue passed for a doctrine of the Church of England. But maleuolent dispositions haue troubled and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all.</p>

Yes, if blind &amp; popish Charity may be judge. Nor is it a word or two, but a whole solemne prayer, of many words and sentences, wherein the state of the dead is deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed for, and that in expresse words: After the soule is departed, <hi>Then</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O LAMBE OF GOD, &amp;c. and, <hi>That he may receiue this body.</hi> How are these things as liable to a faire and charitable vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as otherwise?

Or what faire and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable vnderstanding are these words liable to, when after our dead brother hath receiued a formall absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all his sins, which he hath committed in this life, yet he hath need to be prayed for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he may escape the gates of Hell and the paines of eternall darkenesse?
