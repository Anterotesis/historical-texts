            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>To this opinion is cleane repugnant the saying of our Sauiour Chryst, when he teacheth that more ioy shal bée in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen before the Angels of God, vppon one sinner dooing penance, than vpon ninetie and nine iust me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which néed no penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

                           <hi>Luc.</hi> 8.</note> &amp; rather by force wrested to his owne peculiar stuffe, than naturally applyed to the meaning of Christ. For there is no relation made to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of <hi>Iairus</hi> touching iustification, as if Chryste had willed him onely too beleeue,

Apostolical epistles of Peter, Iohn, Iames and Iude do bende their drift and purpose most of all ageinst that opinion that they may boldly and vehemently affirme, faith without workes to auayle nothing.

Which when I had red ouer, I maruayled not a little bothe at the weakenesse of hys ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling Obiections, he vseth against suche godly poincts of Doctrine, as he laboreth, by forsing of Scriptures and Doctors to his purpose, to ouerthrow: and also at his boldnesse in offering the same vnto you. For I thought vntill I had perused it, that in so little a treatise, so great ignorance of Scriptures, of Doctors, of the common
<pb facs="tcp:13340:20"/>
Arte of Logicke, which boyes after one or two yeares being in the vniuersities, are not ignoraunt in, could not haue ben fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in him, who carieth so great a name and countenaunce of learning: Or at the least if his ignorance had bene such, as by this I vnderstand it in dede to be, that he coulde by politique silence haue concealed it, and not by wryting to your worshippes, (men I doubte not but of perfecte knowledge and sound iudgement in al poynts of true religion) reuealed both it and the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their common cause, which so fain he would support. How be it for this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in his Preamble he pretendeth some cause, <hi>as the auoyding with your worships, the opinion of obstinacie, self wilfulnesse, want of iust matter to mislike in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd Sermon. &amp;c</hi> and this in deede is but a bare pretence. For the bitternesse of his stile, and smothe scoffes, which he vseth too ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in so short a discourse vpon .iiij. point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, sheweth, he rather by these cauils sought to rid his stomake of a litle choler, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing else: or to abuse and seduce your worships as men altogether ignorant in these questions. But yet I will thinke the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13340:20"/>
best, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of charitie teacheth me, and conceiue hope of his conuersion, for which also I pray with my whole harte. And in case he blame me as not iudging rightly of this his writing, being therunto requested by you: let him waigh wel his owne &amp; last words in his preface vnto you, &amp; say plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether a simple &amp; plain meaning may be gathered of them: they be these. <hi>More seking to satisfie your request and demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, than to minister any occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of further ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</hi> What meaneth he hereby? Is he rather moued with satisfying your request tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cause it self he standeth in, which he wold make appeare to the world to be the truth? Or if the truth of his .iiij. assertions did more moue him, than your requestes, why feareth he least by his wryting, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of further argument touching these questions be ministred?</p>
               <p>If he know that he hath héere by good argument mainteyned a good cause, then is there no cause why he should feare fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debating, but he ought like a good mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and teacher, stand and offer him self ready prepared to the defence thereof, yea though it were with daunger and losse of
<pb facs="tcp:13340:21"/>
his lyfe. But yf he bée guiltie in his owne conscience of the naughtinesse of the cause and his owne weake proues, why doth he so much abuse your worships with a shew of confutation of the truth? What iust cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and true occasions haue lead him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend so godly points of doctrine, taught by M. Gough, I referre to the iudgement of any indifferent and learned Reader. I haue vsed as much breuitie as I could, in aunswering his arguments, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therof might not bée tediouse to you. And last of all I thought good in mine own behalfe, (lest some might thinke amisse of me for mainteyning the quarrell, made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst an other man, as one desirous of contention, vayne glorie. &amp;c.) to proteste vnto your worshippes, that the earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of my very friend, who knew me to haue a little spare time and M. Gough too be otherwise more profitably occupied, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to say somwhat in way of an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to M. Fecknam: that I speake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the truth of the common cause of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which of it self ought to moue any man zelous in Gods religion, to take pen in hand agaynst any that shall séeke to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn

the same. Thus much I thought good to let you vnderstand of the occasion of my dealing herein, and partly also for a péece of an aunswere to such talke, as M.

But peraduenture you thought you hadde the sexton of Paules in hand, when you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented this your writing to the worships of these in déede worshipfull &amp; godly gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. The matter is thus, not many ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res since, a good companion minding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create him selfe with the sexton, charged him selfe with a baskette heauy laden as he made the matter appeare, directing his way through Paules Churche, because it was the shorter: where he was mette of his mate: and demaunded why in that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne time he passed thorough that place so charged, a thing not to bée endured, the circumstaunces beyng considered. This companion desired him to lette him passe, for that hée was heauye laden with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne plate, and therefore the gladder too take the shorter way. The sexton woulde not bée persuaded, but alleadging the Quéenes profite, caused him to sette downe his baskette, and sente imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlye for suche as too whome it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned to haue the view of such matters:

and amplifying his probation of the free iustification which we haue thorough the tender mercie of GOD in Christe Iesus, sayeth in this wyse: <gap reason="foreign">

The wordes are but fewe, and therefore easie to be remembred, nay therefore better to be considered: God sent his owne sonne: Why? To condemne sinne in the fleshe: Why so? Bicause it was impossible to the lawe: wherefore? in as much as it was weake bicause of the flesh. Why then we may conclude,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>vers.</hi> 10.</note> that the Lawe is a burden, and so gréeuous a burden, that neither wée nor oure Fathers were able to beare, and that bycause of oure weakenesse. Hereof it is that he sayth in an other place, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if there had bin a law giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which could haue giuen lyfe, surely rightuousnesse should haue bin by the Lawe. It is the woorke of grace to saue and quicken, the receyuers whereof, althoughe they were extréeme
<pb facs="tcp:13340:25"/>
enemies to the wholesome doctrine of the holy scriptures they become fréends. It is not the worke of the doctrine, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer heare and reade without the grace of GOD, they are made worse enemies. Therefore the grace of God is not in the nature of free will and in the lawe and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as the peruerse <hi>Pelagian</hi> dothe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyptfully beleeue and teache: but at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment it is giuen by his good wil and pleasure,<note place="margin">

For the Lawe without grace, is but a letter, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to conuince sin, but not to gyue saluation. So sayth the Apostle. For yf there had bin a lawe gyuen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 21.22.</note> whiche could haue giuen lyfe, surely rightuousnes shuld haue bin by the lawe. But the Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13340:25"/>
promise by the faith of Iesus Christ should be giuen to them that beléeue. Of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he sayeth in an other place: The letter killeth,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Bycause thou presumest of thy selfe, thou extollest thy workes, thou knowest not that the grace of the helper is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that the precept of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunder may be fulfilled.

A preuenting grace and helping you graunt (whereof I will not defraude you) and after permitted to your owne willes you can do what you liste, and kéepe the commaundements, and purchase heauen, &amp; as it foloweth, caste Christ away: Now then let vs ioyne togither: I say that thou O Man what soeuer thou arte, so setting Christe his death and passion a syde, of whose fulnesse we haue all receyued,<note place="margin">

For if there had bin a Lawe giuen, whiche could haue quickened, iustice had bin by the Lawe, neither should a Sauiour bin sought for, nor Christ haue come, nor with his bloud haue sought his lost shéepe, as the Apostle sayeth in an other place. For if rightuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

If you think not this whole tretise which I haue alleaged, rightly cited against you, shew me wherin you differ.

But all these possible things, wée can not euery one haue, not for the weaknesse of nature (that is, as it was firste made of God) least you slaunder God, but for the wearinesse of minde which can not haue all vertues togither, and alwayes. And thus much touching these twoo partes, wherby you may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, how wee say that the kéeping of the law is possible. And how it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. This considered, I come to your argumentes.</p>
               <p>Your first is taken out of the eleuenth of Mathew: and your woordes are these. <hi>Contrarie to this doctrine, is our Sauiour Christ, where he willeth vs to take his yoke vppon vs, because it is light. Tollite iugum meum super vos, iugum enim meum suaue est<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13340:33"/>
&amp; onus meum leue.</hi> Take my yoke vppon you, for my yoke is sweete, and my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is lighte. If it bee a light burden, M. Goughs heauy example, hath not a peny worth of good skill.</p>
               <p>This is neyther contrarie to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, M. Fecknam, neyther is his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy example voyd of skill. But that which causeth you to thincke it to bée contrarie, is that you deceyue your selfe, and make a Paralogisme as the <hi>Logicians</hi> call it, <hi>à fallacia accidentis,</hi> which I shall bée able to shew you by your doctours. For you doe not reason with M. Gough <hi>in sensu vniuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> and in his proposed matter. He taught you in his sermon that to fulfill the law was impossible, you oppose and lay for an aunswere, that the yoke of Christe is easie. <hi>S. Ierome</hi> vppon the same place tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth you that here bée <hi>subiecta diuersa,</hi> &amp; therfore in your disputation there is no <hi>vniuocatio.</hi> Your subiectes are <hi>Lex</hi> and <hi>Euangelium,</hi> the lawe and the Gospell, of which two he sayeth thus. <hi>Quo modo le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius lege Euangelium: quum in lege homici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, in Euangelio ira damnetur? Qua ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Euangelij gratia facilior, quu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in lege adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13340:33"/>
in Euangelio concupiscentia puniatur? In lege multa precepta sunt, quae Apostolus non posse compleri plenissime docet.</hi> How is the gospell lighter than the law, séeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is condemned in the law, and anger is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned in the gospel? How is the grace of the gospell easier, seeing that in the law adulterie, and in the gospell concupiscence is punished? Many things are commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the law, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle sheweth most plainly, that they can not be accomplished. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law works are required, which who soeuer doth, shal liue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the Gospel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will is required, which although it haue not the effect, yet it léeseth not the reward. So that by this Doctor, here is a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betwixt the law and the gospel, and as farre difference there is betwixt your two arguments, as is betwixt <hi>velle</hi> and <hi>facere.</hi> And marke then, is this a good argument. <hi>Non possum facere, ergo no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> possum velle,</hi> I am not able to do, therefore I am not able to will: or this, <hi>Possum velle, ergo possum facere,</hi> I am able to wil, therfore I am able to do. Take which you wil, these are your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I am sure you sée how little holde there is in them: therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse the truth,
<pb facs="tcp:13340:34"/>
giue glorie to God, and be not ashamed to haue erred, but be ashamed to remayne in your error. The gospel sure is easier than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of Iesus Christ forpasseth &amp; surmounteth the letter. If you will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider your heauy burden and come vnto Christ, &amp; craue pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for your sins, &amp; haue a mind to walke in his pathes, and where you fall downe desire him to lift you vp, to cloth your nakednesse with his garmente, you shall find reste and refreshing. and this is an easie yoke. But yf you will néedes doo, when he requireth the will, you will bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your self with an heauie yoke. I could alleage vppon this same place of Mathew <hi>Theophilact,</hi> and <hi>Glossa ordinaria,</hi> whiche neyther of them take the place as you do, but I passe them ouer because I would be short.

               <p>First touching the scope of the Apostle, you are deceiued. Pardon me, I speake it not of malice or to taunt I protest, but for the truth of the matter.

néedes follow that his iustice ageinst those that do it not is good and iust: and this M. Goughe teacheth. He saith also in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Epistle. In <hi>reliquis operibus bonis &amp;c.</hi> In other good works a man may sometimes pretend some maner of excuse: but in hauing charitie no man can excuse him selfe. A man may say vnto me, I can not faste: Can he saye, I can not loue? A man may say for the infirmitie of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye I can not absteine from wine &amp; flesh: can he say, I can not loue? A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may say, I can not kéepe my selfe a virgine: A man may saye, that he can not sell all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and giue it to the poore, can he say, I can not loue myne enemies and forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue offended ageinst me? Let no man deceyue him selfe (deare brethren) for God deceyueth no man. For although there be many things, which for the fragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of mans nature we can not corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfill, yet without any doubte we may haue charitie in oure hartes God so inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it if we will in déed. Thus you sée by this place, what we may doe, when God giueth that which he commaundeth, when he worketh that in vs that he requireth,

and yet that wée of oure selues can not do so much as kéepe a virgine, as sel our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as giue to the poore. And so haue I briefly aunswered your Obiections, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all prolixitie of farther Allegation of moe authorities: desiring you rather to rest your selfe vppon the scriptures, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we may surely ground our selues, than vpon the wauering iudgement of men in whom you sée verified the common say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Quot capita, tot sensus.</hi> So many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings as be heads: and I woulde it were not so in euery one of them.</p>

And thus muche touching this place of Luke .xv. whereof you can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that thei do continually héere vs, neyther yf they did, that we shuld pray therfore vnto them.</p>
               <p>Your next argument is out of Tobie, 12. <hi>This also is refelled by the saying of the Angell Raphaell vnto Tobie. Quando ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas cum lachrymis &amp; sepeliebas mortuos, &amp;c. When thou prayedst with teares, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riedst the dead, and forsokest thy dynner,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13340:47"/>
and hiddest by the day dead folkes in thy house, and buriedst them in the night, I did offer thy prayer vnto the Lorde. All these things the Angell Raphael did know, when Tobie thought lest hereof: and what? shall wee aduenture to say, that the Angel knew it onely, and affirme that no other Angell doth knowe the like, or shall the Aungels knowe it, and not the glorified sainctes of God, when he promiseth of them, that in the resurrection they shall be like Angels? Matt.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>I muse at this kind of dealing (M. Feck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam) I might say vnto you, <hi>vna hirundo non facit ver,</hi> one swalow maketh not so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: but that is not the matter: to see all things that are done of vs, or to heare vs, is it <hi>natura Angelorum,</hi> the nature of the Angels? or is it <hi>speciale donum,</hi> a speciall gift. What kind of reasoning is this, <hi>in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentibus commumbus</hi> to reason <hi>ab vno in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduo ad speciem,</hi> or <hi>à specie ad genus.</hi> Were this a good argumente to say, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates Philosophus verè sentit de summo bono, Ergo, omnes Philosophi verè sentiunt de sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo bono? Socrates</hi> the Philosopher iudgeth truely or a righte of the chéefest good,
<pb facs="tcp:13340:48"/>
or happinesse, therfore all Philosophers iudge and thinke truely therof. Yours is the same. Raphaell saw his doyng, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels saw Tobie his doings, &amp; <hi>per consequentiam,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently, they sée ours. I sée not (Master Fecknam) why I may not deny <hi>consequentiam &amp; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens,</hi> that is, both your conclusion and that which you woulde inferre thereof. For neyther doth it folow, yf Raphaell saw Tobie, therfore all did see him, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yf they sawe his doyngs, therefore they see ours. For as I sayd, it is neyther the nature of an Angel, neyther the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of an angell: of whiche two there must bée one to make an argument good <hi>à specie ad genus,</hi> or by an induction. Thus much touching your kind of reasoning, in grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding an article of religion, which hath no other ground of scripture for his warrant.

he sayd, thy prayers and thine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are come vp into remembraunce before God: &amp; did not say, I did carie vp thy prayers. And yet I wisse you might haue as well concluded by this, <hi>ergo</hi> the angels know what wée do. Euen both a like, when God sendeth them, when god openeth vnto them, I thinke they know. And surely to bée noted it is, that the aungell sayth not, I knew, I saw, I caried thy prayers: but, thy prayers are come, to gyue vs to vnderstande that as they are but messengers, so we can not, nor ought assure our selues more of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than their master willed them to reuele vnto vs. Now to your author, who as you alleadge is Tobie, whose authoritie cited as scripture I deny it, I finde no such author in my Bible.

S. Hierome hath an other interpretation, which I thinke I may prefer before master Goughs saying, Abraham nesciuit nos .i. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham non agnouit nos pro filijs. Abraham hath not knowue vs, that is, Abraham hath not allowed or acknowledged vs for hys children: and why? Quia te offendimus: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue offended thee, saith S. Ierom.

For God forbid that she should be made with a happie life so cruel, that when any thing gréeueth my heart, she should not comfort hir heauie sonne, whom she would neuer sée sad. But surely that is true which the godly Psalme sayeth: My father and my mother haue forsaken me, but the Lord hath gathered me vp.

if our Parents do not communicate or do not meddle, what other are there of the dead, which know what we doe, and what we suffer?

He concludeth a cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie position to yours, saying that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs are presente, because the saincts can not bée. And how the Martyres be present he sheweth in these woordes, <hi>per diuinam potentiam,</hi> by diuine power. For this is not orderly, but as he sayd before, <hi>veru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ista diuinitus exhibentur, longe aliter quàm sese habet vsitatus ordo singulis creaturarum ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neribus attributus</hi> But these are exhibited

from God far otherwise, than the accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med maner is, whiche is giuen to all kind of creatures.

Take the beste of this for your purpose, yet can you not come to that you woulde, to make any certayne rule, no not in the very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres. And so likewise touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he confesseth of him self, that it passeth his vnderstanding. Leaue therefore these vayne speculations, and content your self with that whiche God hath taught you: you are sure that Christ dooth &amp; will heare you, when soeuer you call on him in truth and veritie: you are sure that what so euer you aske in his name,<note place="margin">

the Angels whiche are here present with vs, &amp; at oure doings, they may heare some thing which he thinketh méete and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to whom all things are subiecte.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13340:60"/>
which do folow faith: for touching any iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of works, he maketh the like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you wil not deny simply, for all your allegacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s you bring, do proue that workes before do conferre nothing to iustification.<note place="margin">

Goughe. The question is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good woorkes are necessarie to walke in? Whether we are. bound to walke in the feare of GOD, after that he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested vnto vs his election, and called vs to embrace his frée mercy and Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? I say, the question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to do well that GOD may be glorifyed by vs? But whether a man being already iustified, his woorkes afterward may giue encrease of Iustice? I pray you Sir after that Quéene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie had made you Abbot of Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, dyd you the office of an Abbot, that you would be a more Abbot, or to do your duetie, to the which the Quéene of hir grace hadde called you. For therefore shée bestowed it vpon you, that you should doe the duetie, and not dy doing the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to become a more Abbot.</p>
               <p>So fareth it with the children of God: Of this whole lumpe of earth which he made of this masse, which we call Adam: he of his free mercie and goodnesse hathe chosen some whereby he will bée glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this world, by the good woorkes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13340:61"/>
which they shall do before the face of men. When this election of his beginneth to be manifest to euerye chosen, when he moueth the hearts of his after they haue long slept in sinne, to remember that they are hys, that he hathe slayne hys Sonne for them, that they are deliuered from the whole cursse of the lawe: Is it not requisite thinke you, that they walke worthie his vocation? That they make sure their vocation? Naye doe they in this their course, in any parte delyuer them selues from the cursse of the lawe? Doe they pay that raunsome which was paide before? What is the iustice or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of GOD? Redemption and remission of sinnes in the bloud of Christ. Was then the bloud of Chryst answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all the Lawe, did there remaine no parte vnpayde? For whome then did he all this? Not for him selfe, for there was no guile found in his mouthe: For whome then? For the faithfull, to whome God dothe giue this Faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 18.17.</note> not of merite, but of grace. Haue they then all the iustice of Christe, haue they that, which Christe
<pb facs="tcp:13340:62"/>
dyd in his bodye, put vppon them? May they say, as he sayde, Death where is thy sting, Hell where is thy victorie? May they say, death is swallowed vp in victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? May they say, there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vs whiche are in Christe Iesus? what remayneth then? that they walke according to the Spirite, not according to the fleshe: that they glorifie God before men, whiche hath already made them the children of God. Not to do ageyn y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is done alreadie, for that is impossible: not to ioyne a piece to Christes, as thoughe it were not perfect. For he left no piece vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed. But to receyue by faith that iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that God doth giue them, without the workes of the lawe. For workes <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur iustificatum, non praecedunt iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum:</hi> they followe a man iustified, and goe not before him that is to be iustified: <hi>Effectus autem non praeiudicat causae</hi> as you knowe: The effect neuer preiudiceth the cause. Thorough al the course of our liues we worke, bicause we are iustified: and we do not worke that we may be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And this is the meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in this place: not as thoughe workes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13340:62"/>
were to be ioyned with faith, to deserue some thing: For then should wée receyue reward due, and not grace. And thus much touching M. Goughe his argument. Now to your Obiection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firste, I maruayle that M. Goughe will allowe this terme, Only: when it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in Canonicall scripture. Next I am sure that there is nothing equiualent vnto it: for faith without the workes of the lawe and fayth onely, or fayth simplie withoute workes, be not of one like condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You néede not maruayle much, if you would rightly consider it: Paules whole disputation standeth vpon twoo <hi>Subiecta,</hi> &amp; one <hi>Praedicatum,</hi> as the people are twoo to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he addresseth his doctrine, and must agrée in one. The <hi>subiecta</hi> are these, works or the Law, fayth or Christ: The <hi>Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum</hi> is Iustification. If then reasoning <hi>à diuisione,</hi> the one be put away, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth? If I reason thus, Of all liuing creatures there is one that is <hi>risibile,</hi> apte to laugh: it is not <hi>Brutum</hi> any brute beast: Therefore it is <hi>Homo,</hi> man. If I reason thus I say, is not this consequent compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in <hi>Consequenti:</hi> Therefore onely

<pb facs="tcp:13340:64"/>
By only faith God iustifieth, that he may be saued without worke, through onely fayth, and beyng iustified only by fayth. As for the works which follow, as I sayd before, we conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne them not, we prayse them, as God did in Abraham, Abraham beléeued God, and it was imputed to him for righteousnes, and he was called the friend of God. In that he beleued God, within in his harte, it consisteth in fayth onely, concerning that he lead his sonne to sacrifise him, in that without feare he armed his right hande, in that he would haue stricken had he not bin witholden, surelie it was a great fayth, &amp; the worke also was great, &amp; God praysed the worke when he sayd, bycause thou obeyedst my voyce. Wherfore then sayth the Apostle Paule, wée conclude that man is iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fayth without the workes of the law: and in an other place. It is fayth whiche worketh by charitie? how doth fayth worke by charitie? &amp; how is a man iustified by fayth without the workes of the lawe? This séemeth hard that a man shall bée iustified by fayth onely, and yet that fayth must worke by charitie. Not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13340:64"/>
at all: for in that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is sayd to iustifie, it sheweth what thou haste receyued of God, in that it is sayd to worke by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it sheweth what thou owest to God. For so muste iustification stand, that it may bee applyed vnto all men, whether they be called in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, or at noone, or at night? There is one that beléeueth, he hath receyued the sacrament of faith, and is dead, he hadde no time to worke, what shall wée say? that he is not iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? we say playne that he was iustified, because he beléeued in him whiche iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the wicked. Therefore this man is iustified, &amp; did not worke. The sentence of the Apostle is fulfilled: I conclude that a man is iustified by fayth without the workes of the law. The théef which was crucified with Christ beléeued in hart to Iustice, and confessed by mouth to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For fayth which worketh by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, although it haue not wherein it may worke externally, yet is it kept feruent in the harte. If then fayth in these &amp; such like doth iustifie, why shall it not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Because one man lyueth longer than an other after his vocation, shall
<pb facs="tcp:13340:65"/>
therefore the rightuousenesses of God be changed? shal therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man be made fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe with God in the worke of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bicause he hath bestowed a greater benefite of longer lyfe vppon him? Is this the thank that GOD shall haue at oure hands, for giuing vs space to glorifie him, to vse it as a meanes that we oure selues may glorie? For surely if we deserue any thing, we haue wherein to glorie. But when all is done, it is but an euil fauored glorie, for it is not with God. But let vs goe farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Paule excluding workes of the Lawe, meaneth workes that goe before fayth; which do not iustifie. S. Iames in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Abraham forbidding that fayth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth iustifie, speaketh of workes that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe fayth, whiche doe also iustifie, that is, giue encrease of iustice. Abraham pater noster nónne ex operibus iustificatus est, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens Isaac super Altare?

had néede, and after he hath no néede: then is a benefite requisite, when a man is in pouertie: but when he is riche, it is not néedfull. To be shorte bycause I haue handled this before, workes do neuer goe before iustification.<note place="margin">

It is so to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded, to wit, that they could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise be dooers of the law, vnlesse they be iustified.

For sanctification goeth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iustification, but Iustification before Sanctification. Touching the place of S. Iames, there is no such matter in it as you make. You maye sée by the whole course of the chapter, that he speaketh not
<pb facs="tcp:13340:66"/>
how man is iustified before god, but how they ought to shew before men, that they are iuste before God. So that he beateth downe the vayne opinion of them, which thought that yf they beléeued, it belonged not to them to do well, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned good workes, as who would say they were not bound to glorifie God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, who had glorified them with him self. And touching the example of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, yf you conferre the scriptures togither, as Genesis with Iames: you shall sée that Abraham was iustified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and this is but the shew of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the worlde might know he nothing misdouted the promise of God, although his onely sonne must go to bée offered, and this do your doctors teach, which you heare recite.</p>

But hée that hath a true fayth, hath a these frutes, they follow him as his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maydes, he serueth himselfe of them, and serueth his léege Lorde with them: he is baptized, he is penitent, he sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in awe, he hopeth, he loueth, and all for the glorie of his Maister: and yet not without his owne profit. He deserueth nothing, yet shall he haue great reward: he meriteth not a myte, yet shall he haue thousandes: So standeth fayth amongest her damsels, and yet she is singular: She walketh with great companie, and yet is she alone.

                  <hi>MAister Goughe towardes the ende of his sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did verie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly affirme, that euery sinne committed by a Christian man, is deadly and mortall sinne: and that no sinne is veniall, no not an idle thought, as light as men made of it. Much like vnto the old heresie of Iouinian, which to make
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13340:74"/>
all sinnes equall, made euery sinne lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a deadly sinne. Whome S. Augustine condemned more than a thousande yeares agoe, as appeareth in his</hi> 6. <hi>Tom. de Haeres. Haer.</hi> 82.</p>
               <p>How <hi>S. Augustine</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned <hi>Iouinian,</hi> and wherefore, it is manifest there in the place you recite and in his Epistles, for making all sinnes equall in déed: But not for saying that all sinnes deserue death, and therefore are mortall: That you can not finde in <hi>S. Augustine</hi> or any other: There is great difference betwixte these twoo, propositions, <hi>Omnia peccata sunt ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualia,</hi> and <hi>Omnia peccata sunt mortalia:</hi> Al sinnes are equall, and all sinnes are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. For you can not conclude, They are all mortall, therefore they are all equall. Although contrarie after a certayne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it may be sayde they are all equall, therefore they be mortall. We saye, that who soeuer is angrie with his brother without a cause, shall be culpable of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement: We saye to, whoso sayeth foole to his brother, shal be punished with hell fire: We saye the lyke of murder, we say the like of the sinne of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and

Although that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God be offended in them all, yet in some of them, thou sinnest ageinst nature, thou sinnest ageinst heauen and earth, the sonne it selfe is ashamed to behold thy vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, and thou ashamed to shewe thy selfe in light: in some, thy sin is so horrible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if man do winke, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth will cry out for vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

               <p>
                  <hi>Let vs conferre herewithall two sayings of the Scripture:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>the one of S. Iohn which sayeth as well of himselfe and of euery iust man, as of the sinner. Si dixerimus. &amp;c. If we say that we haue no sin, we deceyue our selues, and the truthe is not in vs: meaning that the iustest man a lyue is not without sinne. Nowe, if this sinne be as M. Goughe teacheth, deadly, mortal and damnable sin, whiche separateth the soule of man from God, and condemneth it to hell fire, let vs see how a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be called iust, which day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committeth such damnable sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This place maketh more ageinst you, than with you, you wil not say I thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Iohn was one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most grieuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was an adulterer, a dronkerd. &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:13340:76"/>
And yet was he a sinner as the iustest ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, yet sinned he .vij. tymes, and lacked the glorie of God. And of the same sinnes, he spake in that sentence, of the same spake he in the sentence before, saying: <hi>And the bloud of Christ his sonne clenseth vs from all our sinnes.</hi> And in the sentence after: <hi>If we acknowledge our sinnes, he is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from all vnrighteousnesse.</hi> He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth him selfe in the number and sayeth, <hi>clense vs from all, forgiue vs all our sinnes.</hi> Then belike the sinnes of S. Iohn had néede of it: If they had néede, why was it? Was it not, bicause that <hi>stipendium pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati mors est?</hi> the wages of sinne is death? But peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture he did not acknowledge these for any sinnes. Then by your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he had no sinne. Take héede of that, if you say so, he wil answer you straight, you are a lier. But you can not sée, how a man may be called iust, which daily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth such deadly sinne. You ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not sée how Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid sayth. <hi>Beati quoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remissae sunt iniquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes &amp; quorum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dauid telleth you in an other place, the iust man falleth, but he riseth vp again. He repenteth him self, and flyeth to the mercy of God, and he doth forgiue him. After this you come againe to the place of Luke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Zacharie and Elizabeth: touching which place bicause I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered it before, I wil say nothing: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides I there alleaged both out of <hi>Glossa or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaria Theophilact</hi> and <hi>Iustinꝰ Martyr,</hi> I will now also refer you to <hi>Ierom aduersus Pelag. ad Chte.</hi> where you shal sée, whether any such thing be to be concluded or no, &amp; take héede you be not a <hi>Pelagian</hi> in that poinct. As for the contradiction you there speake of, which foloweth of these two pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces conferred togither, if M. Goughs expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition do stand: there is none, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of your words. For as you say here after, peraduenture against your will, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Augustin</hi> enforseth you thither, you must say for the least sin you can deuise, <hi>forgiue vs our trespasses:</hi> if you did trespasse
<pb facs="tcp:13340:77"/>
him, you were not without blame. So you make a contradiction against your self, for that you say, a iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is without blame, &amp; yet he must say forgiue me. The truthe is as I said (M. Fecknam) there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to say a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinneth damnably, and therfore in consideration of his own doing worthy to be condemned: yet being pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the frée mercy of Christ, he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.</note> As the Apostle sayeth, who can lay any thing to our charge? not respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that, that we are, but that, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.

                  <hi>To this may bee added the place of S. Iames: where he describeth concupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to make a sin in vs beside mortall sin, saying. Concupiscentia cùm conceperit, &amp;c: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce when it hath conceiued, bringeth forth sinne, but sinne whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is finished: begetteth death. Signifying hereby that sinne is then mortall &amp; deadly, when a man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth it with a ful consent &amp; other circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. For if a light passion or a carnall thought stealeth vpon a man by sodein delectation without consent, the same is not a sinne, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendereth death, but a veniall sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:13340:77"/>S. Iames his purpose is not as you say, to shew how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence maketh a sinne besides mortal sinne, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you proue, by this place, that which you graunt that concupiscence is a sin (although it be true.) S. Iames goeth not about here to shewe, when sinne beginneth to be a sinne, to be taken and estemed so before God: But to shew, when it commeth forth, and whence it proceadeth, that he might against the false surmises of others, shewe, that their sinne and tempting, procedeth not from God. His order is this, The consummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne procureth Death euerlasting: sinne procedeth from vnordinate desires, vnordinate desires from concupiscence. Therefore in that, that men are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their sinnes, they receiue but the frute which they brought forth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues: and therefore can they not cast any fault on God. Can you now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue by this place, that either concupiscence is a sinne which I deny not) eyther that it is not a mortall sinne? Out of thys place I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that my condemnation is of my self: I canne not gather that Concupiscence is a Sinne, but onely by a consequent,
<pb facs="tcp:13340:78"/>
because it bringeth forth sinne. For such as the fruyte is, suche is the tree, and so may I conclude agayne. The fruyte is damnable, therefore the trée. But here I do gather it.<note place="margin">
