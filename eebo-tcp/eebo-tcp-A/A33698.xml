            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE Contents of the following Papers, were intended to fill ſome few Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters, in a General Account of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi> but the Author in digeſting his Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, found them like to ſwell into almost as great a Volume as he deſign'd for the whole, which made him reſolve to venture them out by themſelves, as deſpairing of being read, ſhould the Bulk become ſo great, as the taking in of the other Parts of his Subject wou'd make it. This is the true Reaſon why the <hi>Court of Portugal</hi> appears thus unaccompanied with ſuch other Matters as ſhou'd have been plac'd before and after it; which is what the Author was far from deſigning, when he firſt began to write; It was then, for many Reaſons, the leaſt in his Intention, to ſingle out the <hi>Court,</hi> from that great Variety of Subjects which <hi>Portugal</hi> affords to one that is not altogether an idle Spectator in it.</p>
            <p>It is true, that he thought it convenient in deſcribing the State of that Kingdom, to be more full in this part of his Account, than they
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:54374:4"/>
uſually are, who write of Foreign Countries: For to underſtand the Affairs of any Nation, it is abſolutely neceſſary to have ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Knowledge of the Court; that is to ſay, of ſuch as preſide themſelves at the Helm, or have any great Influence upon thoſe that do; The Court, in this ſenſe, being to a Politick Body, what the Mind is to the Natural, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Life and Motion to all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and as that Vital Principle appears to be diſpoſed, or affected, one may ſooneſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Symptoms of a Vigorous, or a Weakly Conſtitution: And one who is well acquainted with the State of That, may be enabled to give a good Account of the Publick Proceedings, by tracing them to their Original Cauſes and Motives; and may, withal, make ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjecture, what they are like to be in any ſuppos'd Caſe, for the time to come.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe thought neceſſary, in order to underſtand the true State of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to know in what Terms that Kingdom ſtands with its ſeveral Neighbours; thoſe more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in whoſe Will or Power it is to do any great Good or Harm. Now the beſt way to know, how far <hi>Portugal</hi> is to expect either the one or the other from them, is by conſidering what it hath receiv'd already; former Experience being the ſureſt Evidence in this Caſe. It is therefore the Deſign of thoſe Diſcourſes, that make the Second Part of this Piece, to ſhew how
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:54374:4"/>
               <hi>Portugal</hi> hath been ſerved by its real or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Friends, as often as they have been put to the Trial, or had any occaſion to diſcover themſelves; and it is conceiv'd, that the Tranſactions that have paſs'd between this, and other Crowns, ſince the Houſe of <hi>Bragança</hi> came to be in poſſeſſion of the Throne, are ſet in a juſt Light, ſo far at least, as that the Reader may eaſily perceive, what the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>Portugal</hi> are; and whether, or no, they have been duly cultivated, by ſuch as have the Management of Affairs in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But the chief Buſineſs of this <hi>Preface,</hi> is to juſtifie the Author's Credit with the Reader; which may poſſibly be called in queſtion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſeveral Particulars, in the following Account. He is far from the Folly of thinking himſelf exempt from Miſtakes; it is very likely, that he may have been guilty of many, in that great variety of Matters which he hath had occaſion to mention. He does not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he ever ſaw any Relation of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Affairs, made by Strangers, that had not many palpable Errors in it; which makes him the leſs confident of his own Performance: And he expects the like Allowances, that are uſually made to thoſe that write of Foreign Countries. However, he muſt acknowledge at the ſame time, that thoſe groſſer Faults that are commonly obſerv'd in ordinary Travellers, wou'd be much more inexcuſable in him; he
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:54374:5"/>
having liv'd for ſome Years in the Country he writes of, his Acquaintance was amongſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Perſons, who had lived there much longer; he hath been ſomewhat converſant with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Authors, and hath brought away with him a Collection of ſuch of them as are moſt eſteem'd; and out of theſe laſt, he is ready to produce his Evidence, for ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in this Piece, as are moſt likely to be call'd in queſtion.</p>
            <p>In relating that great Tranſaction, wherein His preſent Majeſty's first Queen had ſo large a ſhare, he hath taken the principal Matters of Fact, from the <hi>Cataſtrophe de Portugal,</hi> written in Defence of the Party which got the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-hand; the Subſtance whereof, as the Writer pretends, was read before the Three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Kingdom. It is true, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections very different from his, are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made here upon the very ſame Facts; The Author, on many Occaſions, as little approving of that Writers Sentiments, as he does of his Stile throughout the Book; which is that of a moſt paſſionate and furious Declaimer, rather than a just Hiſtorian. In ſpeaking of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Affairs; with relation to <hi>Rome,</hi> he hath likewiſe made great uſe of the Publick Acts of the King, and the Eſtates, as alſo of the <hi>Conde da Eryceiras Portugal Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> He hath alſo followed the ſame Noble Author, in what he relates concerning the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:54374:5"/>
with the Court of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> had Opportunities to inform himſelf of theſe Matters at the beſt Hand; that is, from the Reports and Letters of Publick Miniſters: His Lordſhip hath indeed given us in <hi>England</hi> great occaſion to complain of him; but that may have been for Reaſons, which will never make him ſuſpected of being much prejudiced againſt either <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>France.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Conduct, in the Cauſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> at the <hi>Pirenees,</hi> is deſcrib'd from his own Letters. The Information received by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, concerning the great part which the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> had, in the Victories obtain'd over the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and in concluding the Peace, and conſequently in eſtabliſhing the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Throne, was ſuch, that he could deſire no better. He hath taken ſome Particulars about the intended Match between the late <hi>Infanta,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as it was tranſacted at <hi>Turin,</hi> from the famous <hi>Gregorio Leti:</hi> But he hath ſpoken dubiouſly of them; tho' if that Writer be of any Credit, he may be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as to things done at <hi>Turin,</hi> he having lived ſo long as he did in the Neighbourhood. There are ſome things likewiſe in the Chapter of <hi>Spain,</hi> borrowed from him, <hi>Leti</hi> pretending to a Perſonal Acquaintance with the Duke of <hi>Giovinazzo.</hi> In the Chapter concerning the Miniſtry, and elſewhere, he hath made ſome uſe, and but little, of a Memoir in <hi>French,</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:54374:6"/>
which was handed about in Manuſcript, at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> written, as 'twas ſaid, by a <hi>German,</hi> that was Secretary to the late Queen; but he is too ſevere in his Cenſures, to be much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by one that would not be thought ſatyrical. He hath cauſe to fear, that his Account of the Cuſtoms and Taxes, is neither ſo exact, nor ſo full, as he could wiſh, he being little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe Matters; however, he ſhew'd it to one whoſe Buſineſs it was to know them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who did not diſcover to him any Error in it. Some may think, that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Money, is ſet againſt our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> at too low a Rate, the Exchange, of late Years, having run much higher on the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſide; but he is aſſured by thoſe that are more skilful than himſelf, that he hath juſtly reckon'd it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intrinſick Value. There is nothing material ſaid, concerning the <hi>Croiſade Bull,</hi> that is not taken out of the <hi>Bull</hi> it ſelf, and the Papers publiſh'd by the Commiſſary, by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Pope; this, and another <hi>Bull,</hi> with ſome more Authentick Papers, ſhould have been placed at the End of the Book, had there been room for them: But they ſhall be forth-coming, whenever it is thought convenient. The Tranſactions between <hi>Xavier,</hi> and her late Majeſty, have been related upon the Credit of the Authors mention'd on that occaſion. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Addreſs is faithfully tranſlated only it was forgot to give neceſſary Directions
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:54374:6"/>
to the <hi>Compoſitor,</hi> to put Breaches in ſeveral places, the Orator making a great many more Flouriſhes, to the like purpoſe with thoſe ſet down, but they are paſt over, lest he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear tedious; however, this Omiſſion hath occaſion'd little or no alteration in the Senſe; great care was taken in the Tranſlation, not to pervert his Meaning, by the least Turn of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, tho' in one Paſſage it cost ſome Pains to make him ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> in modest Terms. The Relation of the Deceaſed Prince's Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy, is wholly <hi>Padre Vieira</hi>'s own: It is indeed very much contracted; but 'tis hoped, that his Senſe is not much obſcured; and it is given, for the most part, in a literal Tranſlation of his own Words. The Reader may wonder to ſee this Father brought in upon the Stage ſo often as he is; which, in truth, is ſo very often, that his Name is ſometimes ſuppreſſed: And ſome may think it unfair, to inſist ſo much upon the Whimſies of one Man, ſince from Relations of this kind, People commonly form their Notions of the general Character and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of a whole Nation. But the Author is far from being Conſcious to himſelf of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous Dealing in this reſpect; one great Reaſon why he thought fit to ſingle out <hi>Padre Vieira,</hi> from amongst ſeveral other of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preachers in <hi>Portugal,</hi> whoſe Works are now by him, was, becauſe he wou'd give for a

               <hi>Specimen,</hi> the very best of the kind, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre Vieira</hi> is generally acknowledg'd to be by his Country-men; inſomuch, that perhaps there never was a Preacher ſo univerſally, or ſo highly approv'd of in <hi>Portugal,</hi> by all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Degrees of Men; and the Reaſon commonly given for his being ſo much eſteem'd is, becauſe he was one of the least guilty of thoſe prodigious Extravagancies which Strangers are ſo much aſtoniſh'd at in the Sermons of other Preachers; tho' the Truth is, one wou'd take that particular Inſtance now mention'd, to be both an Original, and a Nonſuch.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Court of <hi>PORT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GAL,</hi> UNDER THE REIGN Of the Preſent KING, <hi>Dom Pedro</hi> II.</head>
            <p>THIS preſent Account of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Court, is confin'd to the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuch of the Miniſters as are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have a more than ordinary Share in the Direction of Affairs: Other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being reſerv'd for a more General Account of the Kingdom and Government.</p>
            <p>The Subject of this, is commonly the moſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, in Relations from Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and will therefore be more enlarg'd upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54374:8"/>
than hath been uſual in Works of a like Nature: For which, as it is hoped, the Dignity of the Perſons to be ſpoken of, and the Importance, or at leaſt the Novelty of the Matters to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, may ſerve for an Excuſe.</p>
            <p>There will perhaps be occaſion for ſome ſuch Apology, in ſeveral of the following Chapters; but if it be any where needleſs, it is certainly in the firſt. The KING, ſince his being ſetled in the Government, having obtain'd a Character in the World, that is ſo Fair in it ſelf, and ſtands in ſo little need of Shading, that none can with Reaſon think amiſs of an Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw it at full Length, and to ſet it in a juſt Light.</p>

               <head>Of the KING.</head>
               <p>HIS Title is, <hi>The High and Mighty Prince, Dom</hi> PEDRO <hi>the Second, by the Grace of GOD, King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and of the</hi> Algarves, <hi>on this, and on the other ſide of the Sea, in</hi> Africa; <hi>Lord of</hi> Guinè, <hi>and of the Conquest, Navigation, Commerce, of</hi> Aethiopia, Arabia, Perſia; <hi>and of</hi> India, with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was born the 26th of <hi>April,</hi> 1648. He took upon him the Government, with the Title of Prince-Regent, the 23d of <hi>November,</hi> 1667; when King Dom <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the Sixth, his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was Dethron'd; and he ſucceeded to the Crown at the Death of that King, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the 12th of <hi>December,</hi> 1683.</p>
               <p>He is of a robuſt and vigorous Conſtitution, tall of Perſon, ſomewhat above the ordinary ſize, and proportionably big; of wonderful Strength, and great Activity of Body, as appears ſtill by the Proof he makes of both, at his ordinary Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and Diverſions. He is of a grave and comely Aſpect, hath nothing of Haughtineſs in his Looks; but on the contrary, ſuch an Air of Modeſty, as may be thought unuſual in Perſons of his Rank: He appears ſomewhat uneaſie, when gaz'd upon by a Multitude; and one may diſcern a little Diſorder in his Countenance, when he is Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Publick, to ſuch as he is not uſed to. He wears a long black Perruque; and when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Publick, is always habited in Black, with a Cloak, and long Lace-Band, which is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54374:9"/>
common Wear, among People of any Faſhion, about the Town. At other times he goes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cloak, and in colour'd Cloaths, made after the <hi>French</hi> Mode; unleſs it be whilſt a <hi>Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> preſcribing the Faſhion, is in force, (as he hath ſeveral times publiſhed Edicts to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe); for then the King's Cloaths are made after the Pattern he would have follow'd by his Subjects. 'Till <hi>Engliſh</hi> black Cloth was allow'd of, His Majeſty uſually wore <hi>Colcheſter-</hi>Bays.</p>
               <p>This Prince is of a quick Apprehenſion, and a piercing Judgment, ſenſible, thoughtful, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to Melancholy, which of late Years hath grown much upon him; upon what occaſion, I cannot pretend to determine.</p>
               <p>He is a very Religious Prince, being conſtantly obſervant of the Set-Times and Seaſons of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Is often heard, by thoſe that are near him, ſaying over his <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> and <hi>Pater-Noſters,</hi> to himſelf. He ſhews a great Zeal for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Infidels to Chriſtianity, and is at great Charges in ſending out Miſſionaries, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Ships on purpoſe for that end. Nor doth he think it below him, to concern himſelf in bringing over to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, ſuch as he hath been taught to call Hereticks, be the Perſons never ſo mean. But above all, he is exceeding cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable; and, as I have it from good Hands, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends large Sums that way.</p>
               <p>He is very temperate in his Diet, eats com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alone, and ſometimes (as they ſay) ſitting on the Floor, according to the ancient Cuſtom of the Country; (which the Women obſerve to this Day) with a flat piece of Cork under him, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom more than one Attendant waiting on him while he eats. His Meals are extreamly mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54374:9"/>
and provided as for a ſingle Perſon. His conſtant Drink is Water; for he never uſes any ſtrong Liquors. He hath ſo great an Averſion to Wine, that he doth not only refrain from it himſelf but obliges all about him to a like Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence. Such of the Nobility, or others, that have drunk Wine, muſt keep from Court that Day: For His Majeſty would diſcover them by the Smell, and not fail to ſignifie his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Nor doth he find it difficult to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obey'd in this Point; People of this Country, Perſons of Quality more eſpecially, and, indeed, all that have the leaſt regard to their Credit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſhy of drinking Wine: And, I believe, there is no People in <hi>Europe,</hi> leſs addicted, to that moſt inexcuſable Vice of Drunkenneſs, than they are.</p>
               <p>I can ſay nothing in Commendation of this King's Temperance of another ſort; there being certain forbidden Pleaſures, that are too much allow'd of in <hi>Portugal:</hi> In which, if common Report, among his Subjects, be to be credited, he hath indulg'd himſelf very much: And they ſay, he has not been wholly free from the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences conſequent to ſuch a Practice. I never heard, that he hath had any declared Favourite of the Sex, unleſs it were one <hi>French-</hi>Woman; who had that Title, for ſome time, at leaſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People: But thoſe he hath had this Commerce with, are ſaid to be of the loweſt Rank (the <hi>French-</hi>Woman excepted), and very many, and not all of the ſame Colour. He hath not, as yet, acknowledg'd any unlawful Iſſue, ſave one Daughter, whoſe Mother was a mean Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54374:10"/>
He hath not been brought up to Letters; ſome ſay, we may uſe the Term in the ſtricteſt Senſe: But 'tis certain, the Publick Diſpatches are neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſign'd with his own Hand. However, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the manner of his Education, he can have but little of what we generally call Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet he ſpeaks <hi>Spaniſh</hi> very well; and uſes that Language as often as he is addreſs'd to in it by Foreigners. And as for his Native Tongue, it is ſaid, That there is ſcarce a Perſon in the Kingdom that ſpeaks it more Properly, or with greater Elegance: And he hath ſo well improved himſelf by Practice, that Foreign Miniſters do much admire his great Capacity for Buſineſs. They find in their Addreſſes to him; which, in this Court, they have frequent occaſion to make; that he comprehends with much eaſe, the Matter they propoſe, whatſoever it be; and will, upon the Spot, diſcourſe with them readily about it: He ſpeaks always to the Purpoſe, and anſwers to the Point; and if need be, will manage the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with as great Dexterity as any of them.</p>
               <p>Among other Inconveniences that attend his being unacquainted with Books, this is none of the leaſt; that inſtead of thoſe more pleaſant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements, that delight and recreate the Mind, his Diverſions conſiſt moſt in Bodily Exerciſes; or if the Time does not ſerve for them, when the Buſineſs of the Day is over, He, inſtead of ſuch Converſation as may be thought more fit to entertain a Prince, admits into his Preſence, not only the younger Nobility, but Perſons of a much inferiour Rank, who divert His Majeſty with the News and Intrigues of the Town: And they ſay, That when any thing remarkable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, or is talk'd of among the People, of any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54374:10"/>
Sort, or Nation, His Majeſty is ſure to have the Story brought him at Night. But at Times of more Leiſure, his ordinary Recreations are Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Shooting, Riding, and this laſt commonly at the Bull. Going a Hunting, or Shooting, he hath uſed to take his Queen along with him, to partake of the Sport; and the Time between <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>Lent,</hi> is always ſet-apart for theſe Diverſions; to which end, the Court removes, at that Seaſon, to <hi>Salvaterra,</hi> a Country-Houſe in <hi>Alemtejo,</hi> about ten Leagues from <hi>Lisbon.</hi> But above all other Recreations, the King takes a ſingular Delight in Riding; he manages a Horſe ſo well, that there is ſcarce a Maſter in his Kingdom better skill'd in the Art; tho' here almoſt every Body that is able to keep a Horſe, learns to Ride. His Majeſty hath a Court on purpoſe for this Exerciſe, belonging to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at <hi>Lisbon;</hi> but he indulges himſelf moſt at <hi>Alcantara,</hi> a Houſe of Pleaſure, a little way out of Town; where he often enjoys himſelf at his beloved Exerciſe of Riding with his Lance at the Bull, Performing with admirable Dexterity and Conduct. Nor is he content to deal with that fierce Animal on Horſeback, but he frequently engages him a Foot; to this end he hath a ſmall piece of Ground, enclos'd with void Spaces in the Wall on every ſide, big enough for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to eſcape through, when the Bull proves too hard for him, as he ſometimes does, to the endangering of his Perſon; tho' upon the leaſt appearance of a Diſcompoſure, the Company is ready to come in to his Reſcue: And on ſuch Occaſions, one ſhall ſee the main Body of the Nobility engag'd about the Bull, every one ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing him by that Part he can firſt lay hold on,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54374:11"/>
whether it be by the Horns, the Neck, or the Tail. 'Tis true, the King of late hath not uſed this Exerciſe ſo frequently as formerly; not that he finds any failure of his former Strength or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, but becauſe of the Queen's great Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his Perſon: For Her Majeſty would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when ſhe heard the King was thus employ'd, take Coach preſently, and drive to <hi>Alcantara;</hi> and upon her arrival the Sport was at an end.</p>
               <p>The King never fails to be preſent at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Bull-runnings all the three Days, which is the time this Feaſt uſually laſts: Perhaps his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in this, as that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was on the like Occaſions, may be as much to pleaſe the People as Himſelf: For the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> from the higheſt to the loweſt, are ſtrangely fond of the Sport. It hath been an ancient Cuſtom, which is ſtill kept up, for the Chamber of <hi>Lisbon</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the People with this Sight, in Honour to St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> the Son and Patron of the City; and, in Gratitude, for the Birth of an <hi>Infante,</hi> a Pretence which the King of late hath furniſhed them with almoſt every Year: Tho' it is thought one Reaſon may be the raiſing of a conſiderable Sum of Money, which they make by the Scaffolds that are built about a very large Square, before the Palace, which are all ſure to be fill'd; for at the News of a Bull-running, the People come flocking in from all parts of the Country round about. The King has a fine Balcony built for him out of one of the Palace-Windows, where he ſits all the time with his Queen, and the young Princes, attended by a Nobleman; who receives his Orders, and delivers them out at another Window, for the Conduct of the Cavalier, and the Management of the Bulls. His Majeſty, tho'
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54374:11"/>
he ſits compos'd all the while, yet is ſo intent upon the Sport, that he is ſometimes heard by thoſe in the Seats under him, applauding the Cavalier, when he hath given a lucky Stroke; and one that comes off with Credit, ſhall the next Day be received by him in the moſt kind and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging manner, and may depend afterwards on his Favour.</p>
               <p>But there lies a great Complaint againſt His Majeſty on this occaſion: That he, for his own private Diverſion, abates much of the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the People would otherwiſe take: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bulls appear in Publick, the King, on pretence of trying what Metal they are made of, will have them to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> where they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo harraſs'd out, that very few of them will make head againſt the Cavalier; and when a ſprightly Bull appears, that is likely to make them Sport, and do Miſchief, the King will ſometimes order him to be taken in again, and reſerved for his own uſe: This ſets the People a murmuring. A happy People, were this the greateſt Grievance they had to complain of! And, in truth, it ſeems to be one of the greateſt they can lay to their King's Charge, or that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him to be in his Power to redreſs.</p>
               <p>For tho' the Opinions of Men are various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Cauſe and Manner of his firſt taking upon him the Government, yet it is generally agreed, that in the Adminiſtration thereof, he hath all along ſhewn himſelf to be moſt tenderly careful of his Peoples Welfare, and in his whole Conduct, to have highly deſerved the Character that is giv'n him, of a truly juſt and good Prince. I confeſs, it would be ſomewhat difficult, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile to this Character, ſome former Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54374:12"/>
wherein his Name was much made uſe of; but then it muſt be conſidered, that while thoſe things, which are moſt liable to Cenſure, were tranſacted, he was very young, and in the hands of others. But in what relates to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Government, I find, upon the exacteſt Enquiry I could make, People of all Parties to be generally agreed in their Opinions concerning him; and in <hi>Portugal</hi> they take as great a Liberty in ſpeaking their Minds of their Superiours, as in any other Country whatſoever: But they have here ſo high an Eſteem for their King, that if they blame any thing in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, it is his not making uſe of his great Power, ſo often as they could wiſh; they think he pays too great a Deference to his Counſellors, and to theſe they impute all the Hardſhips they ſuffer. The ſame thing is taken Notice of by Foreigners, and reckon'd to be the Cauſe of any falſe Steps this Court may have taken, inconſiſtent with the Honour and true Intereſts of the Crown. But it is a Fault the wiſeſt Men are guilty of, to have too great a diſtruſt of themſelves. And this King, they ſay, is perſwaded to do nothing of Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, without the Advice and Concurrence of his Miniſters, as thinking it the ſafeſt Courſe he can take for the Diſcharge of his Conſcience.</p>
               <p>He is a Religious Obſerver of Juſtice, and has thereby delivered his Kingdom from many great Diſorders, that it before labour'd under. Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries on the High-Way are now ſeldom, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of, notwithſtanding the univerſal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty that appears throughout the Country; and 'tis ſaid, that before this Reign, 'twas unſafe for any to be abroad in the Evening, about, and within the City it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54374:12"/>
Murders are not near ſo frequent now as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the King growing every Day more and more ſevere againſt the Guilty: And in truth, there was great occaſion for it, Crimes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being very lightly made of in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if committed in a Fray, or upon the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Provocation: A former Grudge, tho' of old ſtanding, was uſed to be taken for a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable Excuſe, even when the Murder was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the moſt cowardly and treacherous manner; the Criminal was acquitted, or ſued out his Pardon of Courſe, or fled to Sanctuary; and being once there, procur'd a <hi>Carta de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guro,</hi> which is a Protection given by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for one that hath the Priviledge of Sanctuary, to appear abroad and ſollicit his Cauſe; whereby he has an opportunity given him to compound with his Proſecutors, or by other means to take off, or elude the Purſuit of Juſtice. But now <hi>Cartas de Seguro</hi> are more rarely granted, and Criminals are oftentimes forc'd from Sanctuary. Such Order is taken for preſerving the Peace, that a Man may paſs through the City at any time of Night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting with the leaſt Affront or Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Formerly the City was much infeſted, and great Diſorders committed by Night-Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of all Ranks and Orders, from thoſe of the firſt Quality, down to the very Fryars. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of an old Porter, belonging to a certain Convent, that he uſes to tell with Regret, how mightily the Time are altered, from what they were in his Days; when a Dozen, or more, Fryars, of his Convent, would ſally out in a Night upon Adventures: And there muſt be ſomething in it, that there goes a common Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54374:13"/>
among the People, That <hi>it is equally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to deal with a Fryar by Night, as with a Fidalgo by Day.</hi> The Reaſon uſually given for it is: That in a Night-Scuffle the Fryar will be ſure to ſtand as ſtoutly to it, becauſe he is not known, as a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalgo wou'd in the Day-time becauſe he is. But now all things are ſtill and quiet, the Clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings of Swords and Targets, which formerly uſed to be ever and anon diſturbing Peoples Reſt, are ſeldom heard; except it be on ſuch Nights, when People of all Sorts and Sexes, are let looſe to viſit the Churches; but thoſe are Times of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and they take a Liberty then to commit all manner of Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fidalgo's</hi> (a Title common to ſuch as are of Noble Families) who us'd to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as above the Law, or beyond its reach, are now in a great meaſure reduc'd to order, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice has its Courſe among them, as well as the meaneſt Subjects. Elderly People repreſent them as a ſort of petty Tyrants, exerciſing with great Barbarity, a kind of Deſpotick Power, over the Lives, and all that belong'd to thoſe about them. But if there were any Grounds for ſuch a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, this King's Government can never ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be commended, who hath wrought ſo great a Reformation among them, that there may be found, at this Day, as Noble Inſtances of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and Courteſie, in <hi>Portugal,</hi> as in any part of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three times a Week the King gives Audience to his Subjects, <hi>Tueſdays</hi> and <hi>Thurſdays</hi> to all in general, that deſire it; <hi>Saturdays</hi> to his Nobility, and Officers of State in particular: And this is the Morning's-work of each Day. On the Days of general Audience, the meaneſt Subject may have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54374:13"/>
free Acceſs to the King, whether it be to acquaint him of their Grievances, to beg his Charity, or <hi>Requerer Serviços,</hi> as they call it; that is, to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Penſion on pretence of Service; and Service is pretended, not only by thoſe that have done any thing for the Advantage of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or the Crown; but likewiſe by ſuch as have been for any time in Employment; which they think entitles them to a Penſion, or a better Place. His Majeſty hears all with great Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Patience, will let the Petitioner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he underſtands his Caſe, and will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him when he comes again, and few part from his Preſence diſſatisfied.</p>
               <p>The currant Money of this Kingdom was ſo miſerably clipt, that it was diminiſhed to near half the Value; as appears by an Order made by the Government, That no Pieces of Eight ſhould paſs, that weighed leſs than four Rials and a half: But now it is all reduc'd to a juſt Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard; to which end, it being found neceſſary to Re-coin all the Money, both Gold and Silver, the King, for the Eaſe of the poorer ſort, took the Loſs of the Silver upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Publick Revenues are managed to the beſt Advantage: The Accounts, which were formerly all in Confuſion, are ſaid to be reduc'd into an exact Order, and kept with great Regularity. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and Impoſts, are let out to Farm to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; the Contracter is he that will bid moſt, Native, or Foreigner: The King, it ſeems, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Merchants, who know beſt how to deal with one another, can afford to give him more than he could make of them himſelf; and his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms are ſaid to be much improv'd by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: For the King takes Care to make his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54374:14"/>
of the Farmer's Diligence. The Contract never exceeds the Term of Three Years; which expir'd, an exact Account is taken from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in the Cuſtom-Houſe, of the Gains that have been made, and regard had thereto at the next Auction; and the Price, through the Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Bidders, is often rais'd much higher than was look'd for.</p>
               <p>A Courſe not unlike this is taken, when the King has occaſion to furniſh his Magazines with Stores, or wants any Foreign Commodities; of which Publick Notice is given to the Merchants, and the Bargain is made with him that will take care to procure them at the loweſt Rate. The King is ſo punctual and ſpeedy in his Payments, that the Merchants are encouraged to deal with him for little Profit; ſo that they are never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to under-bid each other: And I have been told, that ſometimes the King has generouſly put a ſtop to them, when in the Heat of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have been deſcending below a juſt Price; His Majeſty, it ſeems, thinking it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming him, to take Advantage at other Mens Follies. By this means he has his Stores al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at the beſt hand, and no Under-Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employ'd in buying them in, he never ſuffers by their Knavery, nor can he be cheated by the Merchant who delivers them into his Magazines; for it is always a Condition in the Bargain, That a fair Trial ſhall be made of the Goods, and no more paid for, than will bear the Proof.</p>
               <p>The Revenues of the Kingdom are ſo very great, that did they all come into the King's Hands, he would be one of the richeſt Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> as will appear by the following Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter. But ſo many Aſſignments are made upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54374:14"/>
almoſt every Branch of them, (the King's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Patrimony, as Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) ſo many Penſions paid to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Families, that they ſeem almoſt wholly diverted from the Publick Treaſury. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Alienation of the Revenues, was ſet on foot, 'tis thought, by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings; and that in proſecution of their Deſign, to reduce <hi>Portugal</hi> into the form of a Province; they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that if the Rents of the Crown were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, <hi>Portugal</hi> could no longer ſubſiſt as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant Kingdom; as not having wherewithal to ſupport the Government, or encourage any great Men to head them, in caſe the People were diſpos'd to a Revolt, while the Royal Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues being divided among private Families, might oblige all that ſhar'd in the Spoils, to adhere to the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Intereſt. It hath been often laid to the Charge of the Three <hi>Philips,</hi> That they did their utmoſt to weaken the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> while they had it in poſſeſſion; they are accus'd of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs, than conſenting to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeizing upon the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Conqueſts in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies;</hi> and all in purſuance of that Maxim of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, <hi>That it is much better to be Maſter of a ruin'd and quiet Kingdom, than one that is rich, powerful, and turbulent. John</hi> the Fourth, this King's Father, when from Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> he was made King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by the Nobility and People, thought fit to accept of the Crown with all its Incumbrances, and it was not for his Intereſt to make himſelf ſo many Enemies as muſt have been impoveriſh'd, had he re-united the alienated Revenues to the Crown: So that he was fain to maintain his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and carry on the War, by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54374:15"/>
Impoſts upon the People; theſe have been ſince increas'd, and the Aſſignments mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd. And this King, tho' perhaps there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a more frugal Prince in his Domeſtick Management; (for, they ſay, he knows what every part of his wearing Apparel coſts him, and will ſtrive as hard as the pooreſt Cuſtomer to beat down the Price); yet by giving way to his generous Inclinations to do good to others, he has ſo impoveriſh'd himſelf, that he is hard put to it to bear the Charges of the Government; which, as 'tis thought, could ſcarce ſubſiſt, were any other but himſelf at the Helm, eſpecially at this Juncture, when he is at ſuch extraordinary Expences in making new Levies, and equipping out his Fleet. The People are already ſo charg'd with Impoſts, that nothing further can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them: For tho' they have had great Advantages by a free Trade, during the late War; yet the Money being convey'd out of the Kingdom, by ſuch ways as ſhall be mention'd in another place, their Condition is not much mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby. That this is the preſent Caſe of the Kingdom, will appear from two Inſtances of a very freſh Date: The King is, as all the World knows, at this time, putting his Kingdom in a Poſture of Defence; to this end, among other things, it was thought convenient to ſecure St. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s Caſtle, which ſtands upon the Bar of the <hi>Tagus,</hi> and guards the Entrance into the River, and is, in effect, the main Bulwark of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> or rather, the Key to the whole Kingdom. It is ſtrongly built after the Modern Way, and well fortified with Guns; but hath this Diſadvantage, that it may be commanded on one ſide from a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Ground that is near it. It was therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54374:15"/>
in Council, Whether it were cheapeſt to level that Ground, or to raiſe a ſmall Fort upon it? But after the Place had been ſurvey'd, it was at laſt concluded, That both Ways were too chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either of them requiring a greater Expence than the State could well bear, and ſo neither way was taken. From this Inſtance, which came from a good Hand, it appears, that the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer muſt run very low at this time. And that the People can afford but ſmall Supplies, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from hence: The King, to enable himſelf to augment and maintain his Army, ſummon'd the <hi>Cortes,</hi> or Parliament, to meet at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the Firſt of <hi>December,</hi> 97: All that he demanded of them, was an Additional Revenue of 600000 Crowns; a Crown in <hi>Portugal,</hi> is ſcarce worth Half a Crown <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Parliament conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Occaſion, could not but acknowledge the Requeſt to be reaſonable; but then, how to raiſe the Money, was a matter of inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: In ſhort, they ſat down, as hath been ſaid, the Firſt of <hi>December</hi> 97, and were ſitting in <hi>July</hi> 98, and were conſidering all the while, of Ways and Means, and had made no Progreſs in the Affair; but, at laſt, they referr'd it to the King, to lay the Tax as he ſhould judge convenient: For their parts, tho' none could be inſenſible of the King's great want of a Supply, yet they found the People ſo burden'd already, that they knew not how to lay on them any further Weight, without danger of their ſinking under it. The King, as hath been reported ſince, has laid the Tax upon Tobacco; which, the Merchant thinks, is the ready way to deſtroy that Trade, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the beſt and cleareſt part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>

The moſt conſiderable Tranſactions of this Reign, will fall under ſome of the following Heads, and therefore I have nothing further to add in this Chapter; but that the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> is an Abſolute Prince, having the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as well as the Executive Power in his hands: For the Royal Edicts have the Force of Laws, and a Collection of theſe, is much the ſame thing there, as our Satute-Book is in <hi>England;</hi> when theſe fail, the Civil Law takes place. There are indeed certain Conſtitutions chiefly relating to the Succeſſion, called the Laws of <hi>Lamego,</hi> made by the <hi>Cortes</hi> at the firſt Inſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which cannot be diſpens'd with, but by Conſent of the Three Eſtates. It belongs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the <hi>Cortes,</hi> to lay Taxes upon the People, tho' certain Impoſts that are now upon Fleſh and Wine, and were given for a limited time, have been continued, by the King's Authority, and the Pope's together; the manner in which this was done, ſhall be told in the following Chapter.</p>

The Revenues ariſe chiefly from Cuſtoms, Taxes, Monopolies, Rents belonging to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Knighthood, and Moneys raiſed purely by the Pope's Bulls.</p>
               <p>The Cuſtoms paid here, are exceſſively great; all Foreign Commodities, excepting ſome few ſorts of ſmall Bulk, and eaſie Conveyance, pay no leſs than 23 <hi>per Cent,</hi> 20 for the ordinary Cuſtom, and 3 for a certain Duty call'd the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulado;</hi> which laſt is likewiſe paid for all Goods exported, whether by Natives, or Foreigners. They are indeed ſet at a favourable Valuation, except Fiſh from <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> which pays 22 <hi>per Cent</hi> in Specie. Goods brought hither, in order only to be tranſported to other Countries, pay 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> But it is believed, that nothing of all this comes to the King, or indeed to the Publick, the <hi>Conſulado</hi> excepted, which is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the building of Ships, and buying in of Stores.</p>
               <p>The Taxes are 7 <hi>Reis per</hi> Pound, upon all Fleſh brought into the Market, and as much <hi>per Canada</hi> upon Wine, ſold in by Retail (few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here keep any in their Houſes): A <hi>Canada</hi> holds ſomething leſs than Three Pints. Freſh Fiſh, which is caught here in great abundance in the River, and on the Sea-Coaſts, and is the beſt part of the Peoples Food, pays no leſs than 47 <hi>per Cent;</hi> and that exacted with great Rigor, and paid commonly in Specie. At the Sale of Lands, Houſes, Cattle of all ſorts, and indeed of almoſt every thing that is known to be bought and ſold, 10 <hi>per Cent</hi> of the Price goes to the King.</p>
               <p>A great part of theſe Taxes were granted by the Three Eſtates in <hi>Cortes,</hi> to King <hi>John</hi> the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54374:17"/>
Fourth, in 1641, and at other times, towards the Charges of the War with <hi>Spain;</hi> but after the Peace was made; the <hi>Cortes,</hi> in the Year 1674, rais'd them to what they are at preſent, by giving the Prince a Supply of a Million of Crowns <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> one half whereof was to be rais'd by an Additional Impoſt upon Fleſh and Wine: But this was then given only for Six Years; yet it hath been paid ever ſince. The Court, in the Year 1675, thought convenient to procure the Pope's Conſent to this laſt Impoſt, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy might have leave to pay their ſhare; becauſe (as it was given for a Reaſon) the laſt <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, and other Canons of their Church, had made it unlawful for any Prince to receive Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from the Clergy, without the Pope's leave, even tho' it were voluntarily offer'd by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as this had been by the Eccleſiaſtical, as well as the two other Eſtates in <hi>Cortes.</hi> And ſince that time, at the end of every Sixth Year, a <hi>Breve</hi> hath been procured from <hi>Rome,</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the Taxes for Six Years longer; therein the Pope impowers the <hi>Nuncio</hi> reſiding at <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> to uſe his Apoſtolical Authority, in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Clergy to pay them. This <hi>Breve</hi> is of courſe publiſhed in <hi>Portugal;</hi> and tho' it chiefly regards the Clergy, yet it is not unlikely but it may be deſign'd to induce the People likewiſe to pay their Taxes quietly, without putting the King, and the Three Eſtates of the Realm, to the trouble of meeting together in <hi>Cortes:</hi> For it muſt needs be a great Argument among them, that the thing is but juſt and reaſonable, ſince the Holy Father conſents to, and approves of it; and it weighs much with them, no doubt, when they conſider why his Holineſs grants the <hi>Breve;</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:54374:18"/>
which, as 'tis declared in the Narrative of it, is, The Exchequers being exhauſted by the vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences that the Crown hath been continually at, for the maintenance and propagation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, in the Dominions abroad, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Brazil,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> Hereticks, and other Infidels, were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to extirpate it: Which Reaſon is ſaid to continue ſtill, or rather, to become more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urgent every time there is occaſion for a new <hi>Breve.</hi> The Pope gives Commiſſion to his <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> to enquire into the Truth of this, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Allegations; as that the Three Eſtates, the Clergy more eſpecially, have given their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; the <hi>Nuncio</hi> cites the King's Procurator before him, and puts him upon the Proof: He ſhews, that the Nobility and People have agreed to the continuance of the Taxes, becauſe they ſtill pay them; and that the whole Body of the Clergy are likewiſe willing, becauſe the Biſhops have given their Conſent; which (as he pretends to prove withal) comprehends that of all the reſt. But it does not appear how he makes good the Main Point, <hi>viz.</hi> The Danger that the Catholick Faith is in from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Hereticks, and other Infidels. As for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd their Peace with <hi>Portugal</hi> in the Year 1669, and have kept it ever ſince. However, the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> is entirely ſatisfied with the Proofs, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be; and thereupon gives order for the Execution of the <hi>Breve,</hi> requiring Obedience thereto from all Perſons, Secular as well as Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, upon pain of the greater Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and 500 Crowns, applicable to the <hi>Reverend Chamber Apoſtolick,</hi> as the Words of the Order run.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54374:18"/>
Under the Title of Monopolies, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the other part of the Supply granted at the ſame time; which was an Impoſt upon To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, made into Snuff; by which, 500000 Crowns <hi>per Annum,</hi> were deſign'd to be rais'd. In order to make this Sum, the King had the whole Trade of Snuff put into his own Hands; and it became almoſt as great a Crime in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> for any to Make Snuff for themſelves, as 'tis with us in <hi>England</hi> to Coin Money, tho' People almoſt univerſally take it here. This Monopoly was let out to Farm to the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> the principal Perſon in the Kingdom, next His Majeſty; and it was ſo managed, that 'tis ſaid the King receiv'd much more than dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Value of what it was given for: The To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, as it come from <hi>Brazil,</hi> was bought up for the King, at a <hi>Teſton</hi> and half, or leſs, <hi>per</hi> Pound; and ſold out in Snuff for 16 <hi>or</hi> 20, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, the beſt, and 14 the more ordinary ſort. But 'tis ſaid, that this Trade is now laid aſide, and an Equivalent, with the Advantage of 600 000, tax'd upon Tobacco in Rolls. The King hath likewiſe in his Hands, a great part of the Trade from Foreign Plantations; as that of Elephants Teeth, from <hi>Africa;</hi> of Wood, from <hi>Brazil:</hi> Beſides, great Duties upon Sugar; and of all Goods coming from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> This laſt Trade is indeed but of little worth; for he hath ſeveral times offered to make it over to a Company of Merchants, but could never get a ſufficient Number of Subſcribers.</p>
               <p>The King is likewiſe Grand Maſter of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Knighthood, in his Kingdom, and has the diſpoſal of all the <hi>Commenda's</hi> belonging to them, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Order of Chriſt; which, in <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54374:19"/>
ſucceeded to that of the Knights-Templers, and is ſtill in poſſeſſion of their Lands, and hath 454 <hi>Commenda's</hi> belonging to it. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Order of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> which hath 60 <hi>Commenda's,</hi> and thoſe of conſiderable Profit. <hi>3dly,</hi> Of <hi>Avis,</hi> which hath 43, and theſe eſteem'd very rich. Beſides, the King hath the diſpoſal of the <hi>Commenda's</hi> in his Kingdom, that belong to the Knights of St. <hi>John of Jeruſalem,</hi> commonly called, the Knights of <hi>Malta;</hi> the chief of which, <hi>viz.</hi> the Priory of <hi>Crato,</hi> accounted one of the richeſt in the World, is at preſent beſtowed upon Dom <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco,</hi> the King's Second Son. I reckon theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the King's Revenues, becauſe they are put to the ſame uſe, as the greateſt part, by much, of his other Incomes are, <hi>viz.</hi> given away in Penſions, or Rewards, for Services.</p>
               <p>But the Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> have, for this laſt Century, made uſe of one extraordinary way to raiſe Money; which, among all <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> perhaps, hath never been thought of by any other Temporal Prince, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> excepted, who firſt brought it up in this Kingdom; and this is, by ſelling Indulgences to the People, for the Pardon of their Sins, and the Deliverance of their own, or their Relations, Souls, out of Purgatory. The Popes having been, for ſome time, ſhamed out of this Trade, by the Noiſe that <hi>Luther</hi> made in the World, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> thought fit to take it up; and have made more Money of it, with leſs Scandal. To this end, <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, after he had got Poſſeſſion of the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> obtained Bulls of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 14th, in the Year 1591; which, ſince that time, have been publiſh'd almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year in <hi>Portugal:</hi> And the Profits ariſing from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54374:19"/>
them, are become a part of the Standing Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown: And, indeed, they may well be accounted a very conſiderable part of them. The Subſtance of theſe three Bulls, are all contain'd in one, which carries for Title, <hi>The Bull of the Holy Croiſade:</hi> But they are retailed out to the People, under the Names of, <hi>The Bull for the Living: The Bull of Compoſition:</hi> And, <hi>The Bull for the Dead.</hi> They have their general Name from the <hi>Croiſade,</hi> as if they were granted for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the <hi>Holy War;</hi> and were we to judge of the Levies, I mean of Money, that are here made, one would think that War was ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, with as great Vigour, as it was 500 Years ago. It's true indeed, that the Kings of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> even ſince that Expeditions to the <hi>Holy Land</hi> were no more talk'd of, have, for ſeveral Ages, been engaged in continual Wars with the Infidels: They had the <hi>Mores,</hi> for ſome time, in the Bowels of the Kingdom; and having driven them out, follow'd them into <hi>Barbary,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered a great part of that Country, and have ſome Footing there ſtill; and the Popes would, ſometimes, to help them out in the Charges of the War, allow 'em the like Indulgences as were granted in the famous <hi>Croiſades.</hi> Yet, in thoſe times, this was done very ſparingly, and as an extraordinary Favour. But ſince the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have had little or nothing to do with the <hi>Mores,</hi> and have now only the ſingle Fortreſs of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gam,</hi> to maintain in <hi>Barbary,</hi> the Popes are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more profuſe of their Graces. The <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade</hi> is publiſh'd every Year, and Pardons, and Indulgences, more ample, by far, than were ever granted before, are now offer'd to all that ſhall contribute towards the Defence of the Places,

which the King is ſuppos'd to hold in <hi>Africa.</hi> It would be a tedious Task, and not proper for this place, to give an Account of all the Priviledges granted to the Purchaſers of theſe Bulls; I ſhall only therefore mention ſome few, that ſeem moſt conducive to the End for which the Bulls were obtain'd. The Bull for the Living, grants to the Purchaſer, a <hi>most plenary</hi> (the word is <hi>Pleniſſima) Indulgence, and a complete Remiſſion of all his Sins, and of the Pains which he ſhould have ſuffered for them in Purgatory.</hi> Theſe are the Words of the Abſolution to be pronounced upon him after Confeſſion; and this Pardon is, in all reſpects, as full as if he had gone to <hi>Rome</hi> for it, in the Year of <hi>Jubilee:</hi> And one that hath bought this Bull, may, if he pleaſes, after ſix Months, for a ſingle <hi>Vintain,</hi> have all renewed to him over again; ſo that as the Commiſſary deputed by his Holineſs, to inform the People of theſe Matters, ſaith, <hi>Here are Two</hi> Jubilees <hi>granted in One Year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Virtue of this Bull, any Man in <hi>Portugal,</hi> may have all the Benefits of the <hi>Stations</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the viſiting a certain Church out of Devotion, at a Set-time, is what they call a <hi>Station</hi> there. <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are made at ſeveral Churches of that City, within, and without the Walls in their Turns, almoſt all the Year about; but chiefly in the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> a plenary Indulgence is gain'd at every one of them; and there are eight Days in the Year, on every one of which a Soul is to be drawn out of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Now one that hath this Bull, if he will but viſit any five Churches, where-ever they are; or if there are not ſo many in the place where he is, but five Altars; or for want of them, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54374:20"/>
ſame Altar five times, ſhall gain the ſame Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as if he had made the <hi>Stations</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> Or, if he pleaſe, he may, <hi>Per modum ſuffragii,</hi> apply the Benefit of them to Souls in Purgatory. And the Commiſſary ſaith, <hi>That regularly this Bull is of more benefit than a Maſs ſaid at a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Altar:</hi> And yet, they ſay, That ſhall draw a Soul out of Purgatory at once.</p>
               <p>Another great Conveniency gain'd by this Bull, is, that a Man by Virtue thereof may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute for any Vows that he ſhall make, except only the Vows of Chaſtity, of Religious Orders, or Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> As for all other Vows, let them be never ſo ſolemnly made, tho' they are confirmed with Oaths; and even with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Vows, that the Party will never commute, nor ſeek a Diſpenſation for them, one that hath the benefit of this Bull, may, for a ſmall Sum of Money, given towards maintaining the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in <hi>Africa,</hi> free himſelf from the Obligation; nay, he may commute for what they call an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Vow of Chaſtity, ſuch as not to marry; not to ſin with a ſingle Woman, or another Man's Wife, or any particular Perſon, and ſome other things which the Commiſſary hath ſet down likewiſe, too long, or not fit to be repeated. He may alſo commute for a previous Vow that he may have made to take that Vow of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orders, and the Circumſtances of a Vow of going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> may be commuted for like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; ſuch as making the Journey on foot, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all the way, or going without much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>But theſe excepted, there is hardly any Caſe to be imagin'd, wherein a Man hath occaſion to make a ſolemn Promiſe; but if he will conſult
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54374:21"/>
an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Priviledges gain'd by the Bull, which the Commiſſary hath ſet forth by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Apoſtolick, he may know what he is to pay in Commutation of his Vow. To mention ſome few Inſtances, as they are ſet down in that Piece: Suppoſe a Perſon ſhould vow, That he would hear two Maſſes in a Day, or maintain a poor Man for a Day, remain chaſte for a Day, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Conjugal Chaſtity for ſix Days; not to Play, take Snuff, or drink Wine for a Month, or not ſpeak to any Body for two Days. Or, if a young Woman ſhall make a Vow to for bear eating Chalk, Earth, or Red Clay (ſuch as the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Ware is made of) for a Week. In every one of theſe Caſes, the Rich are to pay ſix <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> the Middle-Sort four, the Poorer two, the Pooreſt one: And this Rate is to be obſerv'd for the time the Vow was to laſt. As, put the Caſe, a Man had bound himſelf to faſt every <hi>Saturday</hi> in a Year; if he be taxed at the loweſt Rate, his Commutation-Money will come to 1040 <hi>Reis.</hi> But if he be unable to pay the whole Sum, he may be admitted to compound after this manner: Suppoſe the Perſon makes his Vow at fifteen Years of Age, this Vow, according to ſome Doctors, would oblige him till he came to be of ſixty, ſome ſay 'till ſeventy. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary takes the middle Number, <hi>viz.</hi> 65, whence take 15, and there remains 50 Years of Obligation to faſt, and the Commutation-Money would come to 120 <hi>Millreis;</hi> for all which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of Compoſition, of which I ſhall ſpeak anon, he is to pay but 2 <hi>Mill,</hi> 800 <hi>Reis:</hi> And if he cannot afford this, he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound but for 10 Years; and then he will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pay but three <hi>Teſtons:</hi> But it is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54374:21"/>
way, ſaith the Commiſſary, to pay the whole Sum, if the Perſon can afford it; at leaſt, to pay for ten Years: But if he cannot do that, his Compoſition will ſecure him in all Caſes, wherein he cannot conveniently faſt.</p>
               <p>One that hath made a Vow of Chaſtity (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be commutable) if he would be freed from the Obligation, is to pay a <hi>Vintaine</hi> a Day at the loweſt rate, which will amount to 7 <hi>Mill</hi> 300 <hi>Reis,</hi> if the Vow be for Life, according to the rate of 10 Years purchaſe, it will amount to 73 <hi>Millreis.</hi> If he be unable to pay this Sum, he muſt compound: Now, ſince People live ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to fourſcore, he (ſuppoſing the Vow made at 15) has 65 Years to account for, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of which amounts to 474 <hi>Mill</hi> 500 <hi>Reis.</hi> According to the Rule of Compoſition (to be explain'd preſently), for the firſt 200 <hi>Millreis,</hi> he may compound for 6 <hi>Mill,</hi> and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder at 10 <hi>per Cent,</hi> which makes 27 <hi>Mill,</hi> 450 <hi>Reis;</hi> and in all it comes to 33 <hi>Mill</hi> 450: but in caſe the Man be poor, and unable to pay, he may compound for 10 Years only, and come off for fifteen <hi>Teſtons:</hi> But this eaſie Compoſition is allow'd only in caſe of Conditional Vows, and that before the Condition be fulfilled; as for inſtance: Suppoſe one in a Fit of Sickneſs ſhall make a Vow, That if he recovers, he will turn Fryar: If he compounds before his Recovery, he ſhall be admitted to this eaſie Compoſition; but if he delays 'till the Condition be fulfill'd, that is, 'till after his Recovery, his Commutation-Money ſhall be doubled. All that is required of the Party, in this Buſineſs of Commutation, is, for him to come and put his Money into a certain Caſh Cheſt, which is called the <hi>Vow-Box;</hi> but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54374:22"/>
he muſt be ſure to put it in with his own Hands, or take care that it be done by ſome other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his Confeſſor excepted; for the Confeſſor is not to finger the Money upon pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, tho' it be in order to put it into the <hi>Vow-Box.</hi> All that he has to do in the Caſe, is to inſtruct his Penitent, when, and how he is to make his Commutation; and he becomes guilty of mortal Sin, ſaith the Commiſſary, if he ſets the Commutation at an Under-rate. Theſe are ſome of the Priviledges granted by this Bull; and, as if they were not enough to oblige People to buy it, it ſuſpends and derogates from all other Indulgences and Priviledges whatſoever, making them of no validity to thoſe that ſhall neglect to take out this: And to make it more neceſſary, and which may be a great Cauſe, why every Body buys it, it grants a Licenſe to eat Eggs, Butter, Cheeſe, and all other <hi>Lacticinia,</hi> in time of <hi>Lent.</hi> There are ſome Dioceſſes in <hi>Portugal,</hi> where, by ancient Cuſtom, it was before lawful to eat thoſe things in <hi>Lent;</hi> but the Bull is nevertheleſs neceſſary there, than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: For it ſuſpends, as I have ſaid, all ſuch Priviledges; ſo that the Cuſtom becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, when the Bull is publiſhed. It likewiſe gives leave to eat Fleſh upon Faſt-Days, all the Year about; in caſe the Spiritual and Bodily Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſhall think it convenient. The Spiritual Phyſician is any licenſed Confeſſor, tho' he gives his Judgment out of Confeſſion; and for the other, the Opinion of an experienced old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, may, by Virtue of this Bull, be taken in the caſe. But it is to be obſerved, that the Bull holds good only 'till the next Publication, when another muſt be taken out; and it is publiſhed every Year.</p>
               <p>

The Price of it, to thoſe that are worth 400 <hi>Millreis</hi> a Year, which way ſoever it ariſes, is three <hi>Teſtons:</hi> Such as are worth 200 <hi>per Ann.</hi> pay two <hi>Teſtons;</hi> the Wife paying always as much as the Husband: All thoſe that are above ſeven Years old, pay 4 <hi>Vintains,</hi> excepting theſe that follow, who pay but two <hi>Vintains:</hi> Young People that are maintain'd by their Parents, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, and Journey-men, that live only on their Wages, Beggars, Common Soldiers, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and ſingle Women that live on Alms; Prieſts, that have nothing but their Maſſes to maintain them; or ſuch of them as are Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or go begging about the Kingdom, all theſe pay but two <hi>Vintains.</hi> Under the ſame Claſs are reckon'd ſuch as have Houſes of their own, yet live miſerably; Coblers, or Botchers, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſet up a Stall, but go about for Work; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits profeſt, begging Fryars, unleſs they have ſomewhat allow'd them by their Friends, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and Priſoners: But then all Journey-men that can get two <hi>Teſtons</hi> a Day; Prieſts that live with their Parents, Servants to Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, whoſe Wages come to 40 <hi>Millreis,</hi> muſt pay 4 <hi>Vintains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Tax we ſee is univerſal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtant, muſt amount to a conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; and the two other Bulls muſt mightily increaſe the King's Profits: Suppoſing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe any thing of Popery, as certainly they do in <hi>Portugal,</hi> as much, or more, than in any Country in the World The Bull, for the Dead is ſold to all People alike, at the ſame Price, <hi>viz.</hi> for half <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Teſton:</hi> But then it is of no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, but to ſuch as have taken out the former. By this a Man may apply all the Indulgences and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54374:23"/>
Remiſſions contain'd in the other to any Soul in Purgatory, let him chooſe which he will; and ſhall, <hi>Per modum ſuffragii, obtain a relaxation of the Pains, to which that Soul ſtands expos'd by the Divine Juſtice,</hi> (they are the Commiſſary's words). More than this, he may make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Application of the Bull to any Soul, with a Reſerve, That if that Soul ſhall have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it, the Benefit ſhall go to another; and if that be got out already, to another, and ſo on as far as he pleaſes; as for Inſtance: I take out a ſingle Bull, for the Soul of my Friend <hi>Franciſco,</hi> with this Condition, That if he be gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I take it then for <hi>Pedro;</hi> and, in caſe he does not want it, for <hi>Diego,</hi> &amp;c. but he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways determine the Application to ſome certain Perſon; or he may ſay, It ſhall go to him that ſtands moſt, or to him that ſtands leaſt in need of it that is, to him whoſe Turn it would be to go firſt or laſt out of Purgatory. But if he ſhall give it indefinitively to whomſoever God pleaſes, the Bull loſes its Virtue, for want of a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Application. And the Commiſſary declares, That one and the ſame Perſon, may deliver as many Souls as he pleaſes, at the rate of half a <hi>Teſton per</hi> Soul; for each of them he is to receive an Extract of the Bull, with this following Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate at the end of it, ſubſcribed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary: <hi>For aſmuch as you</hi> N. N. <hi>have given half a</hi> Teſton, <hi>the Soul for which your Intention was to give the ſaid Alms, remains free from the Pains of Purgatory.</hi> Lourenço Pires Caravalho. But then the ſaid <hi>N. N.</hi> muſt ſee that the Money be good: For if he, through miſtake, ſhould think it ſo, and it proves naught, the Bull, as the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary declares, and the Caſuiſts agree, will be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54374:23"/>
good for nothing. This Bull may be taken out ſeveral times for one and the ſame Perſon; which, in my Opinion, ſhould make a body que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion its Efficacy, and doubt of the Infallibility of that Determination of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, concerning Indulgences, that <hi>Tantum valent quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſonant.</hi> But however, if it be renewed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it will increaſe the King's Incomes; and therefore the Commiſſary thinks it adviſable that a freſh one ſhould be taken out once every Year for the ſame Soul, and there can be no great loſs in ſo doing, by reaſon of the conditional appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and by this Means the King comes to have a conſtant Revenue from the Dead, as well as from the Living, which goes increaſing every Year. <hi>It is wholſome advice,</hi> ſaith the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, <hi>for a Perſon on his Death-bed to recommend to his Friends, the taking of it out for him, and the beſt time is as ſoon as the Breath is gone out of his Body; however,</hi> ſays he and the Caſuiſts, <hi>it will have the ſame effect at one time as another;</hi> And I believe they ſpeak their Minds in this. It is Cuſtomary to give the Bull to the dead Corps to carry it with him to the Grave; and I have frequently ſeen it tuck'd under his Girdle (for the Dead are buried here in the Habit of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> without Coffins.) But the Learned I muſt own, do not think this to be at all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but rather condemn it as an Abuſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bull of Compoſition</hi> ſeems to be no leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Exchequer, than either of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. By virtue of this, ſuch as have made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unlawful Gains, upon paying down a ſmall part of them, may, with a ſafe Conſcience, keep the reſt to themſelves. By it Eccleſiaſticks may compound for the Profits of their Benefices, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54374:24"/>
they receive when they have fallen from their Rights to them, either by neglect to ſay their Offices, or by lying under Cenſures: And this Bull is ſo accommodated to all ſorts of People, that it is of ſingular uſe to Traders of what kind ſoever they be, Uſurers, Lawyers, Officers of Juſtice, Truſtees, Gameſters, Rooks, Thieves, Proſtitutes: Theſe are all of them, in expreſs, or equivalent Terms, admitted to Compoſition in the Commiſſary's Explication of the Bull, as in a word, are all ſuch in general that have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make unlawful Gains; the Merchant who puts off Dammaged Goods, without diſcovering the Fault to the Buyer, or to enhance the Price pretends they are of one Country, when they come frem another; One that mixes good and bad Wares together, as Corn, for inſtance, that hath been putrified, with that which is ſound, or that puts his Corn into a moiſt place to make it ſwell; ſuch as ſell by falſe Weights and Meaſures, Gold and Silver-Smiths that put too much Alloy into their Works; Apothecaries, who, that they may not be known to want any Druggs that are called for, put others in their ſtead; Extortioners, whether by way of Uſury, or that taking Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from their Neighbours Neceſſity, uſe to buy things for leſs than a juſt Price. All theſe are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Compoſition for their ill-gotten Gains, in caſe they are incertain as to the particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom Reſtitution ought to be made; the ſame is to be ſaid concerning Officers of Juſtice, Advocates, Witneſſes, Notaries, who take more than their juſt Fees, or who appear in bad Cauſes.</p>
               <p>There is a very commendable Practice among Trading-People in <hi>Portugal,</hi> to ſet aſide ſome part of their Eſtates for Pious Uſes, by way of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54374:24"/>
Reparation for Wrongs they may have done, through inadvertency in the Hurry of Buſineſs. But that which is given this way, being common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left by Will, the Executors may, by virtue of this Bull, compound for one Moiety of all ſuch Legacies, in caſe the Legatees ſhall neglect to come and Claim them within a Year: Executors may likewiſe compound for all manner of Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in caſe the Perſons concerned cannot be found after a due Enquiry. They alſo that keep Gaming-Houſes, where Cheats are practis'd, ſuch as Rook others at Play, or Win Money from Boys, Women, Fryers, Slaves; They that have loſt at Play and have no mind to pay, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Women that exact, or by their Artifices gain more from their Cuſtomers than their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hire (for their Hire, according to the Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, is their due, if it be moderate, or no more than is cuſtomary, or than as it is rated by the Magiſtrates.) Private Women that practice the ſame Trade are likewiſe Compounders, and that (as ſome will have it) for all the Money they take; for ſome Caſuiſts reckon all their Gains unlawful, for that they do in a manner practice without a Licence. Men are likewiſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for the Money or Jewels they take on ſuch accounts from Married Women, ſuppoſing that what they give be at their own diſpoſal, or of their <hi>bona Paraphernalia,</hi> as the Lawyers term it, otherwiſe it is to be reſtored to the Husband. Such as have gotten Ship-wreck'd Goods into their hands, or Goods taken out of Houſes in a Fire, if the Owner be not known, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for them: Compoſition may likewiſe be made for a Depoſite left by one gone into a Far Country, in caſe He or his Heirs be not heard of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54374:25"/>
in ſome time; as alſo, for the ſurpluſage of the value of a Pawn, that's ſold when the Party that hath taken Money upon it, is not found, upon due enquiry.</p>
               <p>But it is a Queſtion, What Diligence is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſeeking out the Party to whom Reſtitution ſhould be made in any of theſe Caſes? The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary for his part, is very reaſonable, tho he ſpeaks by Apoſtolical Authority, and declares that Diligence to be ſufficient which a Prudent Man, (the Quantity and Quality of the Thing, the Time and the Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſidered,) would uſe in his own Concerns, and it is a receiv'd Maxim amongſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Caſuiſts, That in this Caſe, <hi>No es neceſſario hazer lo ultimo de potencia;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>a Man need not do his utmoſt:</hi> But I have met with a ſingle <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who very honeſtly declares againſt them all, <hi>that ſince it is commonly for Goods ſtolen or unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that People compound, the moſt exact dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is requir'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Compoſition once made, let the Owner then appear as ſoon as he will, the Compounder is abſolv'd from the Debt, and is no longer bound to Reſtitution, either <hi>in Foro Conſcientiae,</hi> or <hi>in Foro externo,</hi> ſo ſaith the Commiſſary, whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is a Law in theſe Matters, and my <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> Caſuiſt, who was ſo honeſt juſt now, ſeems to be of the ſame Opinion.</p>
               <p>Another Queſtion is, <hi>Whether a Man may be admitted to Compound, who makes his unlawful Gains in confidence of having the benefit of the Bull?</hi> The Commiſſary declares in expreſs Terms <hi>that he cannot;</hi> however he mollifies the matter not a little, by declaring, <hi>That one who hath ſuch a Confidence, may Compound for what he hath unjuſtly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54374:25"/>
got through Frailty, and that at the worſt, he may apply himſelf to him</hi> (the Commiſſary) <hi>and make ſuch a Compoſition as He ſhall think fit;</hi> for in this Caſe, he ſays, there is no Rate ſet: He ſays the ſame thing concerning ſuch, as ſhall take that which is another Mans, knowing whoſe it is at the ſame time, but hoping they ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him afterwards, that by this means they may have the Benefit of the Bull, and of ſuch as will not pay Legacies, till the time be expired, in hopes of Compounding; In all theſe Caſes, they muſt come to the Commiſſary, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with him at his own Terms.</p>
               <p>The Ordinary Rate of Compoſition is a <hi>Teſton per</hi> Bull, for every 5 <hi>Millreis ie</hi> one in 50 of the aforeſaid unlawful Gains; and at this Rate one may Compound for 100 <hi>Millreis,</hi> but when the Sum exceeds an hundred <hi>Millreis,</hi> he muſt pay for the exceſs 2 <hi>Teſtons</hi> out of every Five <hi>Millreis,</hi> till he comes to 200, but after that there is no Compoſition, till he applies himſelf to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, or his Deputy, and he commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts 10 <hi>per Cent,</hi> but does not ſo ty himſelf up, but will require more or leſs, according to the Circumſtances of the Caſe.</p>
               <p>The Purchaſer of this Bull muſt receive a Printed Copy of it, or elſe the Commiſſary ſaith it will do him no good; however, he ſaith, it may be preſently torn in Pieces (as that for the Dead may too) and be of as much Benefit as before, but ſuch as will keep it by them, muſt have their Names Subſcrib'd, or if they are ſhy to do this, as being tender of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, they muſt themſelves ſubſcribe <hi>Foam,</hi> that is, <hi>Some-body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:54374:26"/>
None can have the Benefit of theſe two later Bulls, unleſs he has taken out the former, They may be all Three had by any that reſide in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> whether Natives or Strangers, and by <hi>Portugueſes</hi> reſiding in Foreign Countrys, in caſe they deſign to return Home in any Time; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Matters, of as great Importance as any thing yet mentioned, might be related concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Bulls: The Reader, perhaps, will think I have trifled too long about them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but he may depend upon it, that nothing hath been ſaid on the Subject, but upon ſufficient Authority.</p>
               <p>The Money rais'd by all theſe Contributions, goes I ſuppoſe, for the moſt part, the ſame way as the reſt of the Publick Revenues do. The Pope indeed has his Share out of it, but if it be no more than is pretended, it is but a very inconſiderable one, ſince the King ſtands ſo much oblig'd to him for the whole; for it is ſaid to have been no more at firſt than 12000 Crowns a Year, as I remember, I have been told that it is now 15000; but it has been of late, one part of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s buſineſs at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to get it rais'd higher. However, if his Holineſs fails in this, he knows how to make it up out of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> by other ways.</p>
               <p>Another ſmall part of theſe Incomes goes to maintain the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Gariſon in <hi>Mazagam,</hi> conſiſting of about 1500 Men. <hi>Mazagam</hi> is a Rock in the <hi>Atlantick Ocean</hi> in the Coaſt of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> ſo contiguous to the Shoar, that at Low-Water it ſeems to be join'd to the Firm Land, and ſerves ſometimes as a Refuge to Chriſtian Slaves from <hi>Mequenes,</hi> I know not what other uſe it may be of, unleſs it be to keep them in

countenance that are employed in Preaching up the <hi>Croiſade;</hi> but they fearing belike, that the Pretence may not be ſufficient to bear them out, take care to inform the People, that were there no ſuch Place in being, and not a Souldier Paid in <hi>Barbary,</hi> they ſhall have every thing made made good to them to a Tittle that is promis'd in the Bulls, for whatever becomes of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney their Merit is the ſame; and that, they ſay, by the help of the Indulgences, will be ſure to carry them directly to Heaven; I have the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of one of theſe Preachers now before me, and he, among other Prodigious Extravagances, is proving, <hi>That the</hi> Croiſade Bull <hi>is of greater Benefit to his Auditors than their Baptiſm it ſelf, or than Martyrdom would be:</hi> I ſhall not repeat his Profane Arguments; But the Concluſion he pretends to make out is, <hi>That theſe Indulgences are able to purifie them from the Guilt of all their Sins, and free them from the Puniſhment due to them either in Hell or Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Land-Forces, uſed in Times of Peace, to amount to about 12 or 13000 Men, Horſe and Foot, but they have been encreas'd of late Years, and with the New Levies rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a year ago, they made 25000 Men, and new Commiſſions are ſtill giving out. But the King's Pay is ſo poor a Subſiſtence, that tho' there be Lazy Beggars enough in this Kingdom, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple live as hardly here as in any Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> yet it would be impoſſible, even in times of Peace, to get Souldiers to ſupply the Garriſons, were not Compulſion us'd. The Pay of thoſe that ſerve about <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which, as I have been told, is double to what they receive in other
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54374:27"/>
Parts of the Kingdom, is half a <hi>Teſton per diem,</hi> out of which ſuch Deductions are made, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a ſmall Ammunition-Loaf, there comes, ſcarce a <hi>Vintain</hi> to the Souldier; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Officers, whoſe buſineſs it is to raiſe Souldiers, are dreaded and courted by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their ſeveral Diſtricts, as Men in whoſe power it is to do the greateſt miſchief in the World to their Neighbours; and when any Perſon is pitch'd upon for the King's Service, leſt he ſhould run his Country, his Father or his neareſt Relations, are made reſponſible for his Forth-coming, and this in time of Peace. But it is commonly reported, that during the War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> It was a Cuſtomary Thing among the Poor People, to blind their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they were young, leſt when they grew up they ſhould be taken from them for Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and this is uſually given for the reaſon why there are ſo many Blind Beggars about the City, that gain their Livelihood by ſinging Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at the Doors of the poorer ſort, who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with them for their Attendance, each Cuſtomer allowing them a Penſion of about Ten <hi>Reis</hi> or <hi>Vintain per</hi> Month; and there are many who think the Parents of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creatures have well provided for them.</p>
               <p>The King hath about 25 Ships of War, great and ſmall, moſt of them well built, and they ſay after the beſt. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Models, according to His Majeſties immediate Directions, who is ſaid to have great Skill in theſe Matters, and to delight much therein. It is thought that about Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen may be Fitted out for Service. Nor hath
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54374:27"/>
this King been leſs careful to provide himſelf with Seamen, to which end he hath taken care to have a certain Number Enroll'd and ready always upon Occaſion; and for their Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, he has beſtowed ſeveral conſiderable Priviledges and Immunities, upon ſuch as being found duly qualified, ſhall enter their Names in the Liſt. But the Number required is ſo very ſmall, as ſhews that there is a great Want of Seamen in the Kingdom; for they are no more than 300, at leaſt they were no more at their firſt Inſtitution in 1676, and I have not heard that they have been encreas'd ſince: Whence it appears, That the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who were once ſo famous for Navigation all over the World, are now much fallen from what they were 150 Years ago. Another Proof of this great Change is this, Tho' they have every Summer, a ſmall Squadron out a Cruiſing upon the <hi>Algerines</hi> and <hi>Sallee-men,</hi> they have never been able to take a Prize, at leaſt in the Memory of the Oldeſt Men of my Acquaintance, who have known the Country for theſe many Years. We had indeed a Story in the <hi>Engliſh Gazette,</hi> I think it was in 1692, of their burning the Admiral of <hi>Sallee,</hi> but at laſt it proved to be but a ſmall Boat that was run aſhoar. It might be expected that they ſhould in ſome meaſure recover themſelves dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late War, in which other Seafaring Nations were embroil'd, whilſt they enjoy'd the Benefit of a Free-Trade, as in effect they did, almoſt to the doubling of their Trading Veſſels. But it does not appear that they made any great Improvement in the <hi>Art of Navigation;</hi> for there was hardly Skill enough among them to carry a Ship into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Channel, very
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54374:28"/>
few, if any of them, daring to venture upon that Voyage without an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pilot: I ſuppoſe it is for want of Seamen that the King's Ships are ſo much crowded with Land-Souldiers; for theſe make the greateſt part of the Complement, That of the biggeſt Ships, as I have been told, conſiſting of 60 Mariners, 80 others not yet qualified for Able Seamen, and 250 Land-Souldiers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>She was Born the <hi>21th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1646, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to Dom <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the VI. King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1666, arrived at <hi>Lisbon</hi> the Second of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, and having co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited with that King for the ſpace of near Sixteen Months, was Divorced from him, and Married afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1668 to his Brother the <hi>Infante Dom Pedro,</hi> now King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Lady, who before her Marriage, went by the Title of the <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Aumalle,</hi> was at firſt deſigned for the <hi>Infante,</hi> whilſt a Match was in Treaty between the King his Brother, and her Elder Siſter <hi>Mademoiſelle de Nemours,</hi> the preſent Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Savoy;</hi> but that Match not taking effect, ſhe was Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as I have ſaid, to the King, and another Marriage was concluded between the <hi>Infante</hi> and <hi>Mademoiſelle de Bouvillon,</hi> Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Turenne,</hi> and Niece to the Mareſchal of that Name: But this was Broke off, becauſe the <hi>Infante</hi> could not be prevail'd with by any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54374:29"/>
Perſwaſions or Menaces, the King his Brother could uſe, or the Entreaties of the Miniſters and his own Servants to ſtand to what had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon in his Name and by his Order: The reaſons for his refuſal I could never learn.</p>
               <p>Soon after the New Queens Arrival at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> began to expreſs an extraordinary coldneſs towards her, and in a ſhort time he eſtranged himſelf very much from her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, his Indifferency growing into an utter Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, inſomuch that he forbore not openly to Exclaim againſt the Authors of this Match, who, as he hath been heard to ſay, <hi>had adviſed him to that which he ſhould have cauſe to repent of all his life-time;</hi> all this was ſaid (by ſuch as were ill-affected to that Prince) to proceed from a certain un-fitneſs for Marriage, which the Queen afterwards laid to his Charge. Others are ſtill of Opinion, that it was occaſioned by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cauſe of Diſlike that rendred her Perſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to him. They that accuſe the King of Inability, impute the cauſe of that, and of his Incapacity for Government, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of likewiſe, to his Sickneſs in the time of his Infancy; for at Three Years Old he had been ſeiz'd with a Malignant Fever, and that was ſucceeded by a Palſie, whereby, as it is ſaid, all his Right Side became withered, from Head to Foot, inſomuch that he remain'd Lame ever after, on that Side; but they that tell this, accuſe him likewiſe of delighting to Ride the moſt fierce and un-manageable Horſes, and to encounter with Wild Bulls, and other Violent Exerciſes, which one wou'd think ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a vigorous Habit of Body; they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him alſo as guilty of many Extravagancies
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54374:29"/>
on the account of lewd Women, as in truth, his vicious Inclinations to them were apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cauſe of moſt of thoſe Diſorders they lay to his Charge. And this may make one ſuſpect their ſincerity likewiſe, when they tell us, <hi>That the ſame Diſtemper had ſo affected his Brain, that he was never in his right mind.</hi> It may, no doubt, with reaſon enough, be ſaid of this King, That ſome have taken the Liberty (upon what grounds I know not) to ſay of his Father before him, that he was none of the wiſeſt Kings that ever reign'd in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but then, the Faults he was guilty of, may be as well imputed to his want of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as to any Natural or Accidental Defect in his Underſtanding: For perhaps, there never was one deſigned for a Crown more neglected in his Youth than this Prince had been: He had been ſuffered to abandon himſelf to all the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies his childiſh Inclinations led him to, and not only his own, but thoſe of his Companions; theſe were (not the Sons of the Nobility but) ſuch as himſelf had pickt up out of the Streets, from among the Boys that he us'd to behold from the Palace Windows, dividing themſelves into Parties, and Pelting one another with Stones, the uſual Paſtime of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Children. They that were of the Party favoured by the King, and ſignaliz'd themſelves moſt at this Exerciſe, had the largeſt ſhare in his Affections, and ſome of them, as they grew up with him, became his Principal Favourites; theſe, from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign, found entrance into the Court, and would, at times, entice the King down into the Stable-Yard of the Palace, and there, together with a lewd Rabble of Grooms, Blacks, and <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Slaves, entertain His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54374:30"/>
with Wreſtling, Boxing, throwing the Bar, darting Knives, ſetting Dogs to Fight, the Young King making One amongſt them, and what he learnt from the Converſation of this vile Crew, he afterwards, on ſome occaſions, put in practice.</p>
               <p>Such Education was not, we may be ſure, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely to qualifie him for the Affairs of State. 'Tis true, the Chiefeſt of his Companions had been put from him immediately before his taking the Government upon himſelf; and he having had the happineſs to fall into better hands, a great alteration was obſerved in his Conduct; yet he was not ſo changed, but that he found himſelf obliged to leave Affairs of Importance to the Care and Management of others.</p>
               <p>This the new Queen ſoon perceiv'd; and as 'tis very likely ſhe was encouraged to make her Advantage of the King's Unfitneſs for Buſineſs, and to endeavour to get the Government of him, and his Kingdom, into her own hands. This is certain, that notwithſtanding the King's Neglect of Her, ſhe was not wanting to her ſelf; but took all occaſions to make her ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; She not only procured from him a Grant for the Augmentation of the Revenue ſettled on her in Marriage, but began to talk of calling to account ſuch as were poſſeſt of any Lands belonging to former Queens, and more than this, to interpoſe in Affairs of State, and Matters of Government, giving the Miniſters to underſtand, that ſhe expected to know how things went, and ſhe made her ſelf to be obey'd ſo far, that nothing of Moment was tranſacted in the King's Council, but Her Majeſty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about it. Not content with all this, ſhe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54374:30"/>
ſeemed to have a further Aim ſtill, and to deſign no leſs than a Total Change of the Miniſtry, in order to engroſs the whole Power to her ſelf, or impart it to ſuch as ſhe ſhould engage in her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>
               <p>The Great Men of the Kingdom were at this time divided into Two Irreconcileable Parties, neither of which could be ſafe, but by a Total Overthrow of the other; the one conſiſting of thoſe that had been in the Government in the late Queen Mother's time, or had done their utmoſt to continue her Regency, and were at this time wholly broken, driven from Court, or deprived of their Charges, and the Principal of them Baniſh'd into ſeveral remote parts of the Kingdom. The other was of them that were then in the Miniſtry, or had been inſtrumental in placing King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> on the Throne, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Queen his Mother, and obliging her to retire into a Monaſtery. The new Queen, preſently after her Arrival publickly declar'd for the vanquiſh'd Party, at leaſt, did that which in effect was the ſame thing; for ſhe openly ſollicited the return of the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> and his re-eſtabliſhment at Court. This Duke was the chief Perſon of the whole Party, and had ſhewn himſelf the moſt active of them all in the Queen Mothers Service, and thereby had drawn upon himſelf the largeſt ſhare of the King's Diſpleaſure. Beſides, the <hi>Conde de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelmelhor,</hi> who was then the Prime Miniſter, and the Principal Man, next the King, at Court, had reaſon to look upon the Duke as his moſt formidable Antagoniſt; and to apprehend his Return as a Step towards the Ruine of himſelf and his whole Party, eſpecially if it were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54374:31"/>
by the Queens Sollicitation, which would have engaged that Great Man to her Service; and it might prove impoſſible for him to hold out againſt their united Intereſts. There had that paſſed between the Duke and the <hi>Conde,</hi> that the Court could not well hold them both, as it cannot to this day; for they are both ſtill alive; the Duke is now in the Miniſtry, and for that reaſon (ſome give it for the only reaſon) the Court, for this laſt Reign, hath remain'd ſhut to the <hi>Conde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to put things in their due light, I find it will be neceſſary to look back to the time of the late Queens Regency, and give a brief account of ſome former Tranſactions, particularly thoſe wherein either of theſe two great Men were concern'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Donna Luiſa Franciſca de Guſman,</hi> who by her Courage had animated Duke <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Bragança,</hi> her Husband, to take upon him the Crown, which ſhe is ſaid to have preſerved likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head by her Counſels; was left by that King at his Death, which happened the Sixth of <hi>November</hi> 1656, Regent of the Kingdom, and Tutreſs or Guardian to the Princes their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but her Regency was not like to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long, ſhould the Young King, her Son, be reckoned to be of Age at the uſual time of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, it having been cuſtomary, for Kings of this, as well as of other Nations, to be declared Majors at Fourteen, and Dom <hi>Alfonſo</hi> was near the end of his Thirteenth Year at the King his Father's Death, for he was born the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 1643, ſo that ſhould former Preſidents be obſerved in the preſent Caſe, ſhe was like, in a ſhort time, to be forced to let go the Power out
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54374:31"/>
of her hands, and ſee a Kingdom which ſhe had contributed ſo much to procure and preſerve for the Family, committed to the diſcretion of a Child; or entruſted by him to ſhe knew not whom, for he once declared, <hi>Major</hi> would be at liberty to chuſe his own Miniſters. The beſt-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Governments in ſuch a caſe muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be expoſed to many great Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; but that of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which was then new and unſettled, and ſtruggling as it were, for life, in a War with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, would be in danger of utter Ruine: For theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, as we may well ſuppoſe, the Queen reſolv'd to prolong her Regency for ſome Years beyond the ordinary time; to this end ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all Offices of Truſt upon Creatures of her own, or ſuch as ſhe could conſide in, and took ſuch ways to engage thoſe in Power, as ſhould make them more apprehenſive of a Change than her ſelf; and in effect, ſhe ſo manag'd Matters, as to remain poſſeſt of the Government till the King was within a Month of Nineteen; and had not the Conde <hi>de Caſtelmelhor,</hi> by an unexpected Surprize, broken all her Meaſures, ſhe might, in all likelihood, have kept it in her hands as long as ſhe pleas'd; and her Enemies uſed to ſay, That by her good will ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver parted with it while ſhe lived.</p>
               <p>And in truth, her Conduct in regard to the King her Son may have given ſome colour to this Aſperſion; the Education of that Prince in his tender Age was ſuch as has been now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Its true, the Queen Mother took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, with what Scandalous Companions he aſſociated himſelf, and made grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of it; but ſtill they had acceſs to him,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54374:32"/>
even while he was of thoſe Years when one would think his Governours ſhould be reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his Carriage.</p>
               <p>As the King grew bigger he became guilty of ſuch Exceſſes as might be expected from a Youth ſo Bred, and left to his own Liberty, without a Curb; He took great pleaſure in walking the Streets a Nights in Company of his Braves, to haunt the Houſes of leud Women, and ſometimes he would order the Proſtitutes to be brought to him to the Palace; he is reported likewiſe to have committed ſeveral Outrages upon thoſe he met with in his Night-Walks; nor did he wholly abſtain from thoſe Pranks in the Day-time; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances of this nature are reckoned up by thoſe that have made a ſtrict enquiry into his Faults; but I do not find, that he ever did any great miſchief; He often endangered his Perſon indeed, and began to looſe himſelf much in the Peoples Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Queen Mother made loud Complaints of theſe diſorders; but then ſhe took ſuch a courſe, as might make her Enemies ſuſpect, ſhe deſired that the People rather than her Son might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſible of his Faults; ſhe expoſing them in as Publick Manner as was poſſible, in order, as ſome imagine, to make her ſelf thought more Neceſſary, and him leſs capable of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. One time ſhe contriv'd it ſo, that all the Counſellors of State ſhould wait upon him in a Body, and let him underſtand how his Perſon and the Kingdom were in danger by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he took; The young Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> Dom <hi>Nuno Alvarez Pereira,</hi> upon the account of his Quality (he being then, as he is ſtill, the only Duke in the Kingdom) was choſen Spokeſman,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54374:32"/>
and he, at the Head of the reſt, in the Name of the Queen, the King's Brother and Siſter, the Court, and the whole Kingdom, admoniſh'd His Majeſty to change the whole Courſe of his Life, and not to expoſe, as he did, himſelf and the Nation to ruine. Another time ſhe aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together the Officers of the Crown, the Courts of Juſtice, the Nobility and Gentlemen about the Court, and the Magiſtrates of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> The Deſign of this great Aſſembly was to make a more ſolemn Remonſtrance to the King, and withal to remove one <hi>Antonio Conti</hi> from about his Perſon; this <hi>Conti</hi> had been one of thoſe Boys that had had the good hap to get into the King's Favour, by diſtinguiſhing himſelf at the Exerciſes aforementioned; and by this means, from ſerving in a Pedling Shop in the <hi>Capella</hi> (a ſmall Cloyſter within the Palace) he grew to be a conſiderable Perſon at Court, becoming the King's conſtant Companion in his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies; and he was thought to contribute more to the corrupting of him than any other Perſon whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The ſeizing of this <hi>Conti</hi> was the firſt thing to be put in Execution, and therefore whilſt the Queen Mother entertain'd the King in private, the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> with ſome other Lords, took him violently out of the Palace it ſelf, where he had ſhut himſelf up in the King's own Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Duke was ready to force, and had done it, had not <hi>Conti</hi> opened to him, he having caus'd inſtruments to be brought in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to break down the Doors, reſolving to kill <hi>Conti</hi> upon the Place, in caſe he refus'd to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render himſelf. <hi>Conti</hi> taken, and with ſome others of the like Stamp, convey'd on Board a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54374:33"/>
Ship then under Sail for <hi>Brazil,</hi> the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany came and preſented themſelves before the King, and in the Name of them all, the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State read a Remonſtrance to him that had been drawn up by general Conſent; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an account of the Queens Complaints, the Grievances of the Nation, the King's ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the Exorbitancies of his Favourites. The King was mightily ſurpriz'd, to ſee himſelf thus unexpectedly attack'd, by ſo great a Crowd of People; for he had not the leaſt Warning given him of their coming; was ſo little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive and anſwer their Addreſs, that it was ſome time after the Company was gone before he knew what Buſineſs brought them thither; and this makes it look as if there was ſome further Deſign in hand than barely the King's Amendment. 'Tis plain, that in caſe the Queen had a Deſign to create a mutual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt between her Son and all the moſt Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Perſons in the Kingdom, in order to keep him out, and ſecure her ſelf in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe could not have taken a more effectual Courſe to gain her Ends. She might be ſure, that thoſe ſhe employ'd in ſuch ungrateful Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, would be very unwilling to ſee <hi>Alfonſo</hi> in a condition to call them to account; the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Nation is as little addicted to Forgiveneſs as any perhaps in <hi>Europe;</hi> and ſuch as are apt to revenge Injuries themſelves, do of courſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the like Returns from thoſe they have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> was a Prince, violent of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had not been bred to reſtrain or diſſemble his Reſentments; ſo that theſe, who had thus violated the Palace of their King, and had laid open his Infirmities to the World in ſo publick
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54374:33"/>
and ſolemn a manner, as they had, wounded him in his moſt ſenſible part, could never think themſelves ſeeure while it was in his power to revenge the Affronts. And this ſeems to me to have been the Riſe of that powerful Party which the New Queen found ſo ready to ſtand by her, to proſecute her Quarrels, and which enabled her at laſt to finiſh what the Queen Mother, contrary to her intentions, no doubt, had begun, that is the Ruine of the Unfortunate <hi>Alfonſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great Aſſembly diſſolv'd, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to underſtand upon what account they had been with him, and what they had been doing about his Palace, after he had given way to the firſt Tranſports of his Paſſion, began to think it was high time for him to aſſert his Authority, and to ſecure himſelf from the like Inſults; or rather to beware of a Third Admonition. His Mother, by uſing him ſo like a Minor at the end of Five Years that had paſt ſince the time of his Majority, did not a little confirm him in his ſuſpicions, that he was never like to come of Age while ſhe liv'd; nor perhaps, enjoy the Crown at her Death; for he had been for ſome time perſwaded, that her intention was to ſet up the <hi>Infante,</hi> his Brother, in his place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſolv'd, once for all, to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from under her Juriſdiction, by wreſting, if it were poſſible, the power out of her hands; 'tis hard to tell whether theſe and the like thoughts were ſuggeſted to him, or confirm'd by Dom <hi>Luis de Vaſcomcellos &amp; Souſa Conde de Caſtelmelhor;</hi> but 'tis not doubted that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of putting them in execution, was form'd preſently after the Queen Mother and her Party
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54374:34"/>
were withdrawn; when the King ſhut himſelf up for ſome time with the <hi>Conde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Nobleman was of the Firſt Quality, and one of the beſt Families in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes not equal to his Birth, or at leaſt, not to his aſpiring mind; for tho' he was then but young, yet he had, for ſome time, been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining great Deſigns in his Head, which an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion now offering it ſelf, he made appear, that he wanted neither Courage nor Abilities to go through with: He had improved his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Endowments by Travel, an advantage not common to thoſe of his Rank in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and he himſelf had been obliged to it by Neceſſity, rather than Choice, he having had the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be engag'd with ſeveral other Noble-men in a Quarrel, wherein one of them was kill'd. It is reported of him, that while he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the time of his Flight. he took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to declare, <hi>That he muſt needs go home, for his mind gave him, that it would be his Fortune one day to become the greatest Man in</hi> Portugal. The late King having granted him his Pardon, and upon his Death-Bed reconciled the Parties, he came again to Court, and when <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s Houſhold was ſettled, he by means of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes Relations, got in to be a Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber. 'Twas his Week when this great Stir was made about the Court; but the Queen had not thought fit to make him of the Party; and his Enemies give the World to underſtand, that it was for this, and no other reaſon, that he diſ-approv'd of the action. But he appear'd a little too warm while the buſineſs was tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to let one think he was ſo very indifferent; for meeting with the Duke in a Gallery, while
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54374:34"/>
he was in purſuit of <hi>Conti,</hi> he took occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him for having loſt his Reſpect to the King, by uſing this Violence in a Place that ought to be accounted Sacred; upon which, ſuch hard words paſs'd between them, that had not the Queen Mother made up the Quarrel after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, 'twas fear'd that they would have come to Blows; this Diſcourſe happen'd while he was endeavouring to get in to the King to acquaint him of what they were doing about his Court, and had he not found all the Paſſages Guarded, he might have ſpoil'd the Deſign. But in the Conference he had, preſently afterwards with the King, 'tis ſaid, he laid the Project of that entire Defeat which in a few days he gave the whole Party. For the preſent, he prevail'd with the King to diſſemble his Reſentments, which, contrary to his Cuſtom, he did, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it fair with his Mother and her Creatures, ſo that all things ſeem'd to be well again. The Queen was highly applauded by the Courtiers for her prudent Reſolution and Conduct, and thoſe vile Creatures that <hi>Conti</hi> had rais'd, took it extreamly ill that they were not thought fit to be employ'd in the Action. But ſome wiſer than the reſt, were a little ſtartled at the King's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>Conde</hi> to wait another Week; tho' others were of Opinion that the <hi>Conde</hi> did not think himſelf ſafe, unleſs about the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: But the Alarm was more general on the <hi>Monday</hi> after this Tranſaction (which had paſs'd on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1662) when the King, taking occaſion, according to his cuſtom, to go to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> but in greater State than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, the <hi>Conde</hi> from thence wrote to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State in an imperious Stile, that it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54374:35"/>
was the King's Pleaſure to know what they had done with <hi>Conti,</hi> whether any Order had been given to put him to Death; and whether <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noel Antunes</hi> (one of his Aſſociates) had been arreſted, but at Evening the King return'd, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and careſs'd his Mother, and on <hi>Tueſday</hi> all things were quiet again. On <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twelve a Clock the Plot broke out; for the King, at that unſeaſonable Hour (when People in this Country, at this time of the Year are going to ſleep) taking the <hi>Conde</hi> with him in his Litter, withdraws privately to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> and thence ſends to the Court for his Guards, and afterwards for Neceſſaries to fit up his Lodgings, Summons the Nobility to come and attend his Perſon, firſt thoſe that he thought beſt affected to him, and afterwards all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, diſpatches away Expreſſes to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Army and Garriſons, to give them notice, That he had taken the Government into his own hands.</p>
               <p>By this hardy Enterprize, the <hi>Conde</hi> in a few hours time entirely defeated the Queens moſt numerous and powerful Party, and broke all the Meaſures which that Princeſs, the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht of her Sex in the Arts of Policy, had been concerting for ſeveral Years. Not that her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Prudence fail'd her on this occaſion, for ſhe did all that could be expected from one of her Character, to preſerve her Authority; and the <hi>Conde,</hi> who got the better of the day, was not a little oblig'd for his Succeſs to his good Fortune: For at firſt News of what was doing at <hi>Alcantara,</hi> the Queen plac'd a Guard at the Paſſage from the City to that place, called her Confidents about her, and aſſembl'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54374:35"/>
giving out Orders at the ſame time, that none ſhould go near the King, 'till they had been firſt with her: And ſhe was ſo well obey'd, that the Fortune of the Day was for ſome time in Ballance; and it was towards Evening, when the <hi>Conde</hi> found his Deſign had taken ſo little effect, that he was thinking to ſecure the King and himſelf in St. <hi>Julian</hi>'s Caſtle: For notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſending out the Summons with ſuch an Air of Authority, there were no more than two Noblemen of the Secret, and it grew late before a Man beſides them appear'd at <hi>Alcantara.</hi> But this was not known at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> nor had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party ſo much time to recollect themſelves, as to conſult one another's Sentiments, or be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd how People ſtood affected; it was hard for them to think ſuch Summons could have been ſent, unleſs ſome under-hand Aſſurance had been given, that they would be obey'd; and no Man could know, how far others were engaged, or might comply; but every one might be aſſured, that his own Fortunes were ſpoil'd, ſhould he be found among the laſt that came in. While things were thus in ſuſpence at the Court, and at <hi>Alcantara,</hi> two Perſons gave the Turn to the King's ſide; the one was <hi>Antonio de Souſa de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedo,</hi> a faithful Servant of the King, and a true Friend of the <hi>Conde</hi>'s, of whom I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards have occaſion to ſpeak; but he being not ſo conſiderable for his Birth or Quality, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was the leſs likely to draw others after him. The other was a great Lord, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afterwards the moſt bitter Enemy the King had in the World; but at this time, contrary to his Intentions, did him a moſt important piece of Service: This was the Marqueſs of <hi>Caſcaes,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:54374:36"/>
would needs be going to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> contrary to the Queen's Order, that he might ſee what they were doing there, and return to give Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty an account: But other People could not ſee upon what Deſign he went; ſo that he having thus broke the Ice, ſeveral followed his Example, who drew many after 'em that were not ſent for, as well as of thoſe that were. The King's Party growing apparently the ſtronger, the Highway to <hi>Alcantara</hi> was fill'd with Herds of ſuch as think the ſtrongeſt muſt ſurely be in the right, all Men ſtriving to get foremoſt, to aſſure his Majeſty of the great Zeal, which they, for their parts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had for his Service. 'Tis not my Buſineſs to give the Particulars of this Revolution: In ſhort, the Queen, after fome ſtruggle, found her ſelf obliged to make a formal Surrender of the Government into the King's Hands, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Friday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Conde</hi> having thus gotten poſſeſſion of the Government, tho' he had diſcovered much of the Young Man in the Attempt; yet, in the Management of Affairs, he proceeded with all the Flegm and Prudence of an old experienc'd States-man. It's true, that in the beginning he found it neceſſary for the King's Safety, and his own, to uſe ſome Rigor, in making great Alterations at Court. The leading Men of the Queen's Party, as they had more or leſs incurr'd the King's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſure, were either baniſh'd into remote Parts of the Kingdom, removed from their Places, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the Court, or excuſed their Attendance; but notwithſtanding the Murmurs of the intereſſed Perſons, and their Dependants, he managed things ſo well, that in a ſhort time he became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54374:36"/>
popular: He found the State at the Brink of Ruin, being in all appearance reduced to the laſt Extremity, by a War of Two and twenty Years ſtanding. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after they had made Peace with the <hi>French,</hi> falling in upon <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> with the choice of their Forces drawn from all parts of their Dominions; and Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was about that very time in the Bowels of the Kingdom, and expected every Day at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> at the Head of a more numerous Army than had been on foot ſince the beginning of the War: But, upon the <hi>Conde</hi>'s coming to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a ſudden Check was given to the Enemy, and Victory declared it ſelf ſo frequently in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> that this King, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Depoſition, is ſtill, and perhaps ever will be, diſtinguiſh'd by the Title of, <hi>Alfonſo the Victorious.</hi> The People were much eas'd of their Taxes, and the Soldiers better paid than before; Pretenders at Court, who us'd to be put off with Delays, had all reaſonable Satisfaction given them, and many worthy Perſons preferr'd to Employments; in a word, the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration during the five Years of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gave ſo general a Satisfaction, that ſuch as converſe with the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> will find, that tho' they have all the Veneration for his preſent Majeſty, that he juſtly deſerves, yet they ſeldom ſpeak of the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Times, without regretting the want of him in the Miniſtry at preſent, they accounting him the only Perſon able to ſupport the declining State.</p>
               <p>But of all other Alterations, none was more taken notice of than that which People ſaw, or thought at leaſt they ſaw, in the King; as they did not look on him now with the ſame Eyes as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54374:37"/>
formerly, ſo without doubt his change of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Company, muſt have had a like effect upon him, as it has on all other Men. He was now attended and reſpected by his Nobility, and had Men of Senſe and Honour about him, whoſe Buſineſs it was to inform, and help him out, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Occaſions, and to raiſe him in the Peoples E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; and ſo he muſt needs make a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Figure, from what he did in that vile Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he before converſed with, and while he was kept under and diſcouraged by his Mother, whoſe Creatures holding their Places by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion People had of the King's Incapacity, were ready enough, we may be ſure, to catch at any thing that might ſerve to expoſe his Weakneſs. But it was obſerv'd, that ſuch of theſe as ſtill kept in at Court, and were us'd to be the moſt ready to cry out upon him, for want of Common Senſe, were generally the moſt forward to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the vaſt Improvements he had made in ſo ſhort a time, which were ſuch, that they could hardly take him for the ſame Perſon; at leaſt, they could think nothing leſs, than that he was alter'd to a Miracle; they now thought he ſpoke Sentences like one inſpir'd, and they were ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without ſome of his Sayings in their Mouths: And that which aſtoniſh'd them the moſt, was, how it ſhould enter into their Thoughts, that this Prince was unfit to govern <hi>Portugal;</hi> for now they diſcover'd him to be of ſo exalted a Genius, as qualified him for the greateſt Empire in the Univerſe. And I make no queſtion, but they that talk'd at this rate, were the firſt to trample upon that poor Prince at his Fall. But there were ſtill about the Court ſome ill-natur'd People, that had been unhappily engag'd in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54374:37"/>
ſame Party, who could never be brought over by the Turn of the Times to change their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but affected rather the contrary Extream to theſe fawning Paraſites, as thinking it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſcandalous, to be ſo much as in the Right, with ſuch Company. They had ſo often talk'd of the King's Lameneſs in his Right-ſide, that notwithſtanding all Demonſtrations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they were reſolv'd to believe it ſtill, and to hold, that it muſt have weaken'd him to that degree, as to make him unfit for Government: they agreed with the Compliers ſo far, that in caſe the King of himſelf did, or ſaid, any of thoſe Fine Things that were told of him, it muſt needs have been by virtue of ſome very miraculous Change indeed; but they could not be perſwaded that he acted of his own Head: They thought indeed, that he was inſpired; but that it was by the <hi>Conde,</hi> and his Creatures, whom they make the Authors of every thing that was well ſaid, or done by him. And the Reaſon was, that tho' he began a Diſcourſe well enough, and ſpoke to the purpoſe, when any addreſs'd themſelves to him, in caſe he was inform'd of their Buſineſs before-hand; yet if they anſwer'd him again, theſe Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents pretended, that he was at a loſs for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or faultered, or grew mute. When In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were given of his diſcreet Behaviour on Occaſions, when he could have no Inſtructions given him, they would ſay, He might perhaps have his lucid Intervals: Or they would put it off with a cold Jeſt, then current among them, That they allow'd one half of the King to be ſtill hale and ſound; and when he ſpoke a good thing, they us'd to ſay, it came from his Majeſty's Left-ſide; but generally ſpeaking, they thought
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54374:38"/>
all that he did, or ſaid, came from the Right. The Jeſuit might think himſelf more witty, when having occaſion ſome Years ſince to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s Victories, he told the People in his Sermon, <hi>That one half of a</hi> Portugueſe <hi>King, was able to beat the great Monarch of</hi> Spain.</p>
               <p>But as great as this Change in the King really was, it was no thorough Reformation: For tho' in the beginning he ſeem'd to take up and apply himſelf to the Buſineſs of State, being conſtantly preſent at Councils, Diſpatches, Audiences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he was under ſome Conſtraint all the while; and notwithſtanding all that the Conde could do, he would have his Sallies, and ſometimes break out into as great, or greater Extravagances than before: And that he might act with greater freedom, he long'd to have his <hi>Conti</hi> near him again. He had been adviſed, for Vindication of his Authority, to order this Man back from <hi>Brazil;</hi> but withal, to ſave his Credit with the People, by the Conde's Perſwaſion, he forbad him coming near the Court. His Inclinations towards his old Favourite, were ſoon diſcovered by the adverſe Party; who ready to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of any Inſtruments, engag'd <hi>Conti</hi> in their Intereſt; and a Plot was laid to ſupplant the Conde, and reſtore the Queen; in order to which, <hi>Conti</hi> was to perſwade the King, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal the Exiles. He had his Correſpondents at Court, who waiting their opportunity when the Conde was out of the way, contriv'd it ſo, that the King had two Interviews with <hi>Conti,</hi> near <hi>Alcantara:</hi> But the Conde, who had his Spies abroad, ſoon div'd into the bottom of the Plot, and laid it open to the King; who was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed thereat, that <hi>Conti</hi> was baniſh'd to <hi>O Porto,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54374:38"/>
and the Conde had no further trouble with ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal a Rival. One of thoſe two Noblemen who had been of the Party at the Acclamation, (as it was call'd) of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> was found to be in the Conſpiracy, and was baniſh'd likewiſe from Court: The other was dead, and had been in Diſgrace ſome time before, upon pretence that he had drawn his Sword in the Palace, and given a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, which is a Capital Crime by the Laws: Theſe three, had, in the beginning of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, conſtituted a kind of Triumvirate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, tho' the Conde always bore the greateſt Sway; but he is accus'd of having us'd thoſe under Arts, that are ſo much practis'd at Courts, to work the other two out of Favour. And I have not heard what is ſaid in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, in regard to the former; but as for this whom he found tampering with <hi>Conti,</hi> I cannot ſee why he ſhould be blam'd for diſarming an Enemy, whom he caught contriving his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Conde having now clear'd the Court of his Enemies, both publick, and ſecret, ſaw his Prediction fully accompliſh'd, and himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Rival, in a manner ſole Governour of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi> and he might have continued ſo, had he not unhappily laid a Train for his Maſter's Ruin and his own, in the way that he took more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eſtabliſh the Throne of that unfortunate Prince. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> had now no longer cauſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any Deſigns of his Mother, ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been obliged to retire into a Monaſtery; and the Plot to reſtore her, by ſo contemptible an Inſtrument as <hi>Conti,</hi> ſeem'd to be the laſt Struggle of the Party. However, ſhe died ſoon afterwards, and by the Conde's prudent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54374:39"/>
and good Fortune, there ſeem'd to be ſuch an Union between the Royal Brothers, that there was no cauſe to fear any thing from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante,</hi> the only Perſon that could give Umbrage to the King; ſo that had it not been for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Marriage, he might have dy'd with his Scepter in his Hand.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner was this fatal Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, than all things ſeem'd to go backward, and tend directly to the Ruin of them both; the Conde had been the Contriver of the Match, as the King, when in an ill Humour, us'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, and he was the firſt that ſuffer'd by it. He had been perſwaded, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to the King's Security, but his Marriage, which might poſſibly take him off from his wild Courſes; but he thought it a ſure way to ſilence a Report, concerning a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Weakneſs in him; which was whiſper'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, in order to make People believe, that the <hi>Infante</hi> was alone capable of ſecuring the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Conde being himſelf fully ſatisfy'd, that this Report was groundleſs; at leaſt, he ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſted, that he look'd upon it as an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, when ask'd about it by the Marqueſs <hi>De Sande,</hi> as he was going to <hi>France</hi> to conclude the Marriage, he aſſuring the Marqueſs, That he had a Natural Daughter of the King's, at that time in his own Houſe. But the Match concluded on, he ſoon found cauſe to repent of his Diligence; for the Faction began to revive, and re-aſſume new Vigour, and to proſecute the ſame Deſigns under the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Name, which they had before been carrying on in the Queen-Mothers. The Queen-Mother is reported by her Friends, as well as others, to have endeavoured what ſhe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54374:39"/>
could, to ſet up this young Prince in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's place: She had ſettled his Court, when he was but Fourteen Years old, in almoſt as great Splendor as the King's, who was Sixteen before he had ſo much as a ſeparate Apartment in the Palace. This look'd as if ſhe was providing a future Head for the Party, for their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſtick the cloſer by her for the preſent: But after her Retreat, the Miniſters with great Prudence and Succeſs, endeavour'd to endear the two Brothers to each other, having them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten together at the Palace, at <hi>Alcantara,</hi> and <hi>Salva terra,</hi> the <hi>Infante</hi> partaking with the King in all his ordinary Recreations, and ſometimes in his leſs innocent Diverſions. The Miniſters did not a little value themſelves on this, to the great Regret of their Adverſaries, thinking that they had brought them to a perfect Agreement, and put an end to all thoſe little Jealouſies and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities that had been between them.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner was the Princeſs <hi>d'Aumalle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the King, but a Breach began that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be clos'd: The <hi>Infante</hi>'s Refuſal to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the Match that was made at the ſame time, by his own Conſent, between him and <hi>Mademoiſelle de Bouillon,</hi> reviv'd the King's Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies; inſomuch, that he began to accuſe him of having ſtill his Mother's Deſign in his Head, to make himſelf King, and threatned to clap him into a Tower; but all in vain, for the <hi>Infante</hi> perſiſted in his Refuſal. I know not, but it may be about this time, that he was highly exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an Expreſſion the <hi>Infante</hi> had let fall, <hi>That he was ſure, the King could have no Children by his Marriage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54374:40"/>
When the new Queen's Arrival was expected, the <hi>Infante</hi> found himſelf deſtitute of Perſons of Quality to attend him; the Queen-Mother, when ſhe ſettled his Houſhold, had plac'd about him ſeveral Lords of her Party, not much inferiour, either in Rank or Number, to thoſe in the King's Service; but theſe being employ'd elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, he had others given him, that were in the King, and the Conde's Intereſt; and it fell out luckily, as it was then thought, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that the <hi>Infante</hi> took ſuch a liking to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Simon de Vaſconcellos,</hi> that of his own accord he took him into his Service; and this Favourite ſeem'd to have no leſs ſhare in his good Graces, than the Conde had in the King's: But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of <hi>Vaſconcellos,</hi> ſo diſoblig'd the reſt, that they withdrew from the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Service; they return'd indeed again, at the King's Requeſt, but upon the <hi>Infante</hi>'s making his Favourite Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of his Houſhold, they retired a Second time, and the King thought it too great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, to recal them. The <hi>Infante</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have others in their room; the King gave him the Nomination of ſuch he ſhould think fit; he named thoſe that were diſagreeable to the King, who refus'd to confirm them, and offer'd to reſtore the old ones: But the <hi>Infante</hi> would not accept of them; and ſo he was fain to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the King's Servants, when he gave Audience to the Marqueſs <hi>de Rouvigni,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Queen to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> After her arrival, he deſir'd leave of the King to retire from Court, ſince he could not continue there in a State agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Quality: The King told him, He might go if he pleas'd; but ſhould have no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from him: Yet he thinking fit to ſtay 'till the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54374:40"/>
Queen had made her Publick Entry, the King would ſeveral times ask him in Raillery, Why he was not gone? But otherwiſe treating him with great Kindneſs. Upon which the <hi>Infante</hi> took occaſion to declare, before <hi>Vaſconcellos, That he perceived ſome malicious Perſons had done him ill Offices with the King, and that the Conde</hi> de Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melhor, <hi>was not free from ſuſpicion; but in caſe he prov'd guilty, he would find a way to chaſtiſe him according to his Demerits. Vaſconcellos</hi> offended to hear his Brother ſo ill treated, would ſtay no longer in the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Service. The Conde find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the great Men that were diſaffected at the Court, gathering about the <hi>Infante,</hi> and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging him in his Deſign to retire, did his utmoſt with the King, to perſwade him to ſatisfie his Brother's Demands, but could not prevail: He waited himſelf upon the <hi>Infante,</hi> to ſignifie his readineſs to ſerve him; but receiv'd from him a very harſh Anſwer. The <hi>Infante</hi> at laſt retires to a Country-Houſe, about two Leagues from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> orders another to be provided for him againſt Winter, at <hi>Almada,</hi> on the other ſide of the Water: And it was given out, That he withdrew, becauſe the Court could not hold him and the <hi>Conde</hi> together.</p>
               <p>During the Separation of the two Brothers, their common Enemies hoped they would become irreconcilable, and that all things tended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Civil War. The <hi>Infante</hi> never came to Court, unleſs it were to wait on the Queen; and ſhe being taken with a ſlight Indiſpoſition, prevail'd with him to ſtay in Town during her Illneſs, to avoid the trouble of coming to viſit her in the Night, and returning at undue Hours. The Miniſters laid hold on this Opportunity to

make up the Buſineſs ſo, that the <hi>Infante</hi> ſhould chooſe what Gentleman he pleas'd, thoſe only excepted, whom he had before named. Yet this Difference was not ſo made up, but the two Brothers continued diſguſted at each other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the King; and he had ſo little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of himſelf, that he took all Occaſions to treat the <hi>Infante</hi> with the harſheſt Language, and to threaten him with worſe Uſage; he grew every Day in a worſe Humour, as thoſe about the <hi>Infante</hi> gave him Occaſions to ſuſpect they had Deſigns upon his Crown: As when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing to get him ſworn Prince, as they once deſign'd, they advis'd him to requeſt of the King, that he might Command the Armies with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Conſtable</hi> of the Kingdom; which, as the King was perſwaded, was ſought for only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take the Sword, and by that means the Scepter out of his Hand. His Jealouſie thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, his Anger againſt his Brother became more violent; and upon pretence of other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, he took Occaſions to remove from about him, thoſe he ſuſpected to have put theſe Deſigns in his Head. While theſe things paſſed between the King, and the <hi>Infante,</hi> the Queen, on her part, was acting within the Court, in concert, as it were, with thoſe without, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring about the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Ruin. He ſoon perceiv'd by her Pretenſions, that this muſt be her Deſign; and, that if her Demands were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd, his Power was not like to be long-liv'd; and therefore, he either found, or made them ſo very difficult to be comply'd with, that her Majeſty grew highly diſſatisfy'd, and reſolv'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to break with him, taking a ſolemn Oath, That ſhe would never ſpeak to him more about
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54374:41"/>
Buſineſs. And it was not long before ſhe had occaſion, to make known her Reſentments to the whole Court and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It happen'd that a certain <hi>French-</hi>Man was murder'd by a Carrier in the unfrequented Roads of <hi>Alemtejo.</hi> The Murderer had fled to a Church, and tho' he were forc'd from thence, yet before Juſtice could be done, it was firſt to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Whether he had any Right to Sanctuary? For which Cauſe, and for want of ſufficient Proof, the Trial was delay'd. About the ſame time a Difference aroſe between the High-Steward of the Queen's Houſhold, a <hi>French-</hi>Man, and her Secretary, a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> about Matters relating to their ſeveral Places, and the Queen gave Orders to the Secretary of State, that this Buſineſs ſhould be referr'd to two of the Judges; but the Secretary thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to lay it before all the Judges, and to communicate it likewiſe to the Council of State: He waiting upon the Queen, about other Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſhe took occaſion to enquire, What had been done in theſe two Caſes? The Secretary gave the Reaſon, why the Criminal was not yet try'd; and told her, That the other Buſineſs lay before the Council, and that it was neceſſary the <hi>Conde de Caſtelmelhor</hi> ſhould be ſpoken to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. The Queen, at naming of the <hi>Conde,</hi> flew into a violent Paſſion; and after having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reprimanded the Secretary of State, for not having done his Duty, by punctually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her Orders; ſhe told him, <hi rend="margQuotes">That ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd he ſhould tell her of the <hi>Conde,</hi> ſince ſhe had ſworn, never to have more to do with him; who, by thwarting her in every thing, had reduced her to a State of Beggary; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54374:42"/>
wanting Power, when her Occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd it, tho' at no time elſe: That for theſe eight Months, ſhe had not ſo much as an Alms to give, by reaſon of his obſtructing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of 20000 Crowns granted her by the King: That a great deal of Artifice was uſed in concealing Matters from her; as if ſhe, next the King, was not the moſt concern'd in all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. And knowing how much ſhe laid to Heart, the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi>'s Return, they had not given her any Account of that Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, notwithſtanding her having ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeded for him, as intercede ſhe would, let them blame her for it as much as they pleas'd; that it was enough to ſet them againſt any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to ſee her appear in his Favour, even when ſhe had Reaſon for it; and when ſhe deſir'd any thing, were it never ſo feaſible, it became impoſſible; and that for no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe ſhe deſir'd it That, it ſeems, they affected to let the World know, that ſhe had no ſhare in the Government; and for her part, ſhe was glad of it, as having no ſhare in the Blame. That ſhe deſired not to have Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſubmitted to her Determination; however, ſhe thought it was but Manners in them, to make her acquainted with what they did: But they had no regard to Decency. And ſome People took a Pleaſure in croſſing her, and were ſo proud, that, it ſeems, they thought ſhe came to <hi>Portugal,</hi> not to be their Queen, but their Slave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe, and other paſſionate Expreſſions of her Majeſty, put the poor Secretary into a Paſſion too; he, after having excuſed himſelf about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his executing her Orders, in Anſwer to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54374:42"/>
her Complaints, told her: <hi rend="margQuotes">That the <hi>Conde,</hi> and his Friends, had made it their Buſineſs to ſerve, and pleaſe her Majeſty. That it was none of his Fault, if ſhe was in any Straits, that being no part of his Buſineſs. That her Majeſty had her Revenues; and it was hoped, ſhe would proportion her Expences according to them. That the Conſignment of 20000 Crowns was a new thing, and not eaſily ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. That ſhe had been made acquainted with all Matters of Importance; and nothing of any Conſequence had been kept from her Knowledge, that the Court was full of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Pretenders; who, if favoured by her Majeſty, might engage her in the proſecution of their unjuſt Demands. That he could give her no account concerning the Duke's Return to Court, the King having himſelf come to a Reſolution in that matter, that for their parts, they did not know how to pleaſe her, ſince ſhe was not ſatisfy'd, after they had done all they could to ſerve her, ſhe having been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo much Reſpect, that no Queen ever had ſo great an Authority.</hi> But coming to that part of her Complaint, wherein ſhe ſaid, ſhe had been treated like a Slave, he chang'd his Note, and in <hi>Portugueſe</hi> (for he had ſpoken <hi>French</hi> before), he boldly told her, <hi rend="margQuotes">That her Majeſty was abus'd by ſome about her, who deſerv'd to be chaſtis'd; had no Reaſon to complain of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> ſince the Reſpect they paid her, came little ſhort of Adoration.</hi> The Queen, after a warm Reply, wherein ſhe ſaid, She knew how to diſtinguiſh between the good and the bad <hi>Portugueſes:</hi> There being not above three or four that ſhe complain'd of; and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54374:43"/>
ſignifying what ſhe would do to thoſe that had enrich'd themſelves with the Rents belonging to the Queens of <hi>Portugal;</hi> commanded the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary not to ſpeak ſo loud. He told her, That if he ſpake loud, it was, that all the World might hear what he ſaid. The Queen bad him hold his Peace, and be gone. He not departing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, ſhe roſe from her Seat, and was going away; the Secretary imprudently laid his Hand upon her Gown, either to kiſs it, according to Cuſtom, at her departure, to ſignifie his Deſire, that ſhe would hear him out; but ſeeing her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to be gone, he cry'd out to the Noblemen and Ladies preſent, <hi>That he was unworthily us'd, no King having ever treated a Vaſſal in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perſon who had this Diſpute with her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, was <hi>Antonio de Souza de Macedo,</hi> before mention'd, as one of the firſt that came in to the King at <hi>Alcantara:</hi> I cannot tell what he was by Birth; but in himſelf he was a Perſon of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities, as appear'd afterwards by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the Service of his Maſter, and his Friend; he was a Man of Letters, and a Doctor in the Laws. After the Revolt from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he had written with great Zeal and Eloquence in defence of his Country's Cauſe, and went Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the ſolemn Embaſſy, which King <hi>John</hi> ſent to our King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, to acquaint him, of his having aſſum'd the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and, upon King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Demand, to know on what Right his Maſter's Claim was founded; he drew up a Paper, which entirely ſatisfy'd his Majeſty. In <hi>England</hi> he continued Reſident for ſeveral Years, and was very ſerviceable to the King, in the time of his Troubles. From hence
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54374:43"/>
he went Ambaſſador to <hi>Holland,</hi> and in a very difficult Negotiation, he acquitted himſelf much to his Maſter's Satisfaction, and his own Credit; and at his Return, he was highly eſteem'd at Court: And the <hi>Conde</hi> could not do a more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to the Nobility, than prefer him, as he did, to the place of Secretary of State, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he might have ſome regard to himſelf, as well as to the Publick, in advancing this Man: The <hi>Conde</hi> was young, and <hi>Antonio de Souſa</hi> well practis'd in Buſineſs, and by his Counſels may have been of as great uſe to the <hi>Conde,</hi> as the <hi>Conde</hi> was to the King. It is certain, that he drew up Inſtructions for him to obſerve, in the Adminiſtration of the Government; and as the <hi>Conde</hi> was to be deſtroy'd, before the King could be depos'd, ſo it is very probable, that this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel was pick'd on purpoſe with <hi>Antonio de Souſa,</hi> in order to make way for the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Ruin.</p>
               <p>The King coming to underſtand what had paſſed between the Queen and him, did his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pacifie her Majeſty, promiſing, that the Secretary ſhould be ſeverely puniſh'd; but the Queen would not be appeas'd. It unluckily fell out, that this Broil happen'd at the time of Bull-feaſt: The firſt Day was over, and her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty could not be prevail'd upon to appear the ſecond Day: So that to conceal the Matter from the People, the Bull-running was put off for that Day, upon pretence, that the King was indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd; and ſhe continuing out of Humour ſtill, the King was fain to be indiſpos'd the next, and the following Days; and by that time things were brought to ſuch a paſs, that an end was put to all Sports and Paſtimes for this King's Reign. The Queen took ſo little care to conceal her Anger, that the People ſoon came to know
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54374:44"/>
the Cauſe, why the Bull-running was put off, and began to murmur loudly againſt the Court, that their new Queen ſhould be ſo much abus'd; and, perhaps, their Diſappointment did not a little ſerve to raiſe their Clamours. The Queen would be ſatisfy'd with nothing leſs, than the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary's being turn'd out of his Place, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd from the Court; which the <hi>Conde</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unwilling to conſent to, as thinking, that ſhould he give way to her in this Caſe, he was like to be the next Man that ſhould fall a Sacrifice to her Reſentments; however, the Court perceiving a Storm ready to break upon them from another Quarter, it was reſolv'd in Council, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary ſhould abſent himſelf from Court for ten or twelve Days; and that the King ſhould communicate this Order to the Queen, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her, That it was made only to content her Majeſty; and that it was hoped, ſhe would engage her ſelf no more in ſuch Matters for the future, to prevent the ill Conſequences that might enſue to the State. Purſuant to this Order, the Secretary, to pleaſe the Queen, departs from Court; but the King forbore to communicate the Order to her, for fear of exaſperating her further, at a time when he had his Hands full of another more troubleſome Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were done above-board, a ſecret Plot was carrying on, among the Heads of the diſcontented Party, to ſeize upon the <hi>Conde,</hi> and carry him off in the ſame manner, as <hi>Conti</hi> had been ſerv'd before. The <hi>Conde</hi> having In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of their Deſign, may be ſuppoſed to have made the more haſt to ſatisfie the Queen's Complaints: For the very next Day, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Guards about the Palace to be doubled,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54374:44"/>
the Cavalry to be mounted, and the Centinels plac'd at the Avenues; and, as 'tis ſaid, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was given to the Soldiers, to fall upon certain Noblemen, in caſe they endeavoured to get into the Court, it being ſuppos'd that they were coming to execute the Deſign.</p>
               <p>Hereupon ſeveral Meſſages paſt between the <hi>Infante,</hi> and the Court; the <hi>Infante</hi> complaining, That the <hi>Conde,</hi> by arming the Palace, had inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, as if he was deſigning to violate it; for which he requires Reparation of Honour; accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Conde</hi> withal, of attempting upon his Life by Poiſon; and therefore deſires, that he might be removed from about the King's Perſon, in order to his Puniſhment. The King takes upon himſelf the doubling of the Guards, and offers to ſend the <hi>Conde</hi> to throw himſelf at the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Feet: The <hi>Infante</hi> refuſes to take this for Satisfaction, and inſiſts upon the <hi>Conde</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval. The King offers to do him all Juſtice, and deſires him to name the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Accuſers, in order to his Tryal: But this the <hi>Infante</hi> would not yield to, unleſs the <hi>Conde</hi> left the Court firſt; threatning, that if he continued there, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would depart the Kingdom. The King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Caſe to be drawn up, and laid before a Conſult of the Counſellors of State, the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it was concluded among them, by the Majority of Votes, That the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> not being a Sovereign Prince, his bare Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation was not to be taken for Proof; that the Suſpenſion and Removal of the <hi>Conde,</hi> was in it ſelf a Puniſhment, as it reflected Diſhonour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and his Family; but that he ought not to be puniſh'd, 'till ſome Proof was made of his Crime. The <hi>Infante</hi> would not yield, that the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54374:45"/>
Caſe had been fairly ſtated, or the Votes free; and ſignifies the ſame in a Letter to the King, wherein he expreſſes his Reſentments of the whole Proceeding with ſome heat.</p>
               <p>While the Buſineſs was thus agitated by way of Letters and Meſſages, each ſide was ſeeking by other ways to make his Party good, the <hi>Infante</hi> had written to the Courts of Juſtice, the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Council of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to acquaint them with his Caſe, ſending them Copies of his Letters to the King. He afterwards called together at his Palace, the Counſellors of State, and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to inform them of what had paſt; among whom, beſides thoſe that had been all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Cauſe, the <hi>Conde</hi> had gain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf many new Enemies, by his Advancement, and his over-haughty Carriage, (as it ſeem'd to them) in the time of his Greatneſs: And the Party was ſo ſtrong againſt him, that 'twas now evident his Ruin was at hand: For many of thoſe fawning Wretches, on whom, by a Fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as 'tis ſaid, to great Men, he had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd his Favours, having rais'd them by his Bounty, were now not only ready to abandon him, but they would needs be employ'd in aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Quarrel upon their Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. The <hi>Infante,</hi> at the beginning of this Broil, was made to remonſtrate in his Letters, <hi>That if the King refus'd to do him Juſtice, he ſhould be forc'd to leave the Kingdom, and end his Days in a foreign Country.</hi> But was now put upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſolution, which was to retire to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Tras Os Montes,</hi> and join that part of the Army, which was commanded by the <hi>Conde de St. John,</hi> one of his principal Confidents, many
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54374:45"/>
of the diſaffected Nobility proffering themſelves to follow him, and ſhare in his Fortunes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conde,</hi> upon the <hi>Infante</hi>'s firſt Complaint, petition'd the King for leave to retire; but it appearing, that the Contrivers of all this Buſtle, aim'd not ſo much at the <hi>Conde</hi>'s removal from the Government, as the King's, who was not like to ſtand long after the Fall of his Miniſter, he was oblig, d to continue at Court; and they were not wanting about the King, that were put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him upon vigorous Reſolutions, which might, if followed, have recovered his expiring Authority: Some adviſed him to go in Perſon to <hi>Corte Real</hi> (the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Palace) attended with his Counſellors of State, the Nobility and Officers of the Army, and Arreſt the <hi>Infante,</hi> together with the <hi>Camariſts</hi> (thoſe he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the Managers of all this Diſturbance); but this Counſel never took effect; ſome think, becauſe it was delay'd ſo long, that the <hi>Infante</hi> being inform'd of the Deſign, had time enough to put himſelf in a poſture of Defence; it is certain, that he immediately after declared, He would run the ſame Fortune with his Gentlemen, and never ſuffer them to be Arreſted. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of a certain Perſon, and, as I remember, I have been ſhewn the Man, that he came and offered to the King, and <hi>Conde,</hi> That with his Majeſty's Leave, he would go to <hi>Corte Real,</hi> and give a good Account of the <hi>Camariſts;</hi> but this Propoſal was rejected, as it well deſerved to be. The great Courage the King us'd to ſhew on other Occaſions, to the loſs of his Credit, now fail'd him when he had ſo much need of it, his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54374:46"/>
Authority and his Honour lying as they did, at ſtake. He ſeems to have been ſo much ſunk at this time, as to become incapable of conceiving, or entertaining a Reſolution befitting a King in his Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conde,</hi> when he ſaw that he cou'd do no good any other way, wou'd have had him retire to <hi>Alemtejo,</hi> and there put himſelf at the Head of his Army, there being reaſon to believe, that the main Body would prove faithful to him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having gain'd ſo many ſignal Victories under his ſhort Reign. Both ſides were endeavouring about this time, to make a Party among the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery; the <hi>Infante</hi> had wholly gaind the <hi>Conde de St. John;</hi> but he had receiv'd Orders from Court, that neither himſelf, nor any Perſon under his Command, ſhou'd ſtir out of his Province 'till further order; and it could not be in his power to do any great harm, ſuppoſing the reſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their Duty. The Commanders had been made acquainted with the Differences at Court by the King's Order, who had ſignified to them his Reſolution to protect the <hi>Conde,</hi> repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Complaints as groundleſs. The Fleet likewiſe, which had been cruiſing on the Coaſts, was commanded into the River, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der given, that none belonging to it ſhould come aſhore without leave.</p>
               <p>It does not appear, that they who were for ſetting up the <hi>Infante,</hi> durſt as yet openly ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit the Army. It's true, the Queen had a very ſtrong Party in it, as appears by the ſtrict Guard that was kept on the Frontiers this Year, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the coming of any Overtures of Peace from <hi>Caſtille;</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> Faction, that was head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Queen, labour'd all they could to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54374:46"/>
but it was not as yet pretended, that the King and Queen had ſeparate Intereſts. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, her Majeſty was working under-hand to promote the Grand Deſign, ſounding the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of thoſe in Command, againſt the time when it ſhould be ripe for Execution. Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who was General of the Strangers, and had, in effect, at this time, the Direction of the whole Army, was oblig'd by Orders from <hi>France,</hi> to hold Correſpondence with the Queen, and to ſupport her Intereſt. The Queen took occaſion to acquaint him, by Letters, how that all things were like to run to Ruin through <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo</hi>'s Extravagances, ſhould he continue in the Government, deſiring to know of the Count, What Reckoning might be made of the Officers in the Army, in caſe the Differences at Court came to an open Rupture? It is not probable, for Reaſons to be mention'd anon, that the Count gave her any great Encouragement to proceed in the Deſign; however, he did as he was order'd, and inform'd her Majeſty, how the principal Commanders ſtood affected, and what might be expected from each of them ſeverally in rhe Caſe propos'd; he was ſo very particular in his Account, that it took up about four Sheets of Paper; and this Pacquet had like to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the King, and ruin'd the adverſe Party; for it narrowly eſcap'd falling into his Majeſty's Hands: Had he been Maſter of it, it might not only have given him great Light into the Plot, but directed him whom to ſecure, and whom he might truſt in: The Story is very remarkable, even in its minuteſt Circumſtances, which ſhew how all things conſpired to the Deſtruction of this unhappy Prince; and it will be no Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54374:47"/>
from our Subject to tell it; which I ſhall the rather do, becauſe I am aſſured, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what follows, came from the late Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s own Mouth.</p>
               <p>It being ſomewhat late when this Pacquet was convey'd to the Queen, her Majeſty ordered thoſe that attended to retire, after having ſet up a Light at her Bed's-Head, for that ſhe had ſome particular Devotions to perform that Night. She took the Papers with her to Bed, and there they remain'd, when ſhe fell aſleep. The next Morning before the Queen was up, News came, that the King was gone to Chapel; and it being the Cuſtom for them both to hear Maſs, in the Tribunal together, the Queen was oblig'd to get ready in all haſte, and her haſte was ſo great, that ſhe never minded her Papers; yet ſhe could not get ſo ſoon into the Chapel, but the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the eſſential part of the Maſs, was over before ſhe came; ſo ſhe was fain to ſtay for another Maſs, the King retiring when the firſt was ended. When the King was gone, the Queen bethought her ſelf of her Papers, and ſent <hi>de Ville,</hi> the Jeſuit, her Confeſſor, (who was in the Secret, and is ſuppos'd to have inſtigated her Majeſty to what ſhe was acting againſt her Husband) to ſecure them: <hi>de Ville</hi> coming to the Chamber-door, found that the King was got there before him, and he having no Priviledge to enter, while the Queen was abſent, ſtood there for ſome time, and heard the King walking about the Room, and talking aloud, as if he were in ſome heat, to the <hi>Condeça de Caſtelmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor,</hi> the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Mother, and chief Lady of the Bed-Chamber to the Queen: With theſe dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tidings, the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> returns to the Queen.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54374:47"/>
Her Majeſty upon this, ſends one of her Ladies to ſee, whether there were any hopes of retrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Papers. The Lady, upon her coming, found that the King had thrown himſelf upon the Bed. This being told her Majeſty, ſhe found it abſolutely neceſſary for her to go her ſelf; but Maſs was not near done: And what Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence could ſhe have to leave it? Or how ſhould ſhe hinder People from enquiring into the Cauſe of this ſudden Motion? <hi>De Ville</hi> was at her El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow; he ſuggeſted to her, that ſhe ſhould be ſuddenly taken with a Fainting-fit: His Counſel was put in Practice, her Majeſty ſwooning away immediately; and in this Condition ſhe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the Tribunal into her Chamber. The King ſurpriz'd, and concern'd at his Queen's Illneſs, would have had the Bed ſet in order for her to be put into it; had he been obey'd, her Majeſty might have had a Fit in earneſt; for the Papers lay under ſome Cloaths that were upon the Bed: The Fright brought her Majeſty to her ſelf ſo far, as that ſhe deſired them without more ado, to lay her upon the Bed immediately; this done, ſhe felt about for the Papers, found they were ſafe; and, in a little time, all was well again.</p>
               <p>But whatever were the Contents of theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, it ſeems, the Queen did not think it advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for the <hi>Infante</hi> to put himſelf upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: For, in truth, thoſe that ſhe had greateſt Reaſon to depend upon, who were the <hi>French,</hi> were like to give him but a cold Reception; it was not for their Intereſt, at that time, to have the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> embroil'd in a Civil War, while they ſhould be finding Work for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in order to facilitate the <hi>French</hi> King's Conqueſts
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54374:48"/>
in <hi>Flanders.</hi> As for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who together with the <hi>French,</hi> made a good part of the Army, they had been ſent into <hi>Portugal</hi> to ſerve King <hi>Alfonſo;</hi> and it was not to be thought, that they wou'd, upon any account, draw their Swords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; nor is it credible, but the <hi>Conde,</hi> who had the diſpoſal of all Places for above five years together, muſt have bad Friends enough among the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> themſelves, to make the King's Party good; ſo that of the two, it was doubtleſs the beſt way for the King to betake himſelf to the Army: The <hi>Conde,</hi> who was the beſt Judge in the Caſe, thought, that as things ſtood, it was the ſafeſt, if not the only Courſe he cou'd take, to ſecure himſelf; and he had once brought in the Mind to follow this Advice, which was when he was juſt upon leaving the Court himſelf; it being then reſolv'd, that the King ſhould paſs into <hi>Alemtejo</hi> in Diſguiſe, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>Conde:</hi> But when this Project was to be put in Execution, the King fell off, and all the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Remonſtrances cou'd not prevail with him to move from <hi>Lisbon.</hi> His Enemies ſay, That he was ſo much in love with his Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that he cou'd not bear the Thoughts of diſcontinuing them: And, in order to keep his Brother at home too, he wrote him a moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Letter, inviting him to Court, and diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him from his Reſolution to retire, telling him, <hi>That he ſhou'd chooſe rather to come to him, who was ready to receive him with open Arms, and with all the Love that was due to a Friend, a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Son, and (ſhould he fail of Iſſue) the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to his Kingdoms.</hi> But as theſe kind Words were not believ'd to come from his Heart, they rendred him the more contemptible to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:54374:48"/>
While theſe things were tranſacting, the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Lisbon</hi> was up, and in a Fury againſt thoſe that ſhould occaſion the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Departure; but reſolv'd withal to put a ſtop to his Journey, for fear of ſeeing themſelves involv'd in a Civil War: For the poor People had been ſtrangely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at a certain Prophecy, which was then buzzed among them: <hi>That a Day was coming on, when the</hi> Rua Nova (the chief Street in <hi>Lisbon) was to be overflown with Humane Blood, ſo that the Horſes ſhould be bemired in Gore.</hi> And they were under terrible Apprehenſions, that their Eyes were now to ſee the ſad Day. But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Party had made ſo much Noiſe of his retiring, that he could not handſomely draw back, without giving up the Cauſe; for now all that could be done againſt the Court, next to offering downright Violence, had been done already; and all would have been to no purpoſe, ſhould this Deſign be laid aſide: For the Court, when let alone, might in a little time recover its Authority. On the other ſide, ſhould they perſiſt to ſend away the <hi>Infante,</hi> the Rage of the Multitude might have been turn'd upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (for the Court had been tampring with the Ringleaders); and in caſe they got ſafe to the Army, they were like, for the Reaſons now mentioned, to find but little Welcome.</p>
               <p>And now it was high time for the Queen to appear again: Her Majeſty therefore ſends <hi>De Ville</hi> to the <hi>Infante,</hi> to know, whether her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation might be acceptable to him? and if ſo, to deſire he would defer his Journey, while ſhe endeavoured to make up the Buſineſs. No ſooner was the Queen nam'd, but the <hi>Infante,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54374:49"/>
to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Gallantry, was ready to proſtrate himſelf at her Feet, and commit his Cauſe and all to her diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>It does not appear by what means the King was brought to agree to this Arbitration; but agree to it he did, tho' the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Removal, without any mention made of his Return, was a kind of preliminary Article; whereas the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> had all along deſir'd no more, than that he ſhould be ſuſpended from his Charges for a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time. While the Treaty was on foot, the <hi>Conde</hi> was urgent with the King to betake himſelf to his Army; but not prevailing, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd of the Queen, that his Life and Honour might be ſecured to him under the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Hand: And this being preſently granted, he, at the head of the King's Horſe-Guards, retired to the <hi>Arabida,</hi> a Convent of <hi>Capucins,</hi> Seven Leagues from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> leaving the Court prepared for Ruin, which he had hitherto ſupported, and might, as 'twas thought, have preſerv'd ſtill, had his Counſels prevail'd. 'Tis reported, that coming from the King, after his laſt Conference, his Indignation burſt forth ſo far, that he ſhould ſay: <hi>He was going off; but it was for want of a King to ſtand by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Storm was ſcarce blown over, the King being yet diſabled by it, when the Queen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him time to recollect himſelf, rais'd another more violent upon him, by which he was overwhelm'd at laſt; his Majeſty now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one on whoſe Counſels he might rely on in ſo difficult a Juncture, reſolv'd to call <hi>Antonio de Souſa de Macedo,</hi> to Court again, the time of his Baniſhment being out, and made it his Requeſt to the Queen, That by her Favour he might have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54374:49"/>
leave to return; but tho' he frequently renewed his Intreaties, ſhe would not hear him; and when he began to grow importunate, ſhe flatly told him, <hi>That he might reſtore him by his Abſolute Power, if he thought fit; but for her part, he ſhould never have her Conſent.</hi> The King, in hopes to prevail, by ſhewing that he deſired nothing but what was reaſonable, ſent her a Copy of the forementioned Order of Council; but this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſatisfying her, put her Majeſty into ſuch a Paſſion, that after having expreſs'd her Anger in a very ſtrange manner, by Letter to the King, ſhe lock'd her ſelf up, and would ſpeak to no Body. The King no leſs offended at her Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is ſaid to have expreſſed his Sentiments of it in very blunt Terms: Upon this the Secretary, who is ſuppos'd to have lain conceal'd at Court all the while, appear'd there publickly again, but came withal well armed, and well atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to defend himſelf from any Aſſault that ſhould be made upon his Perſon; yet he was not like to ſtand out long againſt them that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed his Patron. He was ſoon made a more dangerous Perſon about the King, than the <hi>Conde</hi> himſelf had been; and the People were not a little confirm'd in this Opinion of him, by Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors ſpread among them, That the King was at laſt determined to leave the Court, at the Head of his Guards, and to ſummon the <hi>Fidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go's</hi> about the <hi>Infante,</hi> to attend him; and if they refus'd, to enter the City with his Troops, and put all Things to Fire and Sword; and that a Liſt was making of ſuch whoſe Heads were to be chop'd off on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>The truth is, <hi>Antonio de Souſa,</hi> upon his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Miniſtry (for he was deſigned to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54374:50"/>
ſupply the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Place) had given the Alarm to the <hi>Camariſts.</hi> By his Advice care was taken to keep the three Regiments that were about the City well affected to the King, and an Officer was appointed to Command them, that ſhould be ready on occaſion to execute the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: It was obſerved likewiſe, that this Officer, together with the three Colonels, were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call'd for to Court; and 'tis ſaid, as they were made acquainted with a Deſign, that <hi>de Souſa</hi> was putting the King upon, which was to ſeize upon the leading Men of the Faction; and that they did not only approve of it, but engag'd themſelves by a ſolemn Promiſe, to put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: But 'tis ſaid withal, that this Project, as well as another, to ſecure the General of the Army, then attending at Court, to ſerve the <hi>Infante,</hi> as 'twas thought, rather than the King, came to nothing; the King being unwilling to come to a Reſolution, 'till he had imparted the Matter to the <hi>Conde de Val de Reys,</hi> who being a timerous Man himſelf, was all for uſing fair means. However, the appearance of thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers about the Court, put the Cabal into a Fright; they eaſily perſwaded themſelves, that no Good was meant towards them, and therefore they thought themſelves concern'd, as they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued their own Safety, to get this evil Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, <hi>Antonio de Souſa,</hi> remov'd out of the way. In order to bring this about, it was firſt thought convenient to render him odious to the People; and to effect that, was no hard matter, he being a Perſon of ſuch a Character, that his Enemies could not wiſh for a fitter Man to ſet the Mob upon. He was indeed a Man of nice Honour, and unbiaſs'd Integrity, a paſſionate Lover of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54374:50"/>
his Country, and for his Inſight into Affairs, and Capacity for Buſineſs, throughly qualified for the Poſt he was in; and at his return into his Country, had been eſteem'd accordingly by ſuch as were in a higher Sphere, that had Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to know the Man: But his Merit was not like to gain him the Good-will of his Equals, it muſt almoſt neceſſarily have enraged them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, conſidering how unpardonable a Crime it appears to moſt Peoples Eyes, for one that hath been of their Rank, to advance himſelf above their Level. It is certain, that all his good Qualifications were not of themſelves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make him Popular; on the contrary, they were attended in him, as they ſometimes may be, with certain little Weakneſſes, that rendred him diſagreeable to the Many; theſe were obvious to the common View, whereas it was not every one that could underſtand his Worth; there was ſomething in his Carriage, that made him appear moroſe, ſour, and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, whereby he became uneaſie to ſuch as had Buſineſs with him, eſpecially thoſe of the meaner ſort, who are always the moſt apt to interpret every ſeeming Neglect, for a ſign of Contempt; and here all manner of People are continually addreſſing themſelves to the Secretary of State, ſo that it is almoſt impoſſible for any Perſon in that Place, to avoid diſguſting great Numbers of Pretenders, eſpecially in ſuch turbulent and factious Times as theſe were, when the Fate of the Great Ones depends upon the good pleaſure of the People, and they expect to be careſs'd and courted accordingly. But <hi>Antonio de Souſa,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was, that having his Head fill'd with other Buſineſs, he cou'd the leſs bear with the many
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54374:51"/>
Impertinences that one in his Station muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually plagued with; or that being ſtrictly honeſt himſelf, he could have no Complaiſance for ſuch Ill-meaning and Ill-deſigning Perſons of all ſorts, as he muſt have had to deal with; either had not, or he did not make much uſe of the Art of Managing a Multitude. He was ſo unhappy in this reſpect, that even when he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Demands of thoſe that applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, he did it with ſo ill a Grace, that he could hardly pleaſe them. This rough Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was no doubt the worſe taken in him, for that the People had been accuſtom'd to other Uſage, and that by the <hi>Conde de Caſtelmelhor,</hi> whoſe greater Quality might have made the ſame thing ſeem tolerable in him, which wou'd have appear'd unſufferable in <hi>Antonio de Souſa.</hi> But the <hi>Conde</hi> us'd to carry himſelf after quite another manner; for having the advantage of a more Court-like Education, he had ſuch eaſie and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Ways with him, that he cou'd diſmiſs a diſappointed Pretender not diſſatisfied. It is the Obſervation of a Gentleman, that was a Publick Miniſter at <hi>Lisbon</hi> about this time, and who in other reſpects gives <hi>de Souſa</hi> his juſt Character: <hi>That People would ſometimes go away much better ſatisfied with the</hi> Conde'<hi>s graceful Denial, than the untoward Grant of</hi> Antonio de Souſa.</p>
               <p>One ſo little in Favour with the People alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, might eaſily be traduc'd to them, and made to paſs for as ill a Man as Enemies were pleas'd to make him: Accordingly, thoſe diſmal Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, concerning his murderous Intentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Nobility, and good People of the City that wiſhed well to the <hi>Infante,</hi> were greedily ſwallow'd by the prepoſſeſt Multitude.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54374:51"/>
And beſides the Havock he was to make amongſt them, it was found, that he, and his Servants, had their Piſtols, and their Carbines with them in the Secretary's Office, which was call'd forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Palace; and that cou'd be done with no other intent, but to kill the <hi>Infante,</hi> tho' he now ſeldom or never came there, and to deſtroy all that ſhould come to take his part. Theſe Diſcoveries wrought ſo effectually in the Peoples Heads, that they diſpos'd them for another Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, and brought 'em flocking to <hi>Corte Real,</hi> fully reſolv'd to ſtand by the <hi>Infante,</hi> againſt all the wicked Plots of <hi>Antonio de Souſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Things being thus in a readineſs, the <hi>Infante</hi> was carried to the Palace, attended by a confus'd Multitude of diſaffected Nobility and Rabble, and all to demand Juſtice againſt the Secretary of State; and that, not ſo much for his Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat Deſigns, for thoſe may be ſuppos'd to have been contriv'd only to bring the People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as for his want of Reſpect to the Queen, and the horrid Outrage committed by him on her Majeſty's Perſon, when he laid his Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Gown. This was on the Fifth of <hi>October</hi> in the Morning, while the King was yet in his Chamber; the <hi>Infante</hi> ſtaid at the Door for ſome of the Counſellors of State to go in with him; when they entred the Chamber, the King was ſo ſurpriz'd at their appearance, that while the <hi>Infante</hi> was telling his Story, he in a great Rage call'd for his Sword. The <hi>Infante</hi> preſenting him with the Guard of his own, ſaid, as 'tis reported: <hi>Sir, If you want a Sword againſt me, make uſe of mine; if againſt any other, this ſhall defend you.</hi> The Noiſe brought the Queen into the Chamber; who preſently fell a beſeeching
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54374:52"/>
his Majeſty, not to be in ſuch a Paſſion. The King wou'd hearken to none of them, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, as he ſaid; that they had murdered the Secretary amongſt them. They aſſured him, that he was alive: But the King wou'd not believe them 'till he ſaw him; whereupon the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> went and fetch'd him from a private Room, where the poor Man had lock'd himſelf up, promiſing him Life if he wou'd go with him; and he very honourably kept his Word, tho' it was not without ſome difficulty; for the Paſſage was crowded with Rabble, whoſe Fingers itch'd to be at the Secretary; and had certainly fall'n upon him, and torn him in pieces, had not the Duke turn'd about, and with an Air of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſaid, Antonio de Souſa <hi>goes along with me.</hi> The King was ſomewhat ſatisfied at the ſight of him, but not appeas'd; hereupon the Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and the <hi>Infante</hi> after her, into the Anti-Chamber. The Secretary being left alone with the King, gave him ſuch Advice as preſerv'd him for that time, and defeated the Deſign of ſome that were Ringleaders in the Tumult. Had the Violence of the King's Paſſion continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it had in all likelihood provoked the Rabble to ſome further Outrage; but he became calm and eaſie, and thereby ſtill'd the Fury of the People, who when their firſt Heat was over, on a ſudden began to relent. While the King and the Secretary were yet together, a Voice was heard crying, <hi>All's well, All's well;</hi> which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it began in the King's Chamber, or was rais'd by ſome Friend of his in the Crowd, the People fell a repeating. The Queen was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into her Apartment, but the Noiſe brought her out again; poſſibly ſhe was ſurpriz'd, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54374:52"/>
not well pleas'd with it. The King coming out, found her and the <hi>Infante</hi> together, in the Anti-Chamber; and, by the Secretary's Advice, took them with him to one of the Windows that looks into the <hi>Terreiro do Paco,</hi> a large Square before the Palace, ſhewing himſelf in their Company to the People below; who ſeeing them all three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, thought that all Quarrels were now at an end, and ſaluted the King with their loud <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va's,</hi> as the King was retiring, either himſelf, or ſome about him cry'd out, <hi>The King pardons every Body;</hi> the Mob took the Cry again. A certain Lord, vex'd perhaps that the great Buſtle they had been making, was like to end in this, call'd one to the King, and with an Heroical Boldneſs, as thoſe engag'd in the ſame Cauſe term it; the Indifferent perhaps will give it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Name, told him, <hi>That they wou'd have none of his Pardon, but Thanks.</hi> The poor King anſwered, <hi>That he gave them his Pardon and his Thanks too.</hi> The ſurly Man reply'd, <hi>They wou'd have nothing but Thanks.</hi> But ſome were ſtill for depoſing the King out of hand: One near the <hi>Infante</hi> crying out, <hi>Let's e'en clap him up at once, and make an end of the Buſineſs:</hi> Which ſhews what they had been aiming at all the while; but the <hi>Infante</hi> turning quick upon the Perſon that ſpoke this, put him to Silence with ſo ſtern a Look, as ſhew'd that he himſelf had been abus'd by them, as well as the King his Brother; and 'tis reported, that ſome of the King's Party ſhould confeſs, <hi>That the King had let fall the Crown this Day, which the</hi> Infante <hi>took up, and put again upon his Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:54374:53"/>
But the Faction had engag'd that Prince ſo far, that it was now too late to think of a Retreat, and ſomething was to be done at this time, or all they had been acting hitherto, was like to end in their own ruine. The King had ſtill his truſty Officers, with the Three Regiments, at Command, who were they to receive Orders from <hi>Antonio de Souſa,</hi> might after all, enable him to call them to account. As for the Mob, this Day's Tranſaction ſhew'd, that they were not much to be depended on, their Rage dying away as it did, when the Buſineſs came juſt to a Criſis, even whilſt all thoſe horrid Stories that had been ſpread amongſt them, with ſo much Indruſtry, were freſh upon their Minds; and ſhou'd they now diſperſe, when nothing had been done, the ſame Artifice was not like to ſerve again; they might Cool and come to themſelves, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in time, be entirely diſabus'd, and then it wou'd be a hard matter to bring them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when there ſhou'd be further occaſion for them. Such, and the like conſiderations, went, no doubt, a great way to fix them in the Reſolution they then took; which was, to keep Poſſeſſion of the Palace, 'till they had gain'd the Point that had been the Pretence of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, which was the Removal of <hi>Antonio de Souſa;</hi> this they knew the King wou'd never content to: He was by this time ſenſible of his Error, in parting ſo eaſily as he did, with the <hi>Conde,</hi> and fully reſolv'd to keep <hi>Antonio de Souſa</hi> near him, who was now the only ſupport he had left. He had ſhewn in the Morning, how great a Value he had for the Man; when think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was kill'd, he cou'd not forbear to repeat his Meanaces to the Company that came to him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54374:53"/>
in his Chamber, as well attended as they were, that he wou'd ſee them ſeverely puniſh'd who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhou'd be that had a hand in the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; And while he was paſſing to and fro through the Rabble, he wou'd always have him by his ſide, and not ſuffer him to be out of his ſight; as if he thought, that whatever Miſchief was done to the Secretary, was much the ſame as if it had befall'n his own Perſon. But the Faction, on the other ſide, were ſatisfi'd, that they cou'd never be ſafe whilſt this Man was ſuffer'd to be at Court; and therefore, it was concluded amongſt them, to keep the <hi>Infante</hi> in the Palace 'till the Secretary was gone; they making him declare, that now he was there, he wou'd never ſtir 'till he had effected the Buſineſs he come about; and Orders were given, that Neceſſaries ſhou'd be got ready for his Lodging. The Secretary being given to underſtand, that in caſe he remain'd there that Night, he was like to ſleep his laſt. This was the beſt Courſe they could take, to hinder the Rabble from diſperſing; who either in expectation of ſome great Miſchief to enſue, or for fear leſt the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Perſon ſhould be in danger, would be ſure to keep about the Palace. In effect, this Reſolution did their Buſineſs, and ruin'd the King: For the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, tho' he was not to be frightned with either Threats or Dangers, while there was any hopes left of his being ſerviceable to his diſtreſſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as he ſhew'd by his embarking himſelf in an almoſt deſperate Cauſe; yet ſeeing now, that ſhould he perſiſt any longer, all he could do was to get himſelf murdered; which probably would but make the Faction the more deſperate, and haſten their Deſign upon the King; he promis'd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54374:54"/>
to be gone as ſoon as 'twas dark, it not being ſafe for him to appear in the Street before; and two Perſons of Quality undertaking, that he ſhould keep his Word, the <hi>Infante</hi> return'd in Triumph to his own Palace, attended as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The next Morning the King finding the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary gone, as alſo <hi>Manoel Antunes,</hi> who had made the ſame Conditions for himſelf, ſends all about to look for them, ordering all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to be ſearch'd. <hi>Antunes</hi> was found in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemtejo;</hi> but the <hi>Infante</hi> took care he ſhould come no more to Court.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Infante,</hi> before this Buſineſs, had been very ſeldom at Court, ever ſince the <hi>Conde</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; the Queen, as it is like, afraid of a Reconciliation between the two Brothers, which would defeat her Deſigns, ſending him word, That it would be dangerous for him to appear there; and now when all were gone, that they had any Pretence of Complaint againſt, he had the ſame Meſſages ſent to him as before, which kept him ſtill at a diſtance from the King; who, as I have been aſſured by one that had good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to know, how things paſs'd at Court in thoſe Days, had, during all theſe Broils, ſome Remains of Love or Tenderneſs rather for his Brother; believing, that the young Prince was only made the Inſtrument of other Peoples Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. This, I confeſs, ſeem'd to me ſomewhat unlikely, conſidering what had paſt between them, 'till the ſame Perſon told me; That <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo,</hi> afterwards, when a Priſoner, hearing the Noiſe of the Guns, and Ringing of Bells, for the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Marriage with the Queen, when he was told the Cauſe of this Joy, inſtead of expreſſing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54374:54"/>
his Reſentments of his own hard Uſage, fell a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Misfortunes of his poor Brother <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro; Who,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>would, in a ſhort time, have enough of the</hi> French-<hi>Woman, and as much cauſe as himſelf to repent, that he ever had any thing to do with her.</hi> But to return:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonſo</hi> having now none near him that he could adviſe with, being himſelf young, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with Buſineſs, was for the ſhort time that remain'd of his Reign, on all occaſions, at a loſs how to comport himſelf; the <hi>Conde,</hi> for ſome time after his removal, us'd to be ever and anon ſending him Inſtructions, but he had now none with him to carry on the Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and therefore was wholly to ſeek what Meaſures he ſhould take; ſometimes he would refuſe to be preſent at the Council, as when he was there, to confirm their Decrees. The Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Lisbon</hi> was ſet on to Petition him for call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Cortes,</hi> and he being ſenſible that this was in order to lay him aſide, ſometimes would refuſe to hear them; or when they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to return them any Anſwer: Some there were, and thoſe perhaps none of his greateſt Enemies, for having him to allow the Queen, and the <hi>Infante,</hi> a Joint-ſhare with him in the Government; but he would hear no Talk of it: The Council, at laſt, after many Denials, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his Conſent for calling the <hi>Cortes;</hi> but when they had got the Writs ready, they could not prevail with him to ſign them. Whether he ſhew'd ſo much Irreſolution and Inconſtancy out of Weakneſs or Deſign, is uncertain; his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would have the World believe, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the former, and had the Barbarity to publiſh ſeveral weak things, which they report

him to have ſaid, during the time of theſe Broils; when, perhaps, a wiſer Man in his Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, might have found himſelf at his Wit's-end. But it appear'd, that he was preparing for an Eſcape into <hi>Alemtejo,</hi> and that his Horſes, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſeveral Barks, to tranſport them over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, had been getting ready for that purpoſe; ſo 'tis not unlikely, but that he behav'd himſelf in the manner he did, to keep his Enemies in ſuſpence, and from coming to a Reſolution, 'till he could get out of their Hands, and be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to call his Friends about him; but they that were then ſtrongeſt, prevented this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>While things were thus at a ſtand, the Queen, who us'd frequently to viſit the Nunneries, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of the <hi>Eſperança,</hi> (of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Order, where ſeveral Ladies of Honour were profeſt) took occaſion, <hi>Nov.</hi> 21ſt, in the Evening, to go thither in her Coach with her uſual Attendance; as ſoon as ſhe was within the Nunnery, ſhe ſent a Letter to the King to this purpoſe, <hi>That ſhe had left her Country, her Relations, and Friends, and ſold her Eſtate, to come and accompany his Majeſty, in hopes that what ſhe did, might be to his Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and was inconſolable, that ſhe had not been able to attain to what ſhe ſo much deſired; that, as obliged in Conſcience, ſhe was now reſolv'd to return into</hi> France, <hi>in the Ships that were then in the River, for which end ſhe deſired his Majeſty's Conſent; and hoped, that he would order her Dower to be return'd her, ſince his Majeſty knew very well that ſhe was none of his Wife,</hi> &amp;c. The King, when this Letter was brought him, was making ready to ride out into the Fields; but he no ſooner underſtood the Contents of it, than enraged at this the moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54374:55"/>
Affront he had ever yet receiv'd, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediately into his Coach, and with great Fury drove to the <hi>Eſperança,</hi> reſolving to force the Nunnery; and for that end, aſſoon as he got thither, was calling for Axes to hew down the Doors, when the <hi>Infante</hi> came to the place ſo well attended, that he oblig'd him to return to the Palace.</p>
               <p>The next Day the Queen ſent for the <hi>Infante,</hi> and afterwards for the Counſellors of State, and the Nobility about the Court. The Buſineſs that ſhe had in common with the one and the others, was to acquaint them of her Reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>France,</hi> and to deſire that they would aſſiſt her in it. And much about the ſame time, ſhe diſpatch'd away for <hi>France,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Verjus,</hi> who ſerv'd her Majeſty in place of a Secretary, but bore the Character of Agent for the Houſe of <hi>Vendome;</hi> and his Buſineſs was to procure a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation, for her to marry with the <hi>Infante.</hi> The Queen gave Commiſſion likewiſe to the <hi>Infante,</hi> to ſignifie to the King, in a more formal manner, her Delcaration concerning the Nullity of their Marriage, and to deſire his Permiſſion, for her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into her own Country. When the <hi>Infante</hi> delivered his Meſſage, the King, in anſwer to the firſt part of it, pretended to refute the Charge, and that, as his Enemies ſay, in very broad Terms: To the reſt he return'd him but a ſlight Reply. However, he gave others that were about him to underſtand, that as ſenſibly touch'd as he was at this, above all the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes that had befall'n him, his Trouble did not proceed from his Regret for the loſs of the Queen's Perſon; he was ſo far from having any great Fondneſs for her Majeſty, that he declar'd, <hi>That
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54374:56"/>
inſtead of putting a ſtop to her Journey, he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, on Condition ſhe wou'd but be gone, to preſent her with a much better Ship than that ſhe came upon, and to double the Money that ſhe had brought along with her into the Bargain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen the ſame Day having made the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> her Proctor, ſent a Letter to the Chapter of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to acquaint the Canons, <hi>That ſhe had withdrawn her ſelf from the King's Company, the Marriage they had agreed upon, not having taken effect; and becauſe the Scruples of her Conſcience, would not ſuffer her to endure any longer, what her Love to the</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Nation had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to made her diſſemble; ſhe hoped the King, who was a better Witneſs in her Cauſe, would declare the ſame, that ſhe might not be hindred from returning into</hi> France <hi>as ſoon as poſſible: And for the</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter <hi>of the</hi> Holy See <hi>of this City, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to judge of the Cauſe by their Miniſters, ſhe earneſtly deſir'd them to take order, that it may be diſpatch'd with all ſpeed; and to allow all juſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to a Stranger, afflicted with the Misfortune of not being able to live in a Country, which ſhe had come from a far to ſeek, with ſo much pleaſure; and they might aſſure themſelves, that whereſoever ſhe was, ſhe ſhould gratefully acknowledge the Kindneſs they did her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chapter, which conſiſts moſt of young Gentlemen that never were in Orders, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deſign it, return'd Anſwer to her Majeſty, <hi>That they had read her Letter, and were grieved at her Reſolution of abandoning</hi> Portugal; <hi>telling her withal, that what Juſtice allow'd to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, could never be denied to her Majeſty; but there being many Circumſtances in the Caſe that required deliberation, they deſired her Majeſty to allow them convenient time to conſider of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:54374:56"/>
The King, as much concern'd as he was in what the Queen was doing, had ſomething elſe to do than to ſollicit his Cauſe with the Chapter; for the ſame Day that ſhe brought her Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, it was reſolv'd upon, that he ſhould be Depos'd without more ado; in order to which, the Magiſtrates of <hi>Lisbon</hi> went to petition the <hi>Infante,</hi> That they might, the Day following, wait upon him to the Palace, and that he would then take the Government into his own Hands: and that, if this could not be done by fair means, they might uſe Violence. The <hi>Infante</hi> ordered them to be ready on the Morrow, to accompany him, if it ſhould be thought convenient; and it was agreed, that the Council of State ſhould, before they proceeded any further, endeavour to prevail with the King, to reſign up the Crown.</p>
               <p>Early the next Morning, the Marqueſs of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes</hi> got to the Palace before the other Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and coming into the King's Anti-Chamber, told thoſe that waited, That he had a Mind to ſpeak with the King. They anſwering, That he was yet a Bed. He knock'd at the Door with ſo much Noiſe, that he wakened him, and coming to his Bed-ſide, told his Majeſty, <hi>That this was not a time for him to ſleep; that if he did not awake, and ſhake off the Lethargy in which he had lived, he must in a few Hours be deprived of the Kingdom, which he had already ruin'd; and ſince he was unfit to Govern, and uſeleſs in Marriage, he adviſed him to do that freely, and in a way conſiſtent with his Honour, which otherwiſe he muſt be forc'd to do with Diſgrace; that is, to ſend for the</hi> Infante, <hi>his Brother, and deliver up the Government to him; for by that means he might ſecure his Crown, and preſerve his Kingdom.</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:54374:57"/>
The Council came afterwards in a Body, and endeavoured to perſwade the King to reſign; but neither Menaces, nor Arguments, could bring him to comply. He continuing reſolute, the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> was ſent to give the <hi>Infante</hi> an Account how things ſtood; and nothing was further done till towards the Evening, which, as it is pretended, was to give the King time to change his mind; but, as 'tis more likely, to perſwade the <hi>Infante</hi> to finiſh what they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; He, at laſt, Night drawing on, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Magiſtrates of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Party, and a great Concourſe of the People, went to the Palace, where he was received by the Council of State; and at the Head of this Company, went and lock'd up the King in his Chamber, ſecuring all the Paſſages through which he might eſcape. A Form of Reſignation was then drawn up, read and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by the Council, which before they broke up, was ſent to the King for him to Sign, and accordingly it was brought back ſign'd by him; but it is not known by what Means he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to do it: The Prince takes up his Lodgings that Night in the Palace; he had no ſooner thrown himſelf upon the Bed, it being very late, but a Meſſage came to him from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo,</hi> to deſire that <hi>John the Dog-Keeper</hi> might be ſent to keep him Company; the Meſſage drew Tears from the Prince's Eyes, 'tis pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he wept in commiſeration of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers weakneſs, and little ſenſe of his Condition; tho' 'tis not improbable, but the Dethroned King took this way to make his Brother ſenſible of the ill Uſage he had met with, perhaps from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54374:57"/>
their hands, that had been ſent to make him Sign the Reſignation, which, but the ſame Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as hath been ſhown, the moſt Brutal Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could not extort from him.</p>
               <p>The King being thus Depoſed, the Prince Signs the Writs that had been prepared for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the <hi>Cortes,</hi> before they aſſembled, it was debated, Whether it might be convenient for him to take the Title of King, but it paſs'd in the <hi>Negative</hi> in a Committee of Judges, and other Miniſters, to whom the Matter was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and it was carried, that he ſhould content himſelf with the Title he then uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Curator of the King's Perſon, and Governor of the Kingdom;</hi> The ſame Queſtion was afterwards long debated in the <hi>Cortes,</hi> which met on the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1668, but in the end it was concluded, That he ſhould have the Kingly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with the Title of <hi>Prince Regent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Queen having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd her Proceſs againſt <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was depoſed, upon his Confinement was at liberty to proſecute the ſame with the utmoſt vigour. There being no Biſhops at this time in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Cauſe, as hath been ſaid, was brought before the Chapter of <hi>Lisbon:</hi> I ſhall, for many reaſons, forbear giving a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Proceedings, tho' there be no want of Materials; but in ſhort, <hi>Alfonſo</hi> after a few Days Confinement, was, as 'tis pretended, brought to ſign an Acknowledgment of what the Queen had declared, concerning the Nullity of their Marriage, contrary to what he had aſſerted to the <hi>Infante,</hi> when he ſignify'd her Declaration to him the Day after her Retreat, while he was yet at liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:54374:58"/>
It fell out happily for the Queen, as ſhe thought at leaſt, that her Uncle the Duke of <hi>Vendome,</hi> lately made a Cardinal-Deacon, was at this very time commiſſioned by the Pope, to repreſent the Perſon of his Holineſs, as Godfather to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> then ſeven Years old, at that Formality of a Chriſtning, which is uſed for the Children of <hi>France:</hi> For this end the Cardinal-Duke had the Title and Patent given him of <hi>Legat a Latere.</hi> To him, as inveſted with the Plenitude of the Pope's Power, Monſieur <hi>Verjus,</hi> (who was ſent as hath been ſaid, into <hi>France,</hi> upon the Queen's firſt leaving her Husband) applied himſelf for a Diſpenſation, that the Queen might marry with the <hi>Infante.</hi> The Cardinal was, no doubt, willing enough to oblige his Niece, and to do for her whatever was in his Power; but then he queſtion'd much, whether it was in his Power to help her out in this Caſe; as well he might: For who cou'd think, that a Proxy to be Godfather to a Child in <hi>France,</hi> ſhould enable him to make it lawful for a Woman in <hi>Portugal</hi> to marry with her living Husband's Brother? But Monſieur <hi>Verjus</hi> having ſatisfied the <hi>French</hi> King about what the Queen of <hi>Portugal</hi> had been doing, the Diſpenſation was obtain'd without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for he and Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> reading the Cardinal's Bull of Legate, found out that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ſome Clauſes, that did, as it were, point to the very Caſe in Hand, and to give the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal as ample Powers as they could wiſh; and ſo the Diſpenſation was granted without more a-do: And in truth, they in <hi>France</hi> were a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too haſty in this Buſineſs, for the Diſpenſation was obtain'd there, before they were ready for it in <hi>Portugal,</hi> it bears Date the 17 <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54374:58"/>
i. e.</hi> the 16th Day of <hi>March,</hi> and in it 'tis ſuppoſed and affirmed, that the former Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age had been declared null by Courſe of Law. But the Chapter of <hi>Lisbon</hi> were not ſo very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, for they did not pronounce Sentence 'till the 24th of <hi>March,</hi> tho' conſidering how long Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Divorce between Royal Perſons uſed to depend, which we in <hi>England</hi> have good Cauſe to remember, none will accuſe them of dilatory Proceedings. They at laſt by their Delegates appointed to examine and determine the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pronounc'd the former Marriage to be null, by reaſon of <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s incurable Inability to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate it, occaſion'd by his Sickneſs during the time of his Childhood; of which Inability, as 'tis affirm'd in the Sentence, there was more than ſufficient Proof, and at leaſt a Moral Certainty; ſo that as they ſaid, there was no need of Inſpection of Trial for 3 Years, or any other limited time.</p>
               <p>The Queen was now talking of nothing but returning into <hi>France</hi> by the Fleet that lay in the River, to carry off the <hi>French</hi> Troops that had been in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Service; with this Deſign ſhe made the three Eſtates of the Kingdom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, deſiring, that the Portion which ſhe had brought with her, might be return'd her. The doleful News of her intended Departure, (ſaith the Writer, employ'd to give the World an account of theſe Tranſactions) was with great Grief heard by the States, and they entring into politick Conſiderations in the midſt of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, find that this Princeſs, on account of all the Conveniencies of State, all the Endowments of Mind, and all the Perfections of Nature, was the moſt ready, moſt convenient, moſt worthy, and moſt lovely Spouſe that a Prince could wiſh
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54374:59"/>
for; went all in a Body to the Nunnery, (ſaith another Writer of the ſame Stamp) to ſupplicate her Majeſty with Tears in their Eyes, <hi>That ſhe would not abandon them, but ſtay and marry with the Prince, becauſe they were neither able nor willing to return her Portion.</hi> But the Queen would give them no poſitive Anſwer; then they went in a Body to the Prince, <hi>begging of him to ſave the Kingdom, by marrying the Queen; proteſting, they would never ſuffer him to marry any Body elſe,</hi> (for there was a Match about the ſame time propos'd between him and the Princeſs of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> with great Advantages to the State); the Prince told them, <hi>That he for his part was willing, provided they could but gain the Queen's Conſent.</hi> Then they return'd again in a Body to the Queen, and with repeated Entreaties <hi>beſeeched her to Conſent:</hi> Her Majeſty at laſt preferring the Welfare of the Kingdom (ſaith my Author) to her own Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, put off her Return to her own Country, and by a heavenly Inſpiration gave Conſent, that they ſhould treat of the Marriage. The Match was ſoon made up; for the Sentence of Divorce paſs'd but on <hi>Saturday</hi> the Eve of <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> and on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the Paſſion-Week, the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> her Proxy, was married in a private Oratory of the Palace to the Marqueſs of <hi>Marralva,</hi> who repreſented the Prince. On <hi>Eaſter-Monday,</hi> the Prince, with a numerous Attendance fetched the Bride from the Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and carried her to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was conſummated: Poor <hi>Alfonſo</hi> ſending his Complements upon it, to wiſh Joy, as 'tis ſaid, to the new-married Couple. They will have it likewiſe, that he acquieſced all along to the Proceedings in the Cauſe of his Divorce; and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54374:59"/>
that by the Advice of two <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,</hi> he confeſs'd the Inability objected to him by the Queen, and at laſt ſubmitted to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, declaring, that he would not appeal: But he was a Priſoner all the while. This dethroned Prince, after he had been confined ſome time in the Palace, was ſent to the <hi>Terceira</hi> Iſland, one of the <hi>Azores;</hi> but having been kept there for ſome Years, he was for greater Security brought back to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſhut up in the Caſtle of <hi>Cintra,</hi> formerly a Royal Palace, where he ended his Days the 12th of <hi>December</hi> 1683.</p>
               <p>After Conſummation of this Marriage between the <hi>Infante</hi> and the Queen, the Pope was applied to to diſpenſe with it; which he did by a <hi>Breve,</hi> dated the 10th of <hi>December,</hi> 1668, directed to the chief Inquiſitor, and others, impowring them in caſe they found the Allegations of the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners true, to annul the former Marriage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Second; which was done accordingly the 18th of <hi>Feb.</hi> following.</p>
               <p>This Bull hath ſome very extraordinary Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in it, inſerted, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Ex abundanti cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telâ;</hi> which yet it will not be amiſs to mention here, if for no other Reaſon, than to ſee how far the Plenitude of the Pope's Power reaches in ſuch Caſes. By it the Commiſſioners are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred and commanded, <hi>to cancel, diſſolve, and annul</hi> Alphonſo's <hi>Marriage, even without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi> or in caſe the ſaid Marriage <hi>did appear, or ſhould be found to have been valid;</hi> and commands them to diſpenſe with the Second Marriage, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Impediment, <hi>Publicae honeſtatis,</hi> or <hi>any other Impediment of what nature ſoever, that may ariſe or appear;</hi> decreeing, That altho' the ſaid King <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> or any other Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,

                  <hi>have neither given their conſent, appear'd, been cited, or heard;</hi> and altho' the Cauſes for which theſe Letters were granted, <hi>be neither ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved nor juſtified;</hi> that all this, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſaid Letters, and the Contents of the ſame, <hi>ſhall never be call'd in queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or violated for any lawful Cauſe, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, how great or ſubſtantial ſoever;</hi> that <hi>no Perſon ſhall obtain Relief againſt them, upon any Plea of Right, Fact, or Favour;</hi> and in caſe Relief be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, <hi>it ſhall be of no benefit, tho' granted</hi> de mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu proprio, <hi>with full Power and Apoſtolical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> but that <hi>they ſhall be for ever valid, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, without limitation to the ſaid Prince,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Pope had a great deal of reaſon to tell the Prince, as he did afterwards in his Letter, That <hi>in this Cauſe he had certainly ſhewn him all the Favour that the ſacred Canons would permit,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this Marriage was born within the firſt Year, the late <hi>Infanta,</hi> of whom I ſhall ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, but never any other Child, tho' the Queen liv'd with the Prince for above 15 Years. She departed this Life the 17th Day of <hi>Decem,</hi> 1683, after having languiſh'd in great Miſery, for the ſpace of ſix Months together, under the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that occaſion'd her Death.</p>
               <p>After having mention'd ſo many Particulars, which ſeem to bear hard upon the Memory of this Princeſs, common Equity requires, that I ſhould enlarge a little upon what is ſaid in her Commendation: She was much celebrated for her great Underſtanding and Inſight into Affairs, of which I think there can be no better Proof than this; the Prince her Husband (for he had not the Title of King 'till a little before ſhe died) had ſo high an Opinion of her Judgment, as to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54374:60"/>
conſult her upon all occaſions of moment, and never came to a Reſolution in any Buſineſs of Importance, before he had firſt taken her Advice; which may perhaps be one Reaſon, why he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted her loſs ſo much, as that he remain'd inconſolable for ſome time; and, as it's ſaid, could not be perſwaded to think of a Second Marriage, 'till Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. by his Paternal Admonitions, in a manner, oblig'd him to it: They are not wanting, who make large Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums upon her other Vertues; I have two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons now before me, preach'd in her Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, by two of the moſt famous for Eloquence in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the one a little after her Second Marriage, and the other upon her Death; and I have conſulted both theſe, in order to give her Character to the beſt advantage. The former ſpeaks in general Terms of many wonderful Things that might be ſaid in her Praiſe; but when he comes to Particulars, he falls a trifling: He highly magnifies her Noble Birth, chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was deſcended from a Baſtard-Son of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and reckons up the Titles that were related to the Family, and among others, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities of <hi>Anet,</hi> and <hi>Martignes,</hi> the Duchies of <hi>Pontievre,</hi> and <hi>Tampis,</hi> the Marquiſats of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorlem,</hi> and <hi>Saſors.</hi> He tells her Majeſty, (for he preached before her), That ſhe was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Beauty; and he hoped, would be as handſome when ſhe came to be 90 Years old, as ſhe was at 20. He thinks it was diſcreetly done of her Parents, to Chriſten her with three Names, ſince one was not enough to expreſs her Merit: For Aſtrologers call the fineſt Star in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Venus, Lucifer,</hi> and <hi>Veſper.</hi> Speaking of her forſaking her Husband, which he calls lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54374:61"/>
a Crown, to keep her Conſcience unblemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he profanely compares it to <hi>Moſes's refuſing to be call'd the Son of</hi> Pharaoh'<hi>s Daughter, chuſing rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon.</hi> And hence he infers, That this Princeſs ought to be except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that general Maxim of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> which repreſents the Female Sex, as <hi>ambitious and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is no leſs copious in her Praiſes, but ſpeaks a little more to the purpoſe, he highly extols her great Prudence, ſpeaks much in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of her Magnanimity and Patience, in bearing the Diſgrace when the Match was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off between the <hi>Infanta,</hi> her Daughter, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which ſhe had ſet her Heart very much upon; and for her other Vertues, he would have her paſs for no leſs than a Saint; but he intimates, that her Piety was beſt known to her Confeſſor, and compares it to the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> which was viſible only to the High-Prieſt; and, indeed, I do not find, that it was much known to the People, it being very little talk'd of amongſt them: Certainly, if it was ſo very great as this Orator repreſents it, her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Confeſſor had a great deal of reaſon when he us'd to tell thoſe he convers'd with, <hi>That the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>did not know how good a Queen God had ſent them.</hi>

                  <hi>MAria Sophia Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Philip William</hi> late Duke of <hi>Nicubourg,</hi> and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine</hi> by <hi>Elizabeth Amelia,</hi> Daughter of <hi>George</hi> Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſe d'Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt,</hi> was born the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1666, and Married to Dom <hi>Pedro</hi> the II. King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1687, the day of her Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to which place ſhe was conducted by a Squadron of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War, under the Command of the late Duke of <hi>Grafton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Princeſs was of a middle Stature, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fair, and a graceful Perſon. I do not know whether they that are Judges in theſe Matters, will allow her to have been a Perfect Beauty; but no doubt, all Strangers will agree, that ſhe appeared with great advantage among her Ladies, one cauſe of this, perhaps may be, her neglect of thoſe Arts which they have recourſe to to ſet themſelves off, for the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Women of all Ranks, do ſo diſcolour their Faces with Red Paint, that it renders them a very diſagreeable Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the Eyes of Strangers.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved, That her Majeſty did ſeldom or never concern her ſelf with the Affairs of State, contrary to the Practice of the former Queen. It is ſaid, that her Confeſſor, Father <hi>Leopold Fueſs,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who came along with her from <hi>Germany,</hi> advis'd her not to meddle with the Government. They tell indeed, of one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54374:62"/>
of hers, which I may ſpeak of in another place, which ſhe was put upon by the ſame <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,</hi> her Confeſſor, it being a Matter, wherein, as 'tis ſaid, the whole <hi>Society</hi> have concern'd themſelves for ſome time, and that was to bring the <hi>Conde de Caſtelmelhor</hi> into the Miniſtry again; but if her Majeſty ever had any ſuch Deſign, it is certain that nothing came of it, for the <hi>Conde</hi> keeps from Court ſtill, and the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> is ſince more firmly eſtabliſh'd there than before.</p>
               <p>But the Principal Parts of her Majeſties Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, are her great Piety, and ſingular Devotion, according to the Religion in which ſhe had been educated; ſhe was a conſtant Hearer of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Cratory,</hi> an Order of Men, who ſome Years ago were famous for Preaching of true Chriſtian Morality, whereby they became, and were it not for ſome very mean Complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces their prevailing Adverſaries have extorted from them, they had continued ſtill the Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; nor are they yet ſo far degenerated, but People ſtill take notice, that their Sermons are the leaſt ſtuft with thoſe Fooleries wherewith Preachers of other Orders affect to raiſe Mirth in the Audience. It is, I ſuppoſe, for this cauſe, that notwithſtanding the large Share the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have in her Majeſties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſhe honour'd them ſo often with her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and that the Street where their Church ſtands, was every Sunday in <hi>Lent,</hi> crowded with Coaches, for her Majeſties Example ſeems to have had a mighty Influence over the whole Court, eſpecially among thoſe of her own Sex. It is a uſual thing to ſee Ladys of Quality with their Prayer-Books open in their hands, as they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54374:62"/>
are carried along the Streets in their Litters, and I have obſerved ſome of the younger ſort as they were going to a Wedding of one of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panious, very hard at their Devotion in the midſt all their Gayety.</p>
               <p>I need not, I ſuppoſe, tell that her Majeſty is zealouſly addicted to what is now ſo commonly called the <hi>Catholick Religion;</hi> it is enough to make the Reader ſenſible of that, to ſay, ſhe is of the Houſe of <hi>Nicubourg,</hi> The Princes of that Family, by the very extraordinary Methods they take to promote their Religion, have made their Zeal ſufficiently remarkable to the World. But as well inſtructed in <hi>Catholiciſm</hi> as ſhe was in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> her Majeſty ſeemed to be much improved ſince her coming into <hi>Portugal,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe ſmaller Devotions, as the <hi>French</hi> call them, of which good <hi>Catholicks</hi> are ſo very ſhy in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys where Hereticks are in ſight, and ſo mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to, where they are at their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But it would be very difficult for one that is of another Religion, to give an account of theſe Matters, without being ſuſpected of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, or in the preſent caſe of diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Majeſty. I ſhall therefore give but one Inſtance of the Queens Devotion; and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I ſhall ſay nothing but what I have from the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who were her Majeſties Directors, and are at this day reckon'd among the moſt refin'd Courtiers in <hi>Europe,</hi> and therefore may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to underſtand beſt what is moſt fit for the World to know.</p>
               <p>From theſe good Fathers then, I learn, that above all the Saints in the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar, the Queen had a ſingular and moſt devout Affection
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54374:63"/>
for the famous St. <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> I need not, I ſuppoſe, at this time, tell who this Saint is, ſince his Life has been written by the elegant Pen of Pere <hi>Bouhours,</hi> and tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by our famous <hi>Laureat,</hi> or 'tis enough to let the ordinary Reader know that he was one of the firſt Set of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> that appear'd in the World; and that he is frequently addreſs'd to by ſuch as want Heirs to their Familys, and is believed by his Devotes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to procure Relief in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt occaſion taken notice of by my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, of the great Friendſhip between this Saint and her Majeſty, was this; Soon after her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the Viceroy that came from <hi>Goa,</hi> brought along with him a certain Cap, that had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong'd to <hi>Xavier, The greateſt Treaſure</hi> (ſaith the Famous Jeſuit <hi>Vieira) that ever came from the</hi> Indies, <hi>ſince the</hi> Arm <hi>of the ſame Saint, that's now at</hi> Rome, <hi>was brought from thence:</hi> This Cap her Majeſty, poſſibly prevail'd upon to comply with the Bigotry of thoſe about her, put upon her Head on the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>Nevember</hi> 1687, which in the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar is the day <hi>of the Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Virgin,</hi> and ſhe happening to be with Child ſoon afterwards, they would needs have it that ſhe received great Benefit by the Cap; but the Jeſuits have made ſtrange work of the Matter, <hi>On which day</hi> (ſaith the Jeſuit <hi>Duarte) Her Majeſty amidſt the ſweeteſt tranſports of her Heart, received for the firſt time the Sacred</hi> Cap <hi>upon her Royal Head, when ſuddenly</hi> (ſaith <hi>Vieira</hi> another Jeſuit) <hi>the Tears flowed from her eyes in a copious manner, her Countenance being all of a flame, and changed to that degree, that her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi> (a third Jeſuit) <hi>being preſent, was aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54374:63"/>
at the ſight;</hi> and he afterwards asking the cauſe of this alteration; the Queen, (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) reveal'd to him, how that ſhe was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified at the very Inſtant, that the Saint would obtain a Son for her, of which ſhe hoped, through the Saint's Interceſſion, ſhe ſhould never make the leaſt doubt. The Confeſſor's Words (ſaith <hi>Vieira)</hi> are, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nihil amplius haeſitaret de impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trando quod petebat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> after this, brought the Saint's Image from their Church at St. <hi>Roque,</hi> upon a Viſit to the Queen at the Palace; and tell the World, That her Majeſty had learn'd ſo much <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>Meu ſanto daime hum Filho ſe Deos quizer.</hi> My Saint, give me a Son, if God pleaſes. <hi>Her Request was granted,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Vieira);</hi> and he very profanely applies theſe words, <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavit Dominus Annam &amp; concepit,</hi> to this Viſit that the Image made to her Majeſty. After this, ſhe was made to believe, as the Jeſuit's pretend at leaſt, that the Child ſhe had conceived would infallibly prove a Son. <hi>Vieira</hi> proves, that it muſt neceſſarily be a Son by this Inſtance: A certain <hi>Indian,</hi> upon the Coaſts of <hi>Comorin,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to St. <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> That he would pleaſe to beſtow upon him a Son: And not many Days after, the Wife came to underſtand, that the Saint had heard her Husband's Prayers; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it was yet doubtful, what the Saint was ſending her; but when the time of her Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was up, behold ſhe was brought to Bed of a <hi>Girl.</hi> The Father ſeeing it was a Girl, in a rage takes the little Creature, and away he goes with it to the Saint's Altar, and there laying it before him, <hi>Here,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my Saint, here's what you gave me; but it is not what I asked for: Had it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54374:64"/>
been a</hi> Boy, <hi>I intended it ſhould have been mine; but ſince it is a</hi> Girl, <hi>e'en take it for your ſelf.</hi> The Great Miracle-worker (ſaith <hi>Vieira)</hi> was now much in the ſame Caſe, with a poor Trades-man, that hath his Work turn'd upon his Hands: And what, ſaith he, ſhould the Saint do in the Caſe? As for the <hi>Indian,</hi> he was reſolv'd never to own the Girl, but to carry her away preſently to the Hoſpital: But he going to take her off the Altar, he ſaw, to his Aſtoniſhment, that ſhe was become a Boy, a Boy! Upon this the People came thronging about the Altar, to be Witneſs to the Miracle, and the Church was preſently fill'd with a confus'd Noiſe of Thanks and Praiſe to the Saint, and <hi>Much Joy</hi> to the <hi>Indian;</hi> ſo that, ſaith the <hi>Padre,</hi> if the <hi>Indian</hi> was Father of the Girl, the Saint was Father of the Boy. From this Story he infers, (how well I ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine) that the Queen, ſince ſhe had conceiv'd through the Interceſſion of St. <hi>Xavier,</hi> muſt needs bring forth a Son. But to ſecure her Hopes, and return the Saint's Civility, ſhe entred, they ſay, into a new Courſe of Devotion, which was to viſit the Saint at the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Church, ten <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> in the Year. The Confeſſor kept a kind of Journal of the Accidents befalling the Queen, during her Big-belly; and pretends, that in all Dangers ſhe had ſo much Confidence in her Saint, who had given her this Son, that ſhe was ſure of a ſafe Delivery; as in effect, ſhe was delivered much about the time of their Reckoning of a Prince, who dy'd about ſeventeen Days after his Birth. But they pretend, that this was not the only Child that her Majeſty was indebted to St. <hi>Xavier</hi> for; they will have it, that all her Children have <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>Xavier,</hi> among their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54374:64"/>
Names, becauſe ſhe thought her ſelf oblig'd for them all to the Saint; and that among other Marks of her Gratitude, ſhe wore the Saint's Colours for ſome time; and in Token of her Affection, ſent him a new Suit of Cloaths for his Body at <hi>Goa;</hi> of which they believe, (if we'll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them) the Saint was not a little Proud, but made his Braggs in the Court of Heaven of her Majeſty's Favours.</p>
               <p>They that have been in Countries where pure Popery in ſtill practis'd; that is, ſuch as hath not been blended with Heretical Doctrines, as 'tis in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> would not perhaps think ſtrange at all this, or any thing of the like ſort, had my Authors to deal only with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For where-ever genuine Popery is retain'd, it is a common thing for the Prieſts to amuſe the gaping Herd with ſuch Stuff, as my Authors tell of their Saint; but it may deſerve one's Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſee Men ſo ſecurely impudent, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their Sovereigns at this rate; as if they thought it not enough to have them at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, but out of meer Wantonneſs they muſt needs let the World ſee, how they can divert themſelves at the Expence of Crown'd Heads: and certainly, if there be any thing of Truth in their Reports, it muſt move any Man's Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſee what uſe they make of the pious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of a well-diſpos'd, but miſguided Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But by this time, I fear, the Reader may ſuſpect me of miſrepreſenting them as much, as, 'tis to be hoped, they have their Queen; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to vindicate my Credit, I ſhall here tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate ſome Parts of an Addreſs made to the Queen by <hi>Padre Baltheſar Duarte,</hi> Procurator-General at the Court of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> for the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Brazil,</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:54374:65"/>
when he preſented her Majeſty with the Life of <hi>Xavier,</hi> compos'd at her Requeſt, by the famous <hi>Jeſuit, Antonio Vieira,</hi> one of the greateſt Men, by the Confeſſion of all, that ever the Society produc'd in <hi>Portugal.</hi> Such of the foregoing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as are not mentioned in this Addreſs, were taken from the Writings of <hi>Vieira</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                     <hi>MAY it pleaſe your Majeſty then to accept of your</hi> Xavier, <hi>always wholly Yours, becauſe your Majeſty is always wholly His; by ſuch a new and admirable Tranſmigration of</hi> Xavier'<hi>s Soul into your Majeſty, and your Majeſty's Soul into</hi> Xavier, <hi>that your very Names are confounded; inſomuch, that at the Name of</hi> Xavier, <hi>People are in doubt, who is meant, whether it be the Apoſtle of the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>or the Queen of</hi> Portugal; <hi>this is certain, that the ſame Species do mutually excite the Memory of both Names with ſuch a never-failing Connexion, that none can think of your Majeſty, but muſt remember</hi> Xavier: <hi>Hence it was, that ſome Months ago, a Publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary being to write the moſt Auguſt Name of your Majeſty, by a happy and pleaſing Miſtake, inſtead of</hi> Iſabel, <hi>put</hi> Xavier. <hi>The Credit of that Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, would certainly be called in queſtion in After-Ages, were not all the World acquainted of your Majeſty's amorous Tranſmigration into</hi> Xavier, <hi>which at all times will put it out of doubt, that</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Sophia Iſabel, <hi>and</hi> Maria Sophia Xavier, <hi>ſtand for one and the ſame Perſon: And ſo your Majeſty was pleas'd to have the Name ſettled upon you by a Publick Deed, which you were before poſſeſs'd of, and lawfully entitled to by Right of Preſcription, and that not without Conſent of its former Owner.</hi>

                     <hi>What ſhall I ſay to the great variety and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Honours, that your Majeſty beſtows on</hi> Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier? <hi>Your Love never ſhews it ſelf ſo ingenious, as in contriving for him ſome new Methods of Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The vaſt diſtance of Sea and Land, will not permit that you preſent your ſelf as a Royal Pilgrim at his Sepulcher, tho' your Heart is ſo much ſet upon it, that you would do it, if 'twere poſſible, were it with the Peril of your Life. But your Royal Bounty has reach'd where your Perſon cannot come, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty having ſent your</hi> Xavier, <hi>as a Token of your Love, a moſt coſtly Suit of Sacerdotal Veſtments; wherewith, he being ſtill alive after Death, may cloath himſelf in ſuch a glorious manner, as becomes one that triumphs over Mortality; Sacerdotal Veſtments, I ſay, as to one, that is free from Corruption, white, as to a Confeſſor, embroidered with Red, as to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of Love; and that there ſhould not want Symbols of your Fervour, and pure Affection, ſhining with the Fire of Gold, and Snow of Pearls; I believe,</hi> Xavier, <hi>on that Day when dreſs'd up in all his Finery, ſhew'd himſelf to the whole Court of Heaven, telling every Saint with a holy Vanity:</hi> His me veſtibus Cliens mea Luſitaniae Regina contexit. <hi>Nor were you content to cloath your Saint in divers Colours, but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54374:66"/>
you wore your ſelf the Colours of your Saint: For we know that you made a Vow, That for the ſpace of a Year you would wear no Silks of any other Colour, but that wherewith the Sun of the</hi> Eaſt, (Xavier) <hi>while he ſuffer'd the Eclipſe of a mortal Body, mortified and conceal'd the Rays of his Vertue, to accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Miſeries of this Life; only you would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a mixture of While, as a Signal of the Virginal Soul of</hi> Xavier, <hi>and your Majeſty.</hi>

At one of thoſe Conferences, wherein two Religious bore a part,</hi> Xavier <hi>being of courſe the Subject, your Majeſty juſt having done Reading the prodigious Cure
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54374:66"/>
that a few Years ago was wrought in a moment, by the Hand of this</hi> Wonder-worker <hi>of the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>upon</hi> Anna Maria Zambrina, <hi>a</hi> Roman <hi>Matron, your Majeſty full of interiour Delight and Conſolation, being deſirous to communicate the Matter, began the Story again, and read it over from beginning to end, tho' it took up a full Hour; and that not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being cloy'd and tired, but without ſo much as pauſing, unleſs it was when your Majeſty from time to time was interrupted by your amorous Sighs; and by theſe you enkindled the like Flame in your Hearers, inſomuch, that they could ſcarce refrain from Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I believe that this was the first time, that the Humble</hi> Xavier <hi>was pleas'd with his own Praiſes; and that he was pleas'd with them now, becauſe they came from the Mouth of your Majeſty.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Your Majeſty, like a moſt pious Mother, hath by the impoſition of ſo beloved a Name, inſtilled the ſame Love into each of your Sons, our moſt Serene Princes, who both of them imitate you ſo happily therein, that ſcarce any Voice came from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could Liſp out</hi> their Mothers Saint, <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Xavier, <hi>and even then they could diſtinguiſh his Image from among the reſt, accuſtoming themſelves to the Veneration of it by a thouſand innocent Kiſſes. I paſs by the Concern of the reſt of your Houſe and Family, who find that their Emulation and Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioc of this your Royal Piety, is the only way to pleaſe their Miſtreſs, and gain her Favour; and indeed, it is commonly reported about the Court and City, that in order to ſucceed in any Buſineſs with Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, there is no Interceſſor like</hi> Xavier.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A love ſo great could not well be contained in one City: It has already paſs'd the</hi> Tagus, <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty having choſen</hi> Beja <hi>for the Theatre of your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, where mov'd partly by your Zeal, partly by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54374:67"/>
the pious deſires of the Inhabitants, you have rais'd a magnificent Houſe to the Honour of</hi> your Saint, <hi>built and endow'd at your own Charges. But why ſhould I ſay, that one City is too narrow for your Love to</hi> Xavier, <hi>when it cannot be confin'd within the limits of a whole Kingdom? What Court is there among the greateſt of</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>wherein your Majeſty</hi> (I ſpeak your own Words) <hi>hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd the ſweet and powerful Patronage of this lovely Saint? Witneſs</hi> Vienna <hi>in</hi> Auſtria, Madrid <hi>in</hi> Spain, Warſaw <hi>in</hi> Poland, Parma <hi>in</hi> Italy; <hi>and laſtly, all</hi> Germany, <hi>a Country that's proud that it can boaſt of your Majeſty's Cradle, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with the numerous Offspring of your moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Houſe; in all which places your Majeſty hath enkindled the Love of</hi> Xavier, <hi>into ſuch a Flame, that few Letters come from thence but are full of his</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums, <hi>written by ſuch as gratefully recount the Favours received from his beneficent Hand.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Your Majesty is the first, by your own Confeſſion, that is able and bound after repeated Tryals, to bear witneſs that</hi> Xavier's <hi>Love for your Majeſty is no leſs than your Majeſties Love for</hi> Xavier; <hi>and if Benefits are a ſure proof of love,</hi> Xavier <hi>hath conferred ſo many upon You, that to reckon them all, would take up a Volume; but your Majesty, no leſs grateful than devout, will not permit me to paſs them all over in ſilence, eſpecially ſince it is for the glory of</hi> Xavier <hi>to have it known, that he ſhews himſelf to be the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of them that ſerve him, and recompences the Regards they have for him with reciprocal Kindneſſes. It is then, through the kindneſs of</hi> Xavier <hi>that your Majeſty has moſt happily brought forth Three Sons one after another: This is acknowledg'd, not by me only, and the whole Kingdom, but by your Majeſty likewiſe. For you remember mighty well, what your

Prophetick Mind foreſaw, when full of Faith, amidſt the ſweeteſt Joys of your heart, you firſt receiv'd upon your Royal Head the Sacred</hi> Cap <hi>of</hi> Xavier, <hi>brought a little before from</hi> Goa; <hi>for according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt Reckoning, juſt Nine Months after your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty brought to light the firſt and wiſh'd for Heir of the Crown, the Infallibility of the Succeſs confirming the truth of the Prediction. Its true, Heav'n did of right take to it ſelf the Firſt Fruit of your Majeſties Royal Blood, but it was in order to recompence that tender Plant, cut off in the Flower, with new Fruits.</hi>

                     <hi>So it was; there ſucceeded a Second Son given by</hi> Xavier, <hi>there followed a Third, whom you owe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to</hi> Xavier, <hi>upon ſeveral accounts; A Saying of your Majeſty makes us believe that your Saint had made you a Promiſe of him, and had given you his Word upon it in Private; for a great while before, you had affirmed without the leaſt ſign of Doubt, that e'er the Ten Weeks were ended, the</hi> Fridays <hi>whereof you had conſecrated to</hi> Xavier, <hi>you ſhould conceive a Son the Third time, the Event prov'd the Truth of this Prediction likewiſe.</hi>

                  <p>But the Reader, I ſuppoſe, may by this time, be as weary as my ſelf, of this High-flown Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, I ſhall therefore paſs over a great many of his Compliments, and come to his Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To conclude, for it is now time, I ſhall end where I began. May your Majeſty receive your</hi> Xavier, <hi>wholly yours, becauſe as your Majesty has entirely devoted your ſelf to the ſervice of</hi> Xavier, <hi>ſo he makes it his whole buſineſs to become ſerviceable to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty. There is an amorous Combat between</hi> Xavier <hi>and your Majesty. Your Majeſty ſtrives to overcome him by your Obſequiouſneſs, and he fights with your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty by his Kindneſſes; But the Event is always to the advantage both of the one and the other Party; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54374:68"/>
as well as the conquered; for Love is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways triumphant on both ſides. That Laureat Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant doth foment the War in ſuch ſort, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Battels between</hi> Xavier <hi>and your Majesty, that he fastens your Majesty to</hi> Xavier, <hi>and</hi> Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier <hi>to your Majesty, like fortunate Priſoners by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble Bonds in the Centre of Divine Love.</hi> I think I have tranſlated this Period right, and ſo it is the Reader's buſineſs to make ſenſe of it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Panegyrick</hi> ends with a ſmall Requeſt, as the Orator calls it, <hi>That her Majesty would pleaſe to continue her Favours to the Jeſuits of the Province of</hi> Brazil, <hi>and take them into her Maternal Care and Protection, for the obtaining of which Request he thinks no ſolicitation can prove ſo effectual as that of the ſame</hi> Xavier.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The World hath been ſo much prejudic'd in Favour of the Jeſuits, on account of the great Parts and Learning for which ſome Leading Men among them have always been eminent ſince the Foundation of the Society, that People will hardly be perſwaded, that all theſe Fooleries can come Naturally and Innocently from them. Yet it may be ſaid in their Favour on the other ſide, that they are not obſerv'd to ſmile in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Faces when they meet in the Streets; were all this deſign'd for meer Banter, one wou'd think it were impoſſible for them to hold their Countenances: But were we to judge of them by their Looks, which are the moſt demure that I ever ſaw, they muſt be thought to be in Earneſt. But whatever it be that puts them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on treating their Queen in ſo extravagant a manner, whether it be their Folly or their Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54374:68"/>
or perhaps a Mixture of both; for theſe two go frequently in Conjunction; this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that their Libels have fail'd of the effect which they might have had in regard to any other Perſon; for the great Eſteem which this Princeſs had gain'd by her many ſignal Vertues, is ſo deeply rooted in Peoples Minds, that it is not in the power of any Jeſuit to leſſen it. This appear'd by the great Conſternation her Subjects were in upon her Sickneſs, and the general La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation that was every where heard among them at her Death. And theſe Teſtimonies of the Great Value that all had for her, were no where ſo remarkable as in the Palace where her Majeſty was beſt known. Letters come lately from <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſay, That one of her Ladies died in two or three days after her for meer Grief; That the Queen Dowager of <hi>England</hi> was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable; That the King never went to Bed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of her Sickneſs, but lay on a Piece of Cork in the ſame Chamber; That his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, while the Corps was carried away, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Paſſion in ſuch a manner, as is not to be deſcribed, it being ſo violent, that neither the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> nor any other Perſon could pacific him. It is ſaid likewiſe, That the Cardinal Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop did many Penances in her Majeſties behalf, but none ſurely ſo ſevere as thoſe perform'd by the King himſelf: The Publick hath had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count already, how that his Majeſty went one Night Bare-foot quite up to <hi>Noſſra Senhora da Graça,</hi> which ſtands upon a ſteep Hill at the furtheſt end of the Town; but theſe Letters add, That he went in the ſame manner no leſs than Nine times to the Cathedral Church, that is at a conſiderable Diſtance from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54374:69"/>
and ſome part of the way very Rugged; and that all the little Princes were carried in a Coach, without their Shoes and Stockins to St. <hi>Roques</hi> the Jeſuits Church where <hi>Xavier</hi> ſtands, and when they came near the Church, went a little way upon their bare Feet; and having ſaid their Prayers for their Mother, return'd upon their bare Feet to the Coach again.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe Paſſages may perhaps, ſeem a little odd to ſuch as are unacquainted with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Cuſtoms; but then all muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they ſet forth the Praiſes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Princeſs, in a manner, by much, more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and lively than the Jeſuites could have done by all their forced ſtrains of Eloquence, ſuppoſing they had ſet themſelves in earneſt to make her <hi>Panegyrick;</hi> for this ſo great and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a Concern for her, ſo variouſly expreſs'd, as it was, demonſtrates how well ſhe had acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her ſelf towards all People, according to the ſeveral relations ſhe had to them; it ſhews how good a Queen, a Friend and Miſtreſs ſhe was, and proves her to have been a moſt Endearing Wife, and a Tender Mother.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HER Majeſty being now, to the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of our Nation, become a moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Part of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Court, this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count wou'd appear but lame, and be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective than it is, ſhould I forbear to mention her: I have great Reaſon to believe, that my Country-men wou'd think the Omiſſion unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, finding them ſo very inquiſitive as they are, concerning her; the firſt Queſtion they put to ſuch as come from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to which Satisfaction is moſt earneſtly deſired, being commonly concerning their Queen-Dowager. But her Majeſty's Character is ſo well known to the World already, that I ſhall not attempt it here. To tell of her moſt exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Piety, wou'd be no News in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> much leſs in <hi>England;</hi> and it is needleſs to ſay, that it is now the moſt diſtinguiſhing part of her Character: For it was ſo, while ſhe Reign'd in one of the firſt Courts of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and none will ſuppoſe her Majeſty to be alter'd in this reſpect now, in the time of her Retirement. It did then, as it does ſtill, give forth ſo bright a Luſtre, as to out-ſhine, by far, all the reſt of her great Perfections; which yet, as thoſe who are competent Judges, and have the Honour to be near her Perſon, affirm, are ſuch as would be highly admired in any other Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:54374:70"/>
But tho' her Majeſty be her ſelf the ſame, her outward Circumſtances are ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, ſince her leaving <hi>England;</hi> her Court is leſſen'd almoſt to a private Family, thoſe few Perſons that waited on her from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the moſt part, either diſmiſs'd with their Salaries continued to them, or excus'd their Attendance; there is now no Noiſe, nor Oſtentation of Grandeur about her Houſe, but all things are quiet and ſtill, except it be on Days of Ceremony, when Perſons of Quality Will be coming to expreſs the great Veneration they have for her; then, indeed, her Court is as great, and full, as the Nobility of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can make it.</p>
               <p>At all other times ſhe convinces the World, that the Formalities of Pomp and State are not inſeparable from Majeſty; and that true Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inſtead of being ſet off by ſuch Helps, appears to the beſt Advantage without them. But the Queen had, doubtleſs, a Nobler End ſtill, in getting Rid of thoſe Incumbrances; there being great cauſe to believe, that it has been all along the chief Deſire of her Heart, to be at Eaſe and Liberty, that nothing might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her from enjoying her ſelf, as ſhe now does, at her Devotions.</p>
               <p>Some ſpeak of it as a conſiderable Alteration about her Majeſty, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are become her Directors; whereas before, ſhe conferr'd that Truſt on thoſe of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Order: But her Majeſty is not of a Character to be uſed by thoſe Fathers, as others may have been. 'Tis ſaid, indeed, that they have taſted of her Liberality in a moſt plentiful manner; but as great as their Profits are, the Credit they have
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54374:70"/>
got, by being favour'd by ſo diſcerning a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, is certainly much greater, ſince ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppos'd to have any Worldly Deſigns to employ them in: For my part, I take this Honour to be the greateſt that ever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd on the Society; and that by this mention of it, I have more than made Amends for any thing I have ſaid, or may ſay, to their Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

               </head>
               <p>DOna <hi>Iſabel Luiſa, Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was born the Sixth of <hi>January,</hi> 1669; ſworn Princeſs, or Heireſs to the Crown, in 1680; died the Twenty-firſt of <hi>October,</hi> 1690. This Princeſs was accounted one of the moſt Beautiful and Accompliſh'd Perſons, of her Sex and Rank, in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and that not only by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi> who admired her almoſt to Adoration, but by more impartial Strangers, ſuch eſpecially as bore a Publick Character, who had frequent Opportunities to ſatisfie themſelves, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Eſteem the World had for her, was not without ground: For which Reaſon, and for the Proſpect there was of her ſucceeding to the Crown ('till after the King's Second Marriage) ſhe was ſought for in Marriage by moſt of the Princes, and among the reſt, by ſome of the moſt conſiderable Monarchs in <hi>Europe;</hi> as indeed there is none ſo great, but might have accounted it a very advantageous Match.</p>
               <p>The firſt that pretended to this Princeſs, at leaſt with any ſucceſs, was <hi>Victor Amedee,</hi> the preſent Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Couſin-German to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta Madame Royale</hi> his Mother; <hi>Marie Jeane Baptist de Savoie,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Nemours,</hi> being Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Queen of <hi>Portugal:</hi> His Pretenſions ſucceeded ſo well, that in the Year 1680, a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was treated, and ſoon agreed upon, and nothing ſeem'd wanting to the final Concluſion,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54374:71"/>
but the coming of the Duke to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> according to Agreement.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſs to give what Account I can of this Match, as how it came on, and was unexpectedly broke off, it being no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Part of the Hiſtory of this Age.</p>
               <p>It may eaſily be ſuppoſed, that it was at firſt contrived between the two Mothers; for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might have proved to others, it afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very advantageous Proſpect to each of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madame Royale</hi> had been left ſole Regent of <hi>Savoy,</hi> during her Son's Minority, by her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> at his Death in 1675: But the young Duke entring at this time upon his 15th Year, had a little before been declared Major; and therefore, ſhould he have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf the Government, her Authority was like to ſuffer no ſmall diminution; nor was there any ſo likely an Expedient to continue the Power in her Hands, as the Duke's being ſent away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Portugal;</hi> the Deſire of Rule, together with the Ambition of becoming Mother of a King, might make this Princeſs give a liſtning Ear to her Siſter's Propoſals. The Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for her part, as ſhe had a great hand in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of his preſent Majeſty, ſo ſhe had a great ſhare with him in the Government; but her Power was not like to continue ſo great, ſhould a ſtrange Prince be admitted into Court, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in caſe any thing ſhould befal the King; but by this Marriage between her Nephew and her Daughter, ſhe ſecured her Authority, and took the beſt Meaſures to eſtabliſh it, both for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and againſt the time to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:54374:72"/>
Theſe may be ſuppoſed to have been ſufficient Inducements on both ſides, for the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to deſire a Match between their Children; and conſidering the great Power that each of them were poſſeſs'd of in their reſpective Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, one would think there was no need of the Intervention of any others to bring the ſame about: But ſome will needs bring the <hi>French</hi> in upon the Stage; for in this latter Age, there muſt nothing of moment be done in any Court of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but what they have a hand in. The Match, indeed, was for the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and that ſeems to be a great Argument why they ſhould not be wholly unconcern'd in the Matter.</p>
               <p>'Tis pretended, that it was concerted by the Cardinal <hi>d'Eſtrees,</hi> who paſſed the Mountains that Year, on pretence of accommodating Differences between the Courts of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> but in reality, to negotiate the Affairs of his King with the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, having a particular Command to call at <hi>Turin,</hi> in order, as'tis ſaid, to propoſe this Marriage, he being thought the fitteſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſerve his Maſter in this Affair, as he was a Relation to the Parties, and highly eſteem'd by the Ducheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and obliged for the Purple to the Queen of <hi>Portugal;</hi> ſo that whatever came from him, might be look'd upon as deſign'd only for the Good of the Family. To make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal more acceptable to the Ducheſs, 'tis ſaid he was Commiſſioned, to aſſure her of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>France,</hi> to maintain her in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
               <p>'Tis pretended, that the <hi>French</hi> had before la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured all they could, to get the <hi>Infanta</hi> for the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54374:72"/>
expected with her, being conſiderable in it ſelf, and might be a means to promote their further Deſigns; for ever ſince their King's Marriage, they have all along had an Eye to the now ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much talk'd of, Succeſſion of <hi>Spain;</hi> but being fruſtrated of their firſt Deſign, by the prevailing Intereſts of other Princes, that were concern'd to obſtruct them in it, thair next Buſineſs was to defeat the hopes which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in favour of their King, or the Pretenſions of any other Prince, in dependance on that Crown: To bring this about, they thought it the beſt way to ſet up one, that ſhould either be dependant on themſelves, or whom they might eaſily deal with as they pleaſed; and none was found ſo fit for their purpoſe, as his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Savoy.</hi> It is ſaid likewiſe, that there was a further Reaſon for their ſetting up the Duke, he having Pretenſions next to the <hi>German</hi> Branch, to the Succeſſion of <hi>Spain,</hi> both as being deſcended from <hi>Donna Catharina,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second; and alſo, by Virtue of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth's laſt Will. If the Duke were once ſettled in <hi>Portugal,</hi> they thought they might ſerve themſelves of him, to hinder the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> from falling to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> hoping to get him preferred before them, partly by their Intrigues at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and partly by Force of Arms; and the Duke, on this Condition, might eaſily be brought to put <hi>France</hi> again in poſſeſſion of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre;</hi> and, perhaps, be outed of <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, whenever King <hi>Louis</hi> ſhould pleaſe to diſpoſſeſs him; or, at leaſt, be obliged by ſome Treaty, to yield up <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:54374:73"/>
But theſe Deſigns ſeem to have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remote; there are others aſcrib'd to the <hi>French</hi> on this occaſion, that had a nearer regard to their preſent Intereſt.</p>
               <p>It was thought, that the ſending away of the Duke would cauſe ſuch Diſcontent among his Subjects, that the Ducheſs-Regent muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſeek Protection from <hi>France,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her Country lie expoſed to their Diſcretion. The <hi>French,</hi> during the preceding War, had found it much to their Prejudice, that none of their Artifices could prevail with her to declare for their Party; or in any point to recede from that exact Neutrality, which from her firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Government ſhe had firmly reſolv'd to obſerve; by this means the Duke's Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons became a kind of Barrier to the State of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> which otherwiſe had lain continually expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to their Inſults; and that which nettled them the more, was, the Princeſs-Regent was born their Subject, and as they had flattered themſelves, was <hi>French,</hi> as well by Inclination as Birth; but notwithſtanding all this, by her conſtant adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the true Intereſts of the Duke her Son, and by the admirable Dexterity and Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Giovinazzo,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, reſiding at <hi>Turin,</hi> they found all their Attempts to be vain, and their Meaſures broken. But the Difficulties they had met with, ſeem'd to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them more in the Proſecution of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; wherefore at the Concluſion of the Peace, they were reſolved at any rate, to ſecure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an Inroad into <hi>Italy,</hi> againſt the next War, to get, if it were poſſible, the poſſeſſion of <hi>Caſai,</hi> and bring <hi>Savoy</hi> into their dependency. How they ſucceeded in the former Attempt, it is not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54374:73"/>
my Buſineſs to enquire; but it ſeems, they found at laſt the true Forible of the Parties they had to deal with; the Love of Money being that poor Prince, the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s reigning Paſſion, as Deſire of Rule was <hi>Madame Royale</hi>'s. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all other Attempts had proved ineffectual, the Continuance of her Regency ſeem'd an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable Temptation; tho' at the ſame time, there was little likelihood of her being able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her ſelf therein, without the Protection of <hi>France;</hi> and it is ſuppoſed, that both theſe were offer'd her, when Cardinal <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> came to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to her the Marriage.</p>
               <p>But whoſoever were the Contrivers of this Match, or whatſoever were the Motives it was made on, it was once in that great forwardneſs, that none doubted of its taking effect; great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were made at <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Turin,</hi> againſt the time when it was to be celebrated, and all things were in readineſs; the <hi>Cortes</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> were called, to acknowledge the <hi>Infanta</hi> Heireſs of the Crown, and to diſpenſe with the Laws of <hi>Lamego</hi> in her favour; theſe Laws are the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Conſtitutions of the Government, and have the ſame force in <hi>Portugal,</hi> as the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Salique</hi> Laws have in <hi>France;</hi> by one of them a Daughter of <hi>Portugal</hi> is deprived of all Right of ſucceeding to the Crown, in caſe ſhe marries with a Foreigner. The Duke had ſent his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to be ready for him againſt his Arrival; where a Squadron of Men of War were equipp'd out, on purpoſe to fetch his Royal Highneſs; the Ships were the moſt finely rigg'd, and adorn'd, of any perhaps that have appear'd in the Ocean for ſome Ages: The Admiral, on which his Royal Highneſs was to imbark, beſides the immenſe Treaſures that were laid out on the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54374:74"/>
in-ſide, was, above Water, all over doubly guilt on the out-ſide, and from thence had the Name given her of the <hi>Monte de Ouro.</hi> I am afraid to tell how vaſt a Sum was ſaid to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the bare Guilding; but I know, that after the Ship had lain rotting in the River for many Years, a certain Chymiſt had the Aſſurance to engage himſelf to the Court, to make a very conſiderable quantity of Gold of the very out-ſide Scrapings; and the Court was perſwaded to employ him when the Ship was broken up; for ſhe never made but that one Voyage. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> Nobility were, or ſeem'd at leaſt to be, ſo over-joy'd at the Match, and impatient to be making their Court to their new Prince, that moſt of them would needs be of the Voyage. The Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> at their Head, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Admiral of the Fleet, all of them ſtriving who ſhould be moſt profuſe in enriching the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ships they went upon; inſomuch, that as I have heard, ſome have ſcarce recovered their Eſtates to this Day.</p>
               <p>While theſe Preparations were making at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> and the Fleet ready to ſet Sail, things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to have another Face at <hi>Turin:</hi> For the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> were not ſo well ſatisfied as thoſe of <hi>Portugal;</hi> they ſaw, or thought at leaſt they ſaw more clearly into the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns: For preſently upon Declaration of the Marriage, there aroſe a vehement Preſumption among them, that this ſending away of the Duke out of the Country, accompany'd, as he was to be, by his principal Miniſters, was meerly a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of <hi>France;</hi> partly, to impoveriſh them, by the vaſt Expences they ſhould be at on this occaſion; but chiefly to take their Advantage
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54374:74"/>
from the Abſence of the Prince and his Council, in order to get his Dominions into their Power. Upon this they began to Cabal among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and give the Ducheſs to underſtand, how prejudicial they thought this Marriage, made without their Knowledge, might prove to their Prince, and the State; the Duke, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, being to be convey'd away on Deſign only, that they ſhould be expos'd to the Mercy of the <hi>French.</hi> The Ducheſs was a Princeſs of that Penetration, that ſhe foreſaw well enough, that this would in ſome meaſure be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Match; but then ſhould it be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, her Reign was in all likelihood drawing towards an end; and this melancholy Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made her give a liſtning Ear to the <hi>French</hi> Offers of Aſſiſtance; for they ſeem'd to be no leſs alarm'd than her Highneſs, at this Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nobility; whereupon their Troops were ſet a marching towards the Frontiers; the Ducheſs in the mean time getting together what Forces ſhe could, on pretence of preventing any Deſign they might have upon <hi>Caſal;</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> had by this time, ſtrook up an under-hand Bargain, tho' it was ſome time after, that the <hi>French</hi> were put in poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>But at <hi>Lisbon</hi> all things went ſmoothly on, where a Publick Proceſſion was made about the City, by way of Thankſgiving, for the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Marriage, and to obtain a good Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Fleet: But an unlucky Accident fell out at this Proceſſion, that put ſome of the wiſer Heads a conſidering, for they did not well know what to think on't, In theſe Feſtival Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> St. <hi>George</hi> makes a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Figure, being a fat burly Image, dreſs'd
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54374:75"/>
up, as I take it, in the Habit worn by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> at the time of the Saint's firſt coming into the Country. He was brought into Requeſt here, as ſome think, by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt;</hi> others are of Opinion, that <hi>Edmund de Langley,</hi> then Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> brought him in a little before; but about their time it was, that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to call upon St. <hi>George</hi> in their Battles, inſtead of St. <hi>Jago;</hi> and ever ſince he has been the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Kingdom, and hath had his place in the Proceſſions accordingly; wherein He, whilſt other <hi>Saints</hi> are carried upon <hi>Pageants,</hi> rides on a Horſe that is kept on purpoſe for him, a Boy for his Page following on another Horſe to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Lance: As the Proceſſion was entring the <hi>Rocio,</hi> the largeſt Square in the City, St. <hi>George</hi>'s Horſe chanc'd to ſtumble, and down fell the Saint in the Preſence of all the People; a Diſaſter, which as the Inquiſitive into theſe Matters have ſince found, had never happened before that Day. Upon the Fall of the Saint, an obſerving Perſon made this Remark, and for it ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by a very grave and learned Author: <hi>This Proceſſion is no Proceſſion, but a Funeral Pomp rather; the miſtaken</hi> Portugueſes, <hi>with Feſtivity and Dancings, going to bury the Male-Line of our Native Kings.</hi> And when our Fleet (ſays my Author) ſo bedaub'd with Gold without, and loaden with Diamonds and Jewels within, was ready to Sail, the ſame Perſon declared, <hi>That tho' it went ſo rich over the Bar of</hi> Lisbon, <hi>it would come home richer at its return:</hi> And being ask'd the Reaſon, he reply'd, <hi>Becauſe it will never bring hither what it goes to fetch.</hi> It has been ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated likewiſe from certain Prophecies, which I may ſpeak ſomething of in their due place,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54374:75"/>
that 'twas impoſſible this Marriage ſhould ever take effect. But theſe were then the private Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of contemplative Perſons, who were not much heeded at that time, when nothing elſe was minded but Publick Rejoicings, and Preparations for the Bridegroom's Reception, and Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Complements to the Bride.</p>
               <p>But at <hi>Turin,</hi> a little before the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleet arrived at <hi>Nizza,</hi> the <hi>Savoyard</hi> Nobility, inſtead of being frighted into a Compliance by the Motions of the <hi>French</hi> Troops on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, were but made thereby more ſenſible of their Danger, and therefore they impatiently waited for an Opportunity to impart their Minds to the Duke himſelf; and this, by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the Ducheſs gave 'em, by her retiring to a Country-Houſe near the Town; they taking the advantage of her Abſence, repreſent to his <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> how much it imported him to conſider, That he was little better than a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whilſt his Dominions were ſurrounded with the <hi>French</hi> Troops on every ſide: That the Ducheſs had ſo concerted Matters with King <hi>Louis,</hi> that his Highneſs's beſt places were to be put in that King's Hands, as ſoon as he ſhould embark for <hi>Portugal:</hi> That ſhe was ſending him to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> not that he might Reign there, but that ſhe might Reign in <hi>Savoy:</hi> That he muſt not think to act as a Sovereign in <hi>Portugal,</hi> whilſt the Prince and the Queen liv'd; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was not for his Intereſt, to be kept in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection there, when he might ſtay at Home and Command them, as his moſt Dutiful Subjects: That the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> bore a mortal Hatred to Strangers, and had not conſented to this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage but by Compulſion; and would ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54374:76"/>
to be of another Mind, at the Death of the Prince-Regent, and might ſerve him as they had done the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> that is, deprive him of the Crown; in which Caſe he was like to be turn'd out of all: For the <hi>French,</hi> during his Abſence, would be ſure to make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and it would be a hard Matter to get them into the Humour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it.</p>
               <p>This Language we may be ſure ſounded very harſh in the Ears of the young Duke, who had hitherto been bred up among the Women, whoſe Grand Concern it was, to take care that nothing ſhould put him out of Humour. When his Fright was a little over, he began to ask them, <hi>What Help there was to prevent all theſe Miſchiefs?</hi> They told him roundly, That <hi>there was no other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but to ſign an Order to Arrest his Mother.</hi> This Propoſal went to the very Heart of him; but they aſſuring him, that he muſt reſolve upon it, and that preſently, if he ever hoped to live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, or prevent his own Ruin; he at laſt, tho' with Tears in his Eyes, ſign'd the Order they deſired. While they were getting all things ready for putting the ſame in execution, the Ducheſs, who as yet had heard nothing of the Matter, returns from the Country; but it was not long before ſhe diſcovered the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: For as ſoon as ſhe alighted from her Coach, ſhe went directly to the Duke's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where ſhe found the poor Prince penſive and melancholy, and ſcarce able to look his Mother in the Face; ſhe, ſurpriz'd at this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began to careſs the Child, and enquire what the Matter was: He, for ſome time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of anſwering her, fell a crying; but ſhe,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54374:76"/>
reſolv'd to know the Buſineſs, careſſed him ſo long, 'till ſhe got it out of him; ſo, at laſt, he told her all, both what he had done, and who they were that had put him upon it. The Duch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, tho' in no ſmall Aſtoniſhment at this News, had yet her Wits about her, and with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Preſence of Mind, ordered the Guards about the Court to be doubled, got the principal of them that had plotted her Impriſonment to be Arreſted, and to bring over the People on her ſide, gave out, That <hi>the Priſoners, and their Accomplices, had conſpired to ſeize upon the Duke's Perſon, in order to deliver him up to the</hi> Spaniards. In the mean while, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleet, under Command of the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> arrives at <hi>Nizza;</hi> but it ſeems, the Ducheſs, tho' ſhe had provided for her preſent Security, began to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from this Mutiny of the Nobility, that ſhe was like to have but an uneaſie Government of it; and that ſhe ſhould be forced to a greater Dependance upon <hi>France,</hi> and be more at their Diſcretion, than ſhe had at firſt imagined; which might render her Authority much more precarious, than if the Duke her Son remain'd in the Country; wherefore ſhe found it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that his Highneſs ſhould be very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd, during the ſtay of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> and not in a Condition to go on Board: So that the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> with the reſt of the <hi>Fidalgo's,</hi> were forced to return as they came; how well pleas'd at their Diſappointment, let the Reader imagine. Preſently upon their Departure, the Duke recovered of his Indiſpoſition, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were never proſecuted for their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Plot; which makes ſome People to be of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that this Commotion of the Nobility was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54374:77"/>
from the very beginning contriv'd by the Duch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs her ſelf, who preſently after the Concluſion of the Match, might begin to conſider the ill Conſequences likely to enſue upon it, which may have made her reſolve to break it; but wanting a plauſible Excuſe to ſtop the Mouths of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> by her ſecret Intrigues caus'd all this Buſtle, in order only to caſt Duſt in their Eyes. But howſoever this was, the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> when they came to themſelves, eſpecially after their King's Second Marriage, were as well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the breaking off of the Match, as the <hi>Savoyards</hi> could be, ſo that in Concluſion the <hi>French</hi> remain'd the only Duppes, who thought to have impoſed upon them both. This is the moſt tolerable Account that is given of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Affair; for ſuch it is ſtill confeſs'd to be, by thoſe that have penetrated the deepeſt into it. The World, tho' moſt of the foregoing Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars were publickly diſcourſed of at the time, continuing ſtill to wonder, how it came to paſs, that the court of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould thus unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart from a moſt ſolemn Engagement; for his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> was then ſo very young, that he did nothing of his own Head, he was meerly paſſive all the while; indeed had this Affair been of a later Date, and tranſacted ſome Years after the Duke came of Age, and had appear'd upon the Publick Stage to act for himſelf, the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in all probability would not have been ſo great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly, Louis</hi> the Fourteenth, King of <hi>France,</hi> his Pretenſions to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> were the Publick Talk, and not without ſome Grounds, after the Death of his Queen, <hi>Donna Maria Thereſa de
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54374:77"/>
Auſtria,</hi> who departed this Life in 1683. This Match muſt have been very advantageous to that King, if for no other Reaſon than that it would give him Footing in <hi>Portugal;</hi> by which means it would be more eaſie for him to ſeize upon the reſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the Catholick King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; and 'tis not doubted, but there were ſome Overtures made by the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> tho' not in ſo vigorous a manner as to give occaſion to the Report that went current a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> it being commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by that People, that his <hi>Most Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> had ſo violent a Paſſion for their <hi>Infanta,</hi> that he was coming to fetch her away by force of Arms: For, on the contrary, it was obſerved at the Court of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> were not ſo warm in this Negotiation, as to oblige them to come to a Reſolution, or give any poſitive Anſwer; which perhaps proceeded from that King's prudent Conſideration, that this was an Affair wherein he was like to be oppos'd, either openly or under-hand, by all Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> and perhaps moſt of all by the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who do not ſeem over-deſirous to come under the <hi>French</hi> Government; this might make him loth to run the hazard of being deny'd: For which Reaſon perhaps it was, that his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Partiſans at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſeem'd to do little more than feel the Pulſe of that Court, without directly putting the Queſtion; or if they went ſo far, they ſuffered themſelves to be put off with very ſlender Excuſes; if it be true, as 'tis report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Court of <hi>Portugal</hi> deſired time to conſider, 'till <hi>France</hi> had fully concluded the Peace with <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and deferr'd gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Anſwer, on account of the Death of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54374:78"/>
King of <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> hapning about the ſame time: But the Death of that poor Priſoner, made little or no alteration in the Publick Affairs, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in what related to the <hi>Infanta;</hi> ſo that theſe Excuſes only ſhew'd, that the Court of <hi>Portugal</hi> was wholly averſe to the Match, and the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, as it was but coldly carried on, ſo in a ſhort time it came to nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> The Prince of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was another Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, and the Match with him ſeem'd once to be in great forwardneſs; but it was broke off at laſt, as it is ſaid, by the Grand Duke's inſiſting, That in caſe his Eldeſt Son had Iſſue by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Children of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſhould ſucceeed only to that Crown, and his Eſtates in <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould be ſettled upon his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, Prince <hi>John Gaſton;</hi> but this the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> Court could not be brought to agree to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly, Charles</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after that King became a Widdower, the Princeſs of <hi>Portugal</hi> had a great Party in his Council, who were for having her to ſupply the place of the deceaſed Queen; and for ſome time there appeared but one Rival in competition with her, <hi>viz.</hi> the Princeſs of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> againſt whom ſhe carried it clearly: For <hi>Spain</hi> could propoſe to it ſelf no greater Advantage from the Marriage of that Princeſs, than a ſmall Sum of Money; ſmall, I mean, in reſpect to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of that Crown; which are ſuch, that all the Great Duke, Rich as he is, could give with his Daughter, would go but a little way to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them: Whereas the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54374:78"/>
the hopes that a Marriage with her might prove an Engagement upon the King her Father to enter into the Alliance, that was then form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the <hi>French,</hi> was like to bring along with her a further Proſpect of Re-uniting <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy: For tho' the King her Father was now married again, and the Queen big with Child a Second-time; yet it was the general Opinion then, that none of King <hi>Peter</hi>'s future Iſſue would be long-liv'd. But the great Concern at <hi>Madrid,</hi> being to procure for his <hi>Catholick Majeſty,</hi> a Princeſs that might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Succeſſion, and ſo prevent the Diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Monarchy; and there being none in <hi>Europe</hi> ſo promiſing in that reſpect, as the Houſe of <hi>Nieuburg,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Mariana</hi> was for that Reaſon preferred to the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> The <hi>Electoral Prince Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who ſucceeded ſo well in his Pretenſions, that a Marriage was in a manner concluded on; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it was once thought, the ſame Fleet which carried his Siſter to <hi>Spain,</hi> would return with his intended Spouſe. But this Match like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was broken off on a ſudden, I know not how; but the Blame is laid wholly on the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> Miniſters: And ſuch as pretend to be well acquainted with the Affairs of this Court, reckon the Miſcarriage among the greateſt Bevues they are charged with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6thly,</hi> The <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> This Prince is ſaid to have been the firſt that was propoſed to the <hi>Infanta;</hi> and that <hi>France</hi> did its utmoſt in his behalf, before either his Marriage with the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54374:79"/>
Princeſs of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was ever thought on; that is to ſay, before the <hi>Infanta</hi> was yet marriageable: So that it ſeems, they reſolv'd to ſecure her, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to themſelves, ſhe being at that time look'd upon by all, as the undoubted Heireſs of the Crown, her Mother being then living, and in no hopes of any other Iſſue: But for the ſame reaſon, there was ſuch oppoſition made to all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures in the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s behalf, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible their Pretenſions ſhould take effect; but howſoever this was, 'tis agreed, that he was the laſt Pretender; and as his Pretenſions were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with more warmth, ſo they were more readily hearken'd to than the King his Father's: For now the Caſe was altered in <hi>Portugal,</hi> as well as in <hi>France;</hi> the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great hopes of the King's Iſſue by his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriage, as knowing perhaps the ſiniſter Opinion of the World in that reſpect to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground. Nor was the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s having three Sons at this time, any Exception againſt him, for he was ſtill an advantageous Match for an <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that was now loſing all hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the Throne, and much to be preferr'd to an Elector of the Empire, eſpecially one outed of his Dominions, and reduced to ſo low an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate as the <hi>Palatine</hi> was at that time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Match was ſaid to be in as great a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs as any of the former. I have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly inform'd, that the King us'd to conſole the <hi>Infanta,</hi> during her Illneſs, with the Hopes of its happy Concluſion. But it was then too late, this Princeſs having been ſo often fruſtrated in her Expectations, was not, as we may well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, over forward to entertain hopes of this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54374:79"/>
kind; this Match could not be more ſincerely deſign'd than ſome of the former had been, and therefore was as liable to be broken off as the reſt were; but what the Succeſs of it would have been is uncertain, Death preventing the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s being ever diſappointed again. She departed this Life <hi>October</hi> the 21ſt, 1690, juſt a Year after the Birth of Prince <hi>John,</hi> the ſurviving eldeſt Son of the late Queen; the promiſing hopes of whoſe Life, together with the Queen's being great of another, put an end to her Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ever aſcending to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Throne; and conſequently, ſhe who had for ſeveral Years been the Idol of that Nation, muſt of courſe have had the Mortification to ſee their Zeal cool'd on a ſudden, and their Devotion directed another way, and her ſelf, no doubt, forc'd to go along with the Stream, and bear a part in the Publick Rejoicings, and Congratulations, for the cauſe of her Excluſion. <hi>Portugal,</hi> which from her very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy ſhe had been taught to call her own, being now become another's, was but an uneaſie place for her; and the rather, becauſe ſhe began to think herſelf confin'd to it, and to loſe all hopes of Reigning elſewhere, there being now ſcarce one Throne left vacant for her, who had been ſo much contended for by almoſt all the unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Sovereigns in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> ſo that at laſt ſhe began to think of taking up with a Cell, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her Apprehenſions to thoſe that freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with her, of her being like to end her Days in a Monaſtery, thinking, perhaps, that after ſo many Miſcarriages, the Treaty then on foot was not much to be depended on.</p>
               <p>Theſe things may be ſuppoſed to have gone to the Heart of this Princeſs, ſo as to add to that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54374:80"/>
Grief and Melancholy, which, as 'tis believed, contributed to the haſtning of her end. There were malicious Reports ſpread throughout <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> ſoon after her Death, which would needs have it, that ſhe was hurried out of the World in a more violent manner. I ſhall not relate them, being well ſatisfy'd of their Untruth, after the exacteſt Enquiry I could make concerning them, they are ſuppoſed to have been firſt rais'd by the Partiſans of <hi>France,</hi> who are not wanting in their turn, to lay hold on all Occaſions to blacken their Enemies: It was for the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Intereſt, ſay they, that the Succeſſion ſhould be ſecured to the King's Children by his Second Marriage; and therefore, as they will needs have it, ſome extraordinary Means muſt have been uſed to remove the <hi>Infanta</hi> out of the way; as if the Siſter could upon any pretence diſpute the Succeſſion with her Brother: But fearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that this was not Ground ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Calumny, they have themſelves endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to give a mortal Wound to the Honour of the deceaſed Princeſs, and thereby far exceeded the Cruelty they ſuppoſe to have been ſhewn her by others. But it is a ſufficient Anſwer to all their Slanders, that ſuch impartial Perſons as are well acquainted at the Court of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That they never heard any call the Vertue of that Princeſs in queſtion; that his Majeſty had ever ſhewn himſelf a moſt tender Father, but more eſpecially as ſhe drew towards the latter End; that the Extreme Unction was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to her on the Day of her Death, in the preſence of Cardinal <hi>Dom Veriſſimo de Alemcaſtro,</hi> one had in great Veneration by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> for his great Probity and Innocency of Life,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54374:80"/>
by that Great and Noble Prelate, Dom <hi>Lewis de Souſa</hi> (now Cardinal), Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Lisbon.</hi> The hardeſt thing that had any probability in it, was reported by the <hi>French</hi> People, that had been in the Service of her Mother; who pretended, that a Coffin was brought into her Chamber, ſome Days before ſhe expired: Which, ſuppoſing the thing to be true, might be done only to put the Princeſs in mind of her approaching Death, and therefore well deſign'd, among People that are Religious in good earneſt. As for the <hi>Conde de Atouguia,</hi> whoſe Death, perhaps, was the cauſe why theſe Reports were entertain'd in the World, he was advanc'd in Years, and was a married Man, and ſo that formal Story of a Marriage, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, muſt neceſſarily be falſe. It is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, but that he was found dead one Morning in the Court of the Palace; but the Government did not think fit to make any ſtrict Enquiry by what Hand, or for what Reaſon this Nobleman fell, and therefore it becomes not private Perſons to take that Liberty.</p>

               <p>One would think, that ſo ſhort-liv'd a Prince (for he liv'd not above Seventeen Days) ſhould give no further Trouble to a Writer, than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell of his coming into the World, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out again; and doubtleſs we ſhould have heard no more of him, had not the great <hi>Vieira</hi> deſign'd him for the Univerſal Empire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd that he might not loſe the many good things he had written on that Subject, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

him in the Government in ſpite of Death it ſelf. But as the Caſe ſtands, whiles that Father ſhall have Credit with Poſterity, as if any regard be to be had to the Judgment of the preſent Age, his Authority will go on increaſing, while <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> is a Nation, this Prince will have a fair Chance, to make a greater Figure in the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles than any of his Predeceſſors. If I ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake his Hiſtory, according to the Account this Father gives of him, I muſt be forced to go back for 500 Years; and to continue his Reign, I muſt look I know not how many Ages forward. I ſhould not give my ſelf that trouble, were this the Rêvery of one ſingle Writer; but he grounds his Doctrine upon a certain Revelation, that for this laſt Age hath been receiv'd almoſt for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, by the whole Nation, but more eſpecially among the Learned; there having been ſcarce a Writer, whether Hiſtorian or Divine, that hath appear'd of late Years, but hath either ſpoken of it at large, or referr'd to it as an unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Truth; and ſince it contains a Prediction that muſt, if ever, be accompliſh'd in our time, ſome Account of it is neceſſary to them that would be acquainted with the preſent State of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Revelation is pretended to have been made to <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez,</hi> the firſt King, the Evening before he receiv'd that Title, upon the Vigil of St. <hi>James,</hi> in the Year 1139; this Prince being then encamped in the Plains of <hi>Ourique,</hi> at the Head of a handful of <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> againſt five Kings, commanding an Army of 400000 <hi>Mores,</hi> according to them that ſpeak modeſtly, moſt Writers make the Number to be much greater;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54374:82"/>
as he was muſing on the Buſineſs of the next Day, when the Battle was to be given, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fall into a Slumber, and dreamed he ſaw an Old Man coming to him, and bidding him, <hi>Be of good Courage, for that he ſhould obtain an entire Victory over the Infidels.</hi> And while he was yet in his Dream, one awakening him, told him, <hi>That there was an Old Man without the Tent to ſpeak with him:</hi> Who being introduc'd, was known by the Prince for the ſame he had juſt before ſeen in his Sleep; and proved to be a Hermit that liv'd in a Cell hard by. The Hermit gave him the ſame Encouragement as before; but told him withal, That <hi>God had fixed the Eyes of his Mercy upon Him, and his Seed, until the Sixteenth Generation, wherein his Off-ſpring ſhould be diminiſhed,</hi> (in quâ attenuabitur Proles tua); <hi>but when it was ſo dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, he would have regard and ſee to it,</hi> (in quâ attenuatâ ipſe reſpiciet &amp; videbit). Ordered him, <hi>when he heard the Hermitage-Bell that Night, to come without the Camp, and Alone. Alfonſo</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he was bid, ſaw a ſhining Ray towards the <hi>East,</hi> increaſing more and more; and while he was attentively looking on it, he ſaw within it a Croſs more reſplendent than the Sun, with our Saviour upon it, attended by a multitude of young Men in white, whom he took to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> expoſtulated with our Lord, for appearing to him rather than to the Infidels, as if he came to increaſe the Faith of one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd already. <hi>Christ</hi> told him, That <hi>he did not come to increaſe his Faith, but to encourage him against the Battle;</hi> commanding him, <hi>to accept the Title of King, which his People ſhould give him next Day:</hi> And continued, <hi>For I am He that build up, and ſcatter Empires and Kingdoms; and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54374:82"/>
I will eſtabliſh to my ſelf an Empire in thee, and thy Seed after thee, that my Name may be made known to Nations that are afar off,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Account, tho' more at large, and with other Particulars in it, that are not to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, is contain'd in a Paper with <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez</hi>'s Name to it, and thoſe of ſeveral Lords and Prelates for Witneſſes: It is ſaid to have been ſworn to by <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> thirteen Years after he had ſeen the Viſion; but it lay hid, and no mention was made of it for above 400 Years, tho' it hath ſince been pretended, that ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Intimations of the Story are to be found in old Writers, particularly the famous Poet <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moens;</hi> who indeed hath ſomething like it, with almoſt the very Words of <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s Expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it ſeems, that he either took it from the Paper, or the Compoſer of the Paper took it from him. It was found out at laſt in the Year 1596, in the <hi>Cartorium</hi> of the famous Monaſtery of <hi>Alcobaça,</hi> founded by this King, and a Copy of it was ſent to the Court at <hi>Madrid;</hi> for <hi>Philip</hi> the Second was then poſſeſs'd of <hi>Portugal.</hi> It was received by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with great Satisfaction, for in truth it ſeem'd to give them a Divine Right to the Crown of <hi>Portugal:</hi> For who could think otherwiſe, but that <hi>Philip</hi> was the Perſon deſign'd in the Promiſe, that it was he who had been pitch'd upon by Providence ſo many Ages before, to ſupply the Default of <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez</hi>'s Off-ſpring, which in his time had ſuffered ſo great a Diminution, that <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> the 16th was the laſt of the Male-Line; he was ſurviv'd indeed, and ſucceeded by his old decrepid great Uncle, <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal, who was the 16th King,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54374:83"/>
excluding <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez;</hi> but he did nothing elſe in his ſhort Reign, than ſecure the Crown to <hi>Philip.</hi> And this diminution of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was the more remarkable, for that of the nine Sons of King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> whereof ſix lived to be Men, there was no lawful Iſſue of the Male-Line remaining at <hi>Henry</hi>'s Death: So that this Paper made ſo much for <hi>Philip</hi>'s Purpoſe, that none queſtion'd its Authority among the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> their Writers, whereof a conſiderable Number might be cited, look'd upon it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, and great uſe was made of it, in the great Controverſie about Precedency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Catholick</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Kings; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that <hi>Valdes,</hi> who by Command from the former, wrote the Treatiſe, <hi>De Dignitate Regum,</hi> which was preſented to the Pope, lays a mighty ſtreſs upon his Maſter's being King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which in his Opinion ought to give him the Right of Precedency, ſince that Kingdom was, as he aſſerts, of a Divine Foundation; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Aſſertion from the Authority of this Paper, whereof he produces a Copy. But when the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> in the Year 1640, revolted from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and began to turn the Prediction againſt them, finding that <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ça</hi> was the Perſon deſign'd by it, they then chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Note, and queſtion'd the Authority of the Piece; yet having ſo often allowed of its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, they did not flatly deny, but it might be as ancient as the Date; but thought it was a Device of <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez,</hi> upon whoſe bare Word, or Oath, the Credit of the Viſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, (for it is not pretended that any ſaw it but himſelf,) and that this Prince might feign the Story to eſtabliſh his Authority, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more reverenc'd by the People.</p>

                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:54374:83"/>
Should I purſue this Matter ae far as it would go, it would engage me in a long Hiſtory of the <hi>Sebaſtianiſts,</hi> and <hi>Fifth Monarchiſts</hi> of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> for which I have now neither time nor room. But my preſent Buſineſs is with the great <hi>Vieira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Revolution in 1640, the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> almoſt to a Man, the <hi>Sebaſtianiſts</hi> excepted, ſaw clearly, that the Duke of <hi>Bragança</hi> was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in whom the new Empire ſhould have its Riſe: For tho' <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was the 16th King, yet this Duke was of the 16th Generation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Pretenſions were more agreeable to the Letter of the Prediction; but yet to make him of the 16th Generation, they were fain to include <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez</hi> for one; which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought a very material Objection. However, <hi>Vieira</hi> ſhews, how that it was ordain'd by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Dukes of <hi>Bragança</hi> ſhould ſupply the defect of the Male Line: For he proves, that a like Method was follow'd in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> the only Kingdom of Divine Foundation beſides that of <hi>Portugal;</hi> his Argument is drawn from theſe Words of <hi>Jacob, Non auferetur Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptrum de Judah, &amp; Dux de femore ejus, donec ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat qui mittendus est.</hi> Here he would have us mark well, that the word <hi>Sceptrum</hi> ſignifies Kings, and the word <hi>Dux</hi> Dukes, and ſo the Text declares, that there ſhould be no Failure of Kings and Dukes of the Deſcendants of <hi>Judah;</hi> and accordingly, after the Kings had fail'd in the time of the Captivity, the Dukes ſucceeded; ſuch were <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees:</hi> And in the ſame manner, when the direct Line of <hi>Portugal</hi> fail'd, the Kingdom was to be ſupply'd by the Dukes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Bragança.</hi> But
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54374:84"/>
he thinks, that what was ſaid concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, or Attenuation of the Royal Off-ſpring, was to be accompliſh'd in the Sons of <hi>John</hi> the Fourth. As Firſt, By the Death of Dom <hi>Theodoſio</hi> the Eldeſt, and next in <hi>Alfonſo;</hi> and that partly by the Sickneſs he had in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, (for the Father had been a great Stickler for the Party, which held <hi>Alfonſo</hi> to be lame and maim'd all over his Right-ſide; and was one of the firſt that were baniſhed at that Prince's taking upon him the Government, being ſuſpected to have drawn up the Remonſtrance read to him by the Secretaty of State) and yet he tells his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors by the way, That one half of a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> King, ſhould be able to beat the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the World. But the Diminution was compleated at <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s Death, for then the Royal Family was reduced to one ſingle Male, <hi>viz.</hi> his preſent Majeſty, <hi>Dom Pedro,</hi> whom he makes to be the <hi>Proles attenuata,</hi> of the 16th Generation, upon whom the words, <hi>Ipſe reſpiciet &amp; videbit,</hi> were to be fulfilled. Now he aſſerts, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicere &amp; videre,</hi> in the Prediction, ſignifies to give a Son; becauſe <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Reg. 1 Cap. Si reſpicieNs videris afflictionem famulae tuae dederiſque ſexum virilem:</hi> Adding, that it is not to give one, but many Male-Children: For we read in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Donec ſterilis peperit plurimos.</hi> But during the time of the King's Marriage with his firſt Queen, this Prophecy was like to come to nothing, ſince in all that time he had but one Daughter; whereas <hi>Reſpicere &amp; videre,</hi> plainly ſignifies, to give a great many Sons; and the King's want of Male-Iſſue, could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> For the King being the Off-ſpring of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54374:84"/>
the 16th Generation, was himſelf the 17th Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and the <hi>Infanta</hi> the 18th; ſo that the Promiſe could not reach to her Iſſue: And if the Crown had been ſettled, as 'twas intended, upon her, the Prophecy could never be fulfilled. Hence, as the Father thinks it was, that the Match with <hi>Savoy</hi> was broken off in ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing a manner; and that his Majeſty's firſt Queen died to make way for his Second Marriage, by which he had this Son, to whom we are now to return:</p>
               <p>Upon the Birth of this Child, the Father mounts the Chair, and takes for his Text theſe words, <hi>Reſpexit &amp; vidit,</hi> proves by Arguments not worth repeating, That <hi>Xavier</hi> was the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ray that was ſeen by <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Crucifix appear'd to him, ſhews how <hi>Xavier</hi> procured the Kingdom for <hi>John</hi> the Fourth, and this Son for the preſent King. He demonſtrates, that ſince King <hi>Peter</hi> is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd Off-ſpring of the 16th Generation, This muſt be the Child promiſed by <hi>Ipſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiciet &amp; videbit.</hi> He then goes on to ſhew, how that the Child was to be an Emperor; becauſe the Crucifix, in the beginning of his Diſcourſe, ſpoke only of a Kingdom, and the Title of a King; but after mention made of the 16th Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, he changes his Language, and ſpeaks of Empires, <hi>Ego enim aeidficator ſum Regnorum &amp;</hi> Imperiorum; and <hi>Volo in Te &amp; in ſemine tuo</hi> Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium <hi>mihi ſtabilire.</hi> Now this Empire, he ſays, is not to be the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> but one greater than any that hath been before, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, over all the World; that is to ſay, it muſt be the <hi>Fifth Monarchy.</hi> That there ſhall be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54374:85"/>
ſuch an Univerſal Monarchy, he brings the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place Proofs: He allows that this <hi>Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> is to be the Kingdom of <hi>Christ;</hi> but ſhews, that it ſhall be this young Prince's nevertheleſs: For it is ſaid, I will eſtabliſh to <hi>my ſelf</hi> an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire <hi>in</hi> Thee, <hi>and in</hi> thy Seed, <hi>Volo enim in</hi> Te <hi>&amp; in ſemine</hi> Tuo <hi>Imperium</hi> Mihi <hi>ſtabilire:</hi> So that the Empire was to belong to <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> at the ſame time. He thinks this Promiſe is much alike to that made to St. <hi>Peter, Tu es Petrus &amp; ſuper hanc Petrum aedificabo Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam meam:</hi> And that as the Univerſal Church, tho' it be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, is yet St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s too; and by being St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, is nevertheleſs the Church of <hi>Christ:</hi> In the like manner this Empire ſhall be of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> at the ſame time; and in effect, the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> had ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, that this young Prince was to be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Vicar, and have a Sovereign Power over the whole World, in Temporals, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Pope, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Vicar in Spirituals, hath an Univerſal Juriſdiction over the Church; this Monarch being the Perſon ſpoken of in that place of <hi>Daniel, Ecce quaſi filius hominis veniebat &amp; ad Antiquum dierum pervenit, &amp; dedit ei poteſtatem &amp; honorem &amp; regnum, &amp; omnes populi, Tribus, &amp; Linguae, ipſi ſervient:</hi> For ſince Chriſt is called, <hi>Filius hominis,</hi> this <hi>Quaſi filius hominis,</hi> muſt be <hi>Quaſi Chriſtus, i. e.</hi> Chriſt's Vicar, his Vicar in Temporals, as the Pope is in Spirituals. That this Emperor muſt be a King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> is plain, becauſe <hi>Hannah</hi> concludes her Song with theſe words, <hi>Dominus judicabit fines terrae, &amp; dabit Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium Regi ſuo, i. e.</hi> to the King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> For tho' all Kings may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be from God, yet other Kings are made by Men,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54374:85"/>
whereas He of <hi>Portugal</hi> is made immediately by God himſelf, and ſo is more properly called His King, <hi>Et dabit Imperium Regi ſuo;</hi> and he makes it plain, that his <hi>Imperial Majeſty</hi> muſt be the New-born Infant; for that he was given to the diminiſh'd Off-ſpring of the 16th Generation from <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Father</hi> had thus provided for the young Prince, he ſoon after received an Account of his Death, which doubtleſs would have put any other Teller of Fortunes into no ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; but it had no ſuch effect upon <hi>Padre Vieira,</hi> for he was a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and was ſo little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the Raillery of his Auditors, that he publiſhed his Sermon, joyning thereto an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology; wherein he proves, after his manner, that this <hi>Quaſi filius hominis,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Vicar in Temporals, was to die, as the Prince did, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take poſſeſſion of the Univerſal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which he could not do any where elſe but in Heaven: For doth not the Text expreſly ſay, <hi>Ecce cum nubibus Coeli quaſi filius hominis veniebat, &amp; uſque ad Antiquum dierum pervenit, &amp; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectu ejus obtulerunt eum, &amp; dedit ei Poteſtatem &amp; Honorem,</hi> &amp;c. He ſuppoſes, that Chriſt's firſt Vicar in Temporals, ſhould go to Heaven, in order to take Poſſeſſion of his Government over the Earth, for the ſame Reaſon that the firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car in Spirituals had the Keys of Heaven deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him here on Earth: For when St. <hi>Peter</hi> had the Keys of the Church given him on Earth, Chriſt was himſelf then on Earth; but he being now in Heaven, it was convenient that his Vicar in Temporals ſhould go to Heaven, in order to be inſtated in the Government of the Earth, and this after the Example of Vice-Roys, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54374:86"/>
who when they pay Homage for the Kingdoms and Provinces, where they are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Power, and repreſent the Perſon of the King, do not perform this Ceremony within the Kingdoms and Provinces committed to their Charge, but in the place where the King then is, whether he be at Court, or whether he be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from it: Now Heaven is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Court, and becauſe he was in the World, and abſent from Court, when his firſt Vicar did Homage for the firſt Univerſal Empire, which is that of his Church. It was done on Earth in like manner, when this his ſecond Vicar was to pay Homage for the ſecond Empire, which is that of the World, he was to do it in Heaven, becauſe Chriſt is now at his Court in Heaven: And this he concludes to be the Reaſon, why the Prince was to die ſo ſoon after he was born.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Prince is gone to Heaven to take Poſſeſſion of the Univerſal Empire, who ſhall have the Adminiſtration of the Government here on Earth? Shall the Prince, who hath taken his leave of us with ſo much haſte, return again to take it upon himſelf? No, he hath taken Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and the Prince that is to be born after him, ſhall have the Benefit of Primogeniture, and ſucceed him in the Empire; inſomuch, that the ſame Empire ſhall be common to both the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the Eldeſt, that is dead, is gone to take Poſſeſſion of it in Heaven; and the Second, who is to live, ſhall adminiſter it on Earth. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſaith the Father, this looks new and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to make one only Heir of two Brothers; that the firſt Brother ſhall take Poſſeſſion, and the other come after him, and be the Poſſeſſor: But to him, altho' it was wonderful, yet it was
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54374:86"/>
no novelty; he thinks he hath a like Inſtance at the Birth of <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah,</hi> Sons of <hi>Judah,</hi> the Father and Founder of the Royal Tribe: <hi>Zarah</hi> put forth his Arm, and when he had a Purple Thread tied thereto, he drew it in again, and let <hi>Pharez</hi> be born before him, and ſo yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him the Right of Primogeniture; by which means <hi>Zarah</hi> took Poſſeſſion of the Purple, that <hi>Pharez</hi> afterwards put on and enjoy'd. Thus, ſaith the Father, was the Succeſſion to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah</hi> founded, and thus was the firſt Foundation laid of the Empire of <hi>Portugal:</hi> The Prince that was born, and preſently after with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew into Heaven, was like <hi>Zarah,</hi> who only took Poſſeſſion of the Purple, and then drew back his Arm; the Prince that is to be born, ſhall be like <hi>Pharez,</hi> and ſucceeding in the Place yielded to him by his Brother, ſhall enjoy the ſame Poſſeſſion, cloath himſelf with the ſame Royal Purple, and ſtretch forth his Arm to graſp the Scepter. He beſtows ſome other Thoughts upon the Parallel, to make it more exact, which I do not think convenient to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate.</p>

I never heard that their Diſcontent proceeded from an Opinion, that this Marriage of the principal Perſon among them, was a Diſgrace to the <hi>Fidalguia:</hi> In other Countries, perhaps, and in former Times, ſo Illuſtrious a Body might think their Blood deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſuch a Match: But their Diſſatisfaction was ſaid to proceed from another Cauſe, they thought the Honour was too great for any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> not excepted; and that he was raiſed thereby too much above their Level; tho' it be confeſs'd by all at the ſame time, that next his Majeſty, his Excellency hath the greateſt Authority, and the greateſt Eſtate, and is of the Nobleſt Blood in the Kingdom. Yet he is not of equal Quality, to them on whom the <hi>French</hi> King hath beſtowed his Baſtards; for they to whom his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> hath done ſo very great an Honour, are ſuch Princes as are the neareſt to his Blood, much nearer than the Duke is to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> no wonder then, if ſo great a Value is put upon the like Honour in ſmaller Courts; the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>French</hi> being, in this Age, ſufficient to alter, if not the Nature, at leaſt the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Things, and make Things look glorious in our Days, which in former Times had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſpect. In one Particular the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Court ſeems to have out-done the <hi>French</hi> on this occaſion; that is, in the Title given to this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, upon her being firſt own'd: For as I was inform'd, at the time it was ordered, that ſhe ſhou'd be treated with <hi>Alteſa Real;</hi> whereas, I do not find, that the <hi>French</hi> King's Natural Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, have, as yet, got above <hi>Alteſſe Sereniſſime;</hi> and this may poſſibly be the Reaſon, why Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54374:88"/>
                  <hi>L'Abbe d'Eſtrees,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, forbore to viſit her, 'till he had expreſs Orders for it from <hi>France.</hi> For his Maſter having been for ſome time uſed to preſcribe Rules for the Ceremonial, he might, perhaps, think it a kind of Uſurpation, for any others to take upon them to alter it: But the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> did not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innovate on this occaſion, for they had a Precedent at the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> where the late Don <hi>John of Auſtria</hi> took <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> upon him; which, perhaps, may have been the cauſe why the Court of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which is reſolved, in all things, to ſwell up to the Grandeur of <hi>Spain,</hi> gave the ſame Title to this Lady.</p>
               <p>It is now commonly ſaid in <hi>Portugal,</hi> that the King's Natural Children have a Right to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in the Throne, in default of his lawful Iſſue: But I believe this Opinion to be as ill grounded, as 'tis derogatory to the Honour of that Nation. Had Royal Baſtards a Right to the Succeſſion, <hi>John</hi> the Second, who ruled with a more Abſolute Power than any King of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either before, or ſince, would doubtleſs have left the Crown to his Natural Son, Dom <hi>Jorge,</hi> Duke of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> Progenitor of the Dukes of <hi>Aveiro,</hi> (now in <hi>Spain)</hi> he having laboured all he could, to obtain the Succeſſion for him; but all in vain: For he was forc'd, before his Death, to acknowledge for his Succeſſor, Dom <hi>Emanuel,</hi> then Duke of <hi>Beja,</hi> whoſe Brother that King had ſlain with his own Hands. When Dom <hi>Antonio</hi> pretended to the Crown, after the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal, he had put an end to the great Controverſie at that time on foot, about the Succeſſion, had Baſtards a Right thereto: But he himſelf was far from thinking they had,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54374:88"/>
and therefore he grounded his Claim upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Marriage between Dom <hi>Luis,</hi> Son of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> with his Mother: It was a Prejudice to him indeed, that ſome ſuſpected <hi>Judaiſm</hi> to lie lurking in his Mother's Blood: However, the Judges conſtituted by <hi>Henry</hi> to determine this Controverſie, alledged his Illegitimacy as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and the only Cauſe of his Excluſion.</p>
               <p>The only Baſtard that ever Reign'd in this Kingdom, was <hi>John</hi> the Firſt; yet he never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Right of Succeſſion to the Crown, but came in by Election of the Eſtates aſſembled in <hi>Cortes,</hi> at a time when the Throne was declared vacant, the other Pretenders being at that time Priſoners in <hi>Caſtille;</hi> and what is more, declared Illegitimate by the <hi>Cortes,</hi> (whether juſtly, or not, is another Queſtion), ſo that Baſtard for Baſtard, it was thought fit in this Caſe of Neceſſity, to Elect Dom <hi>John</hi> before any other.</p>

               <head>Of the MINISTRY.</head>
               <p>ALL Publick Affairs of Importance, and ſuch as immediately concern the King, are here managed by a Sett of Miniſters, as many, or as few as the King pleaſes to appoint, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are called the Council of State; and as Members of this Body, they are all treated with Excellency: The Reaſon, I ſuppoſe, is, becauſe that Title is given to the Counſellors of State at <hi>Madrid;</hi> tho' another Reaſon was given by one of their Number, who ſaid, It was their due, <hi>becauſe they had all of them been Ambaſſadors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Council the King refers all Matters of Moment, ſeldom, or never, reſolving upon any thing before the Affair has been conſidered and debated among them. 'Tis ſaid, the Reaſon why the King pays ſo great a Deference to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, is, partly becauſe it conſiſts of thoſe who had a great hand in advancing him to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Throne; He, for this Cauſe, thinking it but reaſonable, that they ſhould ſhare in the Power they had given him; partly moved thereto, by the frequent Remonſtrances of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are in great Credit with his Majeſty, and as ſome ill-natur'd People give out, are ſet on by the Miniſters, to be ever and anon ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting to him, that he is oblig'd in Conſcience to take this Courſe. But moſt People are ſo well ſatisfied of his Majeſty's Prudence, and Juſtice, as to think that Things would go much better
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54374:89"/>
than they do, if he would take a greater part of the Government upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>This Council, as it imitates that of <hi>Madrid</hi> in other things, ſo it is ſeldom guilty of any great Precipitation in its Proceedings; but People complain rather of its Slowneſs, and want of Diſpatch; and ſome, who love to make the worſt of things, ſay, That when a Buſineſs is brought before Them, they ſhall ſit upon it four or five Times, each Seſſion laſting five or ſix Hours, and after all, the Matter be often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more perplex'd and intricate than before; and the King, who loſes all this time, waiting for their Reſolution, be as much to ſeek as ever. But ſuch as talk after this rate, ſeem to have that Opinion of the Chapter, which is very different from what the World has entertain'd of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; as will appear from the Characters of ſome of thoſe excellent Perſons that compoſe this Council: As firſt of,</p>
               <p>Dom <hi>Manoel Telles de Silva, Conde de Villar Mayor, &amp; Marcheſe de Alegrete.</hi> I name him firſt, not becauſe of his Quality, (for tho' he be moſt Nobly deſcended, yet he gives place to others, whom I ſhall mention afterwards), but becauſe He is in effect the Prime Miniſter of State, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the greateſt Concern being chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to his Management. This Lord having born Arms, for ſome time, in his Youth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf afterwards with extraordinary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the Study of Letters, and made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable Progreſs therein; inſomuch, that he is eſteem'd for one of the moſt Learned Men in the Nation. It is ſaid, that he was much admir'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> for his Readineſs in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54374:90"/>
                  <hi>Latin;</hi> and, I ſuppoſe, it was to exerciſe himſelf in the ſame Tongue, that in the time of his Embaſſy into that Country, he ſet himſelf to write in elegant <hi>Latin,</hi> the Life of <hi>John</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Sir-nam'd, <hi>The Perfect Prince,</hi> which hath been publiſh'd ſince. In this Piece, the Noble Author hath attempted to follow the Stile and Method of the Ancients: How far he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to either, I will not pretend to judge; but, I believe, moſt candid Readers will think, he hath ſucceeded to admiration, conſidering at how low an Ebb Learning hath been in <hi>Portugal</hi> for this laſt Age; But by this Application to his Studies, he qualify'd himſelf for much Greater, and more Honourable Employments, than that of an Author. At Twenty-four Years of Age, he was made one of the <hi>Infante</hi>'s <hi>Camariſts,</hi> and is ſuppoſed to have had a great hand in the laſt Revolution, and he hath been ever ſince one of the neareſt to the Perſon of that Prince.</p>
               <p>After ſome Overtures had been made of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the King his Maſter, and the Princeſs of <hi>Nieubourg,</hi> this Lord was pitch'd upon as the fitteſt Perſon to carry on ſo important a Negotiation; which he brought to a happy Concluſion, and conducted the Royal Bride with him into <hi>Portugal.</hi> Nor was that the only Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the <hi>Conde</hi> did on this occaſion, he gain'd an Honour for his Maſter, which (the Emperor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) no Crown'd Head in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> had ever attain'd to before: For before he made his Publick Entry into <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> he ſo adjuſted Matters in a Preliminary Treaty, that he was to have the Precedency of the Elector, and the Place of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on all Occaſions. This, ſay the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> had never before been granted by an Elector,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54374:90"/>
the Ambaſſador Extraordinary of any King, tho' ſome of the greateſt had been ſeeking it with much Earneſtneſs. <hi>But the Reputation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Grandeur,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſo worthily repreſented by this Great Miniſter, together with his Excellency's great Prudence and Dexterity, gain'd for this Crown that ſingular Prerogative.</hi> When his Excellency made his Publick Entry, the two Princes, <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> waited to receive him in the Court of the Caſtle, and the Elector himſelf went down ſome of the Steps that are open to the Court, to meet the Ambaſſador, as he came out of his Coach; his Electoral Highneſs deſiring his Excellency to be covered, gave him the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, let his Excellency go before him through every Door; and when he had conducted him to the Place of Audience, gave him the moſt Honourable Seat.</p>
               <p>This was ſo very great an Honour, that it had been deny'd, not only to Ambaſſadors, but to a King in Perſon: For when <hi>Henry,</hi> Elect of <hi>Poland,</hi> afterwards the Third of that Name in <hi>France,</hi> call'd at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> in his way to his new Kingdom, there was not a Man to be ſeen in this very Court, where the <hi>Conde de Villar Mayor,</hi> had Princes to wait upon him at his <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere;</hi> and the poor King was ſo out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that he was fain to ſtep aſide, on pretence of making Water, 'till ſome Body might come to ſhew him up Stairs; at laſt, the <hi>Rhinegrave,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two Gentlemen that had eſcaped from the Butchery of <hi>Saint Barthlemi,</hi> met him half way on the Steps, excuſing the Elector his Father, <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third, that he came not to do this Office, by reaſon of a certain Pain that he had in his Leg; but the old Elector invited
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54374:91"/>
King <hi>Henry,</hi> the next Morning, to take a Walk with him, and by no leſs than Thirty Turns in his Great Hall, like that at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> he ſo breath'd the young King, as fully to convince him, that what his Son had ſaid, was but a meer Excuſe. But <hi>Henry</hi> came then juſt reeking from ſhedding the Blood of Innocents; and the old Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, who otherwiſe entertain'd him like a Royal Gueſt, had a mind to let the young King ſee how much a Prince falls from his Dignity, by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of ſuch Barbarities. So that, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, this Precedent ought not to be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, in the Caſe of our Ambaſſador Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
               <p>As for the late Elector, <hi>Philip William,</hi> he, it ſeems, was reſolv'd not to ſtand upon Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with his Excellency; he not only gave him the Upper-hand at his firſt Reception, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at Meals: The Lord Ambaſſador always waſh'd firſt, ſat in the beſt Place, was ſerv'd firſt; nay, the very Electoreſs her ſelf, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes her Daughters, would needs have his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency take the Precedency of them too; but he was more a Gentleman than to inſiſt upon his <hi>Punctilio's</hi> with Ladies: And ſo it was contriv'd, that at Conferences with them, there ſhould be no Canopy in the Room, and conſequently no Diſtinction between the Right, and the Left-hand; and that of two Rows of Chairs, oppoſite to each other, the Ambaſſador ſhould take the uppermoſt on the one ſide, and the Electoreſs on the other, with the Princeſſes her Daughters after her in their Order; his Excellency ſatisfying himſelf with this Equality with her Highneſs, thinking that he had gain'd his Point, while he kept the Elector below him. The old Elector, for his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54374:91"/>
part, contented himſelf with having got a good Match for his Daughter, while the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had all the Advantage in the Ceremonial on their ſide, and were not a little elevated with the Honour their Ambaſſador gain'd to the Crown, though it was no more than was loſt by the Father of their Queen. Nor need we wonder, that this Court ſhould be ſo highly pleas'd with his Excellency's Dexterity and Succeſs herein, ſince the Ceremonial is become the Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Subject of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Negotiations now on foot: For what is there that doth perplex, and embroil moſt Courts in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> ſo much as the additional Sound of two or three Syllables in ſome Princes Titles? Have we not lately ſeen the Force of Blood it ſelf ſuſpended in the moſt endearing Relations? And is not Infallibility it ſelf at a ſtand, and all for want of one to determine the ſeveral Degrees that are between an <hi>Arm'd Chair,</hi> and a <hi>Folding Stool?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Nobleman, at his Return, had the Title of Marqueſs <hi>de Alegrete</hi> beſtow'd upon him, as a Mark of Honour, in Reward for his Service. But his Dexterity in Negotiations of this ſort, make but a ſmall part of his Character: He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by all that pretend to know him, as a moſt accompliſh'd States-man, even by thoſe who are ſo ill-natur'd as to allow that Title to no other Miniſter about the Court. He is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be well acquainted with the preſent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> and throughly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Maſter's Intereſt; and above all, is accounted a Perſon of unbiaſs'd Integrity; his Country-men generally eſteem him a true <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> diſintereſſed in his Counſels, and eſpouſing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54374:92"/>
no Party; as having no other Deſigns in view, but ſuch as he thinks may make for his Maſter's Service, and his Country's Good. This is the Character that's commonly given of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs; the worſt that is ſaid of him, that I could ever hear, is, that his Tenderneſs for a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Family, and Care in providing for them, may have a little ſlackned his Vigor, in oppoſing the Counſels of ſuch as are thought to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in view, than the Good of the State. He is ſaid to be very zealouſly addicted to the Religion of his Country: He aſcribed the happy Iſſue of his Negotiation at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of two Siſters, and a Daughter of his, that are Nuns in the Convent of <hi>Madre de Deos,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle without the City: At leaſt the King was of this Opinion, when Cardinal <hi>de Alemcaſtro</hi> was commending him for his prudent Management, his Majeſty reply'd, That <hi>this Lord had no part in the Succeſs, but that all was done to his Hand by the</hi> Madre de Deos. I have been told of another remarkable Inſtance of his Lordſhip's Devotion, but know not what Credit it deſerves, having no other ground for it than the common Talk of the People, among whom it was reported, That when St. <hi>Antoninho,</hi> (a ſmall diminutive Image of St. <hi>Antonio,</hi> that hath been in great Credit for theſe three laſt Years at <hi>Lisbon)</hi> was hired out to go <hi>Sargente Mor,</hi> to the Fleet that went laſt Year (98), with the Vice-Roy to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> among other Perquiſites promis'd to the Saint, over and above his Standing-Wages of 10 <hi>Millr. per</hi> Month, the Marqueſs <hi>de Algrete</hi> bargain'd to give him a fine new Chappel, in caſe he conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Relation of his Lordſhip's ſafe home from <hi>Goa.</hi>

                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:54374:92"/>
Dom <hi>Nuno Alvarez Pereira,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Ferreira,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tentugal,</hi> &amp;c. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned on ſeveral Occaſions before, deſcended of the Houſe of <hi>Bragança,</hi> from <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Duke of that Title, and conſequently the King's Kinſman. This Noble Perſon, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his high Birth, and vaſt Riches, hath qualify'd himſelf for all manner of Employments, having commanded both by Sea and Land, and all along made a moſt conſiderable Figure in the State, wherein he has at preſent the greateſt Power and Authority next the King, having a hand in all Affairs relating to his Majeſty, his Domeſtick Concerns not excepted. If any part of the Publick Buſineſs be more than other his peculiar Province, I take it to be the Revenue of the Crown, whereof he is a great Farmer, as the Foreign Affairs ſeems to be that of the Marqueſs <hi>de Alegrete.</hi> It is agreed, that the Authority of the Council of State, doth in a manner wholly reſide in theſe two Great Men. It is ſaid, they have been formerly in competition about the King's Ear, and Favour; wherein the Marqueſs was upheld by the Opinion his Majeſty hath of his Prudence and Integrity. The King, no doubt, hath a like Opinion concerning the Duke too; but he, they ſay, by the Pleaſantneſs of his Converſation, contributes likewiſe to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Diverſion, the Marqueſs conſulting only his Country's Good, and his Maſter's Service; the Duke, as 'tis ſuppos'd, doth not wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his own Intereſt. Some will have it, that he is biaſs'd in favour of <hi>France;</hi> but, perhaps, the only Reaſon may be, becauſe both his Wives have been <hi>French-</hi>Women, the preſent Ducheſs
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54374:93"/>
being Daughter of the Marqueſs of <hi>Harcourt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke being, as I have ſaid, the greateſt Subject in the Kingdom, takes a particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to make People ſenſible of his Grandeur; he is not of Opinion, that he ſtands in any need of a pompous Equipage, or a numerous Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, to make himſelf appear conſiderable; but like thoſe famous States-men, that have made the greateſt Figures in the Modern, as well as the Ancient Common-Wealths, thinks the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Perſon ſufficient to Command thoſe Reſpects that are due to his Quality. When his Excellency appears abroad in his Litter, which certainly is not made for ſhow, he is followed only by a Trooper; and by him, becauſe he is General of the Cavalry. Dukes in <hi>Portugal</hi> had formerly their Guards allowed them; but I have not heard, that his Excellency chuſes to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a Soldier, to keep up his Pretenſions to that Priviledge. He is a <hi>Familiar</hi> of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as, I ſuppoſe, all other Noble-men are, it being a Mark of Honour in this County; but at an <hi>Auto da Fe,</hi> other Noblemen ſerve as Guards to thoſe poor Wretches that come out to hear their Sentence, whereas his Excellency ſupplies the Place of a Door-keeper.</p>
               <p>Many other things are told of his Excellency, by ſuch as pretend to give his Character; but they are Matters which the Publick is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to know.</p>
               <p>Dom <hi>Luis</hi> (now Cardinal) <hi>de Souſa,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and <hi>Capellaon Mor</hi> to the King; which, I ſuppoſe, I may tranſlate, Dean of his Majeſties Chappel; a Prelate, who as he is of a Noble Extraction, ſeems to have a Mind ſuitable
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54374:93"/>
to his Birth and Quality, and a Capacity ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to carry on his Deſigns, which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways great, and always ſucceſsful at long run, notwithſtanding the mighty Oppoſition he hath met with; he having been heard to ſay, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his having receiv'd the Cap from <hi>Rome,</hi> That he never ſet his Heart upon any thing, but in the End he found ways to accompliſh his Deſire: And in effect, he hath rais'd himſelf to the higheſt Dignities that either <hi>Portugal</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> cou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him; for his being a National Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, excludes him from all Pretenſions to the Pontificate.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s Reign he became ſuſpected to the Court, by his aſſociating himſelf with the diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Party, and was therefore order'd by the King to his Reſidence at <hi>O Porto,</hi> of which place he was Dean: When Biſhops were reſtored to <hi>Portugal,</hi> he was advanc'd to that See; and from thence he was afterwards tranſlated to the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and at laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in 97, received the Cardinal's Cap from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' the two fore-mention'd Miniſters have the principal Management of State-Affairs, yet they ſay, this great Prelate will take care, that his Vote ſhall have its due Weight in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, eſpecially when he hath occaſion to promote the Grandeur of his Brother's Houſe. I cannot pretend to tell how far he is concern'd in Foreign Affairs; but we may ſuppoſe, conſidering his Profeſſion, that thoſe relating to <hi>Rome,</hi> may, if any, be his Province: But notwithſtanding the great Favours he has received from thence, his Publick Conduct hath not made him ſuſpected of any mean Compliance with that Court; on the contrary, he has endeavoured, ſo far as the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54374:94"/>
Genius of his Country will permit, to reform many of thoſe Abuſes it hath introduced; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, he hath on ſeveral Occaſions ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a great Enemy to Exemptions, by which that Court hath eſtabliſh'd its Tyranny in the World, and ruin'd the Diſcipline of the Church. He hath had many Claſhings with the <hi>Nuncio's,</hi> whoſe Legantine Courts, he thinks, incroach too much upon his Epiſcopal Juriſdiction. In ſhort, he ſeems to have much of the ſame Spirit and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with the late Arch-Biſhop <hi>Harlai</hi> of <hi>Paris;</hi> nor has he, any more than that other great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, eſcaped the Laſh of malicious Tongues.</p>
               <p>I have never heard, that he hath ſhewn ſo little Complaiſance to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in order to gain the Purple, tho' as all agree, he hath been aiming at it for theſe many Years, and conſidering the ſervile Temper of thoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> no way ſeems more likely to ſucceed; but Dom <hi>Veriſſimo de Alemcaſtro,</hi> the late Inquiſitor-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, had put more ſignal Affronts upon the Holy See, than ever the Arch-Biſhop either did, or could; and was (poſſibly for that Reaſon) promoted before him: When the Pope attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſeveral of his Predeceſſors had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, to break the preſent Conſtitution of the <hi>Holy Office,</hi> whereof the <hi>Holy See</hi> bears all the Scandal, and reaps none of the Profit: The Inquiſitor, ſupported, I ſuppoſe, by the Court, (whoſe Creature the Inquiſition was) ſet them of <hi>Rome</hi> at Defiance, ſtood all the Fire of the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> and remain'd unmov'd at their Cenſures, tho' they proceeded ſo far as to interdict him, <hi>Ab ingreſſu Eccleſiae;</hi> inſomuch, that his Holineſs was oblig'd at laſt, upon a ſlight Compoſition, to deſiſt from the Enterprize; and at the next Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,

the Rebel-Inquiſitor was rewarded with the Cap; the ſame Cap, which as the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop pretended, had been promiſed to himſelf. Had this been under any other Pontificate than that of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh, the World would not have been to ſeek for the Reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor's Promotion; but there being ſomething more generous in this Pope's Nature, than in theirs that uſually fill the Holy Chair, 'tis not unlikely, but he had ſome regard to the Merit of the Man; for all give Dom <hi>Veriſſimo</hi> the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of an extraordinary good Man; tho' they ſay withal, that he was none of the wiſeſt; and he may therefore be ſuppoſed to have been but an Inſtrument in the hands of others, when that vigorous Oppoſition was made to the Pope's Deſign of reforming the Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that this Promotion of the Inquiſitor did not a little diſguſt the Arch-Biſhop; and that he ſpared not to make moſt grievous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt thoſe that had deceived him; and that it was not on the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> only that he laid the Blame of his Diſappointment.</p>
               <p>By this Promotion, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> gain'd ſome very conſiderable Advantages; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they took off one great Adverſary, gain'd him over to their ſide, and by his Means diſarm'd another, putting it out of his Power to do them any great harm: For after this, the Cardinal, and the Arch-Biſhop were never in good Terms toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> found the Cardinal the fitteſt Man on all Occaſions to make head againſt the other, whenſoever he was about to give them any Trouble: For tho' there was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the Abilities of the one and the other, yet the Cardinal was ſo highly eſteem'd
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54374:95"/>
for his Innocence and Probity, by the King, Nobility, and People, that as weak as he was, he was able to make his Party good againſt the Arch-Biſhop; who is far from being ſo much, or ſo generally beloved.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> have not been wanting on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occaſions, to raiſe up Enemies againſt this Adverſary of theirs, <hi>Monſignor Nicolini</hi> was ſo happy in the time of his Reſidence, as to ſet the main Body of the <hi>Fidalgo's</hi> upon him: The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he effected it, does not indeed make much for the Honour of the Holy See; however, he did not a little gratifie a certain Paſſion, which they of <hi>Rome</hi> are no leſs ready to indulge, when a fair Opportunity offers, than they are to Court an Enemy that's too mighty for them. The <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalgo</hi>'s were much ſet upon it, to have leave for a Company of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Strolers to Act in the Town, and were as much oppoſed by the Arch-Biſhop; who, perhaps, might think, that the Licenſing of a Publick Stage, was, in effect, to Authorize the Corruption of Manners, that it is apt to cauſe: Not that his Lordſhip was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, leaſt the Players ſhould expoſe Religion, or turn it into Ridicule, to make Sport for the hair-brain'd unthinking Youth of the Town: For, poſſibly, there may not be two Nations in the World, where the Audience it ſelf, to ſay nothing of the Government, wou'd be very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient at ſo horrible an Abuſe; ſhould any thing like it be ſeen upon the Stage at <hi>Lisbon</hi> by theſe very <hi>Fidalgo's,</hi> who were ſo earneſt for a Play-Houſe, their Religion would put 'em upon chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Offenders upon the Spot, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ours will not juſtifie. It is not long ſince they gave a terrible Inſtance of their Zeal upon a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54374:95"/>
Servant of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, who being but a <hi>French</hi> Papiſt, could not be perſwaded to pay the like Reverence as others did, to an Image brought upon the Stage; which made the People fall upon him with ſo much Fury, that he was carried off the place for Dead. And there is this to be ſaid in behalf of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Poets, that their Plays have very little of that Leudneſs in them, which abounds in ſo ſcandalous a manner in thoſe of another Country. But though Crimes of this ſort are not taught in the Play-Houſe there, yet it is much ſuſpected, that they are practiſed amongſt them, the Women that tread the Stage, having no better Character there than in other Places. And this, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, might be the Reaſon why their Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into <hi>Lisbon</hi> was ſo vigorouſly oppoſed by the Arch-Biſhop, who to put a ſtop to all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities in their behalf, publiſhed an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication againſt the Players, in caſe they ſhould Act, and againſt all that went to ſee them. It was in vain for the <hi>Fidalgo's</hi> to deſire his Lordſhip to recall the Sentence; but at laſt they apply'd themſelves to <hi>Nicolini,</hi> the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> who had now a fair Opportunity preſented him to engage a powerful Party againſt the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; nor did he let ſlip his Advantage: It is true, Religion and Vertue were like to ſuffer by what he was about; but thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> think theſe are things to be minded, when they prove ſubſervient to their Deſigns; he, therefore, without more ado, takes off the Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Virtue of his Legantine Power. The Play-Houſe hereupon opens, and fills; the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalgo's</hi> flocking to it like ſo many School-Boys, let looſe from under the Diſcipline of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54374:96"/>
and, perhaps, the more eagerly, that they might a little mortifie the rigid Arch-Biſhop. His Lordſhip withdraws for a time to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Houſe, that he might not be a Witneſs to ſo great a Slur put upon him, and to ſuppreſs his juſt Indignation againſt the <hi>Nuncio.</hi> But this was only a ſhort Mortification, which conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Occaſion, muſt doubtleſs have turn'd to his Lordſhip's Credit, even among thoſe that were pleas'd with it at that time. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſince thought convenient to preſent him with a Cap, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Year 1697, at a Promotion wherein his Lordſhip, and <hi>Monſignor Cornaro,</hi> the then <hi>Nuncio</hi> at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> were the only Perſons advanced to the Purple.</p>

                  <hi>Dom Anrique de Souſa de Tavares da Silva, Conde de Miranda, &amp; Marquis de Aronches,</hi> Brother to the Arch-Biſhop, and acting in concert with him; a Miniſter of great Sufficiency, but too much, as 'tis thought, addicted to his Pleaſures: He hath ſerved in ſeveral Embaſſies, as to <hi>England, Spain, Holland,</hi> and remains well affected to the People among whom he has reſided: Inſomuch, that during the late War, ſuch as would needs have the Miniſters of State to take Parties, have always given the Marqueſs of <hi>Aronches,</hi> together with his Family, to the Allies; and we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be much in the right, if we judge how the Noble Families ſtand affected to other Nations, from the Alliances they contract with Foreigners: This Lord having given his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Prince of <hi>Ligne,</hi> a <hi>Fleming,</hi> Subject of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Prince of the Empire, who ſucceeds him in his Eſtate and Title; the ſame Perſon, who, by Procurement of the Family, was ſent
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54374:96"/>
Ambaſſador Extraordinary from his <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Majeſty to the Emperor, and made that ſplendid Entry into <hi>Vienna;</hi> of which the Publick had ſo large an Account in the <hi>Gazettes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If I do not mention the reſt that are of this Honourable Body, it is becauſe I am not ſo well inſtructed, as to be able to give a particular Account of them: But I muſt not omit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Secretary of State; who, tho' he hath neither a Deliberative, nor a Deciſive Voice in any of the Councils, is yet, as ſome term him, the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of the whole Kingdom: His Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is compounded of that of Clerk of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and another long ſince aboliſhed, but revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a ſmall time by the <hi>Conde de Caſtelmelhor;</hi> he that executed it, was called the <hi>Eſcrivam de Puridade: Puridade,</hi> in old <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> ſignifies Secrecy, or Privacy; but is now out of uſe in that Senſe: The Office ſeems to have been much the ſame as that of <hi>Privado</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> or Prime Miniſter in <hi>France;</hi> but nothing remains of it, now, at leaſt in the Secretary of State, but what is purely Miniſterial. The Office of Secretary, at preſent, as 'tis a Place of Great Truſt, ſo it is in a manner a Place of infinite Buſineſs; he gives an Account to the King, of whatſoever is done in the Council of State; he is addreſs'd to by all ſorts of People that have any thing to do at Court, of what Nature ſoever their Buſineſs is, he propoſes the Matter to the King, and returns his Anſwer; and is apyly'd to by Foreign Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters on all occaſions. This Place is at preſent executed by <hi>Mendo Foyos Pereira,</hi> one rais'd by the Houſe of <hi>Aronches,</hi> and, as ſome ſay, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to the Family: He is a Perſon not ſo
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54374:97"/>
conſiderable for his Birth, as for his indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diligence in his Employment; of which he acquits himſelf ſo well, that it ſeems to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon, that ſome repreſent him of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Capacity. Foreign Miniſters find it to be much for their Convenience, to Manage the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, and hold a good Underſtanding with him, if they deſire to have quick Diſpatches; or when Matters relating to the Ceremonial are in Queſtion: For if he be ill us'd, they may chance to meet with more Rubs in their way, than they look'd for. The <hi>Nuncio's</hi> that have been on ill Terms with him, have not been inſenſible of his Reſentments: However, it is thought adviſable by thoſe that have to deal with this Miniſter, that in the Meaſures they keep with him, they beware, leſt he perceives they are in any Awe of him; ſince an over-great Complaiſance, may be of worſe Conſequence, than a Conduct that is quite contrary.</p>

When that Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Prince, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> had been treated with the utmoſt Indignities by thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they conſcious to themſelves of their Offences, were apprehenſive of his Reſentments; <hi>Inigo Loyola</hi> Founder of the Jeſuits could aſſure them, that he knew the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to be ſo good a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that he would ſuffer his very Beard to be trampled under feet by his Holineſs, without ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt ſign of Diſobedience. The Brave <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> when the Pope to flatter his deſire of Glory, bid him chooſe what Title he pleaſed, anſwered, That he was ambitious of no other, but that which his Anceſtors had ſo well deſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>The moſt obedient Son of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great Devotion of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Kings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Romiſh See, hath given the Pope the advantage to eſtabliſh an Abſolute Dominion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Kingdom. Its true, his Holineſs hath the Title of Soveraign only in Spirituals, but he ſo manages the matter, that Temporals fall in of courſe in <hi>Ordine ad Spiritualia;</hi> he is not indeed at the trouble nor the charge of maintaining the Civil Government, but then he has the Power and the Emoluments of a Temporal Soveraignty. He has his <hi>Nuncio</hi> always reſiding at <hi>Lisbon</hi> with a Legantine Power, and wanting only the Title of Vice-Roy, exerciſing his Juriſdiction in his own Courts, whence there is no appeal but to <hi>Rome,</hi> over the whole Body of the Clergy, who with their Dependents may well be reckon'd one half of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54374:101"/>
the Kingdom. They are commonly ſuppoſed to have much above two thirds of the Wealth; the ſecular Clergy who are more exempt than the reſt from his Dominion, are yet his Tributarys, great ſumms are extorted from them for Collations, to Benefices and Bulls for Biſhops: There goes to <hi>Rome,</hi> as I have been informed, no leſs than 90 Thouſand Crowns before an Archbiſhop of <hi>Evora</hi> can be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his Chair, and all the reſt may be ſuppoſed to pay in their Proportion. As for the Regulars, they are his more immediate Vaſſals or Soldiers ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, its true they are not in his Pay, for they live upon free Quarter, and keep the Country under Contribution, and his Holineſs comes in for a ſhare of the Spoils, by continually draining them of what they ſcrape from the People, every Monaſtery ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always ſome Buſineſs or other depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Nuncio;</hi> or their Agents at <hi>Rome</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Privileges or Indulgencies, or Compoſition for unſaid Maſſes that have been paid for, (of which they will ſometimes be behind hand for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, but upon Compoſition made at <hi>Rome,</hi> one high Maſs ſaid at a privileged Altar will ſerve for all) or to make the Miniſters of that Court ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Squabbles among themſelves. And on all theſe occaſions, the Money of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be diſpos'd of there by underhand Conveyances, as well as open Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; for when a Fryar is to paſs the Mountains, he is furniſhed with Bills for Secret, as well as Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, and it is not impoſſible that the Holy See, may by this means undergo greater Scandal than it deſerves, for the Fryars Account is allowed of upon his own word; ſo that ſhould he convert a conſiderable ſumm to his own uſe, he cannot be diſcovered unleſs it be by a very rare Accident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54374:101"/>
and yet it is no unheard of thing at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> for one to be found out in reckoning ſome Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Crowns for Bribes, which never were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the Service.</p>
               <p>But theſe are not the only ways by which the Riches of <hi>Portugal</hi> are drawn to <hi>Rome;</hi> his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath his Apoſtolical Collectors (for ſo they are called) to raiſe Tribute from the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as well as his own, and to receive his ſhare of the Taxes which the King levys in his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions by his Holineſs's Permiſſion. Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Marriages, muſt neceſſarily bring him in a very conſiderable and conſtant Revenue, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Degrees being ſo very many in the Roman Church, whether upon the account of Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Spiritual Relation, that one would think there could ſcarce be a Wedding among Neighbours or People, that have for any time been acquainted, without a Diſpenſation, and it rarely, if ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that a Match is broken off for want of one, ſuppoſing the Parties will come up to the price of it; if they apprehend any difficulty in it, it is but beginning the Marriage at the wrong End, and then the Diſpenſation is granted of courſe; and the Price being rais'd according to the Quality of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and nearneſs of the Relation, great ſumms are continually drawn from Families of the better ſort, who commonly marry within themſelves, and ſome of them intrench ſo far upon the Laws of Nature, that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the laſt Age, was not more confounded by the various Relations of its ſeveral Branches to each other, than ſome Noble Families in <hi>Portugal</hi> are at this day. In fine, <hi>Portugal</hi> is ſo beneficial a Province to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that could a juſt Computation be made, there is no doubt but his Revenues from thence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54374:102"/>
would be found to exceed the Kings by far, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Charges of the Government deducted. They are ſo great, that if ſome ſudden ſtop be not put to them, the Kingdom is like to be exhauſted in a very ſhort time, which gives thinking People here a ſad proſpect of the approaching Ruin of their Country; This may appear ſtrange to the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> conſidering the vaſt advantages that muſt neceſſarily have accrued to this Kingdom, from an undiſturbed Peace of above Thirty Years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, during which time, all other parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom have been more than once engaged in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive Wars; one would think that during the laſt War at leaſt, which among many other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, brought hither ſo great and gainful a Trade with <hi>England,</hi> as took off all the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities the Country could vent, and that too, at prodigious Rates: I believe, I may ſafely ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove double to what they formerly ſold for; one would think, I ſay, by this time that Riches and Plenty ſhould have abounded every where. But they that have travelled the Country of late, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held another Face of Things, and at the late Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the <hi>Cortes,</hi> the Mouths of the Deputies were full of complaints of an Univerſal Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Poverty, and I have been told, that ſome of them were ſenſible enough of the cauſe of their Miſery, but I have not heard that any Motion was made in their Publick Meetings for a Redreſs to this their greateſt Grievance.</p>
               <p>Having given ſome Account of the State of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Rome,</hi> it may be expected that I ſhould ſay ſomething of the reciprocal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, derived from the Holy See, upon a People that hath done, and ſuffers ſo much for its ſake, or at leaſt, of that Fatherly Tenderneſs which the Pope
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54374:102"/>
muſt needs have for a King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes the favour of his Holineſs by ſo conſtant and meritorious an Obedience. His Holineſs muſt by ſome very diſtinguiſhing marks of Affection, put a Difference between this his <hi>Benjamin,</hi> from whom he hath received ſo much comfort, and thoſe other Sons of his, who by their untoward Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, have been always a croſſing and tormenting him, He that hath been ſo often worried by the head-ſtrong Emperors in former Ages, braved in <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the laſt Age, and more than once in his own Capital by the <hi>French</hi> in our Days, and received ſo many Mortifications from the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, from whom he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that they ſhould upon the Account of their Natural, as well as their Spiritual Relation, behave themſelves more as becomes the Children of the Holy See, He one would think ſhould have reſerved the greateſt and beſt of his Bleſſings for this his <hi>moſt Obedient Son.</hi> But the Holy Father ſeems to be affected with quite contrary Paſſions to other Men, to have caſt away his moſt endearing Favours where the utmoſt Rigour ſhould be expected, and where a Bleſſing was moſt lookt for to have entail'd his Curſe. The Royal Houſe of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had great cauſe for Complaints of this kind, as often as it hath been in diſtreſs, and ſtood in need of his Protection. When <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> while the Queſtion concerning the Succeſſion to <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal was depending, was preparing by force of Arms, to deprive the true Heireſs of her Birthright; Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> did his utmoſt indeed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from the enterprize, but it was to the end, that he might ſeize upon the Crown for his own uſe, as a Chattel of the Cardinals, alledging that his <hi>Spoils</hi> (among which he reckon'd the Kingdom) were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54374:103"/>
forfeitable to the Holy See; and leaſt this ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Claim ſhould be thought inſufficient, he added another; <hi>Alphonſo Henriquez,</hi> the firſt King as hath been ſaid, would needs make his Kingdom Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and charged with the annual Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of four Ounces of Gold, and this was made a pretence by Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> for depriving the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of that King of their Inheritance, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that <hi>Portugal</hi> was by this means become a Feif to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, and as ſuch, by default of the Male-line, was devolved to himſelf; but his pretenſions meeting with that contempt they deſerved, he ſtill reſolved to deprive the right Heireſs at any rate, and of all the Pretenders made Intereſt for him that had the worſt Title, that is, for <hi>Dom Antonio</hi> the Baſtard, as if he had a mind to embroil a Kingdom that had deſerved ſo well at his hands in perpetual Wars. But it was for his convenience that King <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould be diverted from troubling him in <hi>Italy,</hi> and convenience at <hi>Rome</hi> is a juſt Excuſe for the worſt Actions. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when <hi>Philip</hi> by force of Arms had baffled his Holineſs, as well as all the other Pretenders, and had reduced the Kingdom to his Obedience, the Pope made no ſcruple to acknowledge his Title, and treat him as rightful King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Nor did he in this deviate from the practice of thoſe that went before him, the Popes having on many occaſions found it Turn to account to approve the Titles of the moſt Illegal Uſurpers, ever ſince the extraordinary complaiſance of <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> which gave Riſe to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Grandeur of the Holy See.</p>
               <p>But <hi>John</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> the preſent King's Father, who had an undoubted Right to the Crown, met with other uſage at <hi>Rome,</hi> of which I ſhall here give a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54374:103"/>
ſhort Account, it being a moſt ſignal proof of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Devotion to the Holy See; but withal it has ſo far opened the eyes of this Court, that the Miniſters ſeem to be convinced at laſt of this truth, that none are ſo hardly uſed by thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they that deſerve beſt at their hands: This is certain, that the Memory of it is ſtill freſh in their minds, as the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> to their great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret are frequently given to underſtand, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in a great meaſure the cauſe why their Conduct in regard to <hi>Rome,</hi> begins to vary ſo much as it does from that of their Predeceſſors. After King <hi>John</hi> had been ſettled in the Throne of his Anceſtors, by the Univerſal Acclamation of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was poſſeſſed of all the Dominions belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown, the little Town of <hi>Ceuta</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, he began to think of ſending a Solemn Embaſſy to pay his Obedience to the Pope, which is a cuſtom obſerv'd by all Princes of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was thought neceſſary by this King, as well to ſatisfie his own Devotion, as to eſtabliſh his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among the People; and he thought he had great reaſon to expect, that this Embaſſy would be very kindly received; for to ſay nothing of the merits of his Anceſtors, he relied much upon the Pope's great Partiality to the <hi>French,</hi> who out of enmity to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had eſpouſed the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Intereſt, and ſolicited their cauſe at <hi>Rome.</hi> To render this Embaſſy the more acceptable, he made choice of a Perſon that was of the firſt Quality, and withal a Biſhop <hi>Dom Miguel de Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> Brother to the <hi>Conde de Vimioſo.</hi> But this Ambaſſador arriving at <hi>Rome,</hi> found that he had been ſent upon a fruitleſs Errand. For the Pope as little as he cared for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on all other occaſions, had ſo much reſpect for them at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54374:104"/>
this time, that for fear of diſpleaſing them, he was content to put the greateſt Indignity in the World upon a King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> This was <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> from whom better things might been expected than from thoſe that uſually fill the Holy Chair. But his Holineſs without having the leaſt regard to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's Character or Quality, or the obliging Meſſage he came upon, refuſed to admit him into his Preſence, or ſuffer his Miniſters to acknowledge him for an Ambaſſador, ſo that after a whole years Solicitation for Audience, he was fain to return as he came. This the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> thought to be an Indignity that could not have been put upon the Repreſentative of any Idolatrous or Mahometan Prince, without violating the Laws of Nations. All the Favour that could be obtain'd at that time, was, That a Congregation ſhould be appoinned on pretence of conſulting what was fit to be done in the Caſe. The Congregation conſiſted of the two <hi>Barbarini Cayetan,</hi> and <hi>Pamphilio;</hi> Cardinal <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco,</hi> the elder of the <hi>Barbarini</hi> was made Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to take care that the reſult ſhould be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Uncle's mind. He obliged the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Embaſſy to give him an account of the King his Maſter's Title, and when nothing could be objected againſt that, he began to pick Quarrels upon pretence that the Eccleſiaſtical Immunities had been violated in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſome very great affront given to the Apoſtolical Collector; and when Reparation was offered to theſe Grievances, his Eminence gave the Secretary to underſtand, that he grew troubleſome: But <hi>Pamphilio,</hi> who it ſeems, was not of the ſecret, was clearly of Opinion, that that the Ambaſſadors of King <hi>John</hi> ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, at leaſt after he had been four years in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion (ſuppoſing him to be an Uſurper) and to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54374:104"/>
juſtifie his Opinion, he wrote, as 'tis ſaid, a large and learned Diſcourſe, but when Cardinal <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> came to be Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> he was quite of another mind, and would not be perſuaded that fourteen years Poſſeſſion were ſufficient to qualifie this King, to ſend an Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Exaltation of this Cardinal to the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, King <hi>John</hi> reſolves to make another Tender of his Obedience to the Holy See, but for fear of meeting with the like affront as before, he ſignifi'd his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter then reſiding at <hi>Rome,</hi> and received for anſwer, That his Ambaſſador, in caſe he ſent any thither, ſhould not be ſuffered to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Gates of the City. However, his Holineſs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prick'd with remorſe for his barbarous Uſage of this Prince, or perhaps willing to make his Injuſtice known to the World, in order to inhance his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> appointed another Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to conſider of the matter. In this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation the caſe was again Examined and Debated, and it plainly appear'd, that according to the Civil and Canon-Laws, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ambaſſador ought to be admitted, even ſuppoſing his Maſter's Title were diſputable, ſo that it were granted with the Reſerve, <hi>ſine Praejudicio Tertij.</hi> This Reſult, as little favourable as it was, to one whom they at <hi>Rome</hi> could not but know to be a Rightful King, inſtead of being notified to the Party moſt concern'd, was ſent to <hi>Madrid</hi> to be communicated by the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> there to the Miniſters of that Court, his Holineſs not having the Courage to do any thing that had the leaſt appearance of Juſtice, without leave firſt had from them. It was indeed for his Intereſt to keep in if it were poſſible with both Parties, but if that could not be done, the weaker was to be Sacrifi'd to him that could do his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54374:105"/>
moſt miſchief. However, before ſo beneficial a Province as <hi>Portugal</hi> was utterly abandon'd, the <hi>Nuncio</hi> at a Conference with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, made uſe of all his Cunning to draw them in to conſent, that his Maſter might act in this Caſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Juſtice, and what is more as his Intereſt obliged him, and to make the thing go down the more eaſie with them, he avoided as much as was poſſible coming to the merits of the Cauſe, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the leaſt intimation that his Maſter approved of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Right to the Crown. He allowed that Prince to deſerve all the ill names that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were pleas'd to give him, and after all, ſhow'd that his Maſter thought himſelf obliged in Conſcience to admit of his Ambaſſador, ſtating the Caſe in theſe moſt obliging Terms: <hi rend="margQuotes">That the Pope as Chriſt's Vicar is under an indiſpenſable Obligation, to uſe all means for preſerving the Purity of the Catholick Faith throughout the World; the firſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof is Obedience paid by a publick Act to the Apoſtolick See, and ſworn by Princes in their own, and their Subjects behalf; and ſince the Habit of Faith is conſiſtent with ſinful Acts in the ſame Subject, the Pope might, and was bound to receive from a Robber and a perjur'd Perſon, a ſolemn promiſe of Perſeverance in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith; ſo that though the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> held the Duke of <hi>Bragança</hi> for a Robber that had uſurped the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Perſon that had violated his Oath of Fealty to King <hi>Philip,</hi> yet the Vicar of Chriſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs under an indiſpenſable obligation to receive him as a faithful Son of the Church, by that Solmn Act which his Ambaſſador ſhould perform in his Name, at the feet of his Holineſs.</hi>

The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, who by their frequent practice with thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> were as ready at their Quirks, as the <hi>Nuncio</hi> himſelf anſwered him in his own way: <hi rend="margQuotes">That his Holineſs might as in duty bound, receive the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> as a private Perſon, but it would be a manifeſt Juſtice to admit of him as King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> beſides, it had never been cuſtomary for thoſe Dukes to ſend publick Embaſſys to the Soveraign Pontiffs, nor did they ever in that manner pay their Obedience to the Apoſtolick See. This being a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent only upon true and lawful Kings, and Obedience having been already paid by King <hi>Philip,</hi> as rightful King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> no Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy could be received from the Duke of <hi>Bragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ça.</hi> That a Robbery, as the Law teaches, did not deprive the Owner of the Poſſeſſion of a thing ſtolen; for though in fact he be no longer in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, yet he retains it ſtill in his mind, and for that reaſon, all Contracts made with the Thief are invalid for want of a lawful Poſſeſſion, from whence it follow'd that the Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no lawful Poſſeſſion, could not do any Act that ſuppoſes it.</hi>
               </p>

conſequence, would be the introduction of Calviniſm, or of ſome other Hereſie, by reaſon of the Neighbourhood and Correſpondence of that Kingdom with the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, in which caſe the conqueſt of <hi>Portugal</hi> would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt difficult, for all Sectaries being to be chaſtiſed not with ordinary Puniſhments, but according to the Rigor of the Canons, the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes</hi> ſeeing themſelves branded with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mark of Ignominy, would grow deſperate, and chooſe rather to die than in any caſe put themſelves into the Power of King <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </hi> But here the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters took him up ſhort, and told him, that theſe were Sophiſtical Subtilities, and not fair Arguments, without vouchſafeing them any further anſwer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſeeing that this way of arguing would not ſerve the turn, betook himſelf to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quoting Precedents from the proceedings of former Popes in the Caſes of Princes, whoſe Titles were diſputable, and thereby demonſtrated it to have been conſtant practice of the Holy See, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch as were Kings <hi>de facto</hi> without any regard to right; alledging to this purpoſe a ſaying of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>2d. Moris eſt ſedis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicae eum Regem appellare qui Regnum tenet,</hi> and the practice of the ſame Pope, both in the Caſe of <hi>Matthias Corvinus,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> contending about the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Renè,</hi> about the Kingdom of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> to which <hi>Renè</hi> pretending while <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was in Poſſeſſion, was put off by the Pope with this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; <hi>Siquid juris competit ablatum eſt Ferdinando Regni Principes, Duces Comites, &amp; Populares om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes obediunt, eumque ſibi Regem conſtitui expetive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> But the <hi>Nuncio</hi> not content with one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54374:107"/>
brings in that of Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> who being conſulted what account was to be made of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> (the later Kings of the <hi>Merovig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Race) they having the Name and Dignity, but others (the Mayres of the Palace) the Power; determined the Queſtion with this Anſwer; <hi>That he ought to be ſtiled King, and held for ſuch who was found Reigning, and who as King had the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of the Common-wealth in his hands.</hi> Of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> who received the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> he being in Poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Of <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in publick Conſiſtory the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as he did likewiſe thoſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> when they came to pay Obedience to the Holy See; He ſhow'd likewiſe that the ſame thing had been done, for <hi>Alfonſo Henriquez</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> notwithſtanding the great Oppoſition and Power of the Kings of <hi>Leon</hi> and <hi>Caſtille,</hi> for <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Caſtille</hi> the Murtherer of his King and Brother <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> againſt the conſent and right of <hi>Conſtança Pedro</hi>'s Daughter, and for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> to the Prejudice of <hi>D. Joanna</hi> the only Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Inſtances were all home to the Point, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Title to be as bad as his Enemies would have it; for let him be a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Uſurper, Tyrant, or what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there had been as bad or worſe acknowledged for lawful Kings, and highly careſſed by the Holy See. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had another way to deal with the <hi>Nuncio</hi> than diſputing; they offered indeed at ſomething of an anſwer to all theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, affirming without the leaſt grounds, that the greateſt part of the Princes now mentioned, ſent their Ambaſſadors, not to pay their Obedience,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54374:108"/>
but to plead their Cauſe, and juſtify their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and in that caſe granted it to be lawful for the Popes to receive them. But to admit of an Ambaſſador from <hi>Dom John,</hi> as King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> after that the Kings of <hi>Caſtille</hi> have been in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Kingdom for the ſpace of 60 Years, and ſworn to as lawful Sovereigns was, they ſaid, a manifeſt injury to their cauſe. They thought that there was no account to be made of any thing done or ſaid by <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> becauſe that Pope was guided only by his Intereſt, and varied in his Sentiments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; and as for the Kings of <hi>France</hi> that were acknowledged by Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> they muſt needs, ſay the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been Rightful and Lawful Kings, ſince the Oracle of the Holy See had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them for ſuch, for otherwiſe this grand Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would follow, that Popes were no better than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries, Inſtigators of Rebellion and Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inſtead of promoting Equity and Virtue, gave encouragment to the moſt abominable Practiſes; and in concluſion, they told the <hi>Nuncio</hi> that the Pope had beſt conſider well what was juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, for otherwiſe they ſhould take ſuch Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as might not be well pleaſing to his Holineſs, but to ſweeten the menace a little; they added that however, they ſhould always retain that moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Devotion, which the Catholick Kings above all other Princes have ever born in mind, and teſtify'd by their Actions towards the Apoſtolical See.</p>
               <p>Their meaning was underſtood well enough at <hi>Rome,</hi> and this Intimation of what they ſhould do, gave a ſtrange force to their Arguments, and ſo confirm'd the wavering Pope, that he remained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after ſteady to their Intereſt. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had apparently all the Right on their ſide, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Maſters of <hi>Milan, Naples</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54374:108"/>
From this time forward Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> turned a deaf Ear to all that could be ſaid in Favour of King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and could never be brought to grant him that which was never deny'd to an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. That Prince had his Agents continually ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing for him at <hi>Rome,</hi> in his own Name, and in behalf of the Clergy, and of the three Eſtates of the Kingdom, but all to no purpoſe: The <hi>French</hi> made the moſt preſſing Inſtances in his behalf, but the Pope did not mind them at that time; for <hi>France</hi> being embroil'd with inteſtine Diſſentions, He was ſure they could do him no harm. Great Court and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was made to <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> as we are told by the <hi>Conde da Ericeyra,</hi> who obſerves that ſhe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom uſed to fail in any Temporal Buſineſs that ſhe undertook, alluding I ſuppoſe to a Saying to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which was current at that time in the Courts of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes, where upon any Diſappointment of their Affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> were ſure to be told, That, <hi>if the Buſineſs had been ſolicited by</hi> Donna Olympia, <hi>it had never miſcarried:</hi> But on this occaſion, <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> her ſelf could do no good, for either ſhe did not heartily eſpouſe the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s cauſe, or if ſhe did, all her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices were ineffectual upon the obdurate Pontiff. All the anſwer that could be got from this and the former Pope, beſides thoſe frivolous Complaints before mention'd, (for which ſatisfaction was ſtill offered) was, that the Pope as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father of Chriſtendom, thought himſelf bound to carry it equally between <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and not acknowledge or oblige one Son when it could not be done without offence to the other; but the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> could not perſwade themſelves that in this caſe, He in any ſort acted the part of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father, whilſt to gratify the unreaſonable Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54374:109"/>
of the one, he did not ſtick wholly to caſt off the other, and to uſe him in a more barbarous manner than he could have done an Infidel. But in ſhort the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were very rugged in their Threats, and that ſtood them in ſtead of Right and Merit; the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> valuing themſelves upon their blind Obedience to the Holy See kept within the terms of Reſpect, which inſtead of gaining ought upon thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> gave encouragement to their Inſolence.</p>
               <p>Had King <hi>John</hi> but follow'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or come to any vigorous Reſolution, he had doubtleſs ſoon brought his Holineſs to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or he might have had a fair opportunity to vindicate his Country's Liberty, in a yet more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner, than he had done already by ſhaking off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke. For we muſt know, that all theſe Applications to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not made to the end only that his Title might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged there, but in order to have the vacant Sees in his Dominions ſupplied with Biſhops; for in a few years after the Revolution, there was but one Biſhop remaining in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and he not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident upon his Dioceſs, being obliged to attend the Court, and there was a like want of them in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in the <hi>Madera</hi> and <hi>Cap Verde</hi> Iſlands, and upon the Coaſts of <hi>Africa;</hi> the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> therefore laboured all they could to make his Holineſs ſenſible of the miſerable ſtate of their Churches thus deſtitute of Paſtors, petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a ſupply, the King according to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of his Anceſtors, propoſing the Perſons for that end, and to remove all Objections, he agreed that his Nomination of the Biſhops ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with the Clauſe, <hi>ſine Praejudicio Tertij;</hi> notwithſtanding its being a clear Maxim in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54374:109"/>
and confirmed by the practice of the Roman Church, That the ſimple poſſeſſion of an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, City or Territory, that has <hi>Jus Patronatus</hi> annext to it, gives the right of Preſentation to the Poſſeſſor; but neither the reaſon of the thing, nor the deſolate condition of the Orphan Churches, could have any weight upon the obſtinate Pope: He was more apprehenſive of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Threats, than the loſs of Millions of Souls, all that could be got from him was, that He would appoint Biſhops for <hi>Portugal,</hi> on condition, that he might name them <hi>de motu proprio;</hi> he offered indeed another very ſtrange Conceſſion, which was, that the Biſhops he choſe of his own mere motion, ſhould be the very ſame Perſons that the King had named. But the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> could not agree to this Propoſal, for this among other Reaſons, that the Popes might make it a Precedent, for aſſuming to themſelves a Right of nominating Biſhops in after times, which would prove a great grievance to the Nation, ſince the Benefices that were already at his Diſpoſal, were generally the worſt ſupply'd.</p>
               <p>Things being thus at a ſtand, the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church undertook the cauſe of her Siſter of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and took the liberty to mind the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Duty in a Letter, written by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates aſſembled in a Synod, which was preſented in their Name by Cardinal <hi>Franciſco Barbarini,</hi> but the Pope at that time had as little regard to the <hi>French</hi> Church, as he had to the <hi>French</hi> Coutt: The Clergy of that Kingdom ſent their Agent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to take care of the concerns of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Church as well as their own; the Biſhops whom King <hi>John</hi> had nominated, ſent their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition to his Holineſs, that they might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Exerciſe of their Charge, and their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54374:110"/>
Petition was rejected with ſcorn; the Cardinals of the <hi>French</hi> Faction did all the good Offices they could, but to no purpoſe: <hi>Eſte</hi> ſignalized himſelf in a very particular manner on this occaſion, the Pope taking notice that he loytered about the City more than became him, ordered him one day to his Dioceſs, ſaying, That it went againſt his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſee him abſent from it ſo long, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal who was Young and Reſolute anſwered, <hi>That his Holineſs had a great deal of reaſon to be thus ſcrupulous, but being ſo much concerned as he was for one ſingle Church, he ought not wholly to neglect ſo many as there were in</hi> Portugal <hi>unprovided of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and therefore he conjur'd him before God, and in the Name of the King of</hi> France, <hi>from whom he had Commiſſion ſo to do, that he would ſpeedily grant Biſhops to that Kingdom.</hi> The Pope not a little ſurpriz'd at ſo brisk an Attack, was going away without making any other reply than, ſaying, <hi>I ſhall pluck the Cap from off that Boy's Head; Eſte</hi> turns to him again, and crys, <hi>If you do, I ſhall put on another of Iron,</hi> and thereupon retires to his Houſe, fills it with Armed Men, plants Guns at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. But this being the Act of a young Man, was of no Conſequence.</p>
               <p>But had the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> been ſo reſolute in their own cauſe, there is no doubt but they had ſoon put an end to this trouble; nor did they want being ſet in a way to free themſelves from all fear of ever having the like again. For ſeeing themſelves caſt off by the Pope in ſo unworthy a manner, they had recourſe (as 'tis affirm'd in a Letter, or Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the three Eſtates to the Pope) to the moſt celebrated Univerſities and Doctors in <hi>Europe,</hi> to know their Opinions concerning that courſe which was fitteſt for them to take in this Caſe, the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54374:110"/>
anſwers they received as they are ſet down in that Letter, are as follow.</p>
               <p>Some were of Opinion, that the beſt way to bring the Pope to Reaſon, was to take care that no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould go out of the Kingdom to <hi>Rome</hi> upon any account whatſoever, whether for Matrimonial Diſpenſations, or Renunciations of Benefices; that all beneficed <hi>Portugueſes</hi> abroad, ſhould be called home upon pain of having their Profits ſequeſtred; that no Penſions be paid to any Perſons reſiding at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether Subjects or Strangers, with other things which the Eſtates out of their great Reſpect to the Holy See conceal. Of this Advice, as they ſay, were ſome belonging to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Others would have had the King call a National Council, wherein the Clergy might elect a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, who ſhould govern the Kingdom in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, with the Power to Inſtitute and Conſecrate Biſhops, which belonged to Patriarchs according to the Ancient Canons.</p>
               <p>Others thought that the Biſhops nominated by the King, and propoſed to the Pope, who had not rejected them by any expreſs Act of denial, might immediately enter upon their Charge, and exerciſe the ſame, ſince the Pope neglected to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in the ordinary way, and yet had no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt them, for he had offered to confirm them <hi>de motu proprio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth was the opinion of a learned Fryar, who thought that in this caſe of neceſſity, they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to have recourſe to the way of chooſing Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops anciently practiſed and approved of by the Canons, and uſed in the Church as he aſſerted for a much longer time than any other Method, <hi>viz.</hi> For the Chapter of each Dioceſs to chooſe their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54374:111"/>
own Biſhop, and that the Elect being approved of by the Clergy, People and King, and conſecrated by other Biſhops, the moſt ancient of the Order, in caſe of want ſupplying the place of a Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan, might immediately enter upon his Charge without waiting for the Pope's confirmation, which in this caſe was not neceſſary, it being, ſaith the Author of this Advice, the trueſt and moſt certain Opinion, and follow'd by moſt Authors, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops upon their Conſecration receive their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity immediately from God. This he affirm'd to be grounded upon the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>1ſt. Gal.</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith, that he had receiv'd his Apoſtleſhip from God alone, and not from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, no not from St. <hi>Peter</hi> the chief of them: <hi>Paulus Apoſtolus non ab hominibus neque per hominem, ſed per Jeſum Chriſtum,</hi> and in the 2 Chap. <hi>Mihi nihil contulerunt unt aliquid eſſe, nihil</hi> i. e. <hi>nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam Juriſdictionem, nullam Dignitatem, nullam Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatem.</hi> They that were of this Opinion ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That it is clearly proved from Chriſt's words to the Apoſtles, <hi>ſicut me miſit Pater in mundum &amp; Ego vos mitto in illum;</hi> whence ſay they, St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> gather that our Lord gave as much Power and Authority to his Apoſtles, when he ſent them into the World to Preach, as he did to St. <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Quodcunque ligaveris ſuper Terram erit ligatum &amp; in caelis, &amp; quodcunque ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veris ſuper Terram erit ſolutum &amp; in caelis</hi> (it ſhould be <hi>ligaveritis &amp; ſolveritis,</hi> the words being ſpoken to all the Apoſtles in the Plural <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>&amp;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18.) the reaſon is becauſe the words are abſolute, and will admit of no interpretation: from whence it was infer'd, that Biſhops ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtles in their ordinary Office, ſucceed them likewiſe in the ordinary Juriſdiction annext
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54374:111"/>
to that Office; and ſince it cannot be denied, but that the Apoſtles received their Authority immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Chriſt, it muſt be acknowledged that Biſhops upon their Conſecration do ſo receive it likewiſe, and therefore have no need that any other ſhould inveſt them with the Authority they are poſſeſs'd of already.</p>
               <p>Two other Opinions were Printed and ſent into <hi>Portugal</hi> upon this occaſion, both concurring in one concluſion, though different ways were taken to it; that which both agreed in was, that <hi>Portugal</hi> might and was in duty bound, to proceed to the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Biſhops nominated by the King. One of the Authors of this Concluſion aſſerted, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Divine appointment, the Right of Election was in the Clergy and People, after the ſame manner as it was practiſed in the Primitive Church, and a long time after; which Right, he ſaid, was afterwards transferred to the Emperors and Princes, who had Authority in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, in order to the good Government of the Common-wealth, Eccleſiaſtical and Civil matters, having that mutual Dependence upon each other, that they are inſeparable: That the Popes have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Right of naming Biſhops, by the Tacit conſent and liberality of Princes, and this was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the rather, becauſe, Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline was much ſlack'ned, partly by the remiſneſs of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, partly by their being taken up in Military Affairs. But in caſe the Pope ſhould become guilty of the like failure, the ſame Right devolved again to the Princes, as given up and abandoned by the Pope. It was affirm'd likewiſe, that this Right had actually been put in practice on ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even in theſe later times, particularly in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille,</hi> where in the Year 1399. Biſhops were choſen
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54374:112"/>
and Conſecrated without any Confirmation from the Pope; King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> during the great Schiſm, having renounced the Authority of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> and committed the Adminiſtration of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs to the Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, willing them to make the ſame Proviſions as had been uſed to come from the Pope.</p>
               <p>Others who were for the ſame things in effect, aſſerted, That according to the ancient Canons, it belonged to the Prelates of each Kingdom to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and conſecrate Biſhops, before the Popes had reſerv'd that Power to themſelves, and undertook to prove that the ſame thing ought <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi> to be done in the preſent Caſe: To have Biſhops in the Church was, they ſaid, <hi>de Jure Divino &amp; Naturali,</hi> ſince they are Shepherds of the Souls which cannot all be taken care of by the Pope, but their being to be confirm'd by the Pope before their Conſecration, is only <hi>de Jure Humano,</hi> the Obligation whereof ceaſes, not only in caſes of <hi>extreme</hi> neceſſity, but in that which is called <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſima.</hi> That it could not be denied, but the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Churches of <hi>Portugal</hi> for Biſhops at that time was <hi>Graviſſima,</hi> and that of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions thereof in other parts of the World <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This grand <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the Papal Empire, that Biſhops may be made out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and without the Pope's concurrence, being thus happily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were now put in a fair way to reſtore the Ancient Diſcipline to their Church, and with it proſperity to their Nation, it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the Miſeries they labour under, as well as the horrible Corruptions in their Religion, are no other than the neceſſary Effects of the Papal Uſurpation and Tyranny; and it appears that King
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54374:112"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> did for ſome time, approve of the good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that had been given him, at leaſt that he would have it thought ſo at <hi>Rome,</hi> for he ordered his Agent there, to get a Remonſtrance to be put into the Pope's hands, wherein among other things he declares; <hi>That he had been aſſured by very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, that when acceſs and recourſe to the Holy See could not be had, it belonged to the Chapters to chooſe their Biſhops upon his Nomination, according as it had formerly been practiſed in</hi> Spain, <hi>and was ſtill obſerved in ſome places, that his Holineſs had no reaſon to be diſſatisfi'd, if he took up with this Reſolution, after he had ſuffered himſelf to be ſo much ſlighted, while he had the Remedy in his own hands; that if his Holineſs were finally reſolved to prefer the Intereſts of</hi> Caſtille <hi>to his juſt Rights, he for his part would juſtifie himſelf before all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes, ſo that the blame of what followed ſhould never be laid on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the King proceeded ſo far as to convince the Pope that he was in earneſt, he had brought him no doubt to his own terms, or elſe might have done that, for which his Poſterity and Country would have the greateſt cauſe to bleſs his Memory, that is, have ſhaken off that intolerable Yoke, under which they are now ſinking. The very mention of having Biſhops choſen by the Chapters upon the King's Nomination, put <hi>Innocent</hi> into a terrible Fright; he had nothing to ſay againſt the practice, or the neceſſity of it in the preſent caſe. But here the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> interpos'd its Authority, and delivered the <hi>Pope</hi> from the Agony he was in, by condemning the two laſt Opinions, and that for a reaſon which comprehends the reſt; they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Pope as Univerſal Head of the Roman Church, to have all Monarchical Power, and to be the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54374:113"/>
Fountain of all Spiritual Juriſdiction, which cannot be derived to Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters without his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Conceſſion and Will.</hi> This peremptory ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> put a ſtop to all further Proceedings in this Affair: The Pope reaſſumed new Courage, and continued as Inſolent as ever, after the King's Declaration had brought him to his Wits-end; for as the <hi>Conde da Ericeyra</hi> in his <hi>Portugal Reſtaurado</hi> tells the World, his Holineſs did not ſtick to declare, That the <hi>Holy Office had delivered him out of the greateſt Perplexity, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a knot, which of himſelf he durſt not meddle with:</hi> The ſame noble Author tell us, That the King deſiſted from his Reſolution, for no other reaſon, but becauſe the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> did not approve of it, while there were, as he ſaith, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of learned Men, both within and without the Kingdom, ready to juſtifie and maintain it; ſo that according to the <hi>Conde,</hi> it is to the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> owe the continuance of their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and there is no queſtion, but they did their utmoſt to obſtruct the King's Deſign (ſuppoſing that he had a real intention to ſhake off the Roman Yoke;) for ſhould the Church of <hi>Portugal</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Liberty, and have her Biſhops reſtored to their juſt Authority, the <hi>Holy Office</hi> muſt fall of courſe, were the deſign of that Office no other than is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it is at beſt but an encroachment upon the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction; for to the Biſhops it belongs of right to give Judgment in matters of Religion, and ſuperintend the Diſcipline of the Church, and they all along exerciſed this Juriſdiction which they derive through the Apoſtles from <hi>Chriſt</hi> with that Gentleneſs, Tenderneſs and Charity, as became the true Fathers of the Church, till the Popes began to uſurp the whole Power to themſelves, or impart
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54374:113"/>
it to Creatures of their own; and among the reſt, to theſe Wolves of <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> whom in the heighth of their Tyranny, they let looſe upon the Church to diſpoſſeſs the Shepherds and ravage the Flock; but ſhould an end be put to the Papal Uſurpations, there would be no further occaſion for <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and therefore it had been no wonder, if of their own heads they made this deſperate Effort to preſerve their Maſter and themſelves. But in Truth, had King <hi>John</hi> been fully bent to break with <hi>Rome,</hi> it is much to be queſtion'd, whether all the Power of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> as great as it is ſuppos'd to be, could have fruſtrated his deſign; for in reality, this <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal</hi> ſince its laſt eſtabliſhment in <hi>Portugal,</hi> hath had its chief ſupport from the Kings, who on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions have maintain'd it in ſpight of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. Had the King withdrawn his Protection, it is not unlikely but the Biſhops of themſelves, might have made their Party good: For the People doubtleſs would prefer their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that of the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> as chuſing rather to be under the Diſcipline of a Father, than in the hands of thoſe barbarous Executioners. Beſides it was an eaſie matter for the King to hinder the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors</hi> from giving him any trouble, ſome of the chief of them ow'd their lives to his Mercy; the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> General for one, who ſtood convicted as a Principal of the moſt horrible Treaſon that ever Traitor was charg'd with, it was for no leſs a Crime, than a deſign to murther the King, fire the City, and betray his Country to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> It is ſaid, that in order to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Treaſon, the Holy Houſe had been fill'd with Arms, and that which made the Plot the more remarkable, the undermanagers of it were ſome of the leading Men among the <hi>New Chriſtians,</hi> againſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54374:114"/>
whom the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> was erected, and upon whom the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> for the moſt part exerciſe their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities, and thereby gain what favour they have with the People; for the reſt of the <hi>Portuguſes</hi> bear a mortal hatred againſt thoſe among them that go by the Name of <hi>New Chriſtians,</hi> whom theſe Impoſtors repreſent as <hi>Jews</hi> in their hearts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that their Jewiſh blood makes them ſuch whether they will or no. But on this occaſion it was obſerved, That the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> and the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> were of accord together to deſtroy their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and it is very likely that the King, had he pleaſed, might have rendered the one as odious to the people as the other was. But he took other meaſures, and though ſeveral Noble Men of the firſt Quality were Executed for this Plot, yet the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor</hi> General was ſpared for fear of violating the Eccleſiaſtical Immunities; yet it was as much as His Majeſty could do to preſerve him, and ſome others of the Conſpirators from being torn to pieces by the Rabble.</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons I am perſwaded; that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderations might concur with the authority of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> to with hold the King from with drawing his Obedience from the Pope, what they were I ſhall not pretend to gueſs at. It is certain that this Prince was ſo ill adviſed, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the Counſels of Wiſe and Learned Men, he would never make uſe of any other remedy but Supplications, and moſt humble ſubmiſſions to his Holineſs, and he was ever after deſpiſed and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Rome</hi> accordingly. For this great Deference of his to the Holy See, made thoſe he had to deal with there, preſume the more upon his Patience, and reject with the greater contempt all the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were offered up in his behalf.</p>

The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> do not uſe to grow tame under Indignities, one would think therefore that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould begin to reſent this barbarous Uſage, of their King and themſelves: And its true, they ſhew'd themſelves to be not altogether inſenſible on this occaſion; for in the Year 1653. ſix years after the King's Remonſtrance had been given to the Pope, the three Eſtates of the Realm publiſh a kind of Manifeſt, Entituled, The <hi>Bleatings [Bali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos] of the Churches of</hi> Portugal, <hi>after the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Paſtor the Pope;</hi> wherein they give a moſt lamentable account of their Grievances, and how rigorouſly the Holy Father had dealt with them, and to make their Patience appear the more meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, they let his Holineſs underſtand, that they might have remedied themſelves if they had a mind to it, ſetting forth at large the opinions of the Learned on their Caſe, and the reaſons they were grounded on, which yet inſtead of making a right uſe of them, they ſet themſelves after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to confute, and afterwards enter'd a ſolemn <hi>Proteſt,</hi> which ſince it contains the ſubſtance of their anſwers to the advice their Friends had given them; I ſhall here ſet down, that the World may ſee, upon what ſolid grounds the three Eſtates of a Kingdom thought fit to intail the moſt intolerable Yoke of Bondage upon themſelves and their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>They declare, <hi>That they hold it for an infallible Truth, that the Pope as he is Chriſt's Vicar on Earth, Univerſal Paſtor of the Church, and the lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>is the Sovereign Monarch of the Church; all the Authority and Power of other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters being derived wholly from him, which he may ſuſpend and limit in what form and manner he thinks convenient, it being unlawful for any other Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54374:115"/>
to intermeddle with his Government, ſecular Princes having nothing to do in the Affairs belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church, any further than contributing to her Defence and Proſperity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>though various methods have been uſed for the Election and Confirmation of Biſhops, yet it is an undoubted Truth, that it hath always been with the expreſs, or at leaſt the</hi> Tacit <hi>Approbation of the Pope, who has appointed and conſented to thoſe ſeveral ways, according to the different circumſtances of the Times, nor hath it been ever proved,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that there were Biſhops at any time without this confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Particularly they confeſs, and hold for certain, that in the Primitive Church, after the Apoſtles times, this Power returned to and remained in the Pope: That if Biſhops were afterwards choſen by the Clergy and People, it was by the Pope's Permiſſion; if ſecular Princes in thoſe times intermeddled in theſe Elections, either by conceſſion from the Pope, or by their own Authority with an Uſurpative Right; yet they had never any true Right of their own to do it, and for this reaſon, the</hi> Apoſtles in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Church, forbad them to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in theſe matters, <hi>and if any Princes pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, the Popes ſeverely cenſured and checked them for it, and they coming to underſtand from whence they had this Right, were brought at laſt to lay it aſide, and by this means it came to paſs that no Reſpect was had to Princes, or the conſent of the People, but the Power of Elections remained by the Pope's Authority in the Clergy and Fryars of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and at laſt in the Chapters alone: And thus it continued to the Pontificate of</hi> Boniface <hi>the</hi> 8th. <hi>and</hi> Clement <hi>the</hi> 5th. <hi>who began to reſerve the Power of inſtituting Biſhops to themſelves in ſome Caſes, and after that,</hi> Innocent <hi>the</hi> 4th. <hi>by</hi> a Rule in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54374:115"/>
                  <hi>reſerved it wholly to the Apoſtolical See.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that,</hi> ſay they, <hi>This Prerogative and Right to create Biſhops was always in the Pope as 'tis at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; they acknowledge indeed that even after the</hi> Rule in Chancery <hi>came to be in force, many Princes continued to nominate Biſhops for their own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Dominions; but this was by Conceſſion from the Pope, or upon Preſumption of a Privilege ariſing by Cuſtom approv'd of by the Apoſtolical See. But that it was in the Pope's breaſt to receive or reject their Nomination, which did no more than capacitate the Perſon named to procure the Pope's Confirmation, and ſue out the Apoſtolical Bulls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is likewiſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>An undoubted Truth, that the Power of Election which hath formerly been in the Chapter, is now wholly extinguiſhed by means of the Reſervation made by the</hi> Rule in Chancery; <hi>ſo that at this time, the Pope's Creation or Inſtitution of Biſhops, cannot properly be called a Confirmation, becauſe Confirmation ſuppoſeth a preceding Election, but Elections are now wholly aboliſhed, by reaſon and virtue of the aforeſaid</hi> Rule in Chancery; <hi>and laſtly, they hold for certain, that notwithſtanding there was a time when Patriarchs, Metropolitans, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Councils had power to confirm Biſhops, they have now no ſuch Power, nor can they exerciſe it in any caſe, ſince they enjoy'd it only by the Pope's permiſſion, and while there was place for Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before Elections were aboliſhed, when the Power to appoint Biſhops had not been yet reſerved by the Pope to himſelf,</hi> viz. <hi>by the aforeſaid</hi> Rule in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</p>
               <p>Had an Agent from <hi>Rome,</hi> or an Inquiſitor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued after this manner, it had been no wonder, ſince daily experience ſhows how far Intereſt and Paſſion will blind a Man's Reaſon, and what ſilly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54374:116"/>
Arguments ſhall ſerve the turn for want of better, when one is prepoſſeſt with hopes of ſome vaſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by gaining the cauſe; but for the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of a Nation, after what had been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to them from Scripture and Fathers, from the conſtant Tradition and uniform practice of the Catholick Church, thus to renounce their Senſe and Reaſon, in order only to enſlave themſelves when Liberty was offer'd them, is ſuch a Prodigy, that I believe no Hiſtory can furniſh us with a like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Here we have People expoſing their Church and Nation to ruin, becauſe a Negative was never proved, it having never been demonſtrated to them, that Popes did not Tacitly conſent to the Election of Biſhops, in which for ſo many Ages together, they had nothing at all to do, no more than a King of <hi>France</hi> has to do in the choice of a King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and would the <hi>Poles</hi> think we be content to abandon their Country to the miſchiefs of an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum,</hi> and ſubmit their Necks to the Yoke of a Foreign Tyrant, becauſe it can never be made out, that their Kings have not been made by his Tacit Conſent, but when I ſee People laying ſo much ſtreſs upon the Tacit Conſent of the Popes, for my part, I do not at all wonder that they aſcribe ſo much virtue to a Rule in the Pope's Chancery, that it ſhall be able to deſtroy the whole Hierarchy, and turn into an Arbitrary lawleſs Tyranny, that moſt Regular and Beautiful frame of Government, which hath obtain'd in the Church ever ſince the Apoſtles days. However, theſe Reaſons, ſuch as they were, ſatisfi'd the three Eſtates of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſo that inſtead of helping themſelves as they might and ought, they took up with a Reſolution to throw themſelves wholly at the Holy Father's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and in concluſion of their <hi>Bleatings,</hi> declar'd,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54374:116"/>
That <hi>they would wreſtle with</hi> Chriſt's Vicar, <hi>the</hi> Roman Angel, the Figure of God on Earth, <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the vigour that their love and neceſſity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them with, till they got from him his Bleſſing, and would never let go their hold till his</hi> Apoſtolical Hand <hi>was upon them, and till he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his</hi> moſt Holy Feet <hi>to their</hi> Mouths. The Pope finding them to be thus reſolv'd, thought he was ſure enough of them, and therefore let 'em <hi>Bleat</hi> and <hi>Bray</hi> too as they pleaſed for him; for his part he would trouble his Head no more about them, all his concern was how to oblige and humour the boiſterous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who by their rugged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, were ever and anon, threatning him into a Compliance, with their unjuſt and unreaſonable Pretenſions, He knew not what miſchief they might do him. While the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> took care to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Him that he had nothing to fear from them, and I do not find, but that they ſent in their Money in the uſual courſe, ſo that he loſt but little excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what was to be got by the Biſhop's Bulls, which yet as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would perſwade him, was like to come ſpeedily in all in a lump, they feeding him all along with hopes, that they ſhould make a quick diſpatch of the War. In this ſtate did the Affairs of <hi>Portugal</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> continue for part of <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>8th's</hi> Pontificat, all <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>10th's,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>7th</hi>'s, and till the latter end of <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>9th's,</hi> and during the whole Reigns of this King's Father and Brother; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Dom Pedro</hi>'s coming to the Government, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having made Peace with <hi>Portugal,</hi> and acknowledg'd the King's Title, left his Holineſs at Liberty to do ſo likewiſe.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Portugal</hi> having no ſuch need as before of the Pope's Protection or Favour, and being more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54374:117"/>
at Liberty to make Returns of the ill uſage it had receiv'd; the Bleſſings of <hi>Rome</hi> began to ſhour down upon that favourite Kingdom without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> had a happy Opportunity before he died, to ſignalize his Fatherly Tenderneſs, or rather indulgence towards his preſent Majeſty, and make full amends for all the Rigour uſed by former Popes towards his Father and Brother; for a little before the concluſion of the Peace, <hi>Alfonſo</hi> was depoſed in the manner as hath been related, and <hi>Dom Pedro</hi> poſſeſt of his Throne, and a little after of his Bed, by marrying the Queen, the King his Brother ſtill living, and here was a large Field for the Apoſtolical Graces: For now it was not only the King's Title that was to be acknowledged, but the Prince his Right to his Brother's Wife and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Highneſs found in the Pope all the eaſineſs he could deſire. This Prince did but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Letter written on another occaſion, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſending an Ambaſſador to pay his Obedience, and his Holineſs returns anſwer, <hi>That his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor upon his coming to</hi> Rome, <hi>ſhould as he thought, but juſt meet with a kind and honourable Reception;</hi> no ſcruple was made about the Prince's Right of ſending one, no enquiry into the manner of his taking upon him the Government, nor ſo much as mention made of the Clauſe, <hi>ſine Praejudicio Tertij:</hi> How different was this uſage from what his Father met with? King <hi>John</hi> had an undoubted Right to the Crown, and the ſame was manifeſt to the World; yet his Miniſters were called to account at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſhow the grounds of their Maſter's Title, whereas the Reaſons for depoſing King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo,</hi> and placing <hi>Dom Pedro</hi> in the Throne, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were, were not as yet well known to the Publick; and yet after all, King <hi>John</hi> was treated
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54374:117"/>
like a Traitor and a Robber, and <hi>it was but juſt,</hi> that <hi>Dom Pedro</hi>'s Ambaſſador upon the firſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his coming, <hi>ſhould meet with a kind and honourable Reception at</hi> Rome. The World is not to be informed now, what work they uſed to make at <hi>Rome,</hi> in Cauſes of Divorce, eſpecially, between Royal Parties; and one would think his Holineſs might have taken ſome time to conſider of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave way to a Marriage, which I believe never had a Precedent in the Chriſtian World. But here we have an inſtance of a Queens caſting off her Husband without the leaſt Difficulty, and both that, and her Marriage, with her living Husband's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, confirm'd by his Holineſs, with as much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, as if theſe were things done every day of courſe; ſo that it cannot be denied, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Compliance of this Pope, with the Will and Pleaſure of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Court now in the time of its Proſperity, did equal at leaſt, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the inſolence of his Predeceſſors towards that Nation in its diſtreſs. It is certain, that <hi>Clement</hi> did not a little value himſelf upon his having thus far ſtretch'd the plenitude of his Power in <hi>Dom Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>'s Favour, he thought he had done enough to atone for all Offences, and to inſpire this Prince with as great Devotion towards the Holy See, as any of his Predeceſſors have had before him, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> (ſaith he to him in his Letter on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>Certainly we have labour'd to do you all the Favour in the preſent Cauſe that the ſacred Canons will permit, and we receive the greateſt content up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finding You ſo well pleaſed with this Pontificial Kindneſs.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54374:118"/>
for it to the Goodneſs of the Holy See, and you will perfectly comply with this Obligation, if you go on to ſhow (as truly you do) on all occaſions a greater concern and affection for whatſoever hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Holy See, and the Catholick Religion, imitating herein the Ancient Devotion of the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe <hi>Princes, who placed their Glory in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſame See.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>9th</hi>'s Pontificate laſted not long enough to give him time to beſtow all the Favors that were deſigned for <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Confirmation of the Biſhops being reſerved for his Succeſſor <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> for that was not done till 1670.

of the many Contraſts he hath had with the <hi>Nuncio's;</hi> ſo that his <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Majeſty ſeems now to be in Poſſeſſion of a Right to diſpoſe of a Cap, as well as his <hi>Catholick</hi> or his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty, and the Miniſters here having reſented it, that the <hi>Nunciature</hi> at this Court hath not been an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſtep to the <hi>Cardinalat,</hi> as it is in thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> his preſent Holineſs has equal'd the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to them in this particular, likewiſe by advancing the late Nuncio <hi>Cornaro</hi> to the Purple at the ſame time, as he did the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop at the Promotion which was made for them two only.</p>
               <p>So that by this time the Court of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſeems to have diſcovered the ſecret of gaining Favours at <hi>Rome,</hi> and indeed they appear to be ſomewhat ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that it muſt be a quite different method from that formerly uſed, that will procure the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eſteem, and work him into a Compliance: They begin to taſt and reliſh much the <hi>French</hi> Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, thinking belike that there can be no better Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for <hi>the moſt Obedient Son of the Church</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, than that of his <hi>Eldeſt Brother;</hi> inſomuch, that I find it in a Memoir ſaid to have been drawn up for the Inſtruction of a <hi>Nuncio,</hi> laid down as not the leaſt neceſſary, if not one of the hardeſt parts of his Task to beat out of the Miniſters heads, their fond admiration of the <hi>French</hi> King, and the opinion they have taken up of his infallible Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims with reſpect to <hi>Rome.</hi>

the grant of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> by which the Pope's Bulls are free from a Reviſion in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and which ſeems to be the very Baſis of his abſolute Power in the Kingdom, yet by what the Marqueſs of <hi>Alegrete</hi> ſaith in his Hiſtory of that King, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that they are not wanting who call in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the validity of the Grant, though his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſpeaking there in Quality of an Hiſtorian, leaves the matter to be diſputed by the Lawyers; but as a Miniſter of State, he does that which in effect amounts almoſt to as much, for upon a <hi>Nuncio's</hi> arrival, his Patent of <hi>Legat</hi> is call'd for in order to be Examined by the King's Council, and it hath been detain'd for above ſix Weeks to gether, and at the reſtoring of it, the <hi>Nuncio</hi> hath been told with an Air of Authority, That <hi>the King is not well pleaſed with the Ample Powers contained in that Patent, and expects that the</hi> Nuncio <hi>do not exerciſe it to the full, but keep himſelf within Bounds,</hi> and the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> under this Reign have had the Diſcretion not to exert the utmoſt of their Authority, but it mortifies them that the Court would have it thought, that they oblige them to this Moderation, whereas they would fain ſeem to uſe it of themſelves.</p>
               <p>But there is one thing in difference between the two Courts, which his Holineſs lays much to Heart, and by his Good-will is never like to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from his Pretentions, it being an affair which, as all the World agrees by this time, is of the laſt Importance at <hi>Rome,</hi> for in truth it is a Money Buſineſs: His Majeſty hath at ſeveral times thought fit to raiſe the value of the Coin, ſo that the ſame Pieces are now reckon'd at a third, more than they were at the beginning of his Reign. Now his Holineſs thinks it but reaſonable,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54374:119"/>
that the ſumms payable to his Bankers at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſhould be augmented in the ſame Proportion, but the Miniſters of this Court are of another Opinion, and ſeem reſolved never to be convinced of their Error; the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> for ſome years have been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with all their might to undeceive them. Cardinal <hi>Cornaro</hi> when he was juſt upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, preſs'd the matter home to them, but all to no purpoſe; he left them as obſtinate to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction as he found them, and it ſeems they will not be brought to underſtand otherwiſe, but that the ſame Piece that before went but for two <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons,</hi> is now worth three in the Payments made to his Holineſs. Now ſince it is not imaginable, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> can be eaſily brought to deſiſt from a pretenſion of this kind, this Buſineſs may its feared ſometime or other, diſconcert the good Harmony that is between the two Courts.</p>
               <p>But there are other inſtances to ſhow, that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Miniſters do not make it their Buſineſs to manage his Holineſs; they are grown ſo hardy of late years, that they will not ſtick upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to break in upon the Eccleſiaſtical Immunities, inſomuch, that in this Reign, a Convent is not near ſo ſafe a ſhelter for Villains as it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the Civil Powers aſſuming to themſelves a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to judge what Crimes have the benefit of Sanctuary, and in caſe they think the Crimes to be very heinous indeed, the King's Officers ſhall make nothing to break into a Monaſtery and fetch the Criminal out by force, in order to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice. I confeſs they are ſtill ſomewhat tender in this Point, and if it ſhall be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they are miſtaken in the nature of the offence, the Offender ſhall be returned again. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once at a certain place that hath the Privilege
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54374:120"/>
of an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> one of my acquaintance there coming home told me, that he had been to wait on the late Cardinal <hi>de Alemcaſtro,</hi> to engage him as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the Society, to ſolicit the reſtoring of a Perſon whom the Officers had violently taken out of the Houſe, I asked what the Man's Crime was, and he told me, <hi>it was only for killing his Wife,</hi> and upon further enquiry, I was informed that he had not done it out of Jealouſy, for in that caſe he had been acquitted of courſe; but having married an old Woman, he grew weary of her, and enticing her one day to a Country Houſe, he took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cut her Throat, and going about his Buſineſs, he heard a Servant, who by chance found the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man weltring in her Blood, crying out that <hi>her Miſtreſs was a dying,</hi> he hearing that ſhe was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>dying,</hi> whom he had left for <hi>dead,</hi> return'd and diſpatcht her out-right, and then betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Sanctuary, and it was found upon ſecond thoughts, that his Crime was not of ſo deep a dye, as to deprive him of the benefit thereof, and ſo he was return'd again, and after ſome time, he ſued out his <hi>Carta de Seguro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the violation of their Sanctuary is not the only Grievance that the Fryars, and conſequently the <hi>Nuncio</hi> have to complain of, their Immunities have been attempted in a yet more ſenſible part, it being pretended that their Eſtates ſhall be liable to the King's Duties; ſeveral advances have been made towards bringing this about, and great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence uſed as 'tis pretended in the now mention'd Memoir, where I find this reckon'd among other things, wherein the Court is reſolved to Copy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty.</p>
               <p>This change of Conduct has as experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, contributed not a little to raiſe the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54374:120"/>
of <hi>Portugal</hi> with the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> but the Treaſure of the Nation is ſtill flowing thither in ſo many Currents, that it will be ſoon exhauſted, if a ſpeedy ſtop be not put thereto, ſo that the King muſt of neceſſity come to a more vigorous Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than has been yet taken; there is no doubt but that whenſoever he ſhall attempt to ſave his Country, he will meet with all the oppoſition that <hi>Rome</hi> and its Creatures can raiſe againſt him. But he may turn a deaf Ear to their Clamours, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this time is ſufficiently ſenſible of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Ruin, and begins to ſee from what Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is coming upon them, and there is all reaſon to hope that His Majeſty, if he be not wanting to himſelf may carry his Point, and in the end, ſee himſelf as much reſpected and rever'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> as any Crown'd Head in Chriſtendom.</p>

               <p>NExt to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that of <hi>Madrid</hi> ſeems at preſent to be in greateſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> on account both of the near Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the two Kingdoms, and of his <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Majeſty's Pretentions to the Succeſſion of <hi>Spain.</hi> All former Animoſities ſeem now to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forgotten, and a ſincere Friendſhip and cloſe Correſpondence is maintain'd between the two Courts, which as we may well ſuppoſe, the Siſter Queens have not been wanting to preſerve and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate; the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> no doubt leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unattempted on his part, to procure the good-will of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, conſidering the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Proſpect he hath before him in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Ruin of his numerous Family, ſhould the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

be diſpos'd of to his diſadvantage, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly there may not be wanting among the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Grandees, who think is to be for their Countrys Intereſts and their own that his Pretenſions ſhould ſucceed. But the good Correſpondence that is now between the two Courts, ſeems to be of a latter date than the concluſion of the Peace in 1668. they who then laboured all they could to hinder them from coming to an Agreement, have not been wanting in their Endeavours to embroil them ſince; and it was certainly none of their fault, that theſe two Kings have never come to a Rupture, their Artifices having ſo far prevail'd, that in the year 1681. a day was fixed on the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſide for the Declaration of a War, the Difference aroſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Governour of the <hi>Rio de Janeiro</hi> in <hi>Brazil,</hi> had in the year 1680. Peopled and Fortified a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>Portugueſes</hi> on the <hi>North-</hi>ſide of the <hi>Rio da Prata,</hi> over againſt the Iſle of St. <hi>Gabriel,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be within the bounds of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Dominions, according to the famous Repartition of the whole World made by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> and his Succeſſors between the two Crowns; but the Governour of <hi>Buenos Aires</hi> not liking the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that both ſides of the River, with the Iſles therein, and parts adjacent, had fall'n to the ſhare of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crown; got together a body of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> as well as <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and upon the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ſame year, fell upon the new Planters, killing ſeveral of them, and taking Priſoners the Governour with all that were in Arms, ſeizing likewiſe upon the Artillery, Ammunitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the news of this Action came to <hi>Europe,</hi> they whoſe Intereſt it was to have the two Nations
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54374:122"/>
go together by the ears, made their advantage of it, and blew the Coals into ſuch a flame, that the Prince Regent of <hi>Portugal</hi> ordered home his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from <hi>Madrid,</hi> commanding him to make this <hi>Proteſt</hi> at his Departure; <hi>That if within the ſpace of twenty days reckoning, that for one on which the</hi> Proteſt <hi>was made, the</hi> Spaniards <hi>did not make full Reparation for this Inſult, it ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that a War was declared, without any other Formality.</hi> Such Language as this having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual till of late years between Crown'd Heads, and not heard of even in our times, but from one ſingle Court, we may well gueſs from whence it came, and that the Prince Regent did not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf put it into his Ambaſſador's Mouth; for <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> being at that time as little perhaps in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to bear the Expences of a War as <hi>Spain</hi> its ſelf, it is not likely that the Prince would talk at that rate, unleſs he were made believe that he had ſome other Power beſides his own to back his Threats withal. They at <hi>Madrid</hi> at leaſt ſeem'd to be of this Opinion, for they preſently took the Alarm, inſomuch, that in ſtead of loſing time in Conſultation, according to their ordinary Cuſtom, they with all the haſt imaginable, ſent the Duke of <hi>Giovinazzo</hi> away poſt to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with full power to give the Regent ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>But had they ſpent never ſo much time in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, they could not have pitch'd upon a fitter Perſon, either for ſpoiling a <hi>French</hi> Deſign, or managing the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Court, for matters of this ſort had been the Dukes buſineſs for many years; he had ſerved the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> with great Dexterity, and ſucceſs in affairs of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance, while he was Ambaſſador Reſident at <hi>Turin,</hi> where he broke all the meaſures the

                  <hi>French</hi> had taken to engage Madam <hi>Royal</hi> then Regent of <hi>Savoy</hi> in their Intereſts, and by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Practices ſo countermined their deſigns upon <hi>Caſal;</hi> that he kept the Place from being delivered up to them for ſome years, after the bargain had been made with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of which place was ſo entirely aſcribed to him, that when he left <hi>Turin,</hi> it became the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk of <hi>Europe,</hi> that <hi>Caſal</hi> was infallibly loſt: His Conduct at <hi>Turin</hi> made him eſteem'd at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> for the ableſt Perſon to deal with the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, and for that reaſon he was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year 1680. ſent Ambaſſador into <hi>France,</hi> but for the ſame Reaſon, King <hi>Louis</hi> thought him the moſt improper for that Court; his Miniſters had it ſeems ſuch a dread of the Man, that they put their Maſter upon an Action that will not be reckon'd among the Glories of his Reign; for after the Duke had arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> and continued there for five Months, he was obliged to return as he came, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having been admitted to Audience, the King declaring, That if he did not leave the Kingdom, he would force him away by Violence, an Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity never before put upon the Repreſentative of a Crown'd Head; yet ſuch as <hi>Spain</hi> in its low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was forced to digeſt, but the Duke had now a fair opportunity to mortify the <hi>French</hi> in his turn, by defeating their defign upon <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon his Arrival at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> Prince <hi>Peter</hi> more generous than to inſult over an yielding Adverſary, ſhow'd by his Proceedings, that his own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had not prompted him to make his advantage of his Neighbour's weakneſs; for inſtead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Laws to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who 'tis thought would at this juncture have ſubmitted to any terms
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54374:123"/>
of Accommodation, he was content to treat with them upon the Square, and appointed the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> and other Commiſſioners, to confer with the Duke of <hi>Giovinazzo,</hi> who ſoon brought them to his own terms by an Addreſs peculiar to himſelf, which was by turning things into Ridicule and Ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying them into an Agreement; the Prince though ſufficiently ſenſible that what they had concluded upon was much to his diſadvantage, yet ſuffer'd himſelf to be perſwaded by the Duke to confirm the Treaty; it may be ſuppoſed that he began by this time to Relent, and that he ſhow'd himſelf more eaſy to make ſome amends to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their hard uſage. It is ſaid indeed that the Duke had a particular Talent to accommodate himſelf to the Humours of thoſe he had to deal with, and by that means to gain upon the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Prince, who was not to be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as his Miniſters were, for the Duke's Jeſts were not like to take with him, and therefore in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to his Highneſs, he gave another turn to his Diſcourſe, Haranguing him on all occaſions upon his admirable Prudence, and greatneſs of Mind, and Praiſes, having this common with Reproaches, that they ſeldom fail of their effect when there is ground for them; the Prince Regent is reported to have told thoſe about him, after an Audience given to the Duke, <hi>That he knew very well that the fine things this Man had ſaid, tended only to deceive him, who however had got the ſecret to pleaſe him, and therefore he did know how to deny him any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Agreement made at this time, had the Title of a <hi>Proviſional Treaty,</hi> becauſe it did not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Right on either ſide, for that was to be done at a more convenient Seaſon. It was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54374:123"/>
that by the Articles one would think it was deſign'd, to give the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſome ſatisfaction in appearance, and all the real advantage to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It was agreed, that by Order from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Buenos Aires</hi> ſhould be puniſhed according as the manner of his Proceedings had deſerved; which Order the Duke of <hi>Giovinazzo</hi> delivered afterwards to the Prince Regent, who ſent it to his Miniſter at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with a Command to intercede in his Name with the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, that the Execution of it might be ſuſpended. All Arms, Artillery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe had been taken from the Colony were to be reſtor'd, and the Planters ſuffer'd to return, and if any were wanting, as many others to ſettle there in their room. But then they were not to fortifie themſelves, nor ſo much as build Houſes of any durable Matter, nor were they to be ſupplied with freſh Men, though in never ſo ſmall a Number, nor have any ſort of Intercourſe or Commerce with the <hi>Indians,</hi> under Obedience to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were to have the ſame uſe of the River, the Iſles thereof, and Territories adjacent as they had before, ſo that had this <hi>Proviſional Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> continued in force, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Colony muſt neceſſarily in a very ſhort time have fall'n away to nothing, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> remain confirm'd in the Poſſeſſion of a Country, to which their Title was at beſt but Dubious. It was indeed agreed at the ſame time, that Commiſſioners on both ſides ſhould meet finally to determine this Affair, and that in caſe Matters could not be adjuſted by them, it ſhould be referr'd to the Pope's Arbitration; but conſidering how ſeldom Conferences of this kind come to any Iſſue, and how eaſy it is for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to make proceedings at <hi>Rome</hi> to go heavily
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54374:124"/>
on, one would think they had ſmall cauſe to fear that any thing in this Article ſhould deprive them of the Advantage they had got by the reſt; and if things ſucceeded not afterwards to their minds, it was perhaps, becauſe, they could not have a Duke of <hi>Giovinazzo</hi> always at <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Compoſure of this Difference made way for a more ſolid and laſting Friendſhip then hath been uſual between theſe, or perhaps any other border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations; that hoſtile Diſpoſition which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, was always obſerv'd in theſe towards each other, and had been exaſperated by a late War of 27 years continuance, ſeem'd now to be worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way on a ſuddain, and they began to familiariſe themſelves with each other; for the Duke of <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinazzo,</hi> while he ſo happily acquitted himſelf to his Maſter's ſatisfaction in a Negotiation, that was thought to be attended with inſuperable Difficulties, manag'd Matters, ſo that he was no leſs pleaſing to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Court, then to that of <hi>Madrid,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring himſelf acceptable to all, and gaining the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Eſteem of the Prince, Nobility and People; and as he was highly carreſs'd during his ſtay at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he was as much regretted at his Departure.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but the Marriage of the Q. of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Siſter to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> contributed not a little to perfect the Harmony that is at preſent between the two Crowns, and perhaps her want of Children much more, for it being now apparent to the World, that King <hi>Peter</hi> hath enter'd his Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Candidates for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crown, it is natural to ſuppoſe that his endeavours are not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to keep up the good Correſpondence; yet were we to judge of the inclinations of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, from the moſt obliging Carriage of the <hi>Marquis de Caſtel dos Rios,</hi> their late Miniſter at
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54374:124"/>
                  <hi>Lisbon,</hi> one would think that <hi>Spain</hi> expected to reap all the advantage from the good amity; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle would one gueſs from the Conduct of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was not many years ago lookt upon as his Maſter's Rebel, there being ſcarce a Gentleman in <hi>Portugal</hi> more intent than he in making his Court, or more careful to render himſelf acceptable. He to gain their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Favour, hath during the whole time of his Reſidence, that is, for about ſeven years together on every Birth-night of the Eldeſt Prince, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nobility and Foreign Miniſters with a new <hi>Opera</hi> of his own Compoſure, and acted by his own Family, and all to Celebrate the future Glorys of his Highneſs. It would perhaps ſeem trifling in any other times but ours, to draw Conſequences from any thing of this kind, but in our Age, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Excellencies Character do every thing by Preſcription, and the lighteſt matters of Ceremony are exactly weighed.</p>
               <p>It does not yet appear what advances the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath made at <hi>Madrid,</hi> towards the making good his Pretenſions to the Succeſſion, the publick Relations of the Proceedings at that Court, do as yet give but a ſlender Account of his Succeſs; however, the frequent Couriers that paſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, between the two Courts upon every alarm of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Indiſpoſition, ſhow that his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents there are buſy in carrying on his Intereſts, and his late Levies raiſed and maintained at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which his Kingdom is ſo little in a condition to bear, are an Argument that he is reſolved to make One among the Competitors, as indeed it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him much to be, conſidering the apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his own Crown, in caſe he miſcarries in his deſign upon that of <hi>Spain;</hi> for whether a Prince of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54374:125"/>
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or of <hi>France,</hi> ſhall inherit that Crown, he'll be Heir at the ſame time to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the <hi>2d</hi>'s Title to <hi>Portugal,</hi> which as unjuſt as it was, was ſtrengthen'd by ſixty years Poſſeſſion, and the Approbation of ſeveral Popes; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reflects upon the Conduct of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the laſt Age, or of the <hi>French</hi> King in this, will find that very ſlender Pretences have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the turn, when either of them hath had a fair opportunity to invade his Neighbour, and ſee cauſe enough to be afraid; for the Houſe of <hi>Bragança,</hi> ſhould it ever have the misfortune to ly at their Mercy, as it almoſt infallibly will do, when either of them ſhall be in quiet Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy; for <hi>Spain</hi> upon any change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will almoſt neceſſarily recover ſo much of its ancient Vigor, as to be overmatch for <hi>Portugal.</hi> This ſmall Kingdom may perhaps have ſome cauſe to hope, that its deſtruction will come on more ſlowly, in caſe it hath to deal with an <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Prince, but whether it will be therefore the leſs, ſure is a queſtion ſoon decided, when we conſider what a cloſe Union there hath always been between the two Branches of that Houſe, each eſpouſing the Intereſt and Quarrels of the other, and making them its own; how great a part the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had in the <hi>German</hi> Uſurpations, in the buſineſs of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick</hi> League; and how far the <hi>German</hi> Line intereſſed it ſelf in behalf of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon the Revolt of <hi>Portugal;</hi> when to revenge their Quarrel, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> contrary to all Faith, and Honour, the Right of Nations, and the Laws of Hoſpitality ſeiz'd upon Prince <hi>Duarte,</hi> the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Brother, and made him end his days in a Priſon. Now when a Prince of the ſame Houſe, leſs Religious than his preſent <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:54374:125"/>
Majeſty (and one of his Character does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in every Age) ſhall come to have <hi>Portugal</hi> in his power, can we think it likely, that he will ſo far forget the Maxims of his Anceſtors, as to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a Race, that hath occaſion'd ſo many diſgraces to a Family? But if the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cauſe to expect ſecurity from that Houſe, he would have leſs reaſon to think himſelf ſafe, ſhould he fall under the Power of <hi>France;</hi> 'tis true indeed, if words of Friendſhip could inſure him, he would be freeſt from danger, while the <hi>French</hi> are putting themſelves in a Condition to deſtroy him, who till they are ready to give the Blow, are always laviſh of their kind Promiſes, which ſuch as have truſted in them, have found to be the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners or the means rather of their Ruin. Should a <hi>French</hi> Prince become poſſeſs'd of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, if <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d's</hi> Title will not do, there are a great many others now dormant, that will quickly be ſtarted up, the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> will ſoon be found to have been a Dependance of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and it is but erecting a Chamber of Re-u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to annex it thereto again, or a Right of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution may be pretended by the forfeitures which the Kings have incurr'd, they having been formerly Feudatorys to thoſe of <hi>Leon,</hi> or the Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch may think it will be for his Glory or his Convenience, to order his Generals to take Poſſeſſion of this ſmall Kingdom, and that, as appears from ſome Preſidents, may be thought right ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>It is not to be imagined, that the Court of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> is at this time of the Day inſenſible of the Dangers they are threatned with, the Agonies that the Miniſters were in not long ago during his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Majeſty's Sickneſs, could ſcarce be thought
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54374:126"/>
to proceed from any other Cauſe, and a Paper lately publiſhed in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhows that they have been ſetting their Wits at Work to find out means for their Preſervation, that is, to make good their Maſter's Claim to the Succeſſion (which as they ſeem to be perſwaded, is) the only viſible way to ſecure themſelves at this Juncture. The Author of that Paper ſeems to have left nothing unſaid that may make for his Maſter's Cauſe, and he hath gone a great way to prove him to have a much better Right than any other Pretender, if it be true, as he intimates, that there is ſuch a Fundamental Law in <hi>Spain,</hi> as excludes Forreigners from the Succeſſion, and I believe there can be no Inſtance given of any ſuch, that have ſucceeded in a regular Way, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> who was yet Son to the immmediate Heireſs, and poſſeſs'd of the Crown in his Mother's life-time: As for his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and the reſt that came after him, they were all natural born <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which Privilege muſt be granted to the Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> while <hi>Portugal</hi> is allowed to be a part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and it is certain that they are deſcended from <hi>Donna Maria,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and Siſter to her who brought the Crown into the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family; ſo that if there be any ſuch Law, as the aforeſaid Author hints at, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> may have a very fair Title, the <hi>Dauphin</hi> as 'tis aſſerted by his Competitors, being excluded by virtue of the Renunciation which was the neceſſary Condition of his Mothers Marriage, and the <hi>German</hi> line with the Houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> for their being Forreigners. This appears to be the beſt Title the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> can pretend to by Deſcent; 'tis true, the forementioned Writer ſets up another, which he ſaith, His Maſter derives from his Predeceſſor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54374:126"/>
                  <hi>Dom Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but upon what Grounds I ſhall not examine. It were much to be wiſhed for the ſake, both of the common Repoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Preſervation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in particular; that his Majeſty's Right was unqueſtionable ſince <hi>Spain</hi> by the Re-union of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> might be enabled even at preſent to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards its own Defence, and in time gather ſtrength, ſo as to ſubſiſt of it ſelf, and eaſe its Allys of the great Charge and Trouble they are at, in keeping it from falling into Ruin.</p>
               <p>There is one Advantage on the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s ſide, that muſt not be omitted, which is, That it will be very difficult for any other Prince to gain this Crown without his Conſent, he being ready upon the place to oppoſe any other Pretender; his Forces indeed are but very ſmall, when compared to thoſe of other Princes, yet they are ſuch, as with a little aſſiſtance from his Allies, may be able to make head againſt an Invader, and perhaps prove more numerous than any Army that can march in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of <hi>Spain,</hi> though furniſh'd out by the great Monarch himſelf: <hi>Spain</hi> having this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from her preſent Deſolation and Miſery, that though ſhe can make little Reſiſtance againſt any powerful Enemies, yet ſhe'll go near ſtarve them, if they come upon her in any conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. An Army that paſſes the <hi>Pirenees,</hi> muſt not look for ſuch Entertainment as is to be met with in other parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> it was no difficult matter for the <hi>French</hi> King, poſſeſs'd as he was of the ſtrong Holds on both ſides him, to maintain his hundreds of thouſands in the fruitful Countrys of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and on the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but he may find it a harder task to ſubſiſt a third part of that Number in <hi>Spain,</hi> than it was for him to do the ſame in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54374:127"/>
                  <hi>Piedmont</hi> during the laſt War. A Traveller that paſſes through ſuch Parts of this Country, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath been moſt indulgent to, is like to fare but ill, unleſs he carries Proviſion with him, and that for Beaſt as well as Man; but whether an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my like any of thoſe that have been on foot of late Years, can come thus provided for ſo long a March as 'tis over the <hi>Pirenees</hi> into the midſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> let others more skillful in theſe matters judge, but if it brings not along with it all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for life, it is like to be ill ſuppli'd, and that not only in thoſe bare and cragged Mountains, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which it muſt climb, but in the flat Country likewiſe; ill water'd for the moſt part, diſpeopled, and uncultivated, and ſo parcht up, that ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing Green appears in the Seaſon, when Armies uſually take the Field. In effect, the impoſſibility for a more numerous Army than their own to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in <hi>Spain,</hi> is generally what the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, when they are told of the great Forces which his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty hath in readineſs, and it is very probable, that in caſe they be aſſiſted with a competent number of well diſciplin'd Troops from abroad, their being beforehand with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Place, and having their Magazins on the Frontiers, will give them a great Advantage, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they can but bring the <hi>Spaniards</hi> heartily to join with them in defence of their common Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and one would think they ſhould readily accept the Party, at leaſt in oppoſition to the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe Government they muſt neceſſarily have in greater abhorrence, than the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> themſelves, conſidering the Antipathy that hath been always between them and the <hi>French,</hi> which has been kept alive by the continual Wars they have had with them, and of late Years ſeems to have been heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54374:127"/>
to the utmoſt Extremity of Hatred by the many intolerable and ungenerous inſults they have received from them, with which the <hi>French</hi> have on all occaſions been very careful to refreſh their Memories; ſo that there is all reaſon to believe, they will be much ſooner inclin'd to forget their former Animoſities with their <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Their Enmity to theſe never was ſo great as to make them baniſh all thoughts of uniting under one head, a thing often declar'd impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in regard to the <hi>French,</hi> in ſeveral Publick and Solemn Treaties; whereas in the very heat of the laſt War with <hi>Portugal,</hi> there was a Negotiation carrying on, and ſome advances made on both ſides, to have a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Prince plac'd on the Throne of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in the Year 1650. when <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other Child to inherit his Crown but the <hi>Infanta Donna Tereſa Maria,</hi> the great Men in <hi>Spain</hi> were all for having that Princeſs married within the Kingdom, it being a common ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them at that time, That <hi>it was a very hard thing that they could never have a King with</hi> Black Whiskers; upon this, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was encouraged by the ſecret Intelligence he had at that Court, to think of a Marriage between the <hi>Infanta</hi> and his Eldeſt Son <hi>Dom Theodoſio,</hi> and thereupon ſent <hi>Antonio Vieira</hi> the Jeſuit to <hi>Rome</hi> upon other Pretences, but with Inſtructions and Powers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Match to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters there, and he pretends that he wrought ſo effectually with ſome of the Principal Perſons of that Nation and Faction, that he brought them to a great liking of his Propoſal, inſomuch that they ſeem'd deſirous it ſhould take effect, though the Match could not be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54374:128"/>
approv'd of by the Court of <hi>Madrid.</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which <hi>Vieira</hi> prevail'd with the Miniſters at <hi>Rome,</hi> were drawn from the high Birth of the Prince, his being deſcended from the ſame Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and his Extraordinary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, all which were ſuch that had things continued in the ſame ſtate they had been in before the War; there was no queſtion but that <hi>Dom The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſio</hi> would have been the only Perſon pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Jeſuit urged, that as the caſe then ſtood, there were much ſtronger Arguments in his Favour; he being to bring along with him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> with all the Dominions belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto in the one half of the World; that <hi>Portugal</hi> it ſelf was a part and member of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by its Re-union would make the Monarchy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire again, which would thereby become more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and Flouriſhing, than before the Separation: for the ſeveral Armies which at that time were employed on both ſides upon the Frontiers, might then be all united together in one Body under the ſame Head, and <hi>Spain</hi> be ſo ſtrengthened thereby, as to be able to give Protection to their Friends, be rever'd by Neutrals, and become a Terror to their Enemies. Theſe Arguments if we can believe <hi>Vieira,</hi> were well taſted by thoſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party at <hi>Rome,</hi> at a time when the Enmity between the two Nations was at the higheſt; but now all Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being laid aſide, perhaps the ſame, or others of a like nature may be hearkned to at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and incline thoſe of that Court to diſtinguiſh the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> from among the reſt that are Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for the Succeſſion. There was one Scruple that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> made themſelves at that time, they were unwilling to conſent to a Re-union, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54374:128"/>
                  <hi>Lisbon</hi> was to be the Capital of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy; but certainly the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if they knew their own Intereſts, in caſe they agreed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, would readily gratify them in this Point. <hi>Lisbon</hi> by its Scituation ſo near the Sea, and upon the nobleſt River in the World, ſeems deſigned by Nature for the great <hi>Emporium</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and were it in the hands of a People that knew how to improve their Advantage, it would go near to draw to it ſelf the Trade and Riches of the World. <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> was ſenſible of this, and therefore when he came to take Poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, he promiſed, and as it was thought, deſigned, that inſtead of keeping his Court at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> a 100 Leagues within the Land, <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſhould be thence forward the place of his Reſidence, and in order thereto, he began the Structure of a moſt magnificent Palace, but it was well for <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> that he continued not in this Reſolution, and that his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> took it not up after him, for perhaps nothing could have contributed more to bring about the deſign they had laid of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Monarchy.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with this one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that it ſeems fatal to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy to owe her Preſervation from utter Ruin, to thoſe who have brought her to a Condition, in which ſhe is unable to help her ſelf; they were the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> that firſt humbled the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when in the very heighth of their Pride, and from them do they now expect Relief in this their Extremity. By that expenſive War in the <hi>Low Countrys,</hi> carried on ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively by the three <hi>Philips,</hi> this Monarchy was brought into a languiſhing State, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> have ſince ſtood in the gap between it and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54374:129"/>
the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> at laſt gave that Monarchy its mortal. Wound, ſince which it hath never been able to hold up its Head; the <hi>French</hi> indeed had endeavour'd to do the the ſame in that long War which preceded the Peace of the <hi>Pirenees,</hi> but did not effect it, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtood upon the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with them at that Treaty; it is true, ſome thought their Ruin might have been then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, had that War according to Mr. <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Advice been continued a little longer, and <hi>Don Luis de Haro,</hi> if it be true what is reported of him, was much of the ſame Opinion, but Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> was ambitious to have that <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Miniſter, and all the World ſenſible of the Superiority of his <hi>Genius,</hi> and ſo interrupted the courſe of <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Victories, and would needs meet <hi>Don Luis</hi> on the Frontiers, that they might have a publick Tryal of each others Politicks; <hi>Don Luis</hi> met the Cardinal, and gave his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence occaſion to make as great a flouriſh as he pleaſed of all his rare Talents, but when the Peace came to be Sign'd, he could hold out no longer, nor forbear crying to his Friends, <hi>Spain was loſt, but is now ſafe.</hi> So that the <hi>French</hi> left to their abandon'd Friends of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of working out the deſtruction of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Monarchy, which by the help of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they did effectually, at the two deciſive Battles of <hi>Ameixial</hi> and <hi>Monteſclaros,</hi> the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> having never after been able to ſtand upon their own legs, but as they were crutch'd up by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who ever ſince have had them lying on their hands, as a Puniſhment for what they did towards bringing them into this deplorable Condition; and now it ſeems that the

                  <hi>Portuguſes</hi> have their turn come, to contribute on their parts to the Relief of this diſtreſſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who knows but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy may at laſt receive its Cure from the Hand that gave it the laſt and deepeſt Wound, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover new Life and Vigour by means of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who have been the immediate occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its fall.</p>

               <p>SInce the Revolt of <hi>Portugal</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> there hath been till now of late, an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a very cloſe Union between This and the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which ſeemed to be ſo well ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as if nothing were able to ſeparate them; and indeed, were the common Opinion of the World true, concerning the Obligations of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation to the <hi>French,</hi> it would be no wonder if their Friendſhip was in Effect ſo great as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. For they would then ſtand engaged to each other by the moſt endearing Tyes in the World, <hi>France</hi> would have cauſe to account of <hi>Portugal</hi> as a Creature of its own raiſing, and the Houſe of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gança</hi> would owe its eſtabliſhment upon the Throne to his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty. What greater Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54374:130"/>
of a ſincere and cordial Affection can there be expected from one Ally to another, than that which <hi>France</hi> gave to <hi>Portugal</hi> in the Preamble to the <hi>60th.</hi> Article in the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Treaty, that very Article whereby <hi>Portugal</hi> was abandoned to the mercy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for therein his moſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Majeſty declares himſelf to be ſo paſſionately concerned for the good of this Kingdom, that on condition he could but procure for it the Benefits of Peace, he was willing among other things to <hi>yield up all the Conqueſts he had gain'd in the courſe of a tedious War of twenty five years continuance,</hi> and all this out of pure Generoſity. He being as 'tis there declared, under no other ſort of Engagement, than that of his own Good-will.</p>
               <p>But upon a Review of the Tranſactions that have paſs'd between the two Crowns, it will perhaps be found that the obligations of <hi>Portugal</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> have not been ſo very great as the World is apt to imagine. It cannot be denied, but that the <hi>French</hi> have all along exceeded other People by far in their Profeſſions of Kindneſs to this Nation, but it will appear that thoſe Profeſſions, have not always been accompanied with ſuitable Effects, and it muſt have been ſome other means beſides real Acts of Friendſhip, whereby they have ſupported their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Party in this Kingdom. I ſhall in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this Chapter, ſhow as well as I am able what thoſe means were.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Portuguſes</hi> had ſhaken off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke, they found the <hi>French</hi> ingaged in a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame Nation, and they look'd for mighty aſſiſtance from them, conſidering the Diverſion they were like to give to the common Enemy, and in effect, the Ambaſſadors ſent by King <hi>John</hi> to that Court, were received by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54374:131"/>
all the Demonſtrations of kindneſs imaginable, his Promiſes out running all that they could deſire or wiſh for, inſomuch, that the <hi>Meſſineſes</hi> in our days did not think themſelves more happy in the <hi>French</hi> Friendſhip at the firſt Engagement, than the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> did at that time. A perpetual Peace was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently concluded between the two Crowns, each obliging himſelf to diſtreſs the Common Enemy by all poſſible means; to this end, the King of <hi>France</hi> was to ſend twenty Men of War to join ſo many of the King of <hi>Portugals.</hi> But I do not find that any great matter came of this Agreement, unleſs it were the taking of <hi>Port Longone</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> in 1646. when they perſwaded the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to join them with a Squadron of their Ships, for it does not appear, that the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> for the ſpace of almoſt twenty years, received the leaſt aſſiſtance from <hi>France,</hi> but they were left to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unexperienced as they were, and unprovided of all Military Preparations. They were all that time expoſed to the firſt fury of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at their own home, while in all other Parts of their Dominions, the <hi>French</hi> were poſſeſſing themſelves of their Frontier Towns: 'Tis true, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were encouraged all along with very large Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of intended ſuccours, but theſe Promiſes were turn'd into Excuſes, as often as they had occaſion to make tryal of what their Friends would do for them; when they deſired a ſupply of Money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Charges of the War, the <hi>French</hi> were in want themſelves; when they asked for Auxiliary Troops, the <hi>French</hi> on their Part would have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for them, and required ſuch exceſſive Summs, that the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> though they were brought in their neceſſity to bid high, could never come up to their Price. Once indeed, <hi>Mazarin</hi> was for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54374:131"/>
them a far greater ſupply of Men than they deſired, for when the treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> was on foot, while the <hi>French</hi> were thinking of making their Peace, the Cardinal was very deſirous to have the War transferred into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge into that Kingdom the Soldiery that might prove burthenſom to <hi>France.</hi> But the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had no mind to have more <hi>French</hi> among them, than they knew how to deal with, and gave his Eminence to underſtand, that they were afraid in caſe they ſhould accept his offer, of being more oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Friends, than they were already by their Enemies; ſo that after almoſt twenty years ſpent in Negotiations, I do not find that there was ſo much as one Company of <hi>French</hi> Soldiers in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Service.</p>
               <p>Being thus left to themſelves to bear the Brunt of the War, they were ſtill encouraged with hopes, that their Allies whenſoever they made Peace, would not fail to procure very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Terms for them, who contributed ſo much as they did to divert and weaken the Enemy. At their firſt making an Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> they found the Miniſters of that Court ſo extreamly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging, and ready to do more for them than they demanded, that they did not then think it neceſſary to preſs them upon this Point. But coming afterwards to perceive their Error, they obtained a Promiſe of <hi>Louis</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> to make with them a League offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and Defenſive; and in order thereto, a Treaty was entered upon with <hi>Richelieu,</hi> but when they were in a fair way to bring it to a Concluſion, that Cardinal died to their great Misfortune. For he being of a far more generous Temper than his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, they had doubtleſs received better Uſage from him, than they afterwards met with at the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54374:132"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> Court. <hi>Mazarin</hi> indeed who ſucceded him in the Miniſtry, was uſed on all occaſions to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him in fair Promiſes, but to come very ſhort in Performances: He when the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the League to him, finding them already em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkt ſo far, that there was no drawing back for them, would by no means hearken to their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, telling them, that the Alliance already made was ſufficient; to enter into new Engagements, would argue a Diſtruſt between the two Kings, whereas his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty had ſo tender a concern for his Friends, that nothing ſhould be wanting on his part for their Preſervation; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he did not put them out of Hopes, but that ſuch a League as they deſired, ſhould be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time or other, but when they afterwards grew urgent with him, he fed them ſtill with Promiſes, or put them off with Delays, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would keep them in Play, by amuſing them with all the Formalities of a Treaty which went forwards, or was broken off according to the ſeveral occaſions he had for them. While there was any Proſpect of concluding a Peace or Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Munſter,</hi> the Cardinal was thinking to diſpoſe the <hi>French</hi> Troops in the manner now mentioned, for which, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſons, he judged it convenient to have <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> excluded out of the Peace. But the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> at the ſame time were the more importunate with him to get themſelves comprehended, and to that end ſolicited with greater earneſtneſs than ever the Ratification of the ſo long promiſed League, and they preſſed ſo very hard upon him, that his Eminence was at a loſs how to put by their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; his Excuſes were now ſpent, or by being often uſed had loſt their force, and he was reduced
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54374:132"/>
to his laſt ſhifts for a new one. The King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> at laſt furniſhed him with one, it was indeed ſuch a one as a Body would think was very remote and odd, however it ſerved the Cardinal's Turn for that time.</p>
               <p>There ſtands at <hi>Villa Viçoſa</hi> the ancient ſeat of the Dukes of <hi>Bragança,</hi> an old Lady of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> the moſt ancient of all the Ladies bearing that Title throughout <hi>Spain;</hi> to whom the Dukes have all along had a moſt ſingular Devotion, and as they thought not without Reaſon, ſhe having ſerv'd them in place of a <hi>Lar</hi> to the Family. For as I remember, I have been told by one that had reaſon to know the concerns of that Houſe, there have no conſiderable Alterations happened in the Family, but this Image, as it hath been believed ſince, hath ſome way or other given them notice of it before hand. King <hi>John</hi> after he had been pretty well ſettled in the Throne, began to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his old <hi>Penates,</hi> and thought he could do no leſs in gratitude for the Favours received from this Lady, than devote himſelf and all his Dominions to the <hi>Immaculate Conception;</hi> declaring the Lady of that Appellation <hi>Protectreſs</hi> and <hi>Guardian</hi> of the Kingdom, obliging himſelf and his Succeſſors to pay her at her Houſe at <hi>Villa Viçoſa,</hi> the annual Tribute of fifty Crowns of Gold, as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their Homage; and withal according to the Cuſtom of ancient Chivalry, he made a ſolemn. Vow to defend her <hi>Immaculate Conception</hi> with his Arms. Not content to do this himſelf, he obliged the three Eſtates of the Kingdom aſſembled in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> to enter into an Aſſociation to the ſame purpoſe, every Member engaging himſelf by Oath to hold and maintain that Important Article. At the ſame time it was Declared and Enacted by his Majeſty,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54374:133"/>
That whoſoever ſhould attempt any thing againſt it in caſe he were a Subject, he ſhould be unnatura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, and caſt out of the Kingdom; if he were a King, he deſired that God's Curſe and his own might light upon him, that he might not be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among his Deſcendents, hoping through the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Favour, that he would be thrown down from the Throne and diſpoiled of the Royal Dignity. This Act paſſed the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> in the year 1646. Hitherto all things went ſmoothly on, there being nothing in the Aſſociation, but what the generality of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were willing to aſſent to, and maintain with their Lives and Fortunes. But the King would needs have the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryars ſwear to it, Men that are <hi>Thomiſts</hi> upon Oath, and whoſe Order had all along aſſerted a contrary Doctrine to that which the King would now force upon them. This Buſineſs was in Agitation while the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> were adjuſting all things in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the League with <hi>France.</hi> But <hi>Mazarin</hi> had now what he look'd for, a Pretext to break off the Treaty; for his Eminence ſent the King word, that he thought it a very ſtrange thing for him to put ſuch a hardſhip upon the <hi>Dominicans.</hi> But the King continued in his Reſolution, which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal took very ill at his hands; but the King in this caſe made no Account of his Anger, for as the Conde <hi>da Ericeyra</hi> ſaith, his Devotion to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſuch, that no Politick Conſideration could make him deſiſt from his Purpoſe, and doubtleſs the Cardinal foreſaw as much, or elſe he had put his Invention to the rack to find out ſome other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a Quarrel.</p>
               <p>But the Congreſs at <hi>Munſter</hi> being upon the point to break up, and things remaining in the ſame ſtate as before between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54374:133"/>
Cardinal was for bringing on again the Treaty of a League with <hi>Portugal,</hi> but ſtill he inſiſted upon unreaſonable Conditions, and among others would have cautionary Towns put into the <hi>French</hi> hands, with two Harbours that were capable of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fleets. He was encouraged to make this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by the famous Jeſuit <hi>Antonio Vieira,</hi> who had been ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> to aſſiſt at the Conferences with the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, with Power to make what Propoſals he in his own Diſcretion thought fit, and the Father was ſo very forward in making large Promiſes, that the Cardinal thought he could not be too exorbitant in his Demands, and they made ſuch a bargin of it between them, that the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador was fain to interpoſe and put a ſtop to their Proceedings, by declaring that he would ſooner have his hands cut off, than ſign what the Jeſuit was agreeing to.</p>
               <p>After this manner did his Eminence play faſt and looſe with his Friends till the year 1655. when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had like to have done their Enemies of <hi>Portugal</hi> a kindneſs, which they found it impoſſible to do for themſelves; for if the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had made uſe of the advantage which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had put into their hands, they might have managed the Cardinal as they pleaſed, and brought him to Terms of their own preſcribing. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in order to make miſchief in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and incenſe the People againſt the Court, gave out that they had made an offer of Peace to the King, and found him of himſelf willing enough to hearken thereto, but that he was impoſed upon by his Miniſters, who for their own Intereſts were ſtill putting him upon continuing the War. This Report coming to the Cardinal's Ears gave him the Alarm, and raiſed a ſuſpicion in him, that there might be ſome under-hand
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54374:134"/>
Negotiation carrying on between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> which, if ſuch a thing there was, might ſpoil all his deſigns: He therefore diſpatches away the Chevalier <hi>de Sainte Foy,</hi> to adjuſt the League, on Condition, that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> would engage himſelf to a vigorous Proſecution of the War, to which end he ſhould be furniſhed with Money for the Expenſe of the next Campagne, but withall the Envoy was ordered to complain how little <hi>Portugal</hi> minded the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> and of the ſeveral infractions of the Capitulations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made between the two Crowns; and to let fall ſome hints of the King's being ſuſpected of having an Underſtanding with the common Enemy. The good King took care to vindicate himſelf from this unjuſt Aſperſion, which the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> by their Calumnies had caſt upon him, and clear'd himſelf ſo well, that St. <hi>Foy</hi> began to perceive that there was no occaſion for a League, and ſo found out Pretences to defer the Concluſion of it. Hereupon King <hi>John</hi> diſpatches away an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Fryar with the Character of his Envoy, I ſuppoſe to ſatisfie the Court of <hi>France</hi> of his Innocence, but with expreſs orders to haſten the Concluſion of the League; and it ſeems the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Polititian acquitted himſelf of the firſt part of his Commiſſion ſo much to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's ſatisfaction, that his Eminence would hear no talk of what he had to ſay further, and ſo <hi>Frey Domingos do Roſario</hi> (for that was his Fryars name, I think his true one was <hi>O Dally)</hi> was ſent back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ordered to tell his Maſter, that he ſhould make his Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf if he would, and think no more of a League with <hi>France.</hi> This was the laſt Negotiation between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> the firſt King of the Houſe of <hi>Bragança,</hi> and let the Reader
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54374:134"/>
judge how far he was obliged to <hi>France</hi> for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablimment upon the Throne.</p>
               <p>After his death, there was little entercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Courts, the <hi>French</hi> leaving the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and the Orphan to ſhift for themſelves, till the Treaty of the <hi>Pirenees</hi> was drawing on, and then the Cardinal had a further occaſion for <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> During the courſe of this long War, <hi>Spain</hi> had loſt ſeveral important places to the <hi>French,</hi> which they expected to have reſtored to them at the Peace, or ſome Compenſation for them at leaſt: For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not yet been accuſtomed to make Peace on ſuch Terms as they have ſince been uſed to; they ſtood likewiſe obliged by Treaty made with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> at his firſt putting himſelf into their ſervice, never to lay down their Arms till he was reſtored to all the Places and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments poſſeſt by him in <hi>France,</hi> when he firſt came over to them. The <hi>French</hi> on the other ſide were as unwilling to part with the places in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were to yield them up; and as for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> neither the King, nor the Cardinal could be prevailed with to put him in a condition to give them the like trouble again, as he had done formerly; for they were not without ſome jealouſy, that he had a mind to be playing over his old Game again; and ſhould he come off ſo well after all the Buſtle he had made in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, others might in after times be tempted to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Example: So that unleſs ſome Expedient could be found out to ſatisfy both Parties, here were inſuperable Difficulties to obſtruct the Peace, and a Peace the Cardinal was reſolved to have as well for his own private Conveniencies, as to ſettle the ſtate of the Nation, that was then as he thought or pretended, breaking out into new Diſorders.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54374:135"/>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> on their ſide were as willing to end the War as the <hi>French</hi> could be, ſo as it might be done with their Honour ſafe; they were ſenſible enough of their own feeble Condition; they ſaw that two or three Campagnes more were like to prove the total Ruin of their Monarchy. Beſides, they were impatiently eager to be turning the whole force of their Arms againſt <hi>Portugal,</hi> which they made ſure of over running with eaſe, could they be once at liberty from the <hi>French,</hi> and they were the more haſty to come to an Accomodation with them, for that the Pope began to be troubleſome. The Ears of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> were a little more open than thoſe of his Predeceſſors to the <hi>Bleatings</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and he gave notice to the Cardinals of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, that ſomething muſt be done to end the Diſpute, or he ſhould be forc'd to acknowledge that King, who ſucceeding a Father that had reign'd ſixteen years, could not be made to paſs with the World for an Uſurper. Thus were the minds of both Parties diſpoſed for a Peace, but how ſhould they come by it? Who could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Obſtacles that lay in the way, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy thoſe irreconcileable Pretenſions, from which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party would recede?</p>
               <p>To bring all this about, the Cardinal had his Wits at work; he now began on a ſudden to be mighty Zealous for the poor King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> whoſe Ruin was thought infallible, ſhould the <hi>French</hi> forſake him, and therefore his Eminence would ſeem for ſome time to be as earneſt for his Preſervation as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were bent upon his Deſtruction; both Parties agreeing in this, that ſhould <hi>Portugal</hi> be excluded from the Peace, it would of courſe fall into the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſo that in effect this Orphan Prince, and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54374:135"/>
to him ſeem'd to be now wholly at the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Diſpoſal, ſince to exclude them from the Peace, was then thought to be the ſame thing in effect, as to give them up to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and theſe he had to ſet againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the places demanded by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and he made his Advantage of them: For in all the Negotiations in Order to a Peace, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought much of yielding up their Towns and Provinces, the <hi>French</hi> ſometimes would mind them of a whole Kingdom, and the Dominions thereunto belonging, which they were ready to give in Exchange for their Conqueſts. When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> interceded for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> when other Arguments fail'd, would ſpeak for the King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> But there was this Difference between them, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> always began with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> anſwered <hi>Portugal</hi> in their own Defence, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> got conditions for the Prince, not ſuch as they pretended to, but very Honourable, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ill the Prince had deſerv'd at the hands of his King. The Cardinal engaged his Maſter's Word, his Faith, and his Honour that <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould be utterly abandon'd for him. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> to the very laſt were paſſionately Urgent to get ſomething more ſtill for their Friend, the <hi>French</hi> ſurrendred us theirs at the firſt Overtures of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were in earneſt, the <hi>French</hi> had only a Turn of their own to ſerve.</p>
               <p>The firſt Advance that appears to have been made to any purpoſe on either ſide towards a Peace, was in 1658. when the Marquis <hi>de Lionne</hi> was ſent to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to treat with the Miniſters of that Court; what Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi>'s Inſtructions were, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi> beſt knew, who in a Letter to the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Affair, told his Holineſs, That if <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:54374:136"/>
by his Authority could be brought to abate of their Pretenſions in favour of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Peace was upon concluding; ſince all other points were adjuſted, Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> having orders to abandon <hi>Portugal,</hi> in caſe <hi>Spain</hi> would not be ſo obſtinate in behalf of the Prince: but <hi>Spain</hi> could not not be prevail'd upon, and ſo that Treaty was broke off. I have ſeen no particular account how this Buſineſs was manag'd at the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> perhaps it was then that the Offer was made by the <hi>French</hi> to reſtore their Conqueſts, and re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Prince in his Governments, on Condition that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould remain in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Poſſeſſion of his Dominions, for that ſuch an Offer was made ſome time or other we muſt believe, becauſe it is ſo affirm'd in the <hi>60th.</hi> Article of the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Treaty; but whenever it was made, the <hi>French</hi> were aſſur'd it would not be accepted, as I believe I ſhall preſently make appear.</p>
               <p>The Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> broken off by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> perſiſting to Eſpouſe the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Intereſts, the <hi>French</hi> on their ſide were for ſticking cloſe to their Allies, and gave out that they were reſolved never to abandon them. For the Marquis <hi>de Lionne,</hi> a little after declar'd publickly at the Diet of <hi>Francfort,</hi> that the King of <hi>France</hi> neither could nor would make any Peace without the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of his Allies, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>England, Portugal, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> and in effect, they were about renewing their League with the Rump Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> then reſtored to their Seats after <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Death. They were likewiſe treating about a Match between their King and Madam <hi>Margaret</hi> Prince <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54374:136"/>
much taken with the Lady, that many thought a Marriage was like to enſue. About the ſame time the Count <hi>de Cominges</hi> Ambaſſador Extraordinary from <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Lisbon</hi> was Negotiating another Match between the ſame King, and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that was likewiſe in ſuch great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, that Preparations were making for the Wedding, and ſeveral things got ready, which ſerved afterwards when that Princeſs was Married into another Country; and all this to bring on a third Match between the ſame King and the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> which had been in. Treaty ever ſince the firſt Overtures of Peace were made, and both theſe Treaties with <hi>Spain,</hi> viz. of Marriage and Peace, had ſuch a mutual Dependance on each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they were neceſſarily to proceed or break off together. The Advances that the <hi>French</hi> made towards a concluſion of the Match with <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſtartled the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> for ſhould they go on, there could be no hopes of a Peace; and <hi>France</hi> in all probability would in that caſe enter into new Engagements with <hi>Portugal,</hi> wherefore <hi>Don Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Pimentel</hi> was ſent Poſt to <hi>Lions,</hi> whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there preſently broke off all other Treaties, and revived thoſe with <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> yielding at laſt to the neceſſity of their Affairs, and accepting of the <hi>French</hi> Propoſals in relation to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> which were, that he ſhould be permitted to return into <hi>France,</hi> and be reſtor'd to the King's Favour, but remain depriv'd of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments: The Court hereupon removing to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> the principal Articles were there adjuſted, that were afterwards confirm'd by the two great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at the <hi>Pirenees.</hi> But the Allies of <hi>France</hi> ſeem to have been quite forgot at this Treaty of <hi>Paris,</hi> as it was called, at leaſt no mention made
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54374:137"/>
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> unleſs it were in that Article whereby the <hi>French</hi> oblig'd themſelves to abandon it; but that Article had then none of the fine Preamble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, which now ſets it off ſo much to advantage, in the printed Copys of the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Treaty.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were tranſacted, the <hi>Conde de Soure</hi> was coming Ambaſſador extraordinary from <hi>Portugal,</hi> with ſuch Inſtructions as ſhow'd, that the Queen Regent was intirely ſatisfied of the ſincere Affection of her intended Son-in-law, for he was ordered to demand no leſs then 4000 Foot, form'd into ſix Regiments and 1000 Horſe, and all to be paid by his <hi>moſt Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty, even while they were in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſervice; or if <hi>France</hi> could not ſpare ſo much Money, he was at leaſt to raiſe the Men in that Kingdom. He was likewiſe to chooſe out two General Officers, and engage them in his Maſter's ſervice, Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for their Fidelity and Ability; he was alſo to put the laſt hand to the League that had been ſo long in Agitation, there being little Cauſe to doubt but that it would now be ſoon brought to happy Concluſion.</p>
               <p>But the Ambaſſador upon his arrival at <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> was ſurprized with the News, that a Truce had been Proclaim'd between the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and a day fixt for a Conferences between the Cardinal, and <hi>Don Luis de Haro,</hi> in order to conclude the Peace. When he was got to <hi>Roan,</hi> he receiv'd a Meſſage from the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Agent, more mortifying than what he had heard before; for the Agent having acquainted the Cardinal of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's arrival, was bid to adviſe him to come <hi>Incognito</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> his Eminence doubting whether it was convenient to receive a Publick Embaſſy from <hi>Portugal,</hi> whoſe Intereſts <hi>France</hi> was obliged
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54374:137"/>
to abandon by the Peace to be made with <hi>Spain.</hi> Upon his coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Cardinal entirely diſabus'd him, and put an end to all the hopes they had hitherto been feeding themſelves with in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi> for now there was no more talk of the League with <hi>France,</hi> nor of any conditions to be made with <hi>Spain,</hi> but ſuch as the Cardinal might be aſſured that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> would never be brought to accept of; ſo far was the Ambaſſador from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the 5000 Men he came to Demand, that he could not prevail to have two General Officers of that Nation: The Cardinal having ſo much Honour left as to tell the Ambaſſador, that ſhould he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend <hi>French</hi> Men to him, in caſe the Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> enſued, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> might well que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion their Fidelity, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> his Sincerity. However, he named to him two that were of other Nations, whom he advis'd him to Treat with, they being Perſons of known Valour and Conduct, and in all reſpects qualified to Command in the Poſts they were deſign'd for. The Ambaſſador took his adviſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having conſulted with Marſh. <hi>Turenne,</hi> who knew the Men, and highly approv'd of the choice; the firſt, That the Ambaſſador treated with, was the Earl of <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> who preſently embark'd for <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> but had the misfortune to be taken in his Paſſage by the <hi>Algerines,</hi> and after having regain'd his Liberty, he had been but a little while at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> when the News came of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, which occaſion'd his Return home. He was deſign'd afterwards to Command the Forces which that King ſent to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but he did not continue long there. The other was the Famous Count, afterwards Marſhal and late Duke of <hi>Schonberg,</hi> who when he came to have the Command of Men that were worthy of ſuch a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54374:138"/>
Leader, ſoon chang'd the face of things in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and reſtored the moſt deſperate Affairs of that Nation to ſuch a ſtate, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who now made ſure of over running it, were glad to ſue for a Peace, and the <hi>French</hi> who at this time were caſting off the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> with ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, thought fit to court their Alliance: but thoſe by whom the Count effected all this, were not <hi>French</hi> men, and the Cardinal was no Prophet. At preſent he had ſo little conſideration for <hi>Portugal,</hi> that when he was preſented with a Memorial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining twenty ſeven Reaſons why <hi>France</hi> ought not to make Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> without including <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> his Eminence having now gain'd his ends could not find ſo much as one Reaſon among all the ſeven and twenty that was concluſive, though the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> pretended to a Promiſe under the Hand and Seal of King <hi>Louis 13th.</hi> After this came on the Conferences between the Cardinal and <hi>Don Luis de Haro,</hi> at the <hi>Pirenees;</hi> there indeed the Cardinal would ſometimes put in a word for the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but it was only in order to keep <hi>Don Luis</hi> quiet, when he had nothing elſe to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf withal from the Perſecutions of that Miniſter, who notwithſtanding what had been agreed upon at <hi>Paris,</hi> and conſented to in <hi>Spain,</hi> could not help making ſome motion or other in almoſt every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> and ſometimes he would do it with ſo much Vehemence, that the Treaty was ſeveral times like to be broken off pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this Account, even when all other Matters were adjuſted. For <hi>Don Luis</hi> was ſo very tender of his Maſter's Honour, which ſeem'd to him to ly at ſtake on this ſingle point, that he thought he could never do enough to retrieve it; one would think were we to judge of the Conduct of theſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54374:138"/>
two great Men, as 'tis repreſented in <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Letters, that on this occaſion he had changed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters with the Cardinal; <hi>Don Luis</hi> is repreſented at other times, as having all the diſtinguiſhing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the Cardinal on all other occaſions complains of him for being ſtiff, ſlow, and cold, but when he makes him Pleading for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> he repreſents him as transform'd into another Man. He would then become ſupple on a ſudden, uſing all the moſt Inſinuating and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging ways of Addreſs, to gain upon the Cardinal, he would Careſs, Court and Flatter him, enduring his Repulſes without the leaſt Reſentment, as long as he thought it poſſible to bring him to a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and as he found all would not do, he would then begin to take Fire, grow Impatient, and break out into the moſt paſſionate Complaints, as unable to bear the Reproach that his Maſter muſt be forc'd to abandon his Allie. The Cardinal did not ſhow himſelf ſo very paſſionate for the honour of his Maſter, or the ſafety of his Allie, had the Affair of <hi>Portugal</hi> gone as much to his Heart, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but the <hi>Italian</hi> would have fawn'd and cring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much, and winded himſelf into as many ſhapes to gain his ends as the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> They that know any thing of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, would ſurely have expected a great deal more of this from him, than from a Perſon of <hi>Don Luis de Haro</hi>'s Character and Quality. Its true, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence was at this time at the very heighth of his Greatneſs and Glory, and might think it beneath him to be playing over his old tricks, he would now be thought to have put off the <hi>Italian,</hi> and pretended much to the Promptitude and Vivacity of a <hi>Frenchman;</hi> but then had he any concern for his Allie, he would ſurely have receiv'd ſome
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54374:139"/>
warmth from all that heat He obſerved in <hi>Don Luis,</hi> at leaſt that natural Vanity of his, which was at this time encreaſed to as great a height, as the ſtation he was in could raiſe it, ſhould have put him upon doing ſomething for a Prince, who had no other Dependence but upon him; and what could there have been more Glorious for this proud Great Man, who had a Crown'd Head for his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, being ſo ſenſible as he was, that the Eyes of all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> were upon him, Princes and Nations expecting their Fate in the Iſſue of his Proceedings, than inſtead of wrangling and ſquabbling about the exchange of every little <hi>Bicocque,</hi> to be pleading the Cauſe of a Diſtreſſed and Orphan King? But alas! he did not lay the Cauſe of <hi>Portugal</hi> to heart at all, nor concern himſelf for its Preſervation. He had uſed that People before ſo baſely, that he ſeem'd to deſire their Deſtruction no leſs than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves; He contented himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to repell the moſt lively inſtances of <hi>Don Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> by telling with all the Coldneſs and Phleme imaginable, That <hi>his Maſter was ſo deſirous of Peace, that he had no ſuch Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations for the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>as he expreſſed for the Prince,</hi> and that <hi>his Maſter might in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice uſe the Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>in the ſame manner as the</hi> Spaniards <hi>intended to ſerve the King of</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. Its true, that in one of the firſt Conferences, when he had no other way to put by the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of <hi>Don Luis,</hi> he told him, (knowing very well as he ſaith himſelf in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Le Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> that he ſhould not be taken at his Word) that ſince he was ſo very Paſſionate for the Intereſts of the Prince, he himſelf had one Propoſal to make, and would deſire the King his Maſter's Conſent, which ſhould be more advantageous to the Prince,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54374:139"/>
than any thing <hi>Don Luis</hi> had yet deſired: The <hi>Spaniard</hi> over joy'd at this News, was impatient to know what the Propoſal might be; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal told him, <hi>He would deſire the King of</hi> France <hi>to reſtore the Prince and his Son the Duke of</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien, <hi>to all their Charges and Governments, on Condition that the</hi> Catholick <hi>King would leave</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal <hi>in the ſtate it was then in.</hi> The Offer was rejected with all the Indignation that the Cardinal look'd for, and had he not thought as much, it never had been made; <hi>for</hi> as his Eminence ſaith to Mr. <hi>Le Tellier, when he made this bold or hardy Propoſal,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>he knew it would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi> Now if the <hi>French</hi> did not think it worth their while to reſcue the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> from apparent Ruin at ſo ſmall an Expence, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his Employments again, it is more unlikely ſtill that they ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to do that, and yield up the many ſtrong Towns and ſome entire Provinces, that they had poſſeſs'd themſelves of in a five and twenty years War; and this it is that tempts me to believe, that the Propoſal mention'd in the <hi>60th.</hi> Article of this Treaty, was never made in earneſt; the Cardinal in the ſame Letter gives a little more light into this Myſtery; he ſaith there, That <hi>he made theſe offers to let</hi> Don Luis <hi>ſee what vaſt Advances his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had made towards a Peace, and of what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence his yielding in the point of</hi> Portugal <hi>was; ſince rather than do that, he would be content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Prince to his Governments, and give up all his Conqueſts, and it is a great Eaſe to me,</hi> continues he, <hi>that when</hi> Don Luis <hi>is reckoning up the great Advantages the King gets by this Peace, counting the Places and Provinces that remain to his Majeſty, that I can anſwer him again, that all he ſaid was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54374:140"/>
in Compariſon to the Conceſſion we make in the Article of</hi> Portugal, though he gives a hint to Mr. <hi>Le Tellier</hi> by the by, <hi>that for certain Reaſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>all this was no ſuch great matter neither, as he endeavour'd to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> I do not find by his Letters that he made this <hi>Hardy Propoſal</hi> as he calls it, any more during the whole time of the Treaty, but I find him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards directing Mr. <hi>De Lionne</hi> to word the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of the Article in the ſame manner as it now ſtands; the Body it ſeems was adjuſted before at the Treaties of <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo that poſſibly the Preamble had no better grounds for it than the occaſional Diſcourſe of which I have now given an account, let the Reader then judge what we are to make of this formal Declaration, <hi>(vid.</hi> the <hi>60th.</hi> Article of the Treaty of the <hi>Pirenees.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That his</hi> moſt Chriſtian <hi>Majeſty deſiring with an extreme Paſſion, to ſee the Kingdom of</hi> Portugal <hi>enjoy the ſame Repoſe that other</hi> Chriſtian <hi>States acquire by this preſent Treaty, had to that end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a good number of Ways and Expedients, which he thought might be to the ſatisfaction of his</hi> Catholick <hi>Majeſty, among which notwithſtanding, as hath been ſaid, that he is under no ſort of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in this affair, he hath gone ſo far as to be willing to deprive himſelf of the Principal Fruit of that happy Succeſs which his Arms have had during the courſe of a long War, offering beſides the Places which he reſtores by this preſent Treaty to his</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Majeſty, to ſurrender up all the Conqueſts in general that his ſaid Arms have made in this War, and to re-eſtabliſh entirely Monſieur the Prince of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, <hi>provided and on condition that the Affairs of the Kingdom of</hi> Portugal <hi>might be left in the ſtate they are in at preſent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:54374:140"/>
I cannot pretend to tell what the many Ways and Expedients here mention'd were, finding little or nothing ſaid of them in the Accounts of the Treaty that are yet extant, or in the Cardinal's Letters, who ſeems to have given an account of all the moſt material Paſſages, and yet he mentions but one expedient as propos'd by himſelf, and he ſaith too, that he offered that rather to divert <hi>Don Luis</hi> from preſſing him, in behalf of the Prince than out of hopes that it would be accepted. He made it on this occaſion: <hi>Don Luis</hi> had been very urgent with him, that ſince the Prince could not be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Charges and Governments in <hi>France,</hi> he might be allow'd to accept of a Compenſation elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that the <hi>Catholick</hi> King might beſtow upon him either the two <hi>Calabrias,</hi> with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> or the Government of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> with the ſame Authorithy and Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as it was poſſeſs'd by the Cardinal <hi>Infante,</hi> and ſome places for himſelf on the Frontiers; but the Cardinal would conſent to nothing of all this, ſaying, That the Prince muſt reſolve to be wholly <hi>French</hi> or wholly <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> that is, have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or have nothing to do in <hi>France: Yet ſince the King of</hi> Spain <hi>was ſo willing to part with theſe Countries, he deſired that the Kingdom of</hi> Sardinia <hi>might be given to the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and he would deſire his Maſter to agree to it, ſo as that the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>ſhould have cauſe to be ſatisfy'd.</hi> This ſaith he to <hi>Don Luis, is the fineſt Expedient in the World, both to content the King, and let the World ſee that my Maſter ſeeks to get a handſome Retreat for his Ally; for if the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>ſhall embrace this Expedient, the</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>King will be put in Poſſeſſion of ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the leaſt of which is more conſiderable than
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54374:141"/>
that of</hi> Sardinia. I do not find that the Cardinal propos'd any other Expedient beſides this, and this is enough to ſhow what an extream Paſſion he had to ſerve his Maſter's Ally; he would have him ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up all his Dominions for that poor and little Kingdom of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſuch occaſions have offered to give away, but could never get any one to accept of it, and yet it ſeems the Cardinal thought this was too much for the King of <hi>Portugal, for he propos'd it</hi> as he ſaith himſelf, <hi>without any hopes of ſucceeding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was indeed another Expedient offer'd at, but it came from <hi>Don Luis,</hi> which was, That on condition the Prince might have ſome Place of ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given him, ſuch as <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bragança</hi> ſhould have <hi>Olivença</hi> beſtow'd on him, be re-eſtabliſh'd in his Eſtate and Honour, and have over and above the Office of Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille.</hi> But this Expedient was laught at by the Cardinal, he thought that what <hi>Don Luis</hi> offer'd, was too dear at the price of <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> and therefore he would bid nothing at all: When he was brought to conſent at laſt, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhould have the Government of <hi>Burgundy</hi> with the Caſtle of <hi>Dijon,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Anguien</hi> his Son, the Place of <hi>Grand Maitre,</hi> he did not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an Equivalent for his Ally of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but ſcrew'd from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aveſneſs for his Maſter, and the Reſtitution of <hi>Juliers</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Nieubourg.</hi> As for the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he was to ſurrender up all his Kingdoms and Dominions, and content himſelf with his Paternal Eſtate, and a Pardon for what was paſt, which as the Article ſaith, was all that his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty by his powerful Offices could procure for him; but in caſe that he did not accept of the ſame within three
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54374:141"/>
Months after the Ratification of the preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>his ſaid Majeſty promis'd, engag'd, and oblig'd himſelf upon his Honour, in the Faith and Word of a King, for himſelf and his Succeſſors, not to give to the ſaid Kingdom of</hi> Portugal <hi>in common, or to any Perſon or Perſons therein in particular, of what Dignity, Eſtate, Quality or Condition ſoever, any Aid or Aſſiſtance, Publick or Secret, Directly or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly of Men, Arms, Ammunitions, Proviſions, Ships or Money, nor any thing elſe either by Land or by Sea, or in any other Manner; and that he would not ſuffer Levies to be made in any parts of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Eſtates, nor grant Paſſage to ſuch as might come from other States to the Aſſiſtance of the ſaid Kingdom of</hi> Portugal, ſo that hitherto the Houſe of <hi>Bragança</hi> hath not been very much obliged to <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I proceed further, I find my ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to juſtify the Cardinal's Memory from a moſt horrible crime, which the <hi>French</hi> men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not ſtick to charge him with; for they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others pretend, that at the making of this Solemn Promiſe, he had already reſolv'd to violate his Faith, and that he was intending to ſend thoſe ſuccors into <hi>Portugal,</hi> which afterwards arriv'd there from <hi>France,</hi> at the very time when he was obliging his Maſter, who was then but a young Man and under his Direction, to ſwear the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but I think there is Cauſe to believe, that ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable a Perfidy had not as yet enter'd into his thoughts. Its true, what he ſaith to Mr. <hi>Le Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, That for ſome reaſons unknown to the</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, <hi>his yielding in the point of</hi> Portugal, <hi>was not ſo advantageous to them as he made them believe;</hi> would look very ſuſpicious, were it not a uſual thing with him on all other occaſions to affect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54374:142"/>
thought a greater <hi>Fourbe</hi> than he really was; for we find him bragging in moſt of his Letters, how he cheated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in making them think more highly of almoſt every one of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions than they deſerved, whereas they took his Eminence for the Duppe all the while. But I do not in the leaſt Queſtion, but that he really did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to abandon <hi>Portugal</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at this time, according as he was now obliged by all that is Sacred among Men; I will not urge for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he all along moſt ſolemnly proteſted to <hi>Don Luis,</hi> that in caſe the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſubmitted not to the conditions offer'd them by this Peace, he would perſwade his Maſter to hold them for his Enemies, for I believe few will give much heed to Proteſtations made by his Eminence on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but he ſpoke his mind without doubt in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letter, ſent by him to Mr. <hi>Le Tillier,</hi> to be communicated to the King, wherein he repreſents the affairs of <hi>Portugal</hi> to be in ſo deplorable a State, <hi>That the Queen Regent was neither in a condition to defend her ſelf, nor in any terms of accommodation with the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>ſo that as things ſtood, both ſhe and her Son, were in great danger, not only of their Crown, but of their Perſons.</hi> But notwithſtanding all this, he doth not adviſe the King, that the Troops ſhould be ready for a Voyage to <hi>Portugal,</hi> againſt the ſigning of the Treaty, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Crown, and ſave the Perſons of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Queen and her Children, had he any ſuch deſign in his head at that time, we ſhould in all probability find him giving ſome hints of it in theſe Letters. But to put this matter out of doubt, he talks of ſending to that Princeſs, to let her know, That he thought it moſt expedient for her to ſubmit her ſelf to the King <hi>of</hi> Spain, <hi>from whom he was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54374:142"/>
perſwaded ſhe might obtain an Equivalent to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage elſewhere, for what Eſtate ſhe and her Son were poſſeſs'd of in</hi> Portugal, <hi>ſince he had been often told by</hi> Don Luis, <hi>that his Maſter in order to compleat the Peace, would not ſtick to beſtow on her Son the Charge of Conſtable of</hi> Caſtille <hi>with other ſuch like Honours.</hi> This ſurely is not the Language of one who was deſigning to ſend Forces to her aſſiſtance, to animate her to carry on the War, ſo that it ſeems to be an unjuſt Aſperſion upon his Memory, to ſay that he made this Peace with a purpoſe to violate it as ſoon as it was Sign'd; there is indeed cauſe enough to ſuſpect that he was not ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately concern'd for the Well-fare of his Maſter's Allie, as is pretended in the Article, or rather he may be juſtly accuſed of the greateſt Inhumanity to ſay no worſe; who when he thought this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was in ſo deplorable a Condition, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, and the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> ſo diſpoſed to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, procured no better terms for them, as he certainly might have done while the Treaty laſted, and the buſineſs of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was in agitation. But ſtill he clears himſelf of that which would have rendered him more infamous to Poſterity; of engaging his Maſter in ſo black a Crime, as is a premeditated willful Perjury.</p>
               <p>But by whoſe fault ſoever it was, this is certain, That the Peace was no ſooner ratified on both ſides, confirm'd by the Marriage between the <hi>French</hi> King, and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſworn to at the high Altar before the Sacrament, which was expoſed on this occaſion; but while the People were every where making publick Demonſtrations of their Joy, for ſo happy a Concluſion of a long and calamitous War, great Numbers of the moſt expert Officers in the Kingdom, Gentlemen, Soldiers, Engineers,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54374:143"/>
Miners were marching towards <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> in order to Embark for <hi>Portugal:</hi> Theſe were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards follow'd by the choice of the King's Troops, till at laſt the <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries in <hi>Portugal</hi> amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to near 6000 effective Men. But this was none of the Cardinal's doing, for as little as he kept his faith with the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> he dealt more ſincerely with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for he ſent the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Choup</hi> upon the Meſſage mention'd in his Letters, to perſwade the Queen Regent to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up the Kingdom, in hopes that the Dukes of <hi>Brogança</hi> ſhould hereafter be made perpetual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, or Vice Roys of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and theſe were all the Inſtructions he gave the Marquis, as the Marquis declar'd when he arrived at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he met with ſuch a cold Reception as his Meſſage deſerv'd; ſo far was he from giving any underhand encouragement to the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to carry on the War, as ſome Writers affirm he did with great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to the Cardinal. Its true, that while his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence was diſabuſing the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ambaſſador, as to all his former Promiſes, he entertain'd him in hopes that ways might be found out for the <hi>French</hi> Troops to paſs into <hi>Portugal,</hi> after the Peace was made with <hi>Spain;</hi> but when the Count <hi>de Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> offer'd the ſame Ambaſſador, to put himſelf with two Regiments into the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſervice, in caſe he could but have the Tacit Conſent of <hi>France,</hi> he was not only denied by the Cardinal, but told that if he perſiſted in the Deſign, he ſhould forfeit the place of <hi>Grand Ecuyer,</hi> which had been granted to his Son, the Count <hi>d' Armagnac;</hi> ſo that the Cardinal ſeems to be pretty clear of this ſo great and direct a Violation of the new made Treaty.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to be thought that his Maſter could have any hand in it; for his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54374:143"/>
to manifeſt to the World, how diſpoſed he was to obſerve the Oath he had ſo Religiouſly taken, when it appeared that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ambaſſador was liſting Men in <hi>France,</hi> ſent him repeated Orders to depart the Kingdom, and ſome time afterwards commanded the Agent of the ſame Nation to be turn'd out likewiſe, and publiſh'd his Edicts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal home ſuch Officers and Soldiers as were in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſervice, confiſcating the Eſtates of the Diſobedient. 'Tis true, the Ambaſſador after he had been order'd to be gone, continued ſometime at <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> with no leſs then 600 Officers, Gentlemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about him, that he had raiſed for the ſervice, and they did not lie concealed all the while, for the Inhabitants of the Town roſe in a Mutiny againſt them, for eating up their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and when they and others after them arrived in <hi>Portugal,</hi> they were under Military Diſcipline, ſo that ſhould they offer to obey their King's Edicts, Count <hi>Schonberg</hi> who was their Leader, might have hang'd them for Deſertion; and the Count for his part when he return'd into <hi>France,</hi> was rewarded with a Marſhals Bâton: Levies were afterwards publickly made indeed for the ſame ſervice, but then it was done in Marſhal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Name, who took the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Affairs upon his account; and when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made loud complaints of it, as a manifeſt infraction of the Treaty, their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador was put off with a cold and contemptuous Anſwer, that it was but the Act of a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that the Court did not concern it ſelf in the Buſineſs. The ſame thing its true was at laſt done openly, and without Diſguiſe, but it does not appear where the fault lay then.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>French</hi> ſuccors arrived in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the affairs of that Kingdom began to change face, for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54374:144"/>
if they were before, as the Cardinal ſuppoſed them to be, in a bad ſtate, they now fell from bad to worſe: The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> while they were left to ſtand on their own Leggs, had as meanly as the Cardinal thought of their condition, bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves, and gain'd ſeveral very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Advantages over their Enemies, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the two famous Battles of <hi>Montijo</hi> in 1644. and <hi>Elvas</hi> in 1658. This laſt Victory was the more conſiderable, for that it gave a check to the fury of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> when ſpur'd on by the Pope, who pretended he muſt be forc'd to acknowledge that King's Title, they made their utmoſt efforts to quiet his Holineſs, and deſtroy them out of hand; and had the year before taken <hi>Olivença,</hi> the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Place for ſtrength next to <hi>Elvas,</hi> that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had; and that year <hi>Don Luis de Haro,</hi> himſelf at the head of all the Forces he could mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter together, had obliged them to riſe from the Siege of <hi>Badajoz,</hi> at the very time when the place was reduc'd to Extremity, but at the laſt they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely routed <hi>Don Luis,</hi> when he laid Siege to <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas,</hi> which defeat ſo diſheartned the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that for the two following Years, they gave the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> little trouble; it ſeems they thought fit to defer their Revenge till the Peace was made with the <hi>French,</hi> and then they took it to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, on the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> together. For in the Years 1661 and 62. Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> at the head of a ſmall Army, in all not amounting to 20000, but conſiſting of <hi>Veteran</hi> Troops drawn from <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> entred <hi>Portugal,</hi> Ravaging, Spoiling and Burning all before him; 'tis true, he never gain'd any ſet Battle, for by all the Havock he made, he never could provoke the Enemy to fight, though he ſeveral times ſent them the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54374:144"/>
and inſulted them in their very Trenches, ſo he contented himſelf with taking a vaſt number of their Towns, many of them Rich, Populous and Strong. The firſt year he took <hi>Arronches</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conchel,</hi> and fortified and put Garriſons into both places, in the former near 5000 men; the next year he was early in the Field, and in the heart of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> putting all things to Fire and Sword; and <hi>Lisbon</hi> it ſelf was in ſuch a horrible Conſternation, that had he marched directly thither, 'tis thought he might have taken the City without Reſiſtance. But continuing to deſtroy the Country, he ſent a Detatchment to take <hi>Villa Boim,</hi> a ſtrong and rich Place, but preſently ſurrendered by a <hi>French</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. After this, he braved the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army in their Camp, under the Walls of <hi>Eſtremos,</hi> but in vain, for it was impoſſible to draw them to a Battle; he then took <hi>Borba,</hi> a place of ſmall ſtrength indeed, but deſperately Defended, for it had a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Governor. Next he laid Siege to <hi>Geromenha,</hi> a place ſtrongly Situated and Fortified after the modern way, with a Garriſon of 3000 Men, and provided with all things neceſſary for a ſtout Defenſe, but ſurrendered in a Months time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army had in vain attempted to relieve it; this done, <hi>Don John</hi> would have fought the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> but found they had alter'd their mind, and having ſtrongly intrench'd themſelves near <hi>Villa Viçoſa,</hi> patiently beheld him Ravaging the Country round about them, he ſeeing he could do no good upon them, took <hi>Veyros</hi> and blew up the Caſtle, enter'd <hi>Monforte,</hi> and put a Garriſon in it; deſtroy'd <hi>Alter-Chaon, Cabeça de Vide,</hi> and <hi>Alter Poderoſo,</hi> and all the Country round about. He then took <hi>Crato,</hi> and in it the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſtores and Proviſions, ordering the Governor to be ſhot to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54374:145"/>
Death for making Reſiſtance, upon that, <hi>Aſſumar</hi> was preſently ſurrendered to him; he would have taken Poſſeſſion likewiſe of <hi>Alegrete,</hi> but that place, as it muſt be acknowledg'd, was preſerv'd by a <hi>French</hi> Governor. For when <hi>Don John</hi> ſent him a menacing Summons, he was anſwer'd with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of two Bottles of Wine, the Governor deſiring his Highneſs to taſt what excellent Liquor the place afforded, ſending him word with all, that he was reſolv'd to defend the Town to the laſt Drop. The jeſt took, and <hi>Don John</hi> without giving the Man any further trouble, continued his march, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>Ouguella</hi> without Reſiſtance, a ſmall place but of great Importance; and having left two Regiments in it the Summer heats coming on, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into Quarters.</p>
               <p>The Next year he took the Field again with an Army much ſtronger and better provided then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He had no ſooner paſt the Frontiers, but he was expected at <hi>Lisbon;</hi> however, he thought fit to make himſelf Maſter firſt of <hi>Evora,</hi> the ſecond City of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as he did after nine days Siege; the Garriſon which was numerous, being made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of War for that Summer, and ſent away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caſtille;</hi> by this ſucceſs <hi>Don John</hi> became in a manner Maſter of all <hi>Alemtejo,</hi> or the Country on the other ſide of the <hi>Tagus.</hi> He ſent a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 3000 Horſe and 2000 Foot down as far as <hi>Alcacere do Sal,</hi> a Town ſituated upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Sado;</hi> not far from <hi>Setuval,</hi> the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sea-port Town next to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and but at a ſmall diſtance from it. This was done with deſign to encreaſe the Conſternation at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in order to <hi>Don John</hi>'s marching thither, to put an end to the War. The People of that City when they heard of his laying Siege to <hi>Evora,</hi> expecting that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54374:145"/>
their turn ſhould be next, were all in an Uproar; but when the News came that <hi>Evora</hi> was taken, ſuch a fury poſſeſs'd the City, that the better ſort through rage and diſpair joyn'd the Rabble, and all in a common Mob, fell a committing ſuch Outrages, that they ſeem'd reſolv'd to prevent the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and finiſh their own Ruin themſelves. Their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was not a little increas'd by <hi>Antonio de Souſa,</hi> a Man never good at dealing with a Multitude. He thinking to amuſe them and divert their Fury upon the common Enemy, would needs have a line drawn a croſs the <hi>Terreiro do Paço,</hi> cauſing it to be publiſhed, that all thoſe brave Men that would paſs the Line, and come over to the ſide next the Palace, ſhould be choſen out to help the Army in defence of their Countrys Liberty. The Novelty of the thing drew an innumerable concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together, who when their Paſſions were up, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Enemy, and leaving the <hi>Terreiro do Paço,</hi> fell foul upon the Houſes of the Miniſters of State, ſuch more eſpecially, as had manag'd the Military Affairs, and after they had been Ranſacking, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and Burning, whatever came to hand they return'd again, and it may have been through wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, rather then want of will, that they ſpared the Palace it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe terrible Convulſions ſeizing upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at a time when the Enemy was raging in its Bowels with ſo much Violence, look'd like the ſymptoms of an approaching end; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were now arriv'd and ready for Action, and they by the quick and happy Turn, which they gave to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Affairs, recovered the expiring State to Life again, and enabled that People to expel the Enemy, and follow him into his own Country, and to humble him to the Condition in which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54374:146"/>
ever ſince; but of this in its due place.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Affairs of <hi>Portugal</hi> were by the help of theſe their Friends brought (to a flouriſhing condition) they could be in their circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and the War in all appearance drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a happy concluſion on their ſide, his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty began to have a particular Eſteem for the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to own him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his Allie; and his Affection for that Prince was now ſo very great, that notwithſtanding the Engagements he was under to <hi>Spain,</hi> not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf with him: He was now reſolved to ſtand by him, and take his part againſt all Oppoſers, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more eſpecially; and to become (as his Majeſty was pleaſed himſelf to expreſs it) his Companion in Arms; He telling the <hi>Portuguſe</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador at a ſecret Audience in 1666. that he was ready, not only to bear a ſhare with him in the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the War, but likewiſe to accompany him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Field; offering withal, of his own accord, to enter into the League which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had for ſo many years together implored in vain, during the time of their Diſtreſs; and more than that, was very urgent in preſſing their conſent to it. Its true, indeed the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had never leſs occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Aſſiſtance, then at the time when he was ſo earneſt with them to accept of it, but his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty had great occaſion for theirs.</p>
               <p>For that King being then in his full Vigour, and the very flour of his Age, he out of his extreme thirſt after Glory, was meditating a ſuddain Irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Netherlands, ſeveral of which Countries lying convenient for <hi>France;</hi> he laid claim to them in his Queen's Right, who being a Child of the firſt <hi>Venter,</hi> ought as 'twas ſaid, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of thoſe Countries, to have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54374:146"/>
inherited them from her Father, who died the laſt year, in Excluſion to the Male Iſſue by a ſecond Marriage. 'Tis true, that Princeſs had at her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage made a formal Renunciation of any Right or Title that might accrue to her, to her Father's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, either in whole or in part: But in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects, the <hi>French</hi> King found himſelf in a condition to make good his Claim; his Armies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long breathing time had now recovered new Vigour. His Brother-in-law the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was then but an Infant under Government of his Mother, and the Widow and the Orphan were like to make but a feeble Reſiſtance; for their beſt Troops had been drawn from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and conſumed in this fatal War with <hi>Portugal;</hi> but however, for fear leſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not yet humbled enough to be ſecurely trampled upon, or if there were none elſe to fall upon them at the ſame time, might make ſome dying Efforts to repell ſo unjuſt an aſſailant as they no doubt would take his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be. It was judged convenient, that while he was engaging himſelf in this hazardous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſhould be ſet on to keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Play, and animated to follow thoſe deadly Blows they had already given them, with a more vigorous proſecution of the War. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, that <hi>France</hi> propoſed the League Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and Defenſive to this Court.</p>
               <p>But to perſwade the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to imbrace the Propoſal, was thought and with a great deal of Reaſon, to be no eaſy matter; for as much pleas'd and elevated with their Victories as they were, they had as great cauſe as ever to wiſh for a Peace. That poor People had been in Arms for theſe five and twenty years, and were now haraſs'd out, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpent in defending their Country; a ſmall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54374:147"/>
Country indeed, yet but thinly Peopled and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in length, with a Frontier of a hundred Leagues, which muſt be continually guarded or lie expoſed to the Enemies incurſions. In this long War their Youth had been deſtroyed, their Lands laid waſt, their Stocks conſumed, and their Moneys brought to an end; ſo that ſhould the War continue, let their Victories be never ſo many, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in a ſhort time compleat their Ruin. To a People in ſuch a caſe, all talk of prolonging the War muſt ſound ſo harſh, that it could not be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd they ſhould hear of it with any Patience; and that which gave the <hi>French</hi> greater cauſe ſtill to deſpair of gaining their ends on the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> theſe had now for ſome time been flattering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with hopes, that they ſhould ſee a ſpeedy end of their Miſeries. The ſtomachs of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were by this time come down, and they deſired a Peace as much as the <hi>Portugueſes;</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Madrid,</hi> had wrought ſo effectually upon them, that the Articles were drawing up, and all things making ready for a Treaty; Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Secretary had been in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> to give notice to that Court of what he was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and he had ſignified by Letters, that he was preparing for his Journey to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in order to ſet the laſt hand to the Treaty. Theſe Tidings had been received in <hi>Portugal</hi> with the welcome they deſerv'd, and the bleſſed Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Peace, as Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was then call'd, was look'd for with impatience: They thought their Condition upon his coming would be a kind of Heaven, to what it then was, He being, as one of the great Miniſters expreſs'd it, to let them in to the Beatifick Viſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:54374:147"/>
The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> being thus diſpoſed, the <hi>French</hi> ſaw plainly that it would be to no purpoſe to make any direct motion to them, for carrying on the War; ſo that in order to bring the Deſign about, it was thought convenient to take a Compaſs, and all their Talk was of Peace while they were preparing themſelves and inciting their Friends to War; or if War was mention'd, it was only by the bye, and as a laſt reſerve in order to procure for <hi>Portugal</hi> a more firm, laſting, and honourable Peace. But to ſecure this, 'twas pretended that a League with <hi>France</hi> was abſolutely neceſſary for <hi>Portugal, France</hi> being alone able, as they ſaid, to procure good Conditions from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to ſee they ſhould be well obſerv'd. To this purpoſe had <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs, Turenne</hi> and <hi>Colbert</hi> been ſeveral times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Paris.</hi> And that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> might be ſenſible that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their Good was aimed at, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who was there making the moſt ſolemn Proteſtations that the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be kept inviolable, had Orders likewiſe to interpoſe his Maſter's good Offices, and make a tender of his Mediation to compoſe all Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with <hi>Portugal,</hi> and put an end to the War: This offer being hearkned to as 'twas pretended, the Marqueſs <hi>de Sande</hi> (then at <hi>Paris</hi> adjuſting King <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s Marriage, and having the Character of an Ambaſſador for that buſineſs only) was ſent for to the ſecret Audience before mention'd, and told that the Queen Regent of <hi>Spain</hi> had accepted of the Mediation, and that in caſe ſuch Propoſals were made by that Court as were fit to be accepted, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador there had Orders to make a Journey to <hi>Lisbon</hi> and conclude the Peace; or if any thing ſhould detain him, he was to communicate the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54374:148"/>
Propoſals to the <hi>Abbè de S. Romain</hi> at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> who ſhould impart them to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Miniſters; there being no doubt but that the Peace would be ſoon adjuſted, conſidering to what a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had reduced the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy. But then his Majeſty did not think it adviſeable for them to take up with any doubtful or fallacious Truce, and in concluſion, bid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs aſſure the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that in caſe a Peace enſued, He himſelf would be the Guarant; if a War, he would both bear a ſhare in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and become the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Field.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de S. Romain</hi> had the good fortune to arrive in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and got Audience at the Court which was then at <hi>Salva Terra,</hi> before Sir <hi>Richard Fanſhaw</hi> came there, and he diſplayed all his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in ſetting forth that the King his Maſter had ſo ſincere an Affection for <hi>Portugal,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were coming to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, he was very deſirous to ſee the Peace adjuſted, on condition that the Propoſals made by <hi>Spain</hi> were Advantageous and Honourable; but in caſe they ſhould prove otherwiſe, he was ready to aſſiſt the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> with his Troops, Fleets and Money at their choice, and as their Occaſions ſhould require. Theſe fine Words as they were not wholly loſt, yet had not that effect upon the Court, as to diſpoſe them for a League with <hi>France;</hi> they were wiſhing ſtill for Sir <hi>Richard Fanſhaw</hi>'s coming, and teſtified their ſatisfaction at his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, by giving him the moſt ſplendid Reception that was poſſible at that diſtance from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but all the hopes conceiv'd on both ſides from this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſoon vaniſh'd; for Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had ſo order'd matters, that the Treaty was to be enter'd upon as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54374:148"/>
between Kingdom and Kingdom, by which means the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have been excus'd from making any formal acknowledgment of the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>'s Title. This ſo diſguſted the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> whoſe ſpirits had been mightily rais'd by their late Succeſſes, and perhaps not a little by theſe large Promiſes from <hi>France,</hi> that they return'd back the Propoſals without looking further then the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a ſhort Anſwer, that they never would have Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> unleſs it were made between King and King.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Ambaſſador returning to <hi>Madrid,</hi> found the <hi>Spaniards</hi> become as High on their ſide, and utterly averſe from renewing the Treaty; thoſe fears which had been a great motive to them in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing ſo far as they had gone already, were over for the preſent. They had been all along gueſſing at the true Deſign of thoſe great Levies that the <hi>French</hi> were making, which notwithſtanding all the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtations and Offers of Mediation, had given them terrible Apprehenſions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they might put themſelves into ſome poſture of Defence againſt ſo powerful an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, they had been prevail'd with to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Treaty with <hi>Portugal.</hi> But now they were of another mind, for a War was broken out of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which ſecured them for that time from any attempt of the <hi>French</hi> upon <hi>Flanders;</hi> and ſhould this War continue, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> to deal with at the ſame time, might not be in a condition to ſend ſupplies to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and in caſe that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were once abandon'd by them, there might be hopes of reducing it again to the ſame ſtate in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> found it. But notwithſtanding this Backwardneſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54374:149"/>
of it, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> could not yet be brought to conſent to the <hi>French</hi> League; for as great as their Danger was from the Enemy, they thought it ſeems they ſhould run a greater risk by this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with their pretended Friends. All Monſieur <hi>de S Romain</hi>'s Rhetorick could not prevail with them to ſign it this Year, though the <hi>French</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt had been much increaſed by the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>'s Marriage, and the Arrival of freſh ſupplies from <hi>France;</hi> and their Fortune in the War inſtead of making any Progreſs, ſeem'd to be at a ſtand, or rather had receiv'd ſome very conſiderable checks this Year. But then they were unprovided with Moneys to bear the expenſes of the next Campagne, and at a loſs where to ſeek for a ſupply; the <hi>French</hi> indeed continued to make their large offers, but their kindneſs was look'd upon as the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and to be accepted of only in a deſperate Caſe; and when they thought that they muſt at laſt have recourſe to it, yet to ſhow that they would try all expedients firſt before they would come to an agreement with Mr. <hi>de S. Romain,</hi> they made their application for Money to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> as little in a condition, as they knew that Court to be, to furniſh them after an expenſive War with two moſt powerful Nations, and ſuch great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as befel us at home this and the foregoing Year, but no Money coming from <hi>England,</hi> they at laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in the beginning of the Year 1667. yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>French</hi> Importunities, and agreed to the League.</p>
               <p>The principal Conditions of this League were, <hi rend="margQuotes">;That both Parties ſhould have the ſame Friends and the ſame Enemies, <hi>England</hi> only excepted. That <hi>France</hi> ſhould find as many Men as were neceſſary to carry on an Offenſive War againſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54374:149"/>
                     <hi>Spain,</hi> and all Sea-port Towns taken from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were to be delivered up to the <hi>French. France</hi> was to contribute by way of Loan one half of the pay due to the Auxiliary Troops, and give withal, by way of Loan likewiſe, the ſumm of 300000 Crowns <hi>per Annum.</hi> Neither Party was to treat of a Peace or a Truce without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the other. And it was agreed that this League ſhould laſt for the Term of ten Years.</hi> Had this League continued in force, it would have been to little purpoſe that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew their necks from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoak, and ſo bravely defended their Liberty as they had done in ſo long and tedious a War; for they had now in a manner chang'd Maſters, and from being Subjects to <hi>Spain,</hi> had ſurrendered themſelves up to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion of the <hi>French,</hi> inſtead of ſeeing an end of their Miſeries; they had now in all appearance ten Years of War behind ſtill, and that not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but almoſt all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that is, all the Enemies that <hi>France</hi> ſhould make, whoſe deſigns upon the Univerſal Monarchy, were then breaking out, and had they been ſuffer'd to go on, <hi>England</hi> would not have been long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of the Number. It may juſtly deſerve ones Wonder, that ſo able and clear ſighted a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, as all Parties allow the <hi>Conde de Caſtelmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi> to have been, ſhould upon any account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever be prevail'd with, thus to ſacrifice the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his Country to the Ambition of Strangers; Poſſibly Monſieur <hi>de S. Romain</hi> might make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Diſorders that the Court was in at that time, and the <hi>Conde</hi> ſee that the Faction which had been formerly againſt him, was grown to ſuch a head, that the fury of the People when diverted from a Foreign Enemy, was like to turn upon himſelf
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54374:150"/>
and his Maſter, and might therefore think of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to himſelf a place of Retreat, when the Storm that was a gathering ſhould break upon his Head. But if theſe were his thoughts he found himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards much out in his meaſures, for whatſoever promiſes <hi>France</hi> might have made him when in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet after his Fall, tho' he betook himſelf to that Kingdom, he ſtaid not long there, but found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oblig'd to ſeek for Refuge in another Country; and ſo far was he from ſecuring himſelf at home by this unhappy League, that 'tis thought it did but haſten his Maſter's Ruin and his own, by increaſing the Peoples murmurs againſt them. This is certain, his Enemies pretended that it was made in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due manner, without either the Advice or Conſent of the Council, or the three Eſtates, to the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they ſaid, of the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King having thus found Work for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at home, while his Ambaſſador was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> that if there were any Faith in his Maſter, the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Treaty ſhould be kept inviolable, began the ſo much celebrated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the <hi>Franche Compte</hi> conquering all before him. The Succeſs of his Arms was ſo aſtoniſhing to thoſe that did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how he had laid his Deſigns, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> who were but lately come out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive War, that they had been proſecuting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other, took the Alarm, and together with the <hi>Swede,</hi> made the famous <hi>Triple Alliance,</hi> in order to oblige his <hi>moſt Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty to lay down his Arms. This made that King begin to ſhow ſome Deference to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>9th's.</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation for a Peace, and it was agreed upon by the Parties concern'd, that a Congreſs of their Miniſters
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54374:150"/>
ſhould be held in order to adjuſt all Differences; of this Agreement the <hi>French</hi> King gives notice to his Ally the Prince Regent of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to the end that he ſhould ſend thither his Plenipotentiary to act in concert with the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter.</p>
               <p>And now to all appearance were the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in much the ſame condition as they had been at the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Treaty, having no other hopes of a Pea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>e but what the <hi>French</hi> ſhould procure for them; and what reaſon could they have to think otherwiſe, but that they ſhould be ſacrificed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they were then, and ſold for ſome of the controverted Places in <hi>Flanders? Philipville</hi> and <hi>Marienburg</hi> were their Price then, as ſuch of their Writers that are moſt partial to <hi>France</hi> have declar'd to the World, poſſibly the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might bid higher for them now; and how could the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes</hi> be ſure that they would not be taken at their Word? They had the <hi>French</hi> Faith indeed for their ſecurity, and that engaged to them by the late League in a more ſolemn manner then formerly, but not in ſo ſolemn a manner as it had been given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when it was ſworn in the manner before related, That <hi>France</hi> would wholly Caſt them off, and not afford them the leaſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors. They were promis'd its true, that if they would but put themſelves wholly upon the <hi>French,</hi> and leave them to make their Peace, they ſhould have ſuch Conditions got for them, as were both advantagious and honourable; but then if <hi>France</hi> ſhould think her ſelf oblig'd to have greater regard to her own Intereſt and Conveniency, then to all other Engagements, (and that ſuch a thing was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſome former Tranſactions had ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.) In that caſe, why might the little King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Sardinia</hi> be once more thought to be a pretty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54374:151"/>
convenient Retreat for a King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> or the Office of Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille</hi> an honourable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for a Duke of <hi>Bragança?</hi> But in caſe <hi>France</hi> ſhould think it convenient, to continue her ſelf, or keep <hi>Portugal</hi> embroil'd in the War; then all that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could give, or the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ask, might not be thought to be either honourable or ſafe, it was not thought ſo upon Tryal as ſhall be made appear anon.</p>
               <p>But however, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had now their Hands tied up, and could do nothing towards their own Relief. To the <hi>French</hi> they had given themſelves, and for any thing they ſaw, to the <hi>French</hi> they muſt Truſt. The Prince was conſulting about the choice of a Miniſter, whom he ſhould ſend as his Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary to <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> when on a ſudden they receiv'd an unexpected Deliverance from theſe their pretended Friends, brought them by the ſame Hand that had reſcued them, from their Victorious, though perhaps leſs Dangerous Enemies; but this likewiſe muſt be ſpoken of in another Chapter.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the moſt memorable Tranſactions that have paſſed between the two Crowns ſince that of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath been in the Houſe of <hi>Bragança,</hi> and they afford us one Single inſtance of the ſo much talkt of <hi>French</hi> Friendſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſending of their Troops into that Kingdom upon concluſion of the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Treaty; an action which the <hi>French</hi> or all People in the World ſhould be the laſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; they were aſhamed as they had a great deal of reaſon, to own it at the Time, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that attended their Auxiliaries, hath given them little cauſe to glory in it ſince; but this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if it was meant for ſuch, has been more than out balanc'd by the hard uſage which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes</hi> have met with at their hands, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54374:151"/>
never were People ſo trick'd, abus'd and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled withal, as the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were during the whole courſe of <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Miniſtry; never were Allies ſo diſhonourably ſacrific'd, as they were to an enrag'd Enemy at the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Treaty, for I think I have made it plain, that they were then deſign'd to be utterly abandon'd; and as for this laſt Buſineſs of the League and Treaty of Peace, the <hi>French</hi> could have no other regard to <hi>Portugal,</hi> than to make that Kingdom to its own great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice ſubſervient to all their deſigns.</p>
               <p>So that it muſt have been by other means than Offices of true Friendſhip, that the <hi>French</hi> have all along ſupported their Intereſt in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are of Opinion, that their Money hath had as free a courſe into this Kingdom, as into any other part of <hi>Europe.</hi> But other Inſtruments are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made uſe of, and thoſe of two very different kinds from each other; but conſidering the Genius of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation, it is very hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which of them are the moſt likely to ſucceed. Theſe are <hi>1ſt.</hi> the Ladies that are continually ſent hither to marry with Perſons of Quality, who when they match out of their own Families, do uſually ſupply themſelves with Wives from <hi>France;</hi> and to ſay the truth, they have been furniſh'd out of ſome of the beſt Houſes in that Kingdom, and 'tis reported, that the <hi>French</hi> King, to encourage theſe Alliances between the two Courts, allows every Lady a Portion, which perhaps contributes not a little to render them acceptable to the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Nobility, who for the moſt part are not very eaſy in their Fortunes, and when they marry among themſelves, have ſeldom any Money with their Wives, for in <hi>Portugal</hi> Blood ſerves inſtead of a Portion. It is hard to give a particular account,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54374:152"/>
what ſervices theſe Ladies do for the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> but the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Writer that ſets forth his King's Pretenſions to <hi>Spain,</hi> gives a broad hint of what may be expected from them; for he ſays, that of the ſeveral methods uſed by the <hi>French,</hi> to gain their ends upon thoſe they have to deal with, that of ſending <hi>French</hi> Wives to govern them is the moſt infallible, and that they have found this a ſurer way to ſucceed, than all inveigling Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or ſpecious appearances of Advantage, and that it excels the force even of ſecret Bribes; for as he ſaith, they in Conſequence of their having married <hi>French</hi> Women, ſhall be ſo bewitched, that ſeeing and knowing they ſhall ſeek their own Ruin, as if led thereto by a fatal kind of Neceſſity. It is true, this <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſpeaks in the Perſon of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Noble Man, and lays the Scene in that Court, where I believe there are as yet but very few if any ſuch Marriages, ſo that there is cauſe to ſuſpect, that he ſpeaks ſo feelingly from the Experience of his own Country. However by his leave, one that looks upon things at ſome diſtance, may be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to queſtion whether the force of theſe <hi>Syren</hi>'s Charms be altogether ſo irreſiſtible as he makes it; for <hi>Portugal</hi> it ſelf where they are more numerous than in any other Country, ſtands yet undeſtroyed ſince their firſt coming in, which is now more than thrice ten Years; and indeed ſhould we ſuppoſe the Sex to have never ſo ardent a Zeal for the Grandeur of their Monarch, one would think it ſhould be not a little cool'd in ſuch as are thus ſacrific'd to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and ſent in perpetual Baniſhment to ſo hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Country as <hi>Portugal</hi> muſt needs appear to them that have been accuſtomed to the Gallantrys of a <hi>French</hi> Court. But granting that the great Monarch by procuring Husbands for theſe Ladies,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54374:152"/>
doth moſt ſtrongly engage them to his Service, he by the ſame means diſobliges a great many others, and renders them highly diſaffected to His Majeſty, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ladies of the Country, who as 'tis ſaid, do not ſpare to make moſt bitter Complaints of the wrong done them, by this intruſion of Foreigners; and Jealouſie, together with thoſe other Paſſions that uſually accompany it, have no doubt as great an Influence upon them, as Loyalty and Gratitude have upon the others: And the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Women, if they do not belie their Character, are as ſubtle and intriguing, as the <hi>French</hi> can be: Should they in revenge once take to Politicks, why may they not Cabal together, and form their Faction too? Did they once ſet about it, there is no doubt but they have power enough left, to make a Party of their own amongſt the <hi>Fidalgo's</hi> that ſhall be able to make head againſt that of their Rivals.</p>
               <p>Together with the Ladies the Jeſuits are reckon'd moſt zealous Promoters of the <hi>French</hi> Cauſe; theſe Fathers as the World knows very well, have been always Men of Intrigue, ſince their very firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and the greateſt Monarchs have thought fit to make uſe of them, in carrying on their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins. In the laſt Age, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had them wholly at their Devotion, and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> was much obliged to the Society on many accounts, and more particularly for their clearing his way to the Throne of <hi>Portugal;</hi> had it not been for them, it is thought that K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal had according to Juſtice and his own Inclinations, ſettled the Crown in the Houſe of <hi>Bragança,</hi> but King <hi>Philip</hi> was then more in Favour with the Society, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Crown reſerved for him. But as the whole Order hath ſometimes ſince chang'd Sides, and come over to the <hi>French,</hi> theſe in <hi>Portugal</hi> have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54374:153"/>
not been behind the reſt, and are now ſuppoſed to ſerve that Party in this Court, with as much Zeal as any of their Order do elſewhere; ſome may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be apt to accuſe the Society of Inconſtancy on this occaſion, but if any do ſo, it is certainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon, for theſe Fathers are ſtill what they were from the very Beginning. The Fortunes of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are alter'd, but not the Jeſuits, they continue firm to their Principles; it was for the Intereſts of the Society in the laſt Age, as it is in this, to gain the Favour of ſuch as had the greateſt Power, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had it then, and the <hi>French</hi> have it now; and therefore <hi>Louis</hi> the <hi>14th.</hi> is to them what <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> was. Since the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy hath been falling to Ruin, it was time for them to make their Court elſewhere, for it is not to be thought that they have leſs Sagacity than thoſe Animals who are ready to quit a decay'd Building when its fall is at hand.</p>
               <p>But that which is moſt to be admired in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of theſe Fathers is, that notwithſtanding their being look'd upon as little better than Spys to thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring Princes that have bid faireſt for the Univerſal Monarchy, they have yet manag'd their Affairs with that Dexterity, as to maintain their Ground as long as they thought convenient in all other Courts, even thoſe not excepted that were like to ſuffer firſt, when ever the Deſign ſhould take effect; ſeveral inſtances might be given of this admirable Addreſs of theirs in keeping in with all Parties, both in the laſt and the preſent Age, were I not to confine my ſelf to <hi>Portugal.</hi> In this Court, they have enjoyed an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Reign from the time of <hi>Simon Rodriguez,</hi> one of the firſt Companions of <hi>Loyola,</hi> and the firſt Jeſuit that enter'd <hi>Portugal.</hi> He getting into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with <hi>John</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> laid the Foundations of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54374:153"/>
their greatneſs in this Kingdom; in <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>'s time the Jeſuits govern'd all, and the Blame is laid at their doors I know not how juſtly, of the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Deſtruction wherein that ill advis'd Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd both himſelf and his Kingdom; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal was wholly at their Devotion. When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> got poſſeſſion of this Crown, none were more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their Cauſe than the Jeſuits: Yet when For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune began to frown upon them, and the preſent King's Father regain'd his Right, the Jeſuits were ready immediately to aſſert his Title, and that not only to this Crown, but to all the World beſides (by way of Prophecy I mean, for in Effect they are doing what they can to procure their ſo much talk'd of Fifth Monarchy for another Prince) and in all the Revolutions and Turns of State that have happened ſince, it was ſure to be their Side, which ſoever it was, that chanc'd to come uppermoſt.</p>
               <p>In the preſent Court, their Power is certainly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, they having all along had the Direction of the Kings and both the Queens Conſciences, ſo that conſidering how religiouſly diſpoſed his <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Majeſty is, and his misfortune in having been ſo Educated, that his improvements in Knowledge have not kept pace with his other great Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, their Advice muſt neceſſarily go a great way with him, I find in a Memoire written by one, who ſeems well acquainted with the Secrets of this Court, that the Jeſuits have a great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not only over His Majeſty, but over the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters likewiſe, who are ſaid to be obliged to theſe Fathers for the great ſhare they have in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that one who hath the Addreſs to get into Favour with their Reverences, which is done by enlarging on the Praiſes of the Society,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54374:154"/>
may makc a very good uſe of them in any Buſineſs depending at Court, provided that it doth not claſh with the Intereſt of <hi>France;</hi> for it ſeems they have always an eye to that which is now the grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the Society. My Author gives one ſignal Inſtance of their Zeal and Affection to the <hi>French</hi> Party, which ſhows them to be capable of any thing in order to promote that, even to the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all other Intereſts, it being of a Deſign, which had it taken effect, muſt have outed the preſent Miniſters from Court, or at leaſt abated much of their Power; for it was to bring the <hi>Conde de Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melhor</hi> into Buſineſs again, and that becauſe they know him, ſaith my Author, to be well affected to <hi>France.</hi> I cannot tell upon what grounds the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> is thought to be ſo inclin'd, he was indeed a kind of a Martyr for the <hi>French</hi> Cauſe; for the League before mention'd is thought to have been in part the occaſion of his Fall. But his being obliged after all that he had ſuffer'd for them to take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in <hi>England,</hi> where he was honourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd, and had a noble Penſion aſſign'd him, ſhould as one would think have inclin'd him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; its true, his eldeſt Son the <hi>Conde de Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beta</hi> hath married a <hi>French</hi> Lady, but that was ſince the Deſign I am ſpeaking of was ſet on foot. But however this be, the Jeſuits no doubt hop'd for ſome extraordinary advantage from his re-admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Court, ſince they durſt venture to offend the <hi>Conde</hi>'s great Rival the Duke of <hi>Cavadal,</hi> from whom they were to look for a moſt Powerful Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But as the Attempt was great, the way they took to effect it, was ſomewhat ſurprizing, for the Queen by the advice of Father <hi>Fueſs</hi> her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, was to uſe her endeavours with the King to bring it about. It is no wonder that Father <hi>Fueſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:54374:154"/>
being a Jeſuit, though a <hi>German,</hi> ſhould deſire the advancement of one engag'd in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt; yet it is ſomewhat ſtrange, that a Daughter of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Family ſhould ſo far forget her Father's Houſe, as to concern her ſelf in ſuch a Cauſe. But they that are acquainted with the Intrigues of the Society, will not wonder to ſee thoſe carrying on their deſigns, who in appearance ſhould have the greateſt reaſon to oppoſe them. My Author who ſeems to be a very intelligent Perſon, and who as I had it from a good hand, was both a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman and a Servant to her Majeſty, ſaith, that the Buſineſs was brought ſo far to a head, that the Queen waited only for the time, when her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor ſhould think it proper for her to break it to the King. How it came to miſcarry I know not, but it ſeems to be now wholly laid aſide, for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> has not yet appear'd at Court, and it was about 1691. that this Buſineſs was in Agitation, ſince which time the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> hath by the Marriage of his Son, to the King's natural Daughter, eſtabliſh'd himſelf at Court more firmly than ever.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> then having ſuch Powerful Agents at the Court of <hi>Portugal</hi> as are the Ladies and the Jeſuits, tho' their Intereſt there be very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet it is ſome wonder that it is not much greater, as without doubt it would be, were there not ſo wiſe a Prince on the Throne, as his preſent Majeſty. It cannot be denied, but that the <hi>French</hi> Artifices in repreſenting the late War, as rais'd and carried on upon a religious account, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd much, and that not only among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, but with them likewiſe that are in a much higher Station, and have had in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their deſign'd effect, in byaſſing Peoples minds to the prejudice of the Allies. It is reported of a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54374:155"/>
certain very great Lady, that when the News came to <hi>Lisbon</hi> of a great Diſaſter likely to befal ſome of the Allies upon the Coaſts of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſhe could not forbear expreſſing her ſatisfaction in a moſt unuſual manner, That <hi>the Hereticks were confounded.</hi> But there are not wanting among them ſome ſo much wiſer than the reſt, as to ſee through the <hi>French</hi> Artifices, and perceive that all this trouble that they give World, hath ſome other end in it, than the advancement of their Religion, and there are thoſe that will not ſtick to give our King his juſt Titles, of <hi>Europes Deliverer,</hi> and the <hi>Reſtorer of Liberty to Mankind.</hi> As for the King himſelf, he is certainly not inſenſible of his own true Intereſt, I have good grounds to believe that the Levies he was making in 1693. were deſign'd to help forward the common Cauſe, and had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally march'd towards <hi>Catalonia,</hi> had he not been aſſur'd from his Miniſters abroad, that the <hi>French</hi> were earneſtly ſoliciting for a Peace, and that the Fortune of the War had not turned ſo much to the diſadvantage of the Allies, as to make them want his Aſſiſtance. And few I believe doubt, but that the Forces now on foot have been rais'd, upon a like deſign, ſhould there be occaſion for them; this Court being by this convinc'd what little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is to be made of <hi>French</hi> Proteſtations of Friendſhip, and where they are like to end, of theſe they have had as great or a greater ſhare than any other People, and they find themſelves now to be firſt mark'd out for Deſtruction, for while they are careſs'd by the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters at <hi>Verſailles</hi> and <hi>Lisbon,</hi> thoſe of the ſame Nation are again making a Sacrifice of them at <hi>Madrid,</hi> at leaſt if the Author of the Paper concerning the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54374:155"/>
to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuppoſed to have been written by order of this Court be rightly inform'd; for there we find among other Conditions offer'd to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in behalf of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the Re-union of <hi>Portugal</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> propoſed for one; ſo that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> find it high time for them to look to themſelves, and in all appearance, they will leave nothing unattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bring about that Re-union, though in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner than is propos'd by <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>TIll of late Years there hath been little or no intercourſe between <hi>Portugal</hi> and the Court of <hi>Vienna;</hi> the reaſon of this ſtrangeneſs was the cruel Treatment of <hi>Dom Duarte,</hi> Prince of <hi>Bragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and Uncle to the preſent King: This Prince at the Acclamation of his Brother King <hi>John</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> had been eight Years in the Emperor's Service, and was in the Poſt of a Major General, under <hi>Piccolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni,</hi> and as it is ſaid, he had ſignaliz'd himſelf with great Courage, in the War againſt the <hi>Swedes;</hi> but he having no notice given him of his Brother's deſign, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters at <hi>Vienna</hi> aſſoon as the news of the Revolt came thither, procured a ſecret Order from the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54374:156"/>
to have him arreſted by way of Reprizal, for what his Brother had taken from them, and to pleaſe them, this innocent Prince was by a manifeſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Liberties of the Empire, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>German</hi> Nation, kept Priſoner for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time at <hi>Grats,</hi> and afterwards ſold to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for the ſumm of Forty Thouſand Crowns, and was by them carried away to the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> where he was ſhut up for the remainder of his life, he ending his days there after eight years of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. This diſhonourable Act of the Emperor begat ſuch a coldneſs between the two Courts of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Lisbon,</hi> that there had been no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between them till of late Years; the firſt advance towards a Correſpondence by all that I can learn, was not made till the Year 1683. when at the Pope's inſtance, King <hi>Peter</hi> contributed a large ſupply of Money towards the Expences of the War againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> But his Marriage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with one ſo nearly Related to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as her late Majeſty was, laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a ſolid Friendſhip, and it was generally expected, that this Match would have brought the King wholly over to the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Intereſt; it was thought that there was ſomething of a Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on foot, to engage him on that ſide in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the laſt War, <hi>viz.</hi> in 1689. when the Count <hi>de Mansfield</hi> employed in the Buſineſs of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s ſecond Marriage, took <hi>Lisbon</hi> in his way from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Nieubourg,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador ſeem'd to have ſmelt out ſome ſuch thing, and thereupon by way of Revenge, found means to mortify both the King and the Count. For the King having ordered one of his Ships to be got ready for the Count to Embark upon, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador took occaſion to acquaint His Majeſty,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54374:157"/>
that the Count <hi>de Mansfield,</hi> being a Miniſter of the Emperor, and one of his Generals, there was cauſe to fear that the Ship which carried him would be attack'd by <hi>French</hi> Men of War, which might occaſion ſome diſtaſt between his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and his <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Majeſty; the King was fain to hearken to the Admonition, and digeſt the Menace rather than expoſe himſelf to a greater Inſult, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving I ſuppoſe, that the Ambaſſador ſaw plain enough that he was not in a condition to reſent it. wherefore the Count was left to provide a Ship for himſelf, however the King order'd two of his Frigats to convoy him to the mouth of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
               <p>As the War was drawing towards a concluſion, the King ſent a moſt ſplendid Embaſſy to <hi>Vienna,</hi> at the ſame time when he ſent another to the <hi>French</hi> Court, as it was thought to interpoſe his good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices towards the drawing on of the Peace. Nor did the diſgrace which befel the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to his Imperial Majeſty, break off the Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence between the two Courts, the Emperor ſeeming now reſolved to have his Miniſters conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſident at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> having never before had any ſuch ſince the Houſe of <hi>Bragança</hi> was poſſeſs'd of the Crown; it is much for the Intereſt of both Parties to have a good underſtanding together, whilſt the cauſe of the Succeſſion of <hi>Spain</hi> is depending, for though in regard to that affair, they have different ends in view, yet they are both alike concern'd to act in concert, till the greateſt and moſt difficult point be gain'd which is the Excluſion of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the <hi>Dutch</hi> this Court hath had a fair and amicable Correſpondence ever ſince the Year 1669. when all differences were made up that had broken <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54374:157"/>
which I ſhall ſay nothing here, ſince it would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige me to give an account of the preceding War, which would take up more room then can be now ſpared.</p>
               <p>There ſeems to be little or no Communication between this and the two <hi>Northern</hi> Crowns; the great diſtance between them being the cauſe that they have ſeldom any thing to do with one another, all the Buſineſs the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> have here, being about the Trade for Salt, which they load yearly at <hi>Setubal,</hi> but this is eaſily managed by the Conſuls.</p>
               <p>The deſerved Eſteem this King had for the great <hi>Sobieski,</hi> and the Marriage of Prince <hi>James</hi> his Son with the Queen's Siſter, afforded matter for ſome Reciprocal Compliments between them; but there was a difficulty in the Ceremonial which would not permit them to have this little Intercourſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> in his Letter, named himſelf firſt, which this Court could not bear, and therefore refuſed to receive the Letter, becauſe that King is only the Head of a Republick, whereas his Majeſty of <hi>Portugal</hi> is an Abſolute Sovereign. The preſent King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Envoy, when he came to <hi>Lisbon</hi> to notify his Maſter's advancement to that Crown, could not be received nor admitted to Audience for the ſame Reaſon, and not as ſome thought, for that this King refus'd to acknowledge his Maſter or diſapprov'd of his Election.</p>
               <p>The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> can have very little to do here, and therefore little notice is taken of them; the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> himſelf having no Miniſter reſiding at Court. The Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> indeed hath his Reſident, but that is more for the Honour and Security of the Perſon, than on account of any Buſineſs, he being a conſiderable
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54374:158"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> Merchant of the Religion.

               <p>I Believe there are no People in the World that have valued themſelves leſs upon their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> or deſerved more at their Hands then the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I ſhould have placed them firſt, had I rank'd the reſt according as they merit in the Eſteem of this Nation; for they well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be reckon'd, and that in the chief place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Founders, the Protectors, and the Reſtorers of the Kingdom. They have certainly been the ſureſt and moſt diſ-intereſs'd Friends to it, almoſt from the time when <hi>Portugal</hi> firſt became a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the Eſtabliſhment of the now Reigning Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily upon the Throne. And in truth, the ancient <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have ſhown ſo much Gratitude, that there remain in this Country ſeveral Memorials
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54374:159"/>
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generoſity and Valour, that have been forgotten by our ſelves, and are over look'd by our own Writers; but of late we have not had the like reaſon to commend their Juſtice, though our Nation in the preſent Age, as great as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Anceſtors were, hath deſerv'd no leſs at their Hands. Their Ancient Writers ſet forth at large, how great a ſhare the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in the firſt raiſing of their Kingdom, and how they have ſince more then once reſcued it from Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and there are thoſe yet alive among them, that know very well how their Deliverance from utter Ruin, and that Liberty and Peace which they now enjoy, is owing to the Bravery of our Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Prudence of our Miniſters; but their late Writers have not been ſo Ingenuous as to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what they knew to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>It will not be expected that in ſo ſhort a ſpace as is left me, I ſhould give a particular Account of theſe Tranſactions; however, I ſhall briefly touch upon ſome of thoſe that have paſs'd in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, as they are related by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Hiſtorians, hoping that it will not be altogether ungrateful to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader, to hear News from Foreigners, as old as it is concerning his own Country Men: And ſome mention muſt be made of what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have done of late Years for <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that both in Juſtice to thoſe, who by their Wiſdom or their Courage, have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted its preſent Eſtabliſhment; and to excite ſuch as are more able, or may have better Opportunities to do it, to retrieve the Memory of many ſignal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons perform'd here by our Country Men, which as great and important as they were; they that enjoy the Benefit of them, ſeem now reſolv'd to Bury in ſilence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54374:159"/>
It is agreed by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Writers, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern as well as the Ancient, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had a great hand in the Conqueſt of <hi>Lisbon</hi> from the <hi>Mores,</hi> whereby <hi>Portugal</hi> came to deſerve the name of a Kingdom. They ſay indeed, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo Henriquez</hi> chang'd his Title of <hi>Count</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> for that of King, immediately after the Viſion of <hi>Ourique</hi> before mention'd, but poſſibly the ſtory of that Viſion may not be true; and this is certain, that the three Eſtates of the Kingdom in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance to <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> affirm from their Chronicles, that this Prince would not accept of the Crown, till it was made Tributary to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was not done till many Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> viz. not before 1179. when Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> by his Bull ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, conferr'd upon him the Title and Dignity of King. In their Account of the Conqueſt of this City, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Authors tell us, that in the Year 1147. a great Fleet from <hi>England,</hi> compos'd of ſeveral Nations, and bound for the Holy Land, under the Command of <hi>William Longſpè,</hi> paſſing by the Rock of <hi>Sintra. Alfonſo Henriquez</hi> ſo dealt with the Leaders, that they agreed to ſtand in to the <hi>Tagus,</hi> and joyn with him in laying Siege to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> on condition that one half of the City when gain'd, ſhould be given up to them: Accordingly the City was taken after a Siege of five Months, and the ſlaughter of 200000 <hi>Mores. Alfonſo</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to make good the Agreement, and put them in Poſſeſſion of their part of the City, and to make an equal Diviſion with them of all that was taken, both within and without it, which they generouſly refus'd to accept of; ſince as they ſaid, they had not left their Country to get Riches, but were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a more glorious Deſign, and withall they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54374:160"/>
did not think it becoming them to enjoy a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty within another Prince's Dominions; and ſo having accepted of a ſmall ſhare of the Spoils, they proceeded on in their Voyage. I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for the ſeveral Circumſtances of this Story, for I believe ſome of them are not true; I believe there will be no Account found among thoſe that have written of the Holy War of any ſuch Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition made this Year, and the famous Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> if he be the Perſon meant by <hi>Guilbelme de longa Eſpada</hi> was not yet Born; and for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we cannot allow the Account of the ſlain, one is, becauſe <hi>Lisbon</hi> was then ſcarce big enough to hold ſo many. The preſent Inhabitants cannot be ſuppos'd to exceed much that Number, but the Walls that are now ſtanding, and were not built till 1375. though they contain but a part of the City, are of a much larger compaſs then thoſe that ſtood at the time of the Siege. The Strangers had then their Camp upon the Hill, where the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of St. <hi>Franceſco,</hi> and the Church of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> ſtand, which are now in the very heart of the City, and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Camp on the other ſide was, where the Church of <hi>San Vincente</hi> is now, which is within the preſent Walls, though it hath ſtill the Name of <hi>San Vincente de Fora,</hi> becauſe it was formerly without the City. In effect, the ancient City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> was not of a much larger compaſs then that of the Hill on which the Caſtle of St. <hi>George</hi> now ſtands, ſo that they that know any thing of the Place, will never think that 200000 People could be killed at the taking of it, ſuppoſing every Soul to have been put to the Sword. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that <hi>Lisbon</hi> was taken this Year, and that by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and other Strangers, is agreed upon by the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> as well as the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:54374:160"/>
Hiſtorians; I ſuppoſe they were Soldiers of Fortune, as <hi>Mariana</hi> ſeems to intimate, whom <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo Henriquez</hi> had invited thither with hopes of Booty and a ſhare of the Conquſts. And it is not likely that they refuſed the Reward promis'd them whatever it was, on account of their being engag'd in the Holy War, for there remain'd ſo many of them in the Country, that the want of them would doubtleſs have broke that Voyage; for thoſe that ſtayed had the Towns of <hi>Almada, Povos, Villa Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Villa Verde, Azambuja, Arruda Lourinham,</hi> and ſeveral other Places aſſign'd them, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Hiſtorians were all Peopled by theſe ſtrangers. <hi>Almada</hi> which is a ſmall Town with a Caſtle on a Hill, formerly very ſtrong, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on the other ſide of the River over againſt <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> took its Name as theſe Authors will have it, from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Expreſſion which they write <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad-el qu. We made</hi> [Ye] <hi>all:</hi> But if the word muſt needs be of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Original, one ſhould rather think it came from a more modeſt Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> we are <hi>All made.</hi> They tell likewiſe, that the Lords of the Place who took their Name from thence, pretended always to be of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that for this reaſon, thoſe of the Family have on ſeveral Occaſions receiv'd great Honours in that Kingdom. <hi>Povos</hi> which is a Town Situated upon the River about four Leagues above <hi>Lisbon,</hi> was as they ſay, anciently called <hi>Cornovalha,</hi> from its being Peopled by <hi>Corniſh</hi> Men, and afterwards corruptly <hi>Cornaga,</hi> by which laſt name, I find the Place called above 200 Years afterwards, poſſibly the reaſon of its being left off, may be the great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have for the firſt Syllable of it, which a well bred Man amongſt them will never pronounce upon any account. The
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54374:161"/>
Name it hath now is the common Word for Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages. In fine, it ſeems to be almoſt as uſual in <hi>Portugal,</hi> for ſuch as would become of better Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies then ordinary, to derive their Pedigree from theſe Strangers that were at the taking of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as it is with us to have our Anceſtors come in with <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror. Such of them as continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> had very great Priviledges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities allowed them, as well they might, if one half of the City was their own by Compact, and the beſt part of the Kingdom, as the <hi>Termo</hi> of <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> certainly is, was owning to their Valour. The Licentiate <hi>Duarte Nunes de Liam,</hi> who was a Judge, and conſequently muſt be ſuppos'd to underſtand the Conſtitutions of his Country, Reports that theſe Privileges were continued, not only to the Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, from the firſt Conquerors, but to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Merchandizes of ſuch of their Country Men, as ſhould reſort thither; and he ſaith like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that the ſucceeding Kings confirm'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd them to his time, he wrote in the Year 1600. I have ſeen a large Collection of Priviledges gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſeveral Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> beyond thoſe enjoy'd by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Subjects, I know not whether I may call them <hi>Charters.</hi> Theſe were copied from the Archives of the Kingdom, in the <hi>Torre de Tumbo,</hi> but the moſt ancient was of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whoſe Reign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not till 1367. There are ſeveral of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> his Succeſſor, ſome of which refer to others granted by his Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>By this it appears that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had a great hand in ſetting up the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and if the Hiſtorians of this Country deceive us not, they had as great a ſhare in Protecting and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, as often as it hath been brought into Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54374:161"/>
by a Foreign Enemy. Twice it was like to be wholly over-run by the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> who had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves of the greateſt part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and gain'd a numerous Party of the Nobility over to their ſide, and had been very near taking <hi>Lisbon</hi> it ſelf; the firſt time in the Reign of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> the laſt of the lawful Deſcendants from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo Henriquez,</hi> the other time while <hi>John</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> from whom all that have ſucceeded him derived their Titles, was ſtrugling for the Crown; and they have been as often reliev'd by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to carry the War into the Enemies Country, our Princes of the Blood condeſcending to go in Perſon to their Aſſiſtance; firſt <hi>Edmund de Langley</hi> then Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and afterwards <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> And if after the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral flouriſhing Reigns that ſucceeded, they were at laſt reduc'd under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke, it was becauſe they were wanting to themſelves, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent out a Gallant Fleet, and Army to their Reſcue, under <hi>Dom Antonio,</hi> whom they had made their King, but they would not accept Deliverance, and ſo they remain'd under the Power of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>In the laſt War after the <hi>French</hi> had given them up, or aſſiſted them in ſuch a manner as they ſhould not own without Confuſion, when all <hi>Europe</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their Ruin as inevitable, ſome of the moſt conſiderable Perſons in the Kingdom, being ſo far of the ſame Opinion, that they thought it now high time for them to ſave themſelves, and make their Peace with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Aveiro</hi> and their Ambaſſador in <hi>Holland</hi> who went over to them; Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> making himſelf merry with our <hi>Locker</hi> at the Folly of all the reſt, for not doing the ſame, and for thinking it poſſible for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54374:162"/>
them to hold out longer; <hi>Don Luis de Haro,</hi> who was not accounted Sanguin, making nothing of the little Expedition that his Maſter was about againſt the Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> for after this rate he is reported to have talk'd to King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> at the <hi>Pirences:</hi> Thoſe ſmall Forces ſent by King <hi>Charles</hi> after his Reſtoration, by their unparallel'd Valour, ſoon put an end to the Quarrel, and the Victories obtain'd by their Means, being ſeconded as they were by the Vigilence Dexterity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the ſame King's Miniſters, recover'd <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> and reſtor'd it to the condition in which it now remains.</p>
               <p>Theſe Forces conſiſted of about 3000 Men, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into three Regiments, two of Foot which made near 2400, and one of Horſe of about 800. They were at firſt Commanded by the Earl of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiquin,</hi> but his Lordſhip returning to <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they took the Field, they were by Commiſſion from the King of <hi>England,</hi> put under the Conduct of Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who had himſelf the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Command of one of the foot Regiments. They arriv'd in <hi>Portugal</hi> ſoon after <hi>Don John</hi> had made an end of that ſucceſsful Campagne, before mention'd in 1662. and were diſpos'd of into Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters till the following Spring, when they joyn'd the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army in order to relieve <hi>Evora,</hi> but in their March towards that City, they were met with the News of its being ſurrender'd without Reſiſtance in a manner, and upon very Diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Terms, though it had in it a Garriſon of 7000 Foot and 700 Horſe, and was provided with all things neceſſary for a ſtout Defenſe, till ſuch time as the Army ſhould come up and attempt to raiſe the Siege. The News of this loſs ſo ſtruck the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Army, that 'tis no wonder it ſhould
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54374:162"/>
put the People into that conſternation before deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Conde de Villa Flor</hi> the Gen. was ſo diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his concern appear'd to the very Soldiers in his Looks, which our Men who had been uſed to ſee their Commanders ſo Dejected obſerv'd with Indignation. A Council of War being called, it appear'd that the Army was in no condition to fight the Enemy, and it was reſolv'd not to attempt it as bad as their Caſe was. Something might have been done had <hi>Evora</hi> held out, they relying upon the Garriſons, fallying at the ſame time, when they ſhould attack the Beſiegers: But the Garriſon was now made Priſoners of War, ſo it was reſolv'd that they ſhould encamp themſelves at a Place call'd <hi>Landroal,</hi> which lay ſo between the Enemies Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Places, that they might cut off any convoys of Proviſions coming from thence. <hi>Don John</hi> in the mean while having poſſeſs'd himſelf of ſo Great and Populous a City in the very heart of <hi>Alemtejo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came thereby Maſter in a manner of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and was providing for his Army at his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Coſt, by putting all the Country under Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which end and to gave the greater Alarm to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> whereby to increaſe the Tumult there, he ſent that large Detachment before mention'd, as far as <hi>Alcacere do Sal.</hi> The Court at this time appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending no leſs Danger from the Multitude then the Enemy, and ſeeing the Affairs of <hi>Portugal</hi> to be in all reſpects deſperate, was continually ſending Orders to the Commanders to fight at any rate; the Army at laſt being reinforc'd with what Troops other parts of the Kingdom could ſend, or the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons ſpare, march'd towards the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> hoping to find them divided, but not being able to hinder their Detachments from joyning the main Body, they were for retiring again. <hi>Don John</hi> follow'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54374:163"/>
at their Heels to give them Battle, but they had paſs'd a ſmall River, call'd <hi>Degebe,</hi> before he came up with them, and they had poſted themſelves ſo advantageouſly, that there were but two Paſſes through which he could come to Attack them. That where the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> thought the greateſt Danger was, it being in its ſelf the eaſieſt to be forc'd, was defended by one of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Don John</hi> made his greateſt Efforts to gain it, and there enſued a very hot Diſpute, for at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times he ſent in freſh Troops to renew the Charge, which were as often repulſed with loſs, ſo that he was oblig'd at laſt to deſiſt from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, <hi>Don John</hi> found now that he had other Enemies to deal with then thoſe he had hitherto been uſed to. Being fruſtrated of his Deſign, he put a Garriſon into <hi>Evora,</hi> and began to march towards the Frontiers, where he expected to be re-inforced with freſh Supplies, in order to return and both ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and enlarge his Conqueſts. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> began now to take Courage, and perceiving <hi>Don John</hi>'s deſign, being preſs'd withal by repeated Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Court to Fight, directed their March the ſame way in order to wheel about and get before him, which they might eaſily do, having ſecur'd their heavy Baggage at <hi>Eſtremos,</hi> whereas the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Army was much incumber'd with Carriages. However, the March of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army was ſo haſty, that as the <hi>Conde da Ericeyra</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bore both, that and the heat of the Sun with Impatience. Its true, the Toil which our Country Men under went at that time was very great, but leaſt any ſhould gather from that Expreſſion, that they ſhow'd any great Backwardneſs in the ſervice, I ſhall tell the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which his Lordſhip is pleas'd to omit.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54374:163"/>
The two Armies were at a ſmall diſtance over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other, both making what haſt they could to paſs a River <hi>(Tera)</hi> before the Night that preceded the Battle of <hi>Amexial.</hi> The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> being in the Rear of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army, I ſuppoſe, becauſe that was to become the Front when they got before the Enemy; as Evening drew on, the Alarm was taken in the Front, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was at hand, but then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were at a great diſtance from that part where the Action was like to be, and without them it ſeems nothing was to be done; Orders were thereupon given for them to Advance with all ſpeed, which they did as faſt as 'twas poſſible for them to run throughout the whole length of the Army. Their eagerneſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with the Enemy, and their Pride no doubt to ſee ſo many thouſands of Armed Men look upon them as their Guardians, ſpurring them on beyond their ſtrength, inſomuch that ſeveral of them thro' Heat and want of Breath, fell by the Way and ſome were loſt; but by that time they came up, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm ceas'd, and there was nothing for them to do, as 'twas well there was not, for as ſome of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers have aſſur'd me, the Men were ſo Faint, and Weary, as to become altogether unfit for Action; ſuch was the occaſion of the Impatience taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the Noble Author in his Account of this days March.</p>
               <p>The next day the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by reaſon of their ſlow March occaſion'd by their heavy Luggage, put it in the Power of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to oblige them to Fight. As the Armies came in ſight of each other, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe with a Party of <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were commanded to diſlodge ſeveral Battallions of the Enemy, that had poſſeſſed themſelves of a riſing Ground, which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> thought neceſſary
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54374:164"/>
for them, in caſe they ſhould come to a Battle. They did not only do as they were Ordered, by driving thoſe Batallions from the Hill, but they followed them into the Plain on the other ſide, and found themſelves inſenſibly ingag'd in a hot Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh with the whole Body of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalry, that was conducting the Carriages towards another Hill a League off, where their Foot had already poſted themſelves; but they were ſo ſurpriſed and diſorder'd by this ſudden Attack, that had our Men been ſeconded as 'twas expected they ſhould be from the Army, 'twas thought they might have put them intirely to the Rout. Count <hi>Schomberg</hi> ſaw what Advantage was to be made of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion he perceived them in, and was marching towards them in all haſt with ſuch of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry as were near at hand; but giving notice of what he was doing to the <hi>Conde de Villa Flor,</hi> He in all haſt ſent poſitive Orders to command him back, poſſibly for no other Reaſon but to keep up the Cuſtom of Thwarting the Count, who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been oppoſed in almoſt every Motion he made. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Commanders ſeeming reſolv'd to ſpare the Enemy, or give him any Advantage over them, rather then ſuffer the Count to know more of their Trade then themſelves, which without Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was one Reaſon of their former Loſſes, as the Deference they paid him afterwards was of the Succeſs that follow'd. The Count obey'd the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's Orders, though with ſome Reluctancy, but it was not long before he took the liberty to act more of his own Head, and thereby ſaved <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> poſſeſſed themſelves of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Ground, from whence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had been beaten; they on the other ſide retir'd to two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Hills, drawing up the Horſe in a large Plain,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54374:164"/>
at the bottom of that on the right Hand, and their Foot on the tops of both, planting a Battery of four Guns on each. Till three a Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, they ſpent the time on both ſides in Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nading each other, and ſome light Skirmiſhes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any conſiderable Dammage on either ſide; but by this time it was obſerv'd, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> fired more ſlowly then before, and played but four Guns of Eight that they began with, which made the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſuſpect them to be deſigning (as they were) to draw off and continue their March; hereupon it was debated in a Council of War, what was to be done in the Caſe: They had poſitive Orders from the King and the <hi>Conde de Caſtlemelhor,</hi> to Fight upon the firſt occaſion, which they had great cauſe to diſpair of ever being able to do, ſhould Don <hi>John</hi> give them the ſlip at this time, and be re-inforc'd with the Troops that were ready for him on the Frontiers. On the other ſide, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſo placed themſelves, that there was no Fighting with them, but at great Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; their Horſe which were double in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> being ſix thouſand to three, had a large Plain before them, and in regard to the Foot, their Advantage was much greater, yet not on account of their Number indeed, for the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had Eleven Thouſand to Ten of theirs. But they had ſo Fortified themſelves upon one of the Hills, or rather Nature had done it for them, that Don <hi>John</hi> thought he could not have found a better, or more ſecure Place of Arms, as he told the King his Father, in a Letter after the Battle, in which he compar'd it to the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he thought himſelf ſo ſafe there, that he was almoſt aſham'd of his over great Precaution, and that the Enemy in mounting it, came ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

up like ſo many Cats <hi>[Como Gateando.]</hi> But the truth is, his Highneſs did a little exaggerate the matter, as two of the Officers who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Party that did this Feat, moſt ingenuouſly acknowledg'd, and thereby undeceiv'd me of an Error, who could think little otherwiſe of it then as a direct Precipice. Each of them ſeverally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that neither they nor their Men, made uſe of their Hands in mounting it; they ſaid indeed, that it was very ſteep, but according to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, it could not be near ſo inacceſſible as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves have made it. However, theſe Difficulties weighed ſo much with the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> Commanders, that the Council broke up without coming to any Reſolution; But for all this Count <hi>Schomberg</hi> was never the leſs attentive in obſerving the Countenance and Motions of the Enemy, and carefully ſeeking about, where and how he might be attacked, when thoſe that had been for Fighting in the Council, came about him, <hi>Simon Vaſconcellos,</hi> more eſpecially, who urged to him the repeated Orders of the King and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Conde de Caſtelmelbor,</hi> and it was agreed at laſt amongſt them, even in the abſence of the General (one of them undertaking for him) to bring it to a Battle; and as they were ranging the Cavalry in order, the Count took occaſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the General of what they reſolv'd on, who now ſeem'd well enough ſatisfied, declaring that he for his part had been always for it.</p>
               <p>The Fight began between the Horſe on both ſides, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Left charging the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Right Wing; I cannot give any exact Account of the part which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe had in this Action, not having had the opportunity to ſpeak with any Eye-witneſſes of their Conduct. However, thoſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54374:165"/>
Officers from whom I received my Information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Foot, have aſſured me, that the Horſe on this occaſion behaved themſelves with the like Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, as their Country men did in the other part of the Battle, to be ſpoken of preſently: Though they had not the like ſucceſs, they were commanded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Charge, and renew it ſeveral times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they did with their accuſtomed Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, though they were oblig'd every time to leap a wide Ditch, wherein ſeveral of their Horſes ſtuck, and the <hi>French</hi> who were to have ſuſtained them, fired their Piſtols at a diſtance, and then marched off and ſheltered themſelves under a Wall. But it ſeems our Horſe met with their Match at this time, having to deal with a Body of Old <hi>German</hi> Troops, who had learnt the Trade as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for as 'tis ſaid, they kept their Bullets till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came cloſe up to them, and were not to be eaſily broken by ſo ſmall a Number.</p>
               <p>While the Horſe on both ſides were engag'd in a fierce, and for ſometime doubtful Fight, our Foot were facing the foremention'd inacceſſible Hill, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought it; the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> firing their Muskets at the Enemy, who was at ſo great a diſtance, that it was impoſſible to do any Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the mean time playing with their Battery from the Hill, which did ſome Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were to the Left of the whole Army, killing four or five Men among their Pikes. Count <hi>Schomberg</hi> who as being the Author of this Battle, had a more than ordinary concern upon him for its ſucceſs, was now every where gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Orders and Encouragement to the Officers and Soldiers; he coming to the Left to animate his Country men, as he then called the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves as became them, found that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54374:166"/>
their Yeſterdays Fatigue, the ſight of the Enemy had made them Wanton, a thing as it muſt be confeſs'd uſually obſerved in our Soldiers and Sea-men, when they are in hopes of an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe were become Proud before hand of their Buff-coats, which as they thought they ſaw on the Backs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> Don <hi>John</hi>'s Guards being cloathed in Yellow. The Count hearing ſome of them Bragging how fine they ſhould be, gave them a gentle Reproof, by telling them, that <hi>the time to Boaſt was when the Armour was put off;</hi> but ſeeing that the Enemies Cannon was like to prove troubleſome to them where they ſtood, he ordered Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Hunt,</hi> who commanded them at that time to advance nearer the Hill to certain broken Houſes, by which means the great Guns might ſhoot over them, and the Houſes be a ſhelter to them from the ſmall ſhot. When the Count left them, they marched as they were directed, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as they advanced nearer, firing moſt furiouſly upon them, though they received but little hurt, even after they were come within reach of the ſmall Shot; the Officers ſuppos'd that the reaſon was, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> firing ſo faſt as they did, neglected to ram their Muskets, and that the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets tumbled out as they were aiming downwards, before they could give Fire; they were confirm'd in this Opinion, when they obſerv'd afterwards, that ſuch as were wounded, had been ſhot in their upper Parts. When they came up to the Houſes, it was found that they did not afford Covert for half their Men, and here the Soldiers began to grow impatient indeed; the Place ſeem'd hot, and the Enemy was near, and they thought it hard that they muſt ſtand there to be Pelted at, whilſt they might be in Action, wherefore they were all for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54374:166"/>
having their Commander lead them on, and ſhow'd ſo much egarneſs to be up with the Enemy, that he reſolv'd to gratify them, though he had no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for it; and ſo forward they marched through all the Fire and Smoak, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the Hill could make. The Lieutenant Colonel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding upon pain of Death, that none of his Men ſhould fire till he gave the Word; when they were got up to the Brink, the three foremoſt Ranks were ordered to give fire at once, the firſt kneeling, the ſecond ſtooping: The Soldiers took their aim ſo well, that this diſcharge was anſwered with a diſmal hideous Groan from the dying <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but being ſeconded by another, the Rear half-files preſently advancing and firing in the ſame manner, the Enemy began to give way in diſorder, our Men perceiving their Buſineſs to be in a manner done, gave as load a Shout as 'twas poſſible for them to make, and then fell in with the But-ends of their Muskets, and preſently put them into Confuſion, and in a ſhort time entirely routed them beyond all poſſibility of Rallying, continuing the Purſuit for about a Mile, having made themſelves Maſters of the four pieces of Cannon, Don <hi>John</hi>'s Tent and rich Baggage, and many of our Men look'd upon their Work as ſo far done, that they thought it high time to go to Dinner; for among other things, they had ſeiz'd upon Don <hi>John</hi>'s Proviſions, which they found juſt ready Dreſſed, and were falling to, but Count <hi>Schomberg</hi> ſoon found employment for them elſewhere.</p>
               <p>This reſolute Action of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd the famous Victory of <hi>Amexial, Canal</hi> or <hi>Evo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ra,</hi> for the Battle goes by all three of thoſe Names; but the Author of the ſecond Part of <hi>Portugal, Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtaurado</hi> now lately publiſh'd, ſo orders the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54374:167"/>
as to communicate the Honour of it to his own Country men, and not content with that, he will ſcarce ſuffer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to have any the leaſt ſhare in it. In his account of this Battle, he without taking notice of any preceding Action among the Foot, ſets Himſelf and another General Officer at the Head of four Regiments, in order to march up the Hill, one of theſe he allows indeed to be <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Thomas Hunt,</hi> but then he takes care to drop them by the way. Before they begin their March, the <hi>Conde de Villa Flor</hi> is brought in to make a florid Speech, which works ſo much upon them, that at the laſt Words they are in Motion; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being to the Left of all, and neareſt the Plain where the Cavalry on both ſides were ingag'd, are attack'd by four hundred Horſe with great Bravery. But they forming themſelves into a cloſe Body, the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks keeping within the Pikes, make ſuch Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by their repeated Diſcharges, that the <hi>Three</hi> Regiments led on by the two Commanders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their March unmoleſted. In aſcending the Hill they think fit that they might make ſure work of it, to ſend a ſingle Officer to ſee whether the Enemy might not have ſome Horſe there to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them. The Officer does as he is ordered, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his way through Clouds of Bullets, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor expreſſes it, takes a full view of the Place, and ſees no Horſe there; with this Anſwer he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages them to make up to the Top, and then the <hi>Three</hi> Regiments act over again the very ſame things which (as it hath hitherto been believ'd) the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> had done before.</p>
               <p>This Account Publiſh'd, as it is, under the Name of Dom <hi>Luis de Menezes,</hi> who was himſelf in the Battle as General of the Artillery, and doubtleſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54374:167"/>
himſelf therein with Honour, and afterwards had the Title <hi>Conde da Ericeyra,</hi> muſt at firſt ſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſhake the Credit of the foregoing Relation, if not intirely deſtroy it; and ſo put our Country men out of Poſſeſſion of an Honour, which till the latter end of laſt Year, they had enjoy'd as their undoubted Right. However, there are ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſages to be told relating to this Battle, which may poſſibly keep the former Account from being thought altogether incredible.</p>
               <p>But before any thing be ſaid in Defence of the one, or Anſwer to the other, there are certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that have been current about <hi>Lisbon</hi> for ſome Years, which the Publick ought to be inform'd of, and that in conſideration of the reſpect due to one of the <hi>Conde's</hi> Quality. Theſe Reports are ſuch, as if there be any Grounds for them, may make one ſuſpect that the <hi>Conde</hi> hath been much injur'd in the Edition of his Works. It was the common talk in <hi>Portugal</hi> for ſeveral Years after the Publication of the firſt Volumn, that ſome other Perſon beſides his Lordſhip, had a hand in Compoſing and Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his Papers; but then its true, that People dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd much in their Opinions concerning the Perſon ſuppos'd to be thus Employ'd, ſome would have it, that it was a Perſon of Quality indeed, but one of the other Sex: Others were for a certain Prieſt whom the <hi>Conde,</hi> as they pretend, kept in his Houſe for that purpoſe. I will not undertake for the Credit of either the one, or the other of theſe Reports, as being altogether ignorant on what gounds they were rais'd; but the Truth is, there is great cauſe why they that wiſh well to the <hi>Conde</hi>'s Memory, ſhould be glad they were believ'd, and ſome Paſſages in the Book it ſelf makes one think that there may be ſomething in them; the Language beſtow'd by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54374:168"/>
the Author on thoſe he calls Hereticks. Our King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt for one, when he reflects on the Behaviour of that Bleſſed Martyr in his laſt Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is not common among Men of the <hi>Conde's</hi> Rank, but ſeems to come rather from the indiſcreet Zeal of a Bigotted Lady, which is the only excuſe its capable of. And as for the Account now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, the Reader will ſoon perceive, that it ſavours ſtrongly of ſomething that I ſhall not name, but of which above all Men in the World, one would ſooneſt ſuſpect a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt. But to our Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second being informed of the wonderful Bravery of his Soldiers ſhown at this Battle of <hi>Amexial,</hi> was pleaſed out of his pure Liberality, to order Forty Thouſand Crowns-to be diſtributed amongſt them. All that know any thing of the Character of that Prince, know that he was not to be eaſily impoſed upon by ſham Relations of this kind, and it was as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the World, that his Exchequer did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow with Money, and conſequently it muſt be ſome very important Action, that his Majeſty thought fit to Reward with ſo large Donative. But was it poſſible for ſo underſtanding a Prince as King <hi>Charles,</hi> to think it an extraordinary thing for above 2000 Foot to make Reſiſtance againſt a Body of 400 Horſe? Yet this is all the part that our Author allows them in the Victory, only in concluſion he ſaith, that between Horſe and Foot they Ioſt about 50 Men, and that they and the <hi>French</hi> together behav'd themſelves Valiantly. Our Horſe loſt many more, the greateſt part of them being cut to pieces by their renewing the Charge ſo often as they did, while they were abandon'd by the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:54374:168"/>
But if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot did any thing to deſerve the Notice of their King, it was on the Hill, againſt which they were at firſt Poſted, and upon which the main Buſineſs of the Battle was tranſacted; for there by confeſſion of all, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſtrongeſt and were firſt routed, and unleſs it were up thither, our Foot ſcarce moved from their firſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That they did ſomething worthy of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and upon this Place we may appeal to the Memories of all People of any Curioſity in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;</hi> for the fighting over of this and ſome other of their Battles, was obſerved to be the main ſubject of Converſation amongſt them for many Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and their own Officers in the Army did not ſtick to acknowledge that the Crown of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> was preſerv'd by what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did in this; but I am writing in <hi>England,</hi> and ſhall content my ſelf with ſuch Evidence as is at hand. There are two Gentlemen in <hi>London,</hi> who commanded in this very Action, from whence the Author of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal Reſtaurado</hi> hath excluded our Country men; the one hath a Command in my Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment, the other is one of the Old Gentlemen in the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> who are ſo far from magnifying the Performance, that they contradict ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Publick Accounts, that made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more hazardous and daring then it really was. They know very well that they were not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on the foremention'd Hill, but that till the Action was over, there were none beſides them; the former of theſe gives a very demonſtrative Proof, that they could have no Aſſiſtants to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them at the beginning; for where they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the Hill, the nature of the Ground was ſuch, that it would not admit of the whole Regiment (the Party conſiſted but of one) for which reaſon,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54374:169"/>
two Companies that were to the Left, were forc'd to return and joyn the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiment that was drawn up in the ſecond Line, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Colonel <hi>Perſon.</hi> Its true, the <hi>Three</hi> Regiments might get up afterwards by other ways, but that they gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> time enough to do their Buſineſs for them, will appear from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conde Villa Flor</hi> General of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were firſt in Motion, was ſtanding on the riſing Ground, which he had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf of in the Morning, that was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to, and a League diſtant from the Hill, we are ſpeaking of. He ſeeing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> making up to the Enemy, and obſerving that contrary to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> they did not ſo much as once fire all the way, was perſwaded that they were running over to the Enemy, and inſtead of making Speeches, to animate his own Soldiers to follow them, was moſt bitterly exclaiming againſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, declaring, That he waſh'd his Hands from having any thing to do in the Deſtruction of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> or giving this occaſion to the Hereticks to betray them; he was ſo fully ſatisfied, that this and no other was their Deſign, that all they did whilſt in ſight confirm'd him in his Opinion. Mr. <hi>John Cargill</hi> who was Chaplain to the Regiment, which the Gen. was crying out againſt, being near him at that time, and underſtanding what he meant, but not having <hi>Portugueſe</hi> enough to ſpeak to him, enquired for ſome body that could ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> and having found one, deſired him to acquaint his Excellency, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> inſtead of being guilty of ſo vile a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, as he was laying to their Charge, were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a moſt Important piece of Service; but the Gen. was not to be perſwaded out of his Senſes, his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54374:169"/>
Eyes and his Ears convincing him, that the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks were a doing that which, as he ſaid, he had all along expected from them. He had ſeen them running up to the Enemy, till they come ſo near, that they might ſhake Hands, without doing the leaſt act of Hoſtility; he preſently afterwards heard a Shout too loud, as he thought for ſo ſmall a Company to give, and he could think no otherwiſe, but that they, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Congratulating each other upon their Conjunction; as for their general Diſcharge it could be nothing elſe but a Salvo, they doubtleſs ſhooting their Bullets into the Air. Such were the Speeches that the <hi>Conde de Villa Flor</hi> made while our Soldiers were beating the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for him; he chang'd his Note indeed when he came afterwards to underſtand the matter, if it be true as 'tis reported, that he ſaid, <hi>Aquelles Herejes ſam mel hores que os noſſos Santos;</hi> theſe Hereticks are better to us then our own Saints. But for that time, all the Chaplain could do in order to his Conviction, was to prevail, that a Meſſenger ſhould be ſent along with him, to ſee what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were adoing upon the Hill: In their way they met Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Cargill</hi> acquainted with the Conſternation in which he had left the General. The Count upon hearing this, Gallop'd towards the General, and as we may ſuppoſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abus'd him of his Error. The Count was then juſt come down from the Hill, for he having the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the whole Battle upon him, found occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his Preſence in every Part, and thought it neceſſary at this time among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> leſt their heat ſhould carry them on too far in the Purſuit, whilſt their Service was requir'd elſewhere. He had got up with them by that time they had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Enemy about a Mile; and though he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54374:170"/>
diſcovered by his Words, and much more in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, how well pleas'd a Man of his Character muſt be with ſo Gallant an Action; yet they were his own Regiment, and he check'd them for their too great Eagerneſs, telling them that the Enemies Horſe were making towards their Country men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and commanding the Officers to Rally their Men that were then all in Diſorder in the Purſuit and Plunder. While his Orders were putting in Execution, he return'd to the Plain, and when he heard Mr. <hi>Cargil</hi>'s Story, he rode up to quiet the General.</p>
               <p>After the Conference between the Count and the General, we ſuppoſe it was that the <hi>Three Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Regiments, headed by the two Commanders, had the Speech made to them, and were ordered to march up the Hill, for it was juſt at this time that the Enemies Horſe attack'd an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiment in the manner deſcrib'd by our Author, only he gives a wrong Name to it, for it was Colonel <hi>Perſons;</hi> and this was juſt as Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Men, who had nothing to do with any Horſe, at all, were leaving the Hill: For they having ſpent ſome time in getting into Rank and File, were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what haſt they could to joyn their Country men, ſeeing four Squadrons of <hi>Cuiraſſiers</hi> charging them, who were ſo warmly receiv'd, that they ſoon wheel'd off, leaving behind them ſeveral of their Men and Horſes upon the Ground.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> did not aſcend this Hill before our Men had been there and done their work for them, will appear likewiſe from hence: The Author, ſaith that they began their March at the ſame time when ſeven other Regiments of Foot on the Right, aſſiſted by five Squadrons of Horſe, went to Attack the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other Hill,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54374:170"/>
whom after ſome Reſiſtance they routed, taking at the ſame time the other four Pieces of Cannon; but this was not attempted till after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been upon the ſteep Hill, and as a great Officer declared preſently after, had not been done at all, were it not that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were provok'd to it by what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done before.</p>
               <p>However, while theſe ſeven Regiments aſſiſted as they were with five Squadrons, notwithſtanding the Advantage they had in Number and in the Place, by much more acceſſible then the other, as appears by their making uſe of Horſe, were for ſome time put to it by the diſpirited <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Our Author aſſirms, that the <hi>three</hi> Regiments knowing nothing of what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been doing (for he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not a word of it, and has done his utmoſt to keep the Reader from ſuſpecting any ſuch thing) mounted the moſt inacceſſible Hill; two of them directly Fronting it, the third wheeling about to the Right, all keeping their Fire as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done, till they gain'd the Top, which they all did at the ſame time when they make a general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and preſently put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, take their Guns which <hi>Dom Luis de Menezes</hi> turns upon them at the ſame inſtant, and put them intirely to the Rout. But where theſe things to do then, the <hi>Conde de Villa Flor</hi> muſt have been more in his Wits then to make ſuch an unequal Diviſion of his Forces, at leaſt he would have diſpos'd of them in another manner; he would have order'd the ſeven Regiments to wheel about, in order to get up to this Place, where the Enemies chief ſtrength lay, and had ſent the <hi>Three</hi> where there was leſs Danger. Count <hi>Scomberg</hi> as leaſt, who as brave a Soldier as he was, was ſo Prudent a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as to be always for making ſure Work; when
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54374:171"/>
he came up to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would never have taken them off from the Purſuit, could he have ſuſpected that there would ſo ſudden an occaſion for doing over again all that they had done already. But the Truth is, there is ſo great an Agreement in ſome of the moſt material Paſſages in this Account, with what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been doing before, as 'tis related by our Officers, who never ſaw or heard of the <hi>2d.</hi> Volum of <hi>Portugal Reſtaurado,</hi> that they all ſeem to ſpeak of one and the ſame Action, ſo that there is cauſe to ſuſpect that the <hi>Conde</hi> had given an Account of the Part, which our Country men had in the Battle, and that the Reviſors of his Papers, or which is more probable, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors</hi> when the Book paſſed through their Hands, out of their great kindneſs to the Hereticks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to make a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Action of it, by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Names and Time: There are more Reaſons for this Conjecture, then are neceſſary to be told at preſent. It is not denied but that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> might come upon the Place where the Action was perform'd, but it appears from what hath been ſaid, that it could not be till the Buſineſs was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner done, and till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were about leaving it, ſo that they might have ſpared the Officers pains whom they ſent to view it, there being neither Horſe nor Foot in any condition to withſtand them. All the work that they had to do was, that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done, a broken ſcatter'd and confounded Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and which a Brave Man will never by his Good-will ſet his Hand to, which is down-right killing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being drawn off upon a Buſineſs that became them better, had not been long there after the Enemies Horſe were repuls'd, but a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came Riding up to them from Count <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:54374:171"/>
with Orders to Halt, adding that the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> on the Right had attack'd and put to the Rout the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other Hill; ſometime afterwards Count <hi>Schomberg</hi> himſelf came to them, and order'd them to joyn the Army that was going to incamp, it them growing Duskiſh. The Count ſtaid with them part of the Night, telling the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers many diverting Paſſages, and we may gueſs at whoſe Expence he diverted himſelf. Were that Great Man alive now, he had no doubt before this time receiv'd from <hi>Portugal</hi> a further occaſion for his Mirth.</p>
               <p>It is very likely that a Perſon unskill'd in Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Affairs muſt be guilty of many Errors in his manner of Relating this Tranſaction, but as to the ſubſtance of what hath told, he hath deliver'd it with that aſſurance which is Natural to one who himſelf believes what he ſaith, he having receiv'd the moſt material Paſſages from ſeveral Competent Witneſſes, at ſeveral places and times, all agreeing with each other, and with what our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves relates, where he does not plainly do that which 'twould be a great indecency to Name. However, ſince many cannot have the like oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to inform themſelves, he ſhall inſiſt only upon this notorious Truth: That <hi>at the Battle of</hi> Amexial, <hi>part of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Foot without the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of</hi> Portugueſes <hi>or others, attack'd a great Body of</hi> Spaniards, <hi>poſted upon a Hill by themſelves thought inacceſſible, Defeated and Routed them, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their great Guns, their General's Tent and Baggage, and by this means occaſion'd the Victory, which preſerv'd</hi> Portugal <hi>from imminent Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> This he believes to be ſo evident a Truth, that there's ſcarce a Perſon of any conſiderable Rank in the ſeveral Nations, that were concern'd in the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54374:172"/>
Tranſaction, but either is or may be convinc'd of it by Eye-Witneſſes, thoſe that have convers'd with them, Letters from Publick Miniſters, or the like. And ſince on account of the ſuppos'd Author's Quality, the Hiſtory of <hi>Portugal Reſtaurado</hi> is likely to be communicated to thoſe that are in the Higheſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they who have prefix'd to it the Name of Dom <hi>Luis de Menezes,</hi> have done a great diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to their Cauſe, and a moſt irreparable injury to the Memory of that great Man. For while ſuch as have a true ſenſe of Honour, ſhall think that Lord could be Author of a Peace, wherein ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Gratitude is expreſs'd to the Savers of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo much Artifice uſed to Defraud them of the Honour got while they were expoſing their Lives, to reſcue a diſtreſs'd People from Deſtruction, and all for no other apparent Reaſon, but our difference in Opinions: for there appears throughout the Work as great Partiality in favour of the <hi>French,</hi> as Prejudice againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> How vile a thing muſt they take this ancient Popery to be, and how miſchievous amongſt the People, that can have ſo Maligant an Influence upon a Noble Mind! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty ſhould Dom <hi>Luis de Menezes</hi> prove guilty of ſo diſingenuous a Work. The General of the Artillery did not gain more Honour by his Sword, when he fought at the Battle of <hi>Amexial,</hi> then the <hi>Conde de Ericeyra,</hi> forfeited by his Pen when he Diſcribed it.</p>
               <p>In this Battle, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as 'tis ſaid, of 16 Thouſand, had 4000 kill'd, and 6000 taken Priſoners, among whom were 2500 Wounded. The loſs on the Victors ſide was inconſiderable; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the 8 Companies that were ingag'd on the Hill, there were but 16 private Soldiers, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign kill'd. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> indeed while they were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54374:172"/>
killing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot; and fighting with the Horſe, loſt a thouſand of their Men, and had 500 Wounded. The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> being very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the great ſervices done him by our Men, reſolv'd to beſtow a Largeſs upon them as a mark of his Eſteem. His Gift was very Extraordinary in its kind: for it was three Pounds of Snuff to each Company; and not deſpicable for its Value, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering into how low a ſtate <hi>Portugal</hi> had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. But our Foot Soldiers had not ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in them; for when the Preſent was made in his Majeſty's Name, they took it and toſs'd it up into the Air out of Contempt and Diſdain, and as they grew Angry, they began to remember, not their own ſervices, but the loſs of their Valiant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men of the Horſe Regiment, and to vent their Indignation that ſuch Men that had been ſo often commanded on to the Slaughter, ſhould be ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandon'd as they were. However, their Paſſions cool'd, and they came to themſelves again upon the firſt occaſion for Action; and though they were to fight for <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> yet they behav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> ſtill, inſomuch that the remainder of the preſent Campagne, and the two that follow'd, ſeem'd juſt the Reverſe of thoſe made by Don <hi>John</hi> the two foregoing Years, and the beginning of this. Soon after the Battle <hi>Evora</hi> was beſieged and taken, and the next Year <hi>Valença</hi> in <hi>Eſtremadura,</hi> at both which Sieges the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd themſelves in their uſual manner, of which ſeveral remarkable Inſtances might be given. In 1665. the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made ſhift to bring another Army into <hi>Portugal,</hi> under the Marqueſs <hi>de Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena,</hi> to be ſerv'd at <hi>Montes-claros,</hi> in the ſame manner as Don <hi>John</hi>'s had been at <hi>Amexial.</hi> In this Battle while a whole Regiment of <hi>French</hi> fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54374:173"/>
ran away, ſome particular Perſons excepted, who came and Fought by our Country men, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as 'tis ſaid, contributed no leſs to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory then they did in the former.</p>
               <p>But an Account of theſe and ſome other very conſiderable Tranſactions would come with a much better Grace, from a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> then an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hand; to commemorate Benefits, being an Office properly belonging to the Receivers, wherefore it is to be hoped that ſome Perſon of that Generous Nation will ſave us the trouble. If any ſuch ſhall undertake to write a Supplement to <hi>Portugal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaurado,</hi> the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Mercury of <hi>July</hi> 1664. will furniſh him with a Precedent in one particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that's not unworthy of his imitation, which ſince it proves the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to be not altogether inſenſible of kindneſſes done them, and ſhows that they may be ready to make amends for ſuch Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as we now complain of, I ſhall here ſet down, after having given a ſhort Account of the occaſion of it.</p>
               <p>At the Siege of <hi>Valença,</hi> when the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries had made a Breach in the Wall, wide enough for an Aſſault as 'twas judg'd by the general Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. The Governor of the Place refuſing to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate, but on ſuch Conditions, as the Beſiegers thought unreaſonable, it was reſolv'd to attempt the Town by Storm; accordingly the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments were order'd to be in a readineſs to mount the Breach, they being to begin the Aſſault at the firing of 6 Guns all at once. At the ſame time falſe Attacks were to be made in other Places, to divert the Beſieged, and two hundred <hi>French</hi> with Scaling Ladders, were to endeavour to enter the Town where they found leaſt Reſiſtance. When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were upon beginning the Aſſault, amidſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54374:173"/>
vaſt quantities of Artificial Fires, which the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who were upon their Guard poured down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Theſe Fires happen'd to put the Faſcines that were in the Beſiegers Works below into a Flame, which the Marqueſs <hi>de Merialva</hi> then General, thought none ſo fit to extinguiſh as thoſe that were to make the Diverſion, and therefore gave Command that the 200 <hi>French</hi> ſhould lay aſide their ſcaling Ladders, and together with the reſt that were to make the falſe Attacks, be employed in quenching the Fire. This being done, there was no body to renew their former Orders; the Marqueſs indeed had call'd them off from what they were about, but 'twas pretended that to command them on again, was none of his Buſineſs, but Count <hi>Scomberg</hi>'s, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the Marqueſs at that time had a great Pegue; the Count was then taken up in giving neceſſary Directions for the Aſſault; in the mean time the Signal was given, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mounted the Breach with great Reſolution, as many of them as could ſtand in it, maintaining a very unequal Combat againſt the whole Force of the Town, while thoſe that were below to ſupport them, were gall'd by the Enemies ſhot on all ſides, inſomuch that when they retired at laſt, it was with the loſs of about three hundred of their Companions. The place Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ſoon after the next News-book gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Siege, and juſt made mention of this Action, but in ſuch a manner as to make People believe, that about Ten or a Dozen <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and two <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had through their own Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs got themſelves knock'd on the Head; for it was ſaid that the information which had been given concerning the Breach, proved a Miſtake, and ſo only the foreſaid Number went very bravely up and were Kill'd, and that many were Wounded
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54374:174"/>
although they did not come near the Breach.</p>
               <p>This Account coming out while the Army was in Quarters, there being ſome of our Officers at that time at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> they reſolved to wait upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State to demand Reparation for this Slurr put upon them, and the Memory of their deceaſed Friends. They had all along obſerv'd the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> to be free indeed of their Verbal Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements, but very backward in truſting them to Writing, and they were now at laſt ſo far incenſed, that ſome of them did not ſpare to give <hi>Antonio de Souſa</hi> the Secretary very heard Names, even when they came within his Hearing. The Secretary to their ſurprize told them in their own Language, that ſome of them ſpoke broad <hi>Engliſh;</hi> however they inſiſting in their Demand of ſatisfaction for the Wrong that had been done them, he promiſed them they ſhould have it; accordingly in the next <hi>Mercury</hi> appear'd this additional Account, which though it wants much of ſupplying the Defects of the former, yet as it muſt be acknowledg'd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with very Honourable Teſtimonies of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> Mercury <hi>were a</hi> Spaniard, <hi>he would make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of things that never were done, but being</hi> Portugueſe, <hi>he does not mention thoſe that were, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be upon exact Information. Since the laſt was Printed, he hath receiv'd Advice of certain Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, worthy to be remembred, perform'd on our Side at the Enterprize of</hi> Valença, <hi>and it is but juſt that they ſhould be related, that they be not deprived of that glorious</hi> Precomum <hi>which conſecrates them to Eternity; and to ſuch Honourable Gueſts as the</hi> Engliſh <hi>are, the firſt Place in this Relation is due.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Four Regiments were commanded to the Breach, two</hi> Portugueſe <hi>and two</hi> Engliſh, <hi>one of theſe was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54374:174"/>
Count</hi> Schombergs, <hi>the General of the Strangers, Commanded by his Lieutenant Colonel</hi> Thomas Hunt, <hi>the other was Colonel</hi> Henry Perſons. <hi>They went to the Aſſanlt with the greateſt Valour, twenty with an Enſign that carried the Coulors mounting the Breach, there not being room for more</hi> (but ſome of the Gentlemen under Named will tell that they had much more Company.) <hi>For as 'twas ſaid in the laſt, the Breach was not yet compleated, it being a miſtaken Information that was given concerning it. The Twenty ſeeing themſelves unaccompanied, were not diſcouraged, but they all fought till they Died, the Combat was ſo furious, that the Coulors were burnt within the Breach. The two Regiments diſparing now of being able to enter, might have made their Retreat, but their great Courage would not ſuffer them; ſo they drew up at the foot of the Wall, and though they ſtood with their Breaſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, yet they fought to Admiration with thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as if they had been on the Level in open Field; ſo</hi> 150 <hi>of them were kill'd, falling in the ſame order in which they ſtood. Among theſe were the ſaid Lieutenant Colonel</hi> Hunt, <hi>and his Major</hi> John Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>and</hi> John Fitz Patrick <hi>one of his Captains. Of Colonel</hi> Perſon'<hi>s Regiment,</hi> William More, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Noland <hi>and</hi> H. Traverſe, <hi>Captains; there were killed beſides theſe three Lieutenants, four Enſigns, and ſeven Sergeants, all worthy to live eternally in our Memory and our Gratitude, who with ſo much, conſtancy expos'd their Lives for us. There were</hi> 300 <hi>Wounded, among theſe were Captain</hi> Francis Stanly, <hi>and Captain</hi> Nathaniel Hill <hi>of the foreſaid firſt Regiment, and Captain</hi> Thomas Bonſer, <hi>and Captain</hi> John Roch <hi>of the other, and without doubt they had all died, for they had no Covert, were it not that the General commanded them to Retreat, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54374:175"/>
they did in ſo gallant a manner, as rais'd a Noble E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in the whole Army. And ſince they that were neither Kill'd nor Wounded deſerved no leſs Honour, by what they did, 'tis fit it ſhould be known who they were. Of the firſt Regiment were Captains</hi> Francis More, William Love, Henry Boad <hi>and</hi> Andrew Maynard; <hi>af the ſecond beſides, Colonel</hi> Perſon <hi>were Lieutenant Colonel</hi> John Bellaſiſe, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> John Rumſey, <hi>and Captains</hi> Richard Heafield, <hi>and</hi> Charles Langley. <hi>Certainly the</hi> Engliſh <hi>have behaved themſelves with extraordinary Valour, and to great ſatisfaction ſince their coming to aſſiſt us in this War, and that which they are particularly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd for, is their orderly carriage towards the</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Peaſants in their Quarters. On the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of this inſtant</hi> July, <hi>enter'd the Port of</hi> Lisbon 150 <hi>foot Soldiers arrived from</hi> England, <hi>which may in ſome meaſure repaire the Number of thoſe that died in</hi> Valença, <hi>but not ſatisfie our Regret for the loſs of ſuch Companions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Soldiers were fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Battles of <hi>Portugal,</hi> his Miniſters were no leſs buſy in ſecuring the Effects of their Victories, by Negotiating the happy Peace, which that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now enjoys. King <hi>Charles</hi> had ſo great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration for the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> when in their moſt deplorable Condition, that Sir <hi>Richard Fanſhaw</hi> his Ambaſſador at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> had Inſtructions from him in the beginning of the Year 1663. to interpoſe his good Offices, and uſe all poſſible means in order to make their Peace with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> but the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> was then Triumphant, and could think of nothing but making a quick diſpatch of the War. When the Condition of <hi>Portugal</hi> began to mend, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was ſent upon the ſame Errand to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> where 'tis true, he did not meet with that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54374:175"/>
as was expected in his Embaſſy; for though upon Notice of his Arrival, ſuch Preparations were made for his Reception, that the like had ſcarce ever been done for any Ambaſſador at that Court, yet upon his coming near <hi>Madrid,</hi> he found the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters mightily alter'd all of a ſudden, inſomuch that it was ſix Weeks before he made his Publick Entry; and the Court prov'd ſo untractable and unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to accommodate their Minds to their Fortunes, that it was two Years before he could gain any thing upon them, and when he had brought them to conſent to a Treaty at laſt, his Negotiations did not keep Pace with the Victories obtain'd in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> as appeared by the great diſappointment he met with at <hi>Salvaterra,</hi> in the beginning of the Year 1666.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time when our Ambaſſador was preparing for his Journey from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Portugal,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> was ſent as Envoy from King <hi>Charles</hi> to this latter Court, to aſſiſt at the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Peace between the two Crowns. Upon his Arrival in <hi>Portugal,</hi> he heard that Mr. <hi>de S. Romain</hi> had juſt got before him, which made him haſten to <hi>Salvaterra,</hi> where the Court then was. His Inſtructions were of a freſher Date then the Ambaſſadors, and conſequently more accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the ſtate of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Affairs at that time; but the Ambaſſador being not yet come, he found the Miniſters unwilling to enter upon any Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs before his Arrival, they expecting from him ſuch Conditions as ſhould give them intire ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The Ambaſſador not anſwering their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, but on the contrary highly diſguſting them with the Title of his Project of Peace, while Mr. <hi>de S. Romain</hi> was moſt profuſe in his Promiſes of the mighty things that his Maſter would do for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54374:176"/>
them, the Treaty was wholly broke off for that time. However, Sir <hi>Robert Southwell</hi> applying himſelf to the <hi>Conde de Caſtelmelhor,</hi> the next Morning after the Council had ſent that haſty Anſwer formerly mention'd, though he found him in a very great Heat, yet had the Addreſs to pacifie him, and were it not that the Caſe was ſoon alter'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> he might have brought the Treaty on again. The Conde expreſſed himſelf highly diſſatisfied, that it ſhould be thought that they would ever Treat with <hi>Spain,</hi> but upon equal terms, ſaying, That the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> might perhaps conquer <hi>Portugal,</hi> but ſhould never conquer the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who for their parts would firſt leap into the Sea before they would come to any Accommodation, unleſs it were made between King and King. But the Envoy ſoon brought him to a Temper, by repreſenting that what the Ambaſſador had offer'd, was only the firſt and rude Draught, or the Embrio as it were of a Treaty, ſo that there was little reaſon for him to be offended at the Inſcription, which was a thing of no Conſequence, it ſignifying nothing what Name or Title was given it now, ſince <hi>No body e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Chriſten'd a Child before it was Born.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de as he was pleaſed with the conceit, ſo he would not deny but that it was appoſite to the caſe in hand, and the Envoy having aſſur'd him, that his Inſtructions were ample enough to procure for <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> all reaſonable ſatisfaction; it was agreed that a new Project of a Treaty ſhould be drawn up, which was done accordingly, by the Ambaſſador and the Envoy together. It contain'd the very ſame Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which with ſome ſmall alterations are now in force, between the Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> With this they both took a journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> but the War newly broke out between <hi>England</hi> and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54374:176"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> made that Court believe there was no ſuch neceſſity as before of a Peace with <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſo nothing could be done then for that Year.</p>
               <p>By the beginning of the next Year, the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> had concluded and ſign'd their League with <hi>France.</hi> Its true, the <hi>Conde de Caſtelmelhor</hi> the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Author of that League on the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſide, was the ſame Year removed from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and the Court, but this together with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Changes that ſucceeded, was brought about by the Queen and her Party, who were more ſtrongly ingaged in the Intereſts of <hi>France;</hi> the Queen was ſo ingag'd both by Birth and Inclination, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps much more ſtrongly, yet as ſhe hoped to be countenanc'd by the <hi>French</hi> Court in what ſhe had done, and was doing againſt her Husband, and in her further deſign of marrying with the Prince; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> Faction became now more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent at Court then ever, and they ſeem'd there not only averſe to all thoughts of a Peace, but afraid leaſt any Overtures ſhould come from <hi>Caſtille,</hi> to put the People in mind of it, wherefore the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were ſtrictly guarded to hinder all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between the Subjects on both Kingdoms. The precaution perhaps was needleſs, for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niads</hi> whether it was that their thoughts were who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with the War they had then with <hi>France,</hi> or that they hoped when a Peace was made with that Crown by the Intervention of other Princes, that they ſhould be able after all to deal with <hi>Portugal,</hi> made no Advances towards a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This backwardneſs of the Parties concern'd was enough to make a Mediator out of love with his Office, and might have given any other Perſon then the Gentleman that then executed it, juſt cauſe to deſpair of doing any good upon them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54374:177"/>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Envoy was not Idle, to bring two Nations to a Peace, and make them Happy though againſt their Wills, after they had been deſtroying one another for ſeven and twenty Years together, was an Enterprize ſo glorious for a young Miniſter to effect, that one of Sir <hi>Robert South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Character was not to be deter'd from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by any Difficulties; but in order to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his Deſign, he was forc'd to go a great way about, it was in vain to think of ſucceeding by any direct Application to either Court, he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fain to chooſe other Inſtruments to work with, and his choice was ſo good, and he manag'd them ſo well, that he wrought out his ends by them, by diſpoſing both Courts for that Peace which was concluded in the beginning of the Year 1668. to the unſpeakable ſatisfaction of the two Nations.</p>
               <p>At the Battles of <hi>Amexial</hi> and <hi>Monteſcloros,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Perſons of the moſt Illuſtrious Houſes in <hi>Spain</hi> were taken Priſoners, in the former <hi>Don Gaſpar de Haro</hi> Marqueſs <hi>de Eliche,</hi> five times <hi>Grande</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Heir to the two great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, the <hi>Conde Duque de Olivares</hi> and <hi>Don Luis de Haro,</hi> he being Son to the Latter. <hi>Don Anielo de Guſman,</hi> eldeſt Son of the Duke <hi>de Medina de las Torres,</hi> and <hi>Don Juan Henriques Conde de Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calante;</hi> at <hi>Monteſcleros, Don Diego Correa</hi> General of the Cavallery, and ſeveral other Perſons of the firſt Quality. Theſe Noblemen had ever ſince their Misfortune been confined to the Caſtle of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where they were frequently viſited by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Envoy. They had all along expreſs'd a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for our Nation, and would ſometimes Treat our Officers amongſt them, acknowledging them for their Conquerors, for they would by no means allow that Title to the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> The Envoy
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54374:177"/>
having contracted a more particular Acquaintance and Familiarity with them, thought they might be of great uſe to him in prevailing upon the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> to renew the Treaty; he ſaw that their Priſon was very uneaſie to them, and that they were impatient to be at Liberty, of which they could have little hopes till the Peace was made, and the knew their neareſt Relations to be Men of the greateſt Power in <hi>Spain,</hi> who might by their Solicitation be prevail'd upon to think of a Peace. Coming once amongſt them, he began to upbraid them in a familiar way, for their Remiſneſs in not endeavouring to free themſelves from their wretched Confinement, telling them that they ſeem'd to have a worſe Opinion of their own Condition, then ſome of the Fathers had concerning the ſtate of thoſe in Hell; from whence as they thought there was ſome Redemption. But he found them deſparing of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever able to regain their Liberty; ſo far were they from entertaining any hopes of it, that they told him, if <hi>Origen</hi> had been a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ſo favourable in his Opinion; however, the Envoy to ſhow that he did not adviſe them to Impoſſibilities, undertook to overcome the greateſt Difficulty, and make way for a free intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and their Friends. This offer incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd them to write their Minds to their Relations in <hi>Spain,</hi> in order to ſet them at Work to bring on the Treaty of Peace again. They delivered their Letters to the Envoy, who ſo manag'd the matter, that the Governour of <hi>Elvas,</hi> one of his particular Acquaintance, though wholly ignorant of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, conveyed the Pacquet to a Servant of one of theſe Noblemen, who was employed on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to provide him with Neceſſaries. But to get Anſwers to their Letters, which they could not well
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54374:178"/>
expect by the ſame way, the Envoy took another Courſe. He had at that time an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigat watching for him in the River, but he finding his Negotiations to be now in a fair way towards a happy Concluſion, inſtead of imbarking for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> order'd the Captain to make a Voyage to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> ſending on board him a Servant of his, who had been frequently employed in Meſſages of a like Nature, with another Pacquet from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Noblemen, who arriving at <hi>Cadiz</hi> rode Poſt to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> where the Letters he brought with him ſoon produc'd their deſired Effect.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Envoy was thus contriving ways to bring the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſue for a Peace, he had a harder Game to play ſtill, which was to diſpoſe that of <hi>Portugal</hi> to a Compliance, it was to no purpoſe for him to motion the matter to that Court, at a time when it was become wholly <hi>French.</hi> As for the Nobility that were then upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, they were either ingaged in the Queen's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or had Commands in the Army, which made it to be for their Intereſt to have the War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. But then there was at the ſame time in <hi>Portugal</hi> a Power ſuperior to both theſe, and he thought fit in this caſe of neceſſity to ſerve himſelf of that, for the common Good of all.</p>
               <p>The People ever ſince the Revolt from <hi>Spain,</hi> had been in Poſſeſſion of an abſolute kind of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had on ſeveral occaſions exerciſed the ſame over thoſe in Authority without Exception; as all the late Turns and Changes in the State had been brought about by their means, they pulling down and ſetting up as they pleaſed, ſo they kept thoſe they placed in the Government in ſubjection to their Wills. Their Power was never more uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then whilſt they were depoſing King <hi>Alfonſo,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:54374:178"/>
and placing Prince <hi>Pedero</hi> in his room, but had not yet fixt him in the Government. They were at that time in a great Ferment, and according as their Motions were directed by ſuch as had the Art to manage them, they were like to bear down all before them: Now while the greateſt Men in the Kingdom were tampering with them, that by their means they might deſtroy one another, the Envoy did not think it beneath him to be dealing with them too, in order to preſerve the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to this end he thought the fitteſt Inſtrment he could make uſe of, was the <hi>Juis do Povo,</hi> and therefore he took Acquaintance with him, and to keep him well affected, gave Orders that the <hi>Juis</hi> ſhould have ſuch Work as there was occaſion for in the Houſe, that was proper for one of his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he would ſometimes condeſcend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Diſcourſe the Man, incouraging him to contribute on his part by that great Authority which belong'd to his Office towards ſettling the Nation, by an Advantagious and Honourable Peace. The <hi>Juis do Povo</hi> is accounted the chief Magiſtrate of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> his Office ſomewhat reſembling that of a Mayor; he is not indeed of equal Dignity with my Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> which perhaps may be the reaſon why he hath a much greater Power; for he muſt be of one of the meaneſt Hardicraft Trades, whereby he is more fitly qualified to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Peoples Head, and he does not think himſelf too good to become the Ring-leader in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Commotions, acting as it were the part of a <hi>Maſſaniello</hi> by Law. Great things are told con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe that bore this Office during the War; King <hi>John</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> being obſerved to be a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in the Affairs of Government, and too intent.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54374:179"/>
upon his Sports; 'tis reported that he once going to ride out into the Country to Hunt, the <hi>Juis do Povo</hi> laid hands on the Reigns of his Horſes Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and oblig'd his Majeſty to ſtay at home and mind his Buſineſs; nor will this ſeem ſtrange if his Power were ſo great as they ſay it is to this Day, that he could at a Words ſpeaking raiſe the whole <hi>Poſſe</hi> of the Commonalty. The Envoy found the Perſon that was then in Place to be an honeſt well meaning Man, and ready to concurr with him in his Deſign, on which, as one of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Capacity might eaſily be made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, the Happineſs of his Country depended; and this Man ſhowed himſelf ſo very Zealous and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to promote it, that his Picture is to be ſeen at this Day amongſt theirs who were more immediately concern'd in making the Peace. The Envoy took care likewiſe to have his Party amongſt the Peoples Repreſentatives in <hi>Cortes,</hi> which were aſſembled ſome time after <hi>Alfonſo</hi> had been Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; his Table was open for the Members, and he had his Cabals with them, the Effects whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd as ſoon as the Buſineſs came under Debate.</p>
               <p>The Letters of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Noblemen were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd with Powers from the Queen Regent to the Marqueſs <hi>de Eliche,</hi> to enter upon a Treaty with the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to the intire ſatisfaction of that Kingdom. Letters to this purpoſe were no ſooner come, but care was taken to have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of them publiſh'd every where both in City and Country; the News was welcomed by the People, who now hoped to ſee a ſpeedy end of their Miſeries, with ſuch Publick Demonſtrations of Joys as it deſerv'd, which the Court in vain laboured to ſuppreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:54374:179"/>
Mr. <hi>de S. Romain</hi> had now great occaſion to beſtir himſelf, but he found the People ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed already, that all his Artifices were like to have no effect upon them; he therefore ſets forth a Memorial directed to the Prince, the Miniſters, and the <hi>Corteſoens,</hi> or Members of <hi>Cortes,</hi> wherein he Declares: <hi rend="margQuotes">That the Prince could not break the League with <hi>France,</hi> and conſequently not make Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> both, becauſe in taking the Government into his hands, he took upon himſelf the Obligations of the Crown to maintain the Treaty made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Brother and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and in conſideration of the great Benefits confer'd on <hi>Portugal,</hi> by <hi>His Moſt Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty, who had given innumerable Demonſtrations of his Friendſhip to that Kingdom, having ſpent his Treaſures and the Blood of his Subjects in its Defenec; and likewiſe becauſe it was impoſſible for an advantageous Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> to be made with ſecurity in the form Propoſed, ſince the Intervention of the King of <hi>France</hi> was wanting, wherein alone conſiſted the certainty, that the Promiſes and Conditions of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be kept; That the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> whilſt they dreaded the Armies of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> would indeed to free themſelves from the Danger they were in, ſubmit to any Terms that the Prince as a Conqueror ſhould impoſe. But a few days of Delay could be no loſs in this Conjuncture, and ſince <hi>France</hi> was not far off, he adviſed the Prince to ſend thither a Copy of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Propoſals, and when he had received an Anſwer from thence, he might then conſult what was moſt conducive to his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54374:180"/>
Subject's Good. As for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they minded nothing but their own Intereſts, and as they had ſhown upon ſeveral Occaſions, would never ſtand to the Treaty, but while they were under an Impoſſibility to carry on the War. That their Ancient and inbred Hatred was now mightily increaſed by the Miſeries which the Valient <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had brought upon them, and therefore they in all future Ages, would be indeavouring either by Force, or Art, or Alliances, to reunite the Crown of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> to <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and all this in order to take their Revenge in ſo cruel a manner, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory the very Memory of the Nobility, by ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering over the face of the Earth, ſuch of them as ſhould eſcape their Tortures and Poiſons, and to impoveriſh the People to that Degree, that they ſhould have nothing left to enable them any more, to ſhake off their heavy and Tyrannical Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Eliche</hi> who had his Agents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, was one of the firſt that got a ſight of this Memorial, and he immediately drew up an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, which he took care to have diſpers'd throughout the Kingdom. In it he ſets forth, <hi rend="margQuotes">That the <hi>French</hi> Artifices to augment their own Power by weakning their Neighbours were Notorious to the World, of which there was no need to go far for a Proof, none doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that they had ſuccour'd <hi>Portugal</hi> in this laſt War, to the end only that by other Mens Hands they might beat down the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Power of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> in order to become themſelves too ſtrong for both Parties. That this and no other was their Deſign, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54374:180"/>
by their Proceedings after the Peace made at the <hi>Pirenees,</hi> where the King of <hi>France</hi> in Perſon gave his Word to King <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> and confirm'd the ſame in the Capitulations of Marriage between him and that King's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he would give no Succours to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> againſt <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and at the ſame time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that Kingdom with Money, Generals, Officers and Soldiers; that having obtain'd an Advantagious Match with the Princeſs of <hi>Spain</hi> under an Obligation, containing the moſt bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clauſes the Law could afford, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd with the moſt dreadful Oaths, that neither he nor his Succeſſors would make any claim of Inheritance to the Kingdoms or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> he was now contrary to his Promiſe, and the Treaty making War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Monarchy. That he laboured to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Peace with <hi>Portugal,</hi> in order to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he might the more eaſily ſeize upon that Crown, in caſe the Succeſſion ſhould fail; That he might with the ſame injuſtice attempt the Conqueſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> under the ſame Pretext that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in breaking with <hi>Spain, viz.</hi> its not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Power to Defraude his Succeſſors of their Right. That though he now oppos'd King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Right to that Crown, he would doubtleſs make uſe of it hereafter as a Colour for his unjuſt Invaſion. That the Prince did not make the League with <hi>France,</hi> which as 'twas Notorious, was clapt up upon ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Deſigns without the Peoples conſent. That if the King of <hi>France</hi> could make War upon <hi>Caſtille,</hi> on pretence of his want of Power to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54374:181"/>
deprive his Heirs of the Succeſſion belonging to them, with how much greater Reaſon was the Prince oblig'd not to deny his People the Bleſſings of an Advantageous and Honourable Peace, after a cruel War of Seven and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, which had hitherto been carried on for that end only? That if Self-defence made the War be hitherto accounted Juſt, yet when it could be continued upon no other Pretence, then the Conqueſt of other Kingdoms, to which neither <hi>Portugal</hi> nor <hi>France</hi> had any Right, it would become unjuſt, diſpleaſing to God, and conſequently unproſperous. In Concluſion, he declared that his Powers were reſtrained to a limited time, for that Spring coming on, the Queen Regent was about diſpoſing of her Forces as ſhe ſhould judge convenient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſired that the Prince would appoint Perſons to confer with him, about the Treaty of Peace, or elſe he ſhould look upon himſelf as diſingag'd from his Commiſſion, leaving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince's Conſcience, all the Miſchiefs of the War, with the Damages and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies ſuſtain'd by the Priſoners, who fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gaols at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Paper Combat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had all the Advantage they could deſire, unleſs it were among ſuch as either out of Intereſt or for ſome ſecret Reaſons, were for having the War continue. The Officers of the Army would fain have had it proſecuted with Vigour, that <hi>Portugal</hi> by the Conqueſt of the Neighbouring Kingdoms, might re-imbourſe it ſelf for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages it had ſuſtained in the Sixty Years of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Uſurpation. The Eccleſiaſticks, the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſoens,</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:54374:181"/>
and the People were more Loud and Clamourous for a Peace, as thinking the War would become Unjuſt if it continued any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it being the common Voice to be heard at that time, from the Pulpits, and in the Streets, that <hi>Caſtille</hi> might have ſome Pretenſions upon <hi>Portugal,</hi> but <hi>Portugal</hi> could have none upon <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille.</hi> But the Court held out ſtill, as being or ſeeming at leaſt to be, utterly againſt the Peace, and that poſſibly becauſe the Prince thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oblig'd by the <hi>French</hi> League; perhaps the Queen might be afraid to diſoblige <hi>France</hi> by conſenting to the Peace, while the Cauſe of her Divorce and of her intended ſecond Marriage was depending before that Court; for ſhould that Court be diſſatisfied with her Conduct, who could tell, but that Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> might never have found out the Clauſe in the Pope's Bull, which at laſt inabled Cardinal <hi>Vendome</hi> to grant the Diſpenſation?</p>
               <p>This Buſineſs was hotly debated on both ſides, when the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> unexpectedly arrived at <hi>Lisbon</hi> from <hi>Madrid,</hi> with full Power from the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Queen Regent of <hi>Spain</hi> to conclude the Peace. His Excellency by his Preſence and Authority, ſoon put an end to the Diſpute, for by this time, they that were for the Treaty, had made their Party ſo ſtrong, that nothing could withſtand them; the <hi>Cortes</hi> plyed the Prince with three ſeveral Addreſſes for a Peace, and upon his demurring, to give his Anſwer. The <hi>Juis do Povo</hi> came and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily demanded his Conſent. The <hi>Juis</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe on the Earl, and upon his Knees aſſured his Excellency of the Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54374:182"/>
of the People, in all his Proceedings, and as 'tis ſaid, he went to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador likewiſe, to aſſure him, that in caſe he did any thing to obſtruct the Peace, he muſt expect to have his Houſe pulled down about his Ears. In ſhort, the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> by his prudent Management, ſo order'd the Matter, that in a very few daies all things were adjuſted; for his Powers given him at <hi>Madrid,</hi> bear Date the Fifth of <hi>January,</hi> 1668. and the Peace was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and Sign'd the Thirteenth of <hi>February</hi> following, to the unſpeakable Joy of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concern'd. By this Peace the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> became an Independant People, and were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſame Condition with reſpect to <hi>Spain,</hi> as they had been in under the moſt flouriſhing Reigns of their former Kings; at the ſame time when their Deliverance from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke was compleated, they were ſet at liberty likewiſe from the <hi>French</hi> League, which might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the more intolerable Bondage of the two, and all this without being brought under any Engagements to their Deliverers, the obligations of Gratitude excepted: Thoſe indeed are the ſtrongeſt of all other Tyes upon generous Minds, but then they are often complied with by a bare Acknowledgment of the Benefits receiv'd.</p>
               <p>Having mention'd the Benefits conferr'd on the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation by ours, it may be expected that an Account ſhould be given of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from them. It muſt be acknowledg'd to their Honour, that on ſeveral occaſions they ſhow'd a generous concern for our Kings <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and Second in their Diſtreſs, doing them many good Offices by their Miniſters, both
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54374:182"/>
in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, and that they gave a Hoſpitable Reception to the Princes <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> in their Port of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> though they were like to ſuffer no ſmall Damage thereby them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the Remembrance of which things proved no doubt a great Motive to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to take them into his Protection. But as to Returns in Kind, thanks be to God, our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was never in a condition to need them, and the Forces of <hi>Portugal</hi> are ſo limited, that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can be expected from thence, upon any the moſt urgent Occaſion. Their Concurrence indeed might have ſerv'd to a good purpoſe, in the Leagues that have been made of late againſt the common Enemy, if on no other account, but the conveniency of their Habours, which in a War by Sea, muſt have been of a mighty Advantage to the ſide they adhered to: But they thought it was for their Intereſt all along to continue Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and our Princes have not thought fit to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige them to Declare, though in Defence of the common Liberty, in which they had as great a concern as others. We ſuffered them to enjoy the Benefit of Trade, which we loſt our ſelves, while we were engaged in their Defence; we did not make the leaſt offer to compel them to take Party while they were wholly at our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, we being Lords of all the Seas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, the Ocean and the Mediterranean, as well as our own Channel. Such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion would have been to deſtroy our own Gift, and take from them that Independency we had maintain'd them in. It is the Property of another Monarch to treat as his Vaſſals ſuch Sovereigns as he takes into his his Protection;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54374:183"/>
to get them into his Power, by aſſiſting them, and then to ſerve himſelf of them in working out the Ruin of their Neighbours, and their own among the reſt, whereas our Princes have taken another Courſe, and far from making their Benefits uneaſy to the Receivers, or ſnares to entrap them withal, have treated them as Sovereigns whom they raiſed to their own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and therefore notwithſtanding their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſo much greater Power, they have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd from every thing that carried the leaſt appearance of Conſtraint, as thinking it beneath themſelves to require ſuch a Submiſſion even to their juſt demands, as might leſſen the Majeſty of a Crown'd Head.</p>
               <p>Such a generous Proceeding muſt needs have wrought very much upon a Prince of ſo great a Soul, as his <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Majeſty is known to have, and laid ſtronger Obligations upon him than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſiderations could have done; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have not met with a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treatment in his Kingdom, the Fault ought to be laid wholly on his Miniſters and Inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. If the Priviledges of our Countrymen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in <hi>Portugal,</hi> granted and confirmed by ſo many of his Royal Anceſtors, and ratified by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Treaties, have of late Years been either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly violated, or eluded by all the little Arts of <hi>Chicane,</hi> if during the laſt War his Maritime Towns that were almoſt the only Ports in Chriſtendom left free and exempt from our Dominion, became Neſts for <hi>French</hi> privateers, and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pyrates, if by Reaſon of our Religious obſervation of the Peace with <hi>Portugal,</hi> theſe Corſairs found a ſafer retreat at <hi>Lisbon, O Porto,</hi> and <hi>Faro,</hi> than at <hi>Merſeilles,</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:54374:183"/>
St. <hi>Maloes,</hi> or <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and our Merchant Fleets were more infeſted upon the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Coaſts than thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> or in the <hi>Straights,</hi> if our Ships taken under their Caſtles, and in their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, were carried up and diſpos'd of in ſight of the King's Palace; whereas by an expreſs Article in our Capitulations, all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever taken, when brought into any of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> Dominions, were to be reſtored to the right Owners, and laſtly, if on theſe and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions, a greater regard was had to the <hi>French</hi> Menaces, when they could do nothing elſe but threaten, than to our Complaints, while we had the Remedy in our own hands; if any of theſe things were ſo, the Blame ought ſurely to be laid wholly upon the Miniſters, to whom the King as hath been ſaid, defers ſo much in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs, a Prince of his <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Majeſties Honour, Juſtice and Prudence, cannot be ſuppoſed to have had any part in ſuch unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Proceedings; but whether any of theſe things were ſo, it belongs to the Perſons more nearly concern'd to make out. In matters which fall more immediately under the common obſervation our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traders reſiding in that Kingdom, have great cauſe to be ſatisfy'd with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation, where they are treated with all the Reſpect and Civility they can look for, by a People who cannot be inſenſible of the great Advantage that our Trade brings to their Conntry; for we furniſh them with Neceſſaries of Life, in exchange for Supplies to our Luxury: We Cloath them with our Woollen Manufactures, and Feed them in a great Meaſure with our Fiſh from <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and in Exchange for theſe Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54374:184"/>
we rid the Country of their Wines (and that at exceſſive Rates) which all of the wiſer and better ſort among them think much better parted with at any rate, than kept at home, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having provided them a more wholſome and agreeable Liquor. But it is not only the Benefit of Trade that recommends our Countrymen to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> their fair and generous Dealing in their Commerce, uſed to gain them ſuch Credit, that <hi>Palavra de bum Ingrez,</hi> the Word of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man hath been taken for the beſt Security; its true, that in the Inland Parts, the horrid Ideas the People had of Hereticks, as they take us to be, made them look upon our Countrymen as a ſtrange ſort of Monſters, inſomuch that when our little Army firſt march'd into the Country, the Peaſants inſtead of bleſſing them as their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, would watch for opportunities to do a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Straglers; but the firſt Campagne end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they found them to be quite another ſort of Creatures than they had imagined, and began not only to take them for Men, but for ſomething more, finding them to be as Peaceable and Gentle in their Quarters, as they had been Fierce in the Field; for inſtead of Domineering over their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, and playing the Tyrants as the <hi>French</hi> men did, our Soldiers ſpent their time in ſerving the People they were quarter'd upon, and doing any Work that was needful in the Family; ſuch an obliging Carriage in Men, whoſe Bravery they had ſo much cauſe to admire, ſo alter'd their Sentiments concerning theſe Hereticks, that ſhould an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man travel in the moſt unfrequented Parts of the Country, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name hath been ſcarce heard of, either before or ſince the War, he ſhall
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54374:184"/>
be received and careſs'd with all the welcome the poor People can make, when a <hi>French</hi> man ſhall run the Riſque of being knock'd o'the Head. I have mention'd this matter the rather, becauſe the Manners of our Countrymen ſeem to be ſo much changed of late Years, that perhaps it will be as great News to them, as any thing I have related, for poſſibly the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> may differ much from the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in their Opinion concerning our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiery.</p>
               <p>The common People about the City are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be guilty of any Rudeneſs towards the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on account of their Religion; ſuch as have had cauſe to think themſelves moſt expoſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts on this occaſion, having never met with any, which in my Opinion, ought in Juſtice to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the Humanity of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation, after they have been a little converſant with us, as well as to the Prudence of the Government. It is true, that opprobrious Language to Strangers is ſo ſeverely prohibited, that upon complaint made againſt any that ſhall call an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man Heretick, no puniſhment ſhort of Death, or the Galleys, will be thought too great for the Offence. We had like to have ſeen the laſt Year an example of the King's Juſtice upon an Offender of this ſort; a certain Lawyer in his Pleadings, was pleaſed to beſtow upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Titles of Hereticks, Lutherans, Schiſmaticks, Excommunicated Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Complaint hereof being made to His Majeſty, he gave command that the Lawyer ſhould be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, in order to his further Chaſtiſement; the Man took Sanctuary in the Church, but it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Council, that his Crime was of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Church could not protect him, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54374:185"/>
an Order was given out to force him thence, but the Criminal as I have been told ſince died ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo put a ſtop to further Proceedings. And this makes me almoſt aſtoniſhed at the Hardineſs of the Inquiſitors, who in the preceding Year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1697. took an occaſion to publiſh an Edict in all Churches, which is to be ſeen at this day on moſt of the Church Doors. (I am ſure it was not long ago, and is like to remain for many Years as other Orders of the Inquiſition that ſtand by it have done, it being Excommunication to take them down) wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in general are Stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, not only for Hereticks, but for Uſurpers likewiſe; but this is an Offence of too heinous a Nature for a private Perſon to animadvert upon, and therefore I ſhall content my ſelf with having only mention'd it.</p>
