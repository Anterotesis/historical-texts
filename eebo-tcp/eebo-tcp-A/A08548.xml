            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There did they both shew their inestimable forces, and passing nimblenesse of bodie, in this cruell and daungerous encountering.

The Emperour not to séeme daunted with any thing, but to make a more apparaunt shew of his valour, he commaunded his huntsmen to continue the sport, and in outward semblance séemed to be so merrie as euer he was, wheras in truth he was secretly wringed, for the excéeding great passion which he sawe the lady <hi>Claridiana</hi> indure, for the sodeine absence of him who was newly married vnto her, &amp; had begotten her with childe. After thrée daies were passed, they were desirous to returne to the Citie againe, and taking vp their tents, they layde all thinges in order, and in readinesse to procéede on theyr iourney. But as they began to martch on theyr waie, they might perceiue comming a long by the Forrest side a Coach, all couered ouer with blacke Searge, which foure horses did drawe, trapped with such like blacke furniture.

And being plunged in this pansiue moode, he entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest degree of his melancholike passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, debating w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> himself, why shuld it not be possible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his mightie hand shold conquere &amp; subdue one silly Knight. But other somtimes descending from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moode into a more mad &amp; frantick kind of behauiour, this disturbed Moore did bend himselfe towards the midst of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wood, &amp; kéee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on his right hand, he repaired towards the brink of a broad &amp; deepe riuer which ran by that wood, where he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to ease his wearie lims: and the better to performe his desire, he vnlaced his helmet, and hurlde it scornfully to the ground. Now the infernall furies began to visite the Moore, and attended to sting his poysoned breasts, in such sort, that what with desire of reuenge, and sorrow for his late mishap, he was all kindeled in fire, hauing tossed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thoughts in his crabbed minde.
In the end, he cast vp his wretched eyes to the heauens, saieng:<q> O ye trecherous Gods, ioyn in league to defend your selues from mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate hand, stay not, but muster your forces together, for if mine owne hand in the meane while be no impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the cause, by pulling out my heart, I will change the colour of these christalline waters with the Sacrifices of your bloud: for no doubt there resteth more valour in this one knigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After he had thus spoken, forthwith he began to pull in sunder his strong &amp; bright shining armor, &amp; what with outragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

or with sorow which did greatly gall him, he cast from him one péece héere, another there: &amp; blaspheming against al his Gods, he sayd:

Hauing thus said, he cast it in the déepest part of the riuer, not hauing any more weapons but a poore poynado, which vsually he did weare about him: &amp; taking it in his hand, deliuered these speaches vnto it.<q> Thou silly bodkin shalt finish y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> péece of worke, which all Christendome was neuer able at anie time to beginne, I meane in bereauing me of my wearie &amp; lingering lyfe, for I aboue all men onely deserue to léese it, séeing that I béeing the sonne of so valiant a Father, haue not shewed anie sparke of that valour which by right ought to descend to mée from mine auncestour, sith then I haue digressed, I repute my selfe vnworthie to be registred for his sonne.

After she had seene the great ouerthrowe of hyr Knights, with an angry countenaunce she turned hir to the Knight and sayd:

               <p>The sight of these strange deuises made the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince verie pensiue, and caused him to meruaile much at the great art that was vsed in the framing héereof, it was so dainetely handeled. But in the meane time that these two Princes were thus musing and beholding these straunge things, the shippe slyst the Seas, with a braue gale of winde, and carried them so swiftly that when they called to minde the straungenesse héereof they were greatly astonished. In this wise they sayled sixe dayes, not knowing whether they went, nor whether the shippe would carrie them: neyther could they see anie lande, but they were assured of this, that they were directed by the will of the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo.</hi> And sayled not towarde <hi>Dacia,</hi> whereat the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> was greatly discomforted, but this griefe was somewhat stayed by the gentle perswasions which the knight of the Sunne vsed.</p>
               <p>After the long and wearisome trauaile which these two noble Princes sustained, one morning by the péepe of the daie, they did discouer not farre from the place where they were, the lande, towardes which coast the Shippe say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amaine, the Knightes verye ioyfull héereof beganne to arme themselues, with set purpose to land there. Not long after the shippe came to the shoare with such a bottome rush, sticking fast in the sandes, that they thought shée had bene slit in sunder. Which sodaine chaunce made them with all spéede to leape to the lande, assuring themselues that the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> had ordeined the staie to be made there, wherefore without tarrying anie longer, they tooke theyr horses and mounted vppon them, and presently after the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> made proofe of the goodnesse of his horse, which was sent him by the wise man, and broching his sides with the Spurres, hée founde him verye readye, strong, and light.

               <p>These valiant knights not meaning to sléepe out the daie, they vndertooke theyr iourny, and in trauailing they came to a narrowe and straight lane which lead them by the foote of a huge and stéepe mountaine, they had not long rid, but they entered into a broade and rough path, alwayes hoping that the countrey would prooue very pleasaunt and well shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ride in: but after they had tolde all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Trauailing onwardes they found that this croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked waie was diuided into two broade lanes: And then bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a doubt which waie they might take, stood still, and in the end they did determine betwéene them to make a diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the one to take the right hand, and the other the left. And thus these two valiaunt knightes parted the waie betweene them both, béeing right sorrowfull that theyr late acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was so vntimely separated by a crooked lane. The one hauing lost the sight of the other, they rode very sadly, and the Knight of the Sunne trauailed all that daye, and could not happen vpon any path that might guide him to some towne or Uillage. The night wrapping hir selfe in her browne Mantell, made the Grecian alight from his <hi>Cornerino,</hi> nigh vnto a faire Forrest and gréene meddowe, adorned with all sweete and smelling flowers, and pulling of his bridle he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to féed in the gréene medow.

he slept vntil such time as the graie morning with the notes of the swéet singing birds awaked him. This valiant Prince béeing start vp, returned vnto his new begun iourney, &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed so long, that at the last he came to a verie faire and cleare riuer, and going along by the brinke of the same hée beheld, howe by reason of the calme winde that did blowe, there did arise manye small bubbles in the water, the sight whereof did greatly delight him, vntil such time as he discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the same certaine little streames and droppes of bloud, at the view wherof he was striken into a meruaiolus admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the farther he went, the streames did more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew forth the skarlet coulour thereof, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cléere and christalline water had lost his naturall coulour, &amp; was changed into a crimosin, which strange and vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted case procured the noble knight of the Sunne to bée halfe amazed, and meruailed greatly whereof should procéede such abundance of this bloudie water. And hauing an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to knowe the head spring of the riuer, and the occasion thereof, he caused his horse to hast his pase somewhat more fast, alwaies hauing an eie to the waie from whence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die streames descended, but in the end he lost the sight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by reason of a little hill which was betwéene him and the riuer, and there he was constrained to take another path, which did leade him vnto the toppe of the saide hill, which in truth was not farre distaunt from the brooke or Riuer, And when he came to the toppe of this hill, he beheld there a piller of Marble stone artificiallye wrought and firmelye fixed in the ground. Upon the highest part of the piller, there was fastened a chaine, whereat hanged a very faire table of Cipers woode, and therein was written certayne wordes, which this noble Knight began to read, the contents were as followeth.</p>

                  <q>This countrey wherein thou now art, is that auncient and famous kingdome of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> which not long since, was gouerned by one of the most puissaunt Kings that euer raigned therein, or in any Prouince héereabout: but death, by his accustomed furie, depriued him of his life, and all his loyall subiects, of a vertuous and louing Lord, leauing the guiding of the Kingdome, in the power of two very fayre and Angelicall damosels, his daughters, who represented the former vertues of their noble &amp; late deceased father.

And in such sort they mainteined the wars, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in small time they put the citie in great perill to be lost, and likewise the whole kingdome.

Oh my louing subiects, by you I am constrayned to surrender my selfe vnto him, who cannot chuse but intreate you ill, and indamage my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which thing is contrarie to all our expectations: in consideration whereof, I am héere constrained with my own trembling hande, to cut off the florishing braunches of these my dayes: for this I sweare vnto you my deare and faithful subiects, that I had rather offer my soule into the societie &amp; sacred bosome of <hi>Diana,</hi> than to yéelde my selfe vnto this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed figure. And thou King of <hi>Sardenna,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest tyrant amongst tyraunts, beholde héere I yeeld vnto thée my body to vse according to thy will and pleasure, requesting onely this one thing of thée, (if ther be any pitie or mercie in thée) considering that thou inioyest that which thy heart desired, that thou sufferest these my louing subiects to liue in peace, wherefore come now I say, and receiue that which is thine. And thou O chast <hi>Diana,</hi> accept likewise that which with so much bloud I offer vnto thee. And in finishing this sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull speach, she drewe out a faire and bright shining sword, which she had hidden secretly vnder her gowne, and putting the hilte vpon the scaffolde, (little looked for of all those that were present) she sodaynly threwe hir selfe vppon the poynt of the sayd sword, so that not all that were there, could deliuer hir, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poynt passed through hir body in such sort, (as thou dost see heere by this figure portratured) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

What should I héere declare the lamentable sorowes and pitifull lamentation that was there made for this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie mischaunce, committed in the sight of all the people, I say it was such that the woodes eccoed, and their pitifull shrikes ascended to the heauens: but none was more galled with griefe, then the afflicted Giant, who rose vp, and like a man distraught fomed at the mouth, and roaring with horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cries lyke an infernall creature, in great furie he rushed amongst the people throwing them downe on euerie side, till he came vpon the scaffolde, and approching to the dead body of the damosell, he tooke hir in his armes, and with a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fearfull voyce he sayd. Oh my beloued ioy and earst my onely hearts delight. Is this the desired sacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in through thy desperatenes thou hast deceiued me? who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thée more then my selfe.

sooner had he deliuered these speaches, incensed with furie, he set his hand to his sword, &amp; ouerthrew the image of <hi>Diana,</hi> that was there, &amp; parted it in two parts: and yet not content with this sacriligious fact, he descended from the scaffolde, exclaiming against the sorrowfull <hi>Tinacrian</hi> people, and sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: O villaines and traitors, it is not possible but that all you were consenting vnto this cruell fact, and determined euil. And vttering these and such like reasons, in his diuelish furie, he began to flourish with his sword cutting, killing, and wounding on euery side, with such vnmercifull crueltie, that in a small time there did not remaine one of all them, that were there present, but I alone: and by reason that I was one of the Priests of <hi>Diana,</hi> he saued my life, although he little esteemed it. Then when this fierce and bloudie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell did sée that all were slaine, and that we two onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, he tooke the dead Quéene in his armes, &amp; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to follow him with my praiers and orisons accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto <hi>Diana,</hi> and bringing hir to this place, he strayght wayes commaunded this Chappell to be buylded, in this order as you now sée, and promised by vowe vnto all the Gods, to sacrifice euery wéeke sixe persons, naturally borne in the lande of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> thrée men, and thrée women, in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the bloudie sacrifice that they consented to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by their deceased Quéene.

And in this sorte doo these two hell-houndes exercise themselues in this detestable murder, insomuch that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is almost left desolate, and there remaineth verye fewe which doth maintaine the warres. And you shall vnderstand moreouer (gentle Knight) that the Citie is so strong, that it is not possible to win the same, neither by force of armes, neither by hunger or any other ingen, for that it is so well furnished with munition and vittailes: yet in the citie there are but a small number of Knights, which for their great fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie

The noble Prince which with strange attension gaue care vnto this sorowfull Priest, béeing fullye determined to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture his lyfe for to violate this cruell and wicked cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, answered, (not according to the counsell the which he gaue him, but according vnto his couragious determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) saying. Friend, where is (I beséech thée) the abiding of this vnmercifull giant, &amp; which is the way y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leadeth thether. The old Priest replied, His Castle is two leagues distaunt from this temple: but what shall it auaile thée to know the same? &amp; what profit wilt thou get by going thether, but only death: but if thou wilt néedes aduenture thy selfe, the same which brought thée hether, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> direct way thether, for other there is none. Moreouer, the valiant prince demanded of him if he could aduertise him how many knights &amp; what store of people the Gyant had about him, and he aunswered that the most part of them that wer about him were seruants, &amp; that all the rest of his knightes and men of warre, were placed in other castles and fortes of the Iland. And while they were occupied in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, they heard without the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell horsemen, as it appeared by the treading and noyse of their horses. Wherefore to vnderstand what they were, they staid their talk, &amp; the prince issued out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chappell, where he found sixe knights, armed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> verie good &amp; strong armor, who were alighting from their horses to enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chappel, but
<pb facs="tcp:13973:35"/>
when these knightes espyed the Prince so well proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and of so good disposition, &amp; with his armour of strange deuice contrarie vnto theirs, then one of those sixe knightes which séemed to haue more authoritie then the rest, sayd. Oh Knight, what infernall furie hath hardned thée to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hether, knowing the custome which is vsed héere. But it séemeth vnto me that rather ignorance is the occasion héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, more then anie other thing, wherefore I am content to let thée depart againe vpon condition, that thou leauest with me thy armour and thy horse (if it be thine to giue) for that they doo greatly delight me. This valiant Prince dissembling his anger, with a very merrie and smiling countenance made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</p>
               <p>You haue sayd true, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignorance hath brought me hether, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am a straunger in this countrie, and neuer vnderstood that anie such crueltie hath ben vsed héere till now, that this good olde man hath tolde mée. But to giue thée my armour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not determined at this time, for that I am not accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to trauaile without it.

They vnderstanding the wordes which the Prince aunswered vnto them, one of the sixe knights pretending more hardinesse then all the rest, replyed. I will sée how thou canst defend thy horse, and with that he went to laie hande on the horse bridle, which he had not so soone proffered, when the fierce horse opened his mouth and with great furie he caught him by the shoulder, and lift him vp from the ground, and in his fall he all to trampled &amp; troade him in péeces, and so slew him.

I am afraide that if in this sort you battayle with my horse, he will in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all danger of the losse of my armour. Then this other knight hearing these wordes, which he tooke to be a greate reproch vnto him, béeing almost ouercom with anger, in a great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and rage he drew out his sword, and flourishing it about his head, he saide. The greate outrage which thy horse hath héere done, (as I before said) thou shalt spéedely repay with the losse of thy lyfe, and vttering these words, he smote the Prince vppon the helme so vehemently and with such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that the very sparkes of fire sprong out, &amp; fell burning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. This noble prince féeling y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> blowe not looked for, determined that that miserable knight should not go vnpaied for his good deede, least he should praise himselfe for dooing it, but with great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tourning to another, at one blowe he parted his shéeld in péeces, &amp; cut off his arme fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his shulder. Then the other knight which remained aliue, séeing his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions to be so ill intreated by one only knight, thought it best to saue his life by trusting to his legs, rather then to repose any confidence in his prowesse, for that hée
<pb facs="tcp:13973:36"/>
thought it would little preuaile him, and betaking him to his feete, he fledde awaie: Of whome this noble Prince made small account, but let him go, the olde priest of whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoke, was present and beheld all that had happened, and meruailed verie much at the great prowesse of the vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Knight. And this noble Prince seeing himselfe cléere of them that would haue done him wrong, retourned vnto the Priest and asked him if he hadde anie thing that he might eate, and requested him to let him haue it, for that he hunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and had great néede thereof.

But this worthie Gréeke in the meane time that the Gyant spoke these wordes did contemplate himselfe in beholding the huge making and the greate strength that did appeare hée hadde by the proportion of his members. And placing his words with great discreation he answered
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13973:36"/>
and sayd. I come to demand battaile of thée O King, not for that thou hast at anie time gréeued mée, or giuen mee cause, but onelye to take awaye and frustrate (if it bée possible) this euill and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

where out issued the Gyant at all pointes armed with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie rich armour of fine stéele, and vppon his right shoulder a great clubbe barred with yron of a huge weight, and at his girdell a verie bigge and broade swoord, and about his necke there hanged a rich and strong Shielde, whereon was portratured the same deuise which he sawe on the Altar in the Chappell. In his demeanour, he showed himselfe to bée valiant, and with a gentle countenaunce he came towardes the place whereas the Knight abode.
All this, the noble and courteous <hi>Greeke</hi> did stedfastly beholde, and prayed God, that of his mercie he would abolish this euill custome that he did maintaine, and that he would giue him grace to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his error wherein he had transgressed, and that he might be conuerted vnto the knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true faith, for that it was great pitie, to sée so much crueltie remaine, in so noble &amp; worthie a personage, as he was, or in so well proportioned a bodie as he séemed to haue, and thus this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prince remained in beholding his personage till such time as the Gyaunt drew nigh vnto him, who without shewing anie defiaunce or countenaunce of pride, saide. <q>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue (gentle Knight) that this my presence hath put thée in some feare of my force, therfore for that thou séemest to be a knight well disposed &amp; of great valor, I yeelde vnto thée the battaile.

hée was perswaded, that hée was descended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to make that combat with him, whereby to worke his destruction.

Then the Giant séeing himselfe in such a pickle, threw his shielde from him to the ground, and with both his handes tooke his great cutting sword, &amp; heauing it aloft, he let it fall with such wonderfull furie, that it was verye straunge to beholde. But this politike Prince séeing on which part this terrible blowe would fall, determined not to receiue it, but with a light leape did cléere himselfe from the fall thereof, the which fell to the grounde with so greate and terrible hast, that the halfe of it entred into the earth, and by reason that the stroke was giuen more of anger then of cunning, by the great strength that he put to it, he could not keepe himselfe, but was forced with the stroke to fall with his breast vpon the pommell of his sword. He was no sooner downe, but the Sonne of <hi>Trebatio</hi> gaue him another vpon his helme, that it sounded as though he had stroke vpon a bell, wherewith the Giant fell flat to the ground, greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished, and almost beside himselfe.

The Giant which was then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what recouered, caught holde vpon the skirt of his harnesse, and pulled the Knight towards him with such strength, that he was not able to make resistaunce, but néedes he must go whether his strong arme carried him.

This wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie knight then placing the point of his swoorde vppon the grounde, and leaning his arme vppon the crosse of the hilte, not making anie outward apperaunce of wearinesse that he had in this battaile, with an amiable countenaunce he sayd.</p>

easie and apparant to be séene and perceiued. Tell me I praie thée that if at anie time thy Gods haue in their owne causes had anie power or defence? no surely, for if they had, then would not they haue suffered themselues to bée so ill intreated of them who should worship and serue them, for if at anie time your Gods doe not graunt vnto your requests, and performe that which you would haue them doo, then you beginne to curse and to banne them, and speake the worst that may be spoken of them, and some of them you throwe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire and burne, and other some you pull out of their Tabernacles, and tread them vnder your féete and polute them, and presently you leaue them and chaunge them for other new Gods, and vnto them you doe your worshippe till such time as they likewise fulfill not what you aske of them, and yet these poore and infortunate Gods are in no fault, for that at anie time they cannot helpe themselues, but doeth burne in the pit of hell. So that it commeth of a great sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wilt beléeue in the diuell, who is the authour of all euill, and forget the creator of all thinges, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thée this thy strength and prowesse, and will deliuer thée in all thy necessities. Oh king thou shouldest not néede any other proofe, but onely that which thou thy selfe diddest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the image of <hi>Diana.</hi> For in thy anger thou diddest throw it downe and cut it with thy swoord, and diddest vnto it all the euill that thou couldest, so that if they had had anie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thinkest thou then they woulde haue suffered that thou shouldest haue offered this outrage vnto them, no I tell thée thou mightst not haue bene once so hardie as to haue moued against them. </q>The Gyant who then was somwhat touched with the truth, sayd.</p>

The Gyaunt when he sawe his face discouered, he much meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to sée the great beautie of that Prince, and tooke him fast by the hande, and departed towardes the Castell, reasoning with him of diuerse matters by the waie, And when hée came to the Castell, he straight wayes commaunded that a shippe shoulde bée made in a readinesse with all kinde of furniture belonging to it, for that without anie delaie he would prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his voyage, and so curing himselfe of the small wounds which he hadde, which did a little trouble him, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded straight that they should bring him somwhat to eate, for that it was néedfull, as well for the great trauaile he had in the former battaile, as also for the losse of so much bloud which ranne out of his woundes. And when he hadde ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and dined according to his desire, without anye more delaie or further resting himselfe he stayed not so much as to pull off his harnesse, but departed out of the Castell, and entered presently into the Shippe, and without taking

               <p>This dolorous Knight could not procéede forwards with this musicke begunne, by reason of a Damzell, which was in that place vnknowen vnto him, and therefore vnlooked for, who with a softe and milde voyce saluted him, and this Knight retourned hir againe the courtesie she offered. Then this Damosell right sorrowfully said. It doth well appeare sir Knight that thou doest not knowe howe néere thou art vnto the perill of death, considering that so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all care thou art publishing these thy passions of loue. Unto whom he aunswered and said.</p>

                  <q>I doo knowe verye well faire Ladie, that alwayes I

beare about me a deadly perill. But alas, how can I helpe that, although this occasion hath brought me into such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, considering that it is so ordained. But to what end faire Damosell, you haue vttered these wordes, I am as yet altogether ignoraunt, wherefore I would be very glad to knowe somewhat, whereby I might haue occasion to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get these thoughts, &amp; to bring my selfe in care of some new defence. Then this Damosell drewe nigh to him and said, Thou shalt vnderstand sir Knight, that this Countrie in which thou art, is the olde and auncient Kingdome of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacria,</hi> whose happie dayes, which in times past it had, are now abated, and the great felicitie thereof is turned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. Then this Damosell did relate vnto him, all the whole storie that you haue heard, which the olde Priest told vnto the Knight of the Sunne his Cousin: but the great sorrow that he receiued in the hearing of so great crueltie, constrained a fewe salt teares to fall from his eyes, from the which he could not refraine. And procéeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forwardes in hir talke, she said, You shall vnderstand sir Knight, that I am a Damosell belonging to the Countesse of <hi>Modica,</hi> who is nowe in companie with the vertuous Quéene <hi>Garofilea,</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Sarragosa,</hi> héere in the lande of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> by whom I was sent about certaine businesse, and came nowe from thence.</q>
Uerely, the hearing of this terrible and heauie historie, did verie much cause this noble Knight to lament, &amp; compelled his hart to earne, although on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce very much, for that now in the beginning of his knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, he might imploie himselfe and his valiant courage in such terrible conflictes, whereby he might winne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a renowmed name and reporte, if so it please God that he may goe forward with this enterprise. So he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with himselfe, to loose his lyfe in this quarrell, or else to set the same Citie at libertie, although hée gaue not the Damosell to vnderstand anie thing concerning this his intent, who in the end of many good reasons and pittifull perswasions that shée vsed in coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He had not ridden farre when he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Citie, which was meruailously adorned with To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers and fortresses, but yet round about it was to be séene a meruailous and dolorous spectacle of dead men and women torne in péeces, and others hanged by the necke vppon Iyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets hard by the walls, and some vpon trées which were in the field nigh at hand, which caused the Prince to stay, and to sigh with great sorrow and teares in the beholding of so inhumane crueltie, and in bitternesse of heart he said,
<q>O Lord how wonderfull be thy secrets, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou sufferest this Knight to vse so great crueltie without punishing of him, it cannot be without some great mysterie which thy diuine Maiestie doth pretend. I beseech thée (O Lorde) to giue me so much grace and strength, that I may cause this great crueltye to be taken away, and vtterly to cease. O noble Citie, I cannot iudge what anger fortune should receiue of thée, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth thou shouldest be subiect vnto such vnmercifull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so much without pitie and compassion. Well, I maye say, that as <hi>Grecia</hi> may brag hir selfe of most excellent, wise &amp; learned men which it hath brought vp, euen so maist thou complaine, that against thée hath bene fostered two terrible and abhominable tyrants. And in saieng these wordes: hee drew nigh the gates of the Citie, which for feare of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of the Giant, they kept shut, &amp; taking hold at the ring
<pb facs="tcp:13973:44"/>
therof he began to knock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had not so soone done, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lifting vp his eyes, he beheld to descend from aboue out of a bulwarke a great frée stone which was cast downe by the hands of a Gentlewoman, which came so sodainly, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most had no time to deliuer himselfe from receiuing the fall the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But when this Gentlewoman sawe that the stone fell downe without doing anie harme, with a gréeuous and terrible sigh that procéeded from her heart, she sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Art thou that cursed <hi>Tefereo,</hi> through whose cause the most part of the mournfull matrones of this distressed Citie are made widowes, and with great affliction are inforced to bewaile the losse of their louing husbandes and welbeloued sonnes? Art thou he that doth not onely content thy selfe to kill them and teare them in péeces, but also hangest them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, and garnishest the walls of this our vnhappie Citie with the bodies of them? Art thou that sonne of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, which without all feare of the Gods hath put our Citie in this extreame necessitie? Oh cruell tyrant, open the eyes of thy vnderstanding, and let some sparke of pittie reigne in thy heart, and suffer not that for thy cause onely so worthie a Countrie as this is should be destroied? Let it suffice thée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast alreadie bene the occasion that all these noble ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of this Citie, haue lost their rest &amp; forgot their estate, and are nowe become as scowtes in the warres, and frame themselues to weare armour.</q>
This gentle knight of <hi>Dacia</hi> would not suffer her to procéede anie farther, but cut off her tale, and with greate sobernesse he sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Gentlewoman, I am not he that you take me for, but I come hether rather (if so bée I maie) by some meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your rest, &amp; deliuer you from this outrage that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you. Then this gentlewoman with much more anger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. O traitour, doest thou thinke that by thy treasons and subtiltyes to increase our care more then hetherto thou hast done?

The good will which hath brought mée hether, gentle mistresse, aunswered <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> doeth not deserue to be thus ill intreated of you, who for to procure your libertie will put his life in aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I suppose I doe deserue better enterteinement at your handes. Well, let it be what it will bée, sayd this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but touching thy comming into the Citie, it is laboure lost to speake, neuerthelesse if thou art not that cruell knight whom I did take thée for, turne thée about and looke towards the corner of yonder towre, which standeth amongest the gréene trees, and there thou shalt finde him, whom I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue without séeking for thou bringest with thée, &amp; </q>so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie more speaking this Gentlewoman went from the wall, and left this knight alone. Then the Prince <hi>Don Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> séeing himselfe alone, tooke the waie which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman shewed him, wherein he had not trauailed farre, but in the middest of a groaue amongest a companie of gréene trées, he sawe a verie faire house and well wrought, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto when he approched he found that the gates were shut and closed verie fast.
And drawing nigh the gate, he tooke the ring in his hand and gaue a greate stroke, at the sounde whereof there looked a man out of a windowe of the same house, and by the riches of the armour that the Knight ware, he knew that he was none of their companie, but said vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Who art thou that art so hardie béeing a straunger, which without feare doest call at the gate, whereas thou canst not escape, but must of necessitie suffer death. Friend aunswered this <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight, goe thy wayes and tell thy Lorde <hi>Tefereo,</hi> that héere is a knight of a straunge Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie that hath a great desire to speake with him. </q>This man without anie aunswering went awaie from the windowe,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:45"/>
And not long after, there was another window opened more lower then the first, from whence there looked out a knight who seemed to be of a gentle disposition, his face somewhat swart of coulour, who with great curtesie said.
Knight what is it that thou wouldest haue, for I am he whom thou doest séeke for: that which I would haue aunswered <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> is, that thou doest leaue this diuellish custome which thou doest héere maintaine, for that a knight of thy disposition and manner shuld rather occupie himselfe in breaking these euill customes, then in maintaining them, for these be not works of a knight the which thou doest, but of an infernall diuell, I therfore much maruell how thou vsing so much crueltie, thou doest liue with so great ease and without care. Come therefore thou tyrant and arme thy selfe, and I hope thou shalt héere paie the tribute of all these euills which thou hast done, for it is not reason that so diuellish and cruell a man as thou art shouldest liue. These reasons did little trouble this Gyant, neyther made hée anie reckoning of them, but with his accustomed sobrietie, he answered.</p>
               <p>Miserable knight, thou doest not knowe how héere thou doest seeke thy owne death in demaunding battaile of mée, therefore returne againe the waie thou camest, for thy te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>der age and smooth face without a bearde doth moue me to vse this my vertue and curtesie with thée, and considering that thou art a straunger and not of this Countrie. Then this <hi>Dacian</hi> knight aunswered. It is not this that I doe séeke, but to accomplish this which I haue tolde thée, and if my wordes are not sufficient to cause thée to leaue this which thou doest exercise, I do beléeue that my swoord will ere long compell thée thereto, for either I will die the death or else I will depriue thy bodie of that dampnable and accursed soule, and send it whether as thou hast sent manie a better then thine is. To these wordes this <hi>Tefereo</hi> aunswered nothing at all, but withdrewe himselfe in great hast from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, and called for his armour, the which was all blacke, and of a verie faire and straunge making, he was with a trice armed, and being on horse backe, the great and princely Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13973:45"/>
gate was opened, whereat issued out this <hi>Sardenian</hi> with a gentle and demure countenaunce, and after him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a page with two speares in his hand, of the which <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereo</hi> tooke the one, and sent vnto the Prince the other, who standing in néede accepted it, and without farther reasoning they turned their horses about with such courage and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that the lyke hath béene seldome séene betwéene two knights. And when each of them wer come into their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place, they set spurres to their horses with as great force as the thunder in the aire, and méeting together in the midde way with their speares, their shockes were so terrible that it was wonder to sée, so that not one of them failed of his blow, but ioyned in such sort, that the staues (although they were verie strong) brake, and the shéeuers of them separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the aire with great violence, and yet the valyaunt knights both remained in their saddles, no more mooued then a rocke by the sea side. But when either of them behelde the little harme they had done in this their iust, they both with their swordes in their handes returned their horses, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to strike so extreamly the one vppon the other, that their bodies felt the force of their armes, and although their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was not cut, yet it could not be but their flesh shuld re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue damage. In this sort trauailed these two knights more then an houre, without knowledge of anie aduauntage, but either of them were inflamed with anger to sée his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to indure so long, and the knightly courage of each of them did more and more increase, and their excéeding cholar was such, that the battaile began to be more terrible then at the first. But this furious <hi>Tefereo</hi> somewhat féeling, and therefore by experience knowing the surpassing strength and valiant courage of his enimie, although he did not greatlye meruaile at it, yet it did cause him to be more furious, and béeing incensed in such sorte, that with both his handes hée tooke his swoord, and strake at him such a stroke vppon the helme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the blowe sounded through all the fields, &amp; made an ecko in the mountaines, that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waight thereof the <hi>Dacian</hi> knight was constrained somwhat to incline his head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb facs="tcp:13973:46"/>
and remained a while without his remembrance, but his horse being scarred with that terrible stroke, gaue a great leape towards the one side, by the which he deliuered his master from the seconde blowe, which <hi>Tefereo</hi> thought to haue bestowed on him. The <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight being againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and not a little abashed at this blowe, setteled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his saddle, and throwing his shield from him to the ground, he tooke his sword fast in his hand, and stroke <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereo</hi> so terribly vpon his helme, with his sword some what flatling, (by reason whereof, the force of the blow somwhat abated, it slid downe vpon his lefte shoulder,) that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained him to stoupe forwards with all his bodie, and if he had not clasped his armes about his horse necke, hée had fallen downe to the ground, and with the force of this great blowe, the horse was constrained also to boow his fore féete, who with a sodaine and furious force rose vp again: wherat this noble <hi>Dacian</hi> warriour, with great hast pricked his horse with the spurres, pretending to make an ende of this cruell battaile with his second blowe: but it fell out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, for that <hi>Tefereo</hi> comming againe to himselfe, as fierce as a Lion, thrust forwards against his aduersarie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing (if it passed not his power) to repay againe with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, that which he had receiued. Now héere began a newe their battaile, and their forces multiplied in such furious sort, that all the mountaines and valleyes, were occupyed with the noyse of their terrible strokes. The courage was so great of these two Knights, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many times they lost theyr wits, with the weight of the terrible raps which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued one of another. Then this Prince <hi>Don Eleno</hi> sayde to himselfe, that if all the rest of the Knights with whome hée shoulde haue battaile, were of no lesse prowesse then this present Knight, that he feared quickly to be disgraced: and on the other side, <hi>Tefereo</hi> found himselfe very sore troubled, and saw that he was in so great distresse, began to inuocate vpon his Gods for aid. The prowes, strength, &amp; pollicie was such betwéene these two Princes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whosoeuer had ben pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to haue beheld y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, wold haue said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen

them expressed, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knighthood in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: for it was wonderfull to sée, how somtimes they pressed forwards, and presently retired backwards, as wel to bestow as to auoyde their terrible strokes. It was ful thrée houres, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these noble knights thus contended together, &amp; yet there appeared not in them any kind of faintnes, but by their behauior, ther stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth séemed stil more and more to encrease. Then this heroycall <hi>Dacian</hi> not accustomed to find such resistance, began to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get al patience, &amp; as one ouercome w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> anger clasped his sword fast in his hand, &amp; being setled in his sadle, he stroke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giant so hard in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midst of the helme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heuines of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow, he was forced to fall backwards vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crupper of his horse without any reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, &amp; with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great strengh the Prince put to this blow, his sword flew out of his hand, &amp; hanged by the wrist band, which while he recouered, <hi>Tefereo</hi> returned to himselfe, and with outragious anger (prouoked by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great paine he felt) with both his hands he strake such a blow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for at <hi>Don Eleno</hi> with the halfe swoord vpon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, in such furious sort, that it bereaued him of his sight, &amp; glauncing wise it descended downe vpon the head péece of the horse, but by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first blow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last had small strength, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it did but little harme, notwithstanding it amazed the horse in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with his staggering the Prince was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to vse pollicie to kéep himselfe from falling from his backe, but when his horse was recouered, he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, so inflamed with anger as though sparks of fire had is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out of his mouth, &amp; crushing his téeth together, he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these words.

<pb facs="tcp:13973:47"/>
in his stirrops, and stroke the Giant so terrible and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a blowe, that the bloud gushed out of his nose &amp; mouth, and therewith he fell to the ground as though he had bene dead.
He was no sooner downe, but with great lightnesse the <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight leapt from his horse, and stept to the Giant to vnlace his healme, which while hée was a dooing, hée heard a voyce which sayd, Doo not kill him knight, doo not kill him, and tourning his head about to sée who it was that so disturbed him, he perceiued it to be his cousin the Knight of the Sunne. (This was the great noyse of harnesse, that the Knight of the Sunne heard towards his left hand, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue tolde you.) So when <hi>Don Eleno</hi> had pulled of the Gyaunts helme, he withdrew himselfe apart, and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin alighted from his horse, and presently came and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him with excéeding ioye, and no little loue, which the more increased, when he considered that the Knight which should vanquish so great a Giant, could not be but of great valour, as it appeared by that furious blowe, by which the Giaunt was meruailously martyred: for the astonishment was such, that in a great while after <hi>Tefereo</hi> could not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himselfe, till such time as they brought water from the house which was hard by, and threw it in his face, by which meanes, he came to his remembraunce, and séeing himselfe in such a pickle, and the sworde of his conquerour prepared for his death, I doo referre vnto your iudgemens, what such a valiant Knight should thereof conceiue, and with a verye great and sad sigh he said.</p>

Which when <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereo</hi> heard he was sore abashed, and with great sobrietie he saide: Well, séeing it is so, that the flower of all Knighthood and the glorie of armes, is possessed by you and your kinred, I vowe that from this daye forwards, I will not remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer my owne, but nominate my selfe as onely yours, and in deliuering these spéeches, in the best manner be might he arose vp from the ground, and with great loue imbraced them both.

for to repose themselues, considering the greate trauaile and paine which they had passed.

So that when these noble knights per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it was labour lost to stand long in contention, these people (though then causelesse) being so incredible, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe againe towards the Castle: and all the way they went, being almost by the sea side, these two Cousins sawe their ship comming towardes them in great hast, and staieng their horses, they saw, that she was fast at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waters side.</p>
               <p>The knight of the Sunne perceiuing well, that hir com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thether was for no other cause but to inuite them to come aboord hir, which <hi>Eleno</hi> and <hi>Tefereo</hi> condescending vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they presently did: and sent word by a page of <hi>Tefereos</hi> to commaund all those of <hi>Sardenna</hi> that they should set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie all the Countrie, and without farther delaye retourne vnto their owne houses. These worthie Knights were no sooner entred into their Shippe, but she beganne presentlye to spread her Sayles, and shoouing from shoare, in great hast shée launched in to the maine Sea, wherein with prosperous windes they sailed two dayes, but the thirde daye verie earlye in the morning, they discouered a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, gouerned with sixe Oares on a side, which came ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing towardes them, and béeing ioyned together, they behelde that ther was in the same a verie faire Ladie, whose haire of hir head was dispersed abroad, and hir selfe very ill intreated by an vncourteous Knight.

Wherefore with great hast they got themselues to the Sea. Wherein they had not trauayled long, but that vppon a sodaine they discouered a shippe, which was comming towards them, all blacke, and out of it procéeded verie fearefull and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lightenings, accompanied lykewise with terrible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, seeming by the force thereof that the heauen opened: and when the shippe drew nigh vnto the Gallie of the Pagans,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:49"/>
it was presently couered with the thicke and terrible lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, in such sort, that it depriued all them that were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of their sight, and with the great feare that they receiued, they fell flat downe vppon the floore in the Gallie. And when they came againe to themselues they looked about to sée if they coulde perceiue what it should be. And then they coulde not finde the infant <hi>Floramonte,</hi> for whose losse they lamented greatly. You shall vnderstand that the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> by his learning had deliuered the infant from them to kéepe him close and in secret, for that he vnderstood by his art of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great warres that was pretended and made redie for in <hi>Grecia,</hi> in the which warres shoulde be slaine the flower of all knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and that it should be in greate daunger to be lost and vtterly destroied. Also he did comprehend by his learning to knowe how this infant and one other that was then begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (but not yet borne) should be the greatest help &amp; chiefe of this victorie, comming by chaunce to the end of the conquest, likewise he did knowe that if this childe should at anie time before this aduenture vse armour, that he should be put in great perill of death. This was the onely occasion that hée set him at libertie as you haue heard, and did inchaunt him in such sorte, that none other could cléere him of it, but onely he which should be his companion and aide in the greate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of these warres: which was the sonne of the heroicall knight of the Sunne, and of the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> of whome thou shalt heare héereafter. Thus this wise <hi>Lyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeo</hi> hauing deliuered this childe that none in all the Court knewe of it, retourned thether againe, and from that daye forwardes kept it secrete to himselfe, not suffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to vnderstande thereof, nor of anie other thing that hée foreknew in his heart by learning. All those of the Court were verye sadde, for that the Emperour was so sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, forasmuch as hée coulde heare no newes of his sonnes, as I haue before tolde you, determined after hée hadde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the hunting, to retourne backe againe to the Citie. And in the way as they shuld go, they discouered comming towardes them a Wagon, which did represent much do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13973:49"/>
(and this was that which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did finde,) and there they remained to sée what it shoulde bée, and when the Wagon drewe néere where the Emperour was, they lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp a cloth wherewith the wagon was couered, and out of the wagon there issued a Ladie, who lead a maiden childe by the hande, all couered with mourning apparell, which did represent great sorrowe, and of so meruailous beautie, as it was to bée wondered at. This Ladie when shée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode which was the Emperour, shée knéeled downe at his feete, and with sundrie sorrowfull sighes, shée lamentably sayd.</p>

Among which number this which doth present her selfe before thée, is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the least in birth, though nowe one in most miserie, for redresse whereof she craueth thy aide and defence. Thou shalt vnderstand O souereigne Emperour, that this childe is right heire apparant vnto all the kingdome of <hi>Lyra,</hi> of which she hath béen dispossessed by meruailous great violence.</q> The Emperour when he heard that this was the Quéene of <hi>Lira,</hi> he did reuerence her, and tooke her by the hande, and caused her to stand vp, and embraced her with excéeding shewe of loue, &amp; offred vnto her his person and all his power at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement for her helpe &amp; succour.
Then the Lady would haue kissed his hands, but the Emperour would not consent therevnto by anie meanes, but tooke his horse to procéede for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on his iourney, &amp; for curtesies sake tooke vp the young quéene behinde him on horse backe, and the Emperour <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candro</hi> tooke also the other Ladie.

And thus béeing wholy determined, he sent messengers vnto the king to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund his daughter in marriage for his sonne, but the king made them answere verie rigorously, (and although the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are greatly feared; yet the power of this king was such that he didde estéeme them but little.)

with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which knights verie secretly they ariued vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the land of <hi>Lyra,</hi> and verie closely in the beginning of the night, two miles from the citie, they put themselues into a little groue that was nigh at hand, whereas they remained vnespied two parts of the night, then vpon a sodeine when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people were all at rest, and little suspecting anie such sodeine misfortune, they entered the citie &amp; neuer rested till such time as they came to the kings pallace, at which entrie &amp; first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the king himselfe was slaine, by a cruell blowe that <hi>Mandroco</hi> stroke him on his head, as you may beholde héere where the bodie lyeth on a Beere within the wagon.

And againe, that those of the citie were vnprouided of all defence, with verie little a do he ouercame them all and brought them vnder his subiection, by compelling them to yéeld: So I a miserable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more then halfe dead in beholding so great damage d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by a false doore that belonged to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pallace, I went out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as escaped also many of the kings knights y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were taken on a sodeine: so I tooke my way forwards and came to <hi>Hircania,</hi> for that the king therof was my brothers sonne, &amp; cosin vnto this Princesse, who receiued vs verie well, &amp; was not a little sorrowfull for our misfortune. From which place we sent to demaunde of the Gyaunt to surrender vnto vs, that which with great violence he hadde vsurped, and aunswere was retourned, that they woulde not dooe it, except this young Quéene shoulde first marrie with <hi>Mandroco,</hi> to the which we woulde not consent for that he was so deformed. So séeing his determined purpose, wée sent once agayne, demaunding whether he woulde giue vs the bodie of the dead king, to the which they did straight wayes graunt. And <hi>Mandroco</hi> sent vs worde, that forsomuch as wée woulde not consent vnto that which he did require vs, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our owne quietnesse, to the ende we shoulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how little it was that hée did estéeme of vs, hee swore
<pb facs="tcp:13973:51"/>
with a solempne oath neuer to depart out of the Kingdome, for the space of two yeares, with condition, that in this time we should seeke two Knights, who by their great force and chiualrie, should ouercome his father and him in the fielde, and then they would depart the lande, and retourne to their owne Countrie. And contrariwise if we did not procure, to bring these two knightes to the battaile, or els to delyuer vnto them this Ladie within that prefixed time, that <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droco,</hi> might mary with hir, that then they would fully pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse themselues of all the kingdome, and fortifie themselues in such sort, that all agréement notwithstanding, we should neuer retourne to <hi>Lyra</hi> againe. And so vnderstanding their imbassage, I determined to come to this Court, whereas I doo vnderstand is all the prowesse, and flower of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode in the world. So héere I present my selfe (noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) before you and all your Knights, in asking fauour and requesting helpe to reuenge vs of so great wrong, as we haue receiued:</q> and thus she finished hir talke, and with great wéeping, she held her peace.</p>
               <p>This noble Emperor receiued very great sorow &amp; griefe to heare this lamentable tale that the Ladie tolde, and to see that faire young Damzel so dispossessed of her right by such extreame tyrannie, and with a milde countenaunce he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.<q> Noble Dutchesse, since that thy good fortune (though the efficient cause thereof be to too badde) hath brought thée there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where with all good will ye shall receiue succour and comfort, I request you to take your rest, and be quyet, and leaue of this your mourning. And although ther be knights in this my court, that are able to comprehend such enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, by their great prowesse and strength: yet I do looke euery day for them, to whom I may commend greater affayres to be done then these, wherfore rest you a while till two doo come, of whom I haue more dominion ouer, &amp; to them will I commit this charge.</q>
There were many knightes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that would very faine haue offered themselues to this enterprise, but hearing the pretence of the Emperour, they durst not in anie wise attempt it, but kept silence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:13973:51"/>Then this dutchesse began to tell them of all the successe that happened vnto her knightes by the knight of <hi>Cupide.</hi> Unto whome the Emperour sayde: that knight is one of them to whome I will commit the charge of your combat, and I am right gladde that the seruice he shall doe you in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise shall bée the occasion that you shall forget this anger that you haue against him. So with these and like reasons they drew néere the Citie, whereas straight waie they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prepare all things in a readinesse for the departing of the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> and in a short time all things bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prouided, this Emperour béeing also readie with a verie good will entered the ship, and carrying with him the Prince <hi>Meridiano,</hi> and his welbeloued spouse, and the <hi>Troyan Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedes,</hi> he taking leaue of the Emperour with a better counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce then his heart would consent vnto, committed the sailes vnto the winde, and with a prosperous voyage they went a land at <hi>Tenedon,</hi> whereas we will leaue them, for to tell you what chaunced vnto the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who was verie sadde for the absence of her spouse, and likewise to sée her selfe so great with childe, (although in the great hall she continually shewed a merrie countenaunce.) So it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one daie being in conuersation with the Empresse, and the quéene <hi>Lira,</hi> there entered into the great hall the worthie Prince <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> all armed with his accustomed harnesse, and leading by the hande a verie faire Damosell, all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in blacke veluet, and after her there came other nine faire Damosells, all apparelled after the same manner. This Damosell if you doo remember is shée, whose kéeper <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did kill, which was the Prince of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight which came to her at her complaint &amp; sorrow, was <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> who in greate secret followed the knight of the Sunne, and because of the great confidence that he had in the friendship of <hi>Zoylo,</hi> he promised her fauour &amp; succour: for the which this faire Ladie who was daughter vnto the king of <hi>Tiglia,</hi> came in this order as you shall heare. In the meane time that all this happened, there chaunced a thing of verie greate admiration, which was, that the <hi>Tartarian</hi> béeing
<pb facs="tcp:13973:52"/>
at that time in the hall as the Damzell entered, hée made a great noise without anie more tarrieng, neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that could stay him, were he neuer so strong, but running forwardes as a man distraught, hée went out of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice. The sorrowfull Ladie séeing this, fell downe to the grounde as though shée had béene dead. And <hi>Clauerindo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the ingratitude of this <hi>Tartarian,</hi> woulde haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, but the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> stayed him and woulde not suffer him to goe, saying: They should let him alone, for that all they shoulde procure to followe him should bée in vaine. And so retourning vnto the Ladie he practised such remedyes, that verie quickly shee retourned to her selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and then promised her such remedies, as shoulde in the ende restore her to rest. And when the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Ladie did knowe who he was, she did meruailouslie reioyce. So this <hi>Tartarian</hi> went to the sea side, and with great diligence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked himselfe in a shippe that was there readie fraughted for <hi>Spaine,</hi> which he did in such great hast and diligence, that before <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> could tourne themselues, the shippe had hoised saile, and yéelded her selfe vnto the winde, the which was the occasion that these two did the like in taking another ship, who sailed after the first, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined purpose, with all their powers to procure that this <hi>Tartarian</hi> should returne againe, whome we will leaue now sayling on their voyage, for it is necessarie for our hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie to relate other matters in this Chapter. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne therefore to the Emperours court. The Empresse <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiana</hi> séeing her time at hand to be deliuered with childe, was verie sadde, and knew not what to doe, but in the ende of many thoughts she determined to decypher all her secret vnto a maide she had who was called <hi>Arcana,</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she did disclose all the secrets of her heart. This <hi>Arcana</hi> séeing the great friendship and curtesie that the princesse shewed her, in opening her secrets more to her then to anie other, and had a more trust in her then in the rest, kissed her roiall hands, and promised her to be no lesse secret then dilligent in all her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13973:52"/>
So they determined betwéene themselues and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide as it was best for their purpose, to bée continuallye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and without anie companie, but that which did most trouble and gaue greatest care vnto the Empresse <hi>Claridia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was, for that shée did not knowe to whome to giue the charge of nursing that, which shoulde be borne of her, yet the maiden who was verie wise, subtil, and discréet, had ordained all things in good order, for she had in great secret disclosed it vnto a verie honest matrone of the citie, saieng, that she was the partie that should be deliuered, and gaue vnto her verye largely of gifts and iewells, with promises of a farther bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite for to keepe her counsell therein. It was not long after when that with great paine and griefe this noble Princesse was deliuered of a verie faire sonne &amp; daughter, béeing of so great beautie that it was wonderfull to bée séene. The sonne had vnder his left side a meruailous &amp; verie strange marke, which was a speare of such a firie prospect that it made them afraid to touch it. The Empresse tooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both in her armes and with many bitter teares she blessed them, and returned them againe vnto <hi>Arcana,</hi> willing her that she should dresse them, and put all things in order to send them to the nurse, the which she did with great diligence, wrapping and swadde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them vp in very faire and rich clothes, according to the best guise that she could, although she wer but little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in such like matters.

So then there began a cruell and mortall battell, one of the most terriblest in the world, for the strength of their blowes were so outragious, that with the least blowe they gaue, it was thought that the great hall would haue fallen downe. The Empresse and her Ladies what with the great griefe they had, and againe, with the excéeding heate that began in the hall, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into their Closettes and Chambers, and likewise the knights that were present, departed and left them alone in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hall, sauing the Emperour onelye remained at the doore, to keepe the entrie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Brandimardo</hi> and <hi>Claueryndo</hi> were with the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> beholding this cruell battell, not knowing who this great Gyaunt was that trauailed so much for the honour of the Emperour and his sonnes. In all this time these Gyaunts had no other care, but in brusing &amp; mangling one anothers flesh, with so greate strength, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer beheld them meruailed at their fiercenesse, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, all the furious rage of Gyaunts consisted in those two, as it did appeare by the terrible and outragious strokes that they bestowed betwéene them, for w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great strength and the sound thereof, the whole pallace did not onely shake, but also the whole Citie: in this sort they continued a greate while without taking anie breath, and all the floore of the hall was full of hoales, with the heauie blowes that had scaped by. Thus they long continued without knowledge of anie masterie betwéen them, but still they procured the one to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage the other, and to be reuenged one of another, with so greate rage and in such sort, that they séemed rather to bée rash and vnreasonable Gyauntes, then expert and valiaunt knightes: and in this their great furie they both lifted vp theyr great and heauie clubs, in such sort that their blowes met and discharged together, with such surpassing strength,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13973:55"/>
that the club of the King of <hi>Sardenna,</hi> was parted in twain, but the mace of <hi>Bustrafo</hi> discharged vpon the other, although almost in vaine, for that it had lost the former furie by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the first encounter, neuerthelesse it made his healme to sound as an anfielde when it is stroken on with a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Then this king séeing he had such an aduersary, thought it not good to vse delay, but with great hast he drewe his sword, and at such time as <hi>Bustrafo</hi> turned the second blow he could by no meanes shun or apart himselfe from it, but bare it off with his sword, and the fall of the blowe was such, that the mace was cut cleane a sunder, and the great end rolled on the flower in the hall. <hi>Bustrafo</hi> seeing himselfe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest of his heauie mace, threw the tronchon which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his hand, at the King of <hi>Sardenna,</hi> who receiued it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his shielde: but the strength of it was so vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it glaunced on his shield, and flewe vpright to the top of the hall, and the king retired back thrée or foure steps, so that it was a wonder he fell not to the ground. In this time, <hi>Bustrafo</hi> had space to draw his sword, and to shrowde himselfe vnder his shield. Nowe there began a new, a more cruell and rigorous combat betwéene them, then at the first: for <hi>Bustrafo</hi> at his first blow, stroke the King vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shield, and parted it in two péeces, and with an infernall furie, it descended on his helme, and hurt his head, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wound was not very great, yet the blow rested not, but glauncing on the harnesse, fell to the ground, whereas it made a great hoale: but in the meane time this newe conuerted King, was not idle, neither did his aduersarie escape his paiment for the blowe past, but hauing his sharpe cutting sword raysed on high, he discharged it with such excéeding force vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Bustrafo,</hi> (who receiued it vpon his shield) that with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great strength thereof, it parted it in péeces, and descended vpon his helme, taking away with it all that it touched both of the harnesse &amp; flesh, which fell together to the ground, so that <hi>Bustrafo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained very sore hurt. And when he sawe his owne bloud, the battaile beganne a newe to kindle, in such sort, that in a very small time, each of them were sore hurt in sundrie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:56"/>
wherout issued so much bloud, that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hall was sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled therewith. This fierce <hi>Bustrafo</hi> séeing himselfe so ill intreated, his anger still more increased, and gaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>The déeds which in all this time chaunced vnto that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyant <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> we will héere declare, and leaue these two Giaunts, with their perillous, and well sought battaile, till such time as occasion doo serue to to goe forwarde with the same. You doo remember, how that we lefte <hi>Rosicleer</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his inchaunted boate, sayling on the déepe seas, vnder the protection of <hi>Neptune.</hi> And so they trauailed for the space of fiue dayes, and as many nights, without séeing any thing, but the starrie firmament, and the furious waues of the sea, with out knowing whether they did sayle. In the sixt day of their nauigation, they beheld comming towardes them another great Foyst, who came with no lesse furie, then their boate sayled, and the course thereof was directed right with them. So when they drewe nigh together, the Foyst passed by so close, that they might well sée and discouer who was therein, and they perceiued within the same a damosell who séemed to be dead, and by hir stoode a monstrous Giant, and by the maste of the Foyst there was tyed a terrible Griffin, which caused great feare in them that beheld it.</p>
               <p>The Foyst made such great waye, that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> hadde no time to leape into hir, which caused him to be verye sorry
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13973:56"/>
and he was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed, for that he could not be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certified what this aduenture was and what the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof did signifie, and with the anger that he hadde, he began to curse all inchauntments, and all them that vsed it: but all this did profit him but little, for that in a shorte time it sailed out of sight. And looking about him, he sawe two shippes, which were in a great fight, and very fiercely the one assaulted the other, to whome the boate wherein the Prince was, directed his waye with so swifte course, that he almost had no time to put on his helme. And with these two shippes was another boate, which by the force of armes was brought in subiection and ouercome by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other two shippes, and all the people were slaine that was in her, sauing a fewe which had withdrawen themselues into the poope of the barke for their defence, amongst whome, there was one of a verye great and excellent stature, who with strong and mightie blowes, caused all those that approached vnto the place where he was, to withdraw themselues, but by reason that they had bene very long in this battaile, and that they had troubled him very much, he could not choose but be very weake and wearie, in such sort, that if it had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured long, he must néedes haue finished the sight with his death.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had well behelde and noted the great strength and fierce courage of the Knight, it séemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to haue knowen him, and viewing the deuice that hée hadde on his armour, hée knewe that it was <hi>Zoylo</hi> the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> and straight waie without anie more tarrying he leaped into the shippe, and beganne to let them knowe the strength of his strong arme, for in such sorte he bestur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that at the first blowe he cut off helme and head, of one of his enimies, and not being content with this, he began againe to strike first on the one side and then on the other, so that there was not one that was so hardie to abide his terrible blowes, but when his aduersaryes sawe his furie, there ioyned more then thirtie of them together, pretending to assault him, but amongst them there
<pb facs="tcp:13973:57"/>
was one who séemed to bée the principall of them all, sayde. Returne you all backe againe and make an ende of that, which weake and simple women would long since haue finished, and let me alone with this knight that so rigorously doth behaue himselfe, and with great furie he pressed forward and stroke the Prince such a blowe that hee made him asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but this miserable man little knewe that hée had to doo with the best Knight in the worlde, for if he had, he would neuer haue made resistaunce against him face to face. And tourning to strike him once againe, hée discouered the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that he had in his shéelde, whereby he knew him, and was verie much afraide of that which should succéede. The Prince vnderstood by them that were in the shippe, that this was he which did gouerne them, he stroke such a blow at his right arme, that he cut it cleane off, so that arme and swoorde fell downe vpon the hatches of the shippe, who séeing himselfe so ill intreated, with a greate noise and pittifull shrike he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in amongst his people, and cryed for helpe and succour, but all was in vaine, for that the Nephew of <hi>Tiberio</hi> stroke him such another blow vpon the helme, that he parted helme and head in two péeces, so that he fell downe dead: but when his companie sawe this, they altogether fell vpon him with terrible furie, thinking to make an ende of him, but he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them in such order, that quickly he made them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the strength of his victorious arme, for he neuer stroke blowe but either he slewe one, or felled him to the grounde, which was the occasion that their heartes fainted, that not one of them which remained durst approch, neuerthelesse they had so compassed him about, that he could not neither on the one side nor on the other make anie waie, for when he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to put himselfe forwards one waie, then the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laie on him behinde, so that of necessitye hée was constrained in the end to set vpon them all at once, for that they did so trouble him. In this time <hi>Zoilo</hi> had somewhat recouered his strength, and was well eased of his weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and séeing the valiauntnesse of his defender, he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where he was skirmishing, &amp; with his sword

This béeing finished, the Prince and the <hi>Tartarian</hi> embraced one another, with great loue and friendshippe, and <hi>Rosicleer</hi> asked of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> what was the occasion that brought him into so great perill and daunger of death. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> sayde, that by force of an aduenture he departed the Emperours Court, (but he did not declare the effect) and how comming in that small shippe hée was taken with those rouers, who brought him into that greate distresse that he had found him in. Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi> againe threw his armes about his necke, and with great loue he sayd.</p>

The Prince hearing all this which they of the ship told him, began to make himselfe readie to the battaile, and laced on his helme, and put all thinges in verie good order, and when that all was readie he sayde vnto them that were with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O you people of little courage &amp; small strength, I sée well you are all base minded, and that there is no hardinesse in you, but onely for vile matters, get you downe and hide you in the pumpe of the shippe, for I will not consent that anie of you shall runne awaie, neither shal your cries excuse me of this battaile,</q> and so with a lowde voice he commaunded to beare vp the helme, that the ship might runne right vpon the Gallie. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> séeing that they pretended to giue the enterprise, commaunded those that were with him straight waies to put his vessell in verie good order, of the which it had greate néede, so with as great hast and swiftnesse of saile as was possible, they procured that the Shippe and Gallie might ioyne both together, and in verie short time they were come so nigh each to other, that anie man might well discouer and perceiue all that was in the Gallie of their aduersarie.
This valiaunt and worthie <hi>Rosicleer</hi> sawe the greate Gyaunt where hée sate in the middest of the poope of the Gallie in a Chaire, where they verie plainely sawe his countenaunce was so terrible, and his bodie so greate, that all those which were present with <hi>Rosicleer</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide to beholde him. And when the Gyaunt vnderstoode that those which were in the ship would not alonely defend themselues, but also offend their enimies, his rage was such, that in great hast he arose and with a mightie voice he called

for his armour, vttering these words.</p>
               <p>

Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi> aunswered and sayd, Make thy reckoning, that thou hast sayd euen as much as nothing, for of my selfe I speake, that I am none of the Gods thou namest, neither know I thée by the name thou tellest, nor yet doo I desire thy friendship, nor any others that practiseth the like workes, as thou dost, neither, doo I estéeme thy threatnings, nor yet thy furious cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can thy great body put me in any feare.</q>
And with this, he commaunded the marriners to grapple the shippe &amp; Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley together very strongly. Which, when this fierce King sawe, with great anger he arose out of his chaire, and not tarrying to lace on his helme, would haue entered into the shippe: but <hi>Rosicleer</hi> perceiuing his pretence, thruste him with so great force, with both his hands vpon the brest, that he made him to fall backwardes into his owne galley, and sayd.

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:13973:59"/>This noble Gréeke was nothing at all idle, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his rare and precious Sworde, which Queene <hi>Iulia</hi> had sent him, in his hande, hée stroke a terrible and fierce blow at the Gyauntes face, but by reason he was so farre off, he coulde not reach it, but that the point of his sharpe Swoorde onelye passed through his chéekes, but if he coulde haue comprehended more of his head with that blowe, he had made an end of the battayle. This furious Gyaunt when hée sawe his bloud before him, he gaue a terrible groane, and therewith tooke his broade swoorde in both his handes, and with blaspheming and cursing his Gods, hée lyft it vp for to strike this valiaunt Gréeke, who séeing it to descende, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to receiue so doubtfull a blow, but with great and singular wisedome deliuered himselfe from it. The blowe was such that if it had not doubled in the maine sayle which somewhat disturbed it, it had béene sufficient to haue diuided the Shippe in péeces. This valyaunt and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Prince, which with greate discreation and aduise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sustayned this battaile, had alwayes a verye good eye to the Gyaunt, who for to vnloose his Swoorde where it was fast in the Shippe, was inforced to put his lefte hande to holde fast by the shippe side, whereat <hi>Rosicleer</hi> stroke with such furie that the Gyants hand remained fast to the Shippes side, diuided from the arme. But when this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fierce Gyaunt sawe himselfe lame, and that he had cleane lost his lefte hand, hée began a newe to curse and blaspheme his Gods, and procured to hurt this Gréeke by all meanes possible that hée coulde inuent, but he prouided so to the contrarie, that not one blowe which the Gyaunt stroke should eyther touch or hurt him, in such sort, that at last when this furious &amp; outragious diuel striuing to strike this Gréeke Knight, was driuen to ballaunce his bodie, thereby to reache at him, this Knight let passe the same blowe euen as hée did all the rest of his blowes, and in passing by hee gaue him such a cruell blowe vppon the right arme, that he cut it off almost by the elbowe.</p>
               <p>And when this miserable king sawe himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Then those which were of his Gallie séeing this his wretched ende, and fearing theyr owne misfortune, in a meruailous greate hast vngrappeled the Shippe, which was done with such spéede, that when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> remembred himselfe, he had no time to offende them, nor to doo them anie more harme. Then those which were in his Shippe and had behelde this short and victorious bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, beganne a new to fall downe at his féet and most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie craued pardon for their former feare. Then the Prince turned towards the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> who all the time of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, was beholding his excellent and mightie strength, and much meruailed at that which he had séene, and asked of him what he hadde determined to dooe. And the <hi>Tartarian</hi> aunswered, that he would in no wise depart from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and béeing in talke, they, vpon a sodaine sawe two shippes, which séemed vnto them, that they were in a great fight. These Princes were meruailous desirous to be with them, to vnderstand what they were. So this valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt <hi>Greeke,</hi> tourning to the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> he said, Prince of <hi>Tartaria</hi> followe mée, and in greate hast he leaped into his Boate, and he was no sooner entered therein, but that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to make waie lyke a Thunder-bolt in the ayre, so that it séemed sparkes of fire flew out of the water, in such sort that the <hi>Tartarian</hi> hadde no time to followe him, but by reason of the swiftnesse, he had quicklye lost the sight of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:13973:60"/>So for that it is requisite, let vs leaue this <hi>Tartarian,</hi> who was very sorowfull béeing lefte alone, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the marrineers to make waye with his ship, towardes the other two that were a fighting. So this valiaunt <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> sayled on in his inchaunted boate, not without greate sorrowe, for that vpon a sodaine he had lost his perfect friend: neuerthelesse for that he did vnderstand that he was carried to conclude the things that were more for his contentment, he was driuen to comfort himselfe, with that which most he loued. So with these great thoughtes, he sailed two dayes without any aduenture worthy the telling. But the thirde daye very early in the morning, at such time as <hi>Appollo</hi> shewed abroad his glistering beames, they discouered lande, whether the barke with terrible furie made waye: and it séemed vnto him to be a very small Iland, where they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, neuerthelesse by the prospect of the riuers, it appeared to be a place of great delyght, and full of meddowes and other gréene fieldes. So by the resting of this barke a grounde, <hi>Rosicleer</hi> vnderstood that there he should goe aland, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he descended out of the barke, and after him came his good horse, and to the ende he would trauell in more safetie, he mounted on his backe, and looked round about him, if hée coulde discouer any waye or path. But not farre from the place whereas he was, he beheld very faire and sumptuous buildings, wherewith he tooke the way that led him thether, and being nigh thervnto, he saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was old &amp; ancient buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And as he went round about it a while for to beholde the same, he saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ouer the principall gate, was this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription written. <hi>This is the famous and auncient Temple of the goddes Venus, from whence the noble Paris of Troy, stole the faire Queene Helena: this is the Iland of the mother of that cruell Cupide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the greatest sower of discord in all the world.</hi> This valiant Knight did very much content himselfe in beholding that olde and sumptuous Temple, the name whereof was spred through all the world, and lefte not any thing, neither without nor within, but behelde it fully to his contentment. After that he had spent a little time in peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:13973:61"/>
this, he put himselfe in a straight waye, which was not farre from a foote path thereby, whereas he sawe a man that was cutting of woode, of whome he asked what countrie it was, and who was Lord of it. This man perceiuing that hée demaunded somwhat of him, was not able to answere him, but made signes vnto him that he was dumbe, &amp; moreouer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should returne backe againe, giuing him to vnderstande that if he did procéede forwards, he should finde great peril. This noble <hi>Rosicleer</hi> sayd then to himselfe, I doo not know what shall chaunce or happen me: notwithstanding, if a thousand that had their tongues should tell me, (yet would I not doo it, nor leaue off to follow this my pretended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) much more thou, whom I cannot vnderstand. And so without any more tarrying, he retourned vnto his new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun iourney, and at the going vp of a hill, he beheld a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of a mightie and straunge bignesse, which was edified vpon another hills side. He was a good myle from it, when he discouered it, and so iournying thetherward; he hadde not trauailed farre, when he found himselfe in a faire, broad, &amp; smooth way, whereinto when he entred, he sawe certaine foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of horses, which appeared not to be made long before, but that lately they had passed that way: the which footings he followed, although he found other fayre wayes, and as much occupied as that wherein he was, yet for all that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would sée what footings they wer, he would follow that way and none other, so not very farre from that place where he was, he heard (although it was somwhat distaunt from him, to his séeming) a great rushing of harnesse, and the more he trauailed forwards, the more plainer his eares wer occupied with this martiall musicke. Till in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, drawing néerer, he perceiued, it was a notable &amp; well fought battaile, for which cause he pricked his horse onwardes the faster, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> going down from a mountain, into a faire &amp; broad plaine, he behelde at the foot of the castle very much people and amongst them Giaunts, all which were in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile against one onely Knight, of a maruailous great &amp; wel proportioned stature all armed in russet harnes without any

Somewhat on the one side a little distaunt from the battell, he sawe a Damzell of a meruailous &amp; excellent beautie, who with great sorrowe complained her selfe.

Before I procéede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie farther in this battaile, I will (although it be somewhat troublesome to the reader) declare the rest of the terrible bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile that was betwéene the two gyants in the great hall of the Court of the Emperour. You haue heard how we lefte these two Gyaunts <hi>Bustrafo</hi> and <hi>Bramidoro</hi> in great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the battell, each one of them indeuouring themselues to winne the victory, although of each parte they denyed to either other the same. He that séemed to be most troubled in this battaile, was the <hi>Sardenian</hi> King, and with the thicke breath that proceeded from his vnpacient heart, his face was inflamed with the heate thereof. The which his aduersarie perceiued, and like a terrible and outragious Tiger, he lifte vp his mightie sword, letting it fall w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such furie, as though fire hadde fallen from heauen. The King séeing that by no meanes he could escape it, lifte vp likewise his sworde, to ward that terrible blow: but by reason that that of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt <hi>Bustrafos,</hi> was of better stéele, and of more strength, hée cut the sword of the Kings in two péeces, and the blowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended vpon his shoulder, and did a little hurt him. When this King sawe that his sword was in two péeces, hée was
<pb facs="tcp:13973:62"/>
somewhat amazed, yet for all that, he lost not his knightlye courage, but with a valiant heart pressed to his enimie, and with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This Gyant <hi>Bustrafo</hi> féeling himselfe so sore hurt with this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowe, pretended to repaye him with double interest (the which if it had chaunced to take effect) it had made an ende of his dayes: but this newe conuerted Knight, ranne in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the blowe of <hi>Bustrafo,</hi> saieng: O Iesus, kéepe and defend this thy newe conuerted seruaunt. And so ioyning together, they imbraced one another, whereas began a maruailous &amp; strong wrastling, wherein they continued a good while pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their strengths, and procuring the victorie, the one ouer the other, till at the last, both being not a little wearie, they fell downe to the ground, tumbling héere and there from one place to another, without loosing their holde, &amp; in this stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they séeing that this wrastling did little profit them, vnloosed themselues: but the King was the first that rose vp, as one that shewed himselfe to haue the best stomacke, and séeing that all <hi>Bustrafo</hi> his head was bare, in that he wanted his helme, he bent his armed fist, and stroke him such a blowe vpon the forehead, that his braines flewe out, and his eyes started out of his head, and there this vnfortunate Gyaunt fell dead to the ground.
The King séeing then so good a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in his battaile, fell downe vpon his knées to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, and lifting vp his eyes vnto heauen, he saide.<q> I giue thée thankes most mightie Iesus, that thou gauest me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thy power, &amp; lightenest my vnderstanding for to leaue this error in the which I was led, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy true light.

To the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable words which the Emperour had spoken, this faire and distressed Lady aunswered.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Surmounted Emperour, this my great sorrow is so roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in me, that I haue no ioye to receiue any comfort, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, if it be true which I haue heard, both of thée and thy royall Court, the fame whereof, all the world doth resound: then I am sure that thou wilt not denie me of my request, for that hetherto thou hast not at any time denied any Lady or Damosell, which hath requested the same, hauing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie and néede thereof: much more now, béeing demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thée by so afflicted a Damosell as I am, being marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the sonne of that adultresse <hi>Venus,</hi> whom I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble vnto the Uulture, which alwaies taketh for hir repast and féeding, the bowells of that infortunate <hi>Ixion,</hi> and the more paine he suffereth, the more hir hunger increaseth, so that euermore by hir gréedines, he sustaineth a lasting grief, Euen so (soueraigne Lord) loue doth torment me, &amp; alwayes is gnawing of these my afflicted bowels, yet neuer doo I feele them without loue, but rather alwaies, both in the Winter &amp; Summer, in presence and in absence it doth still increase: so that I am at no time without loue, and continuallye my faith increaseth: and by no meanes can I receiue remedie for this griefe, but by the force and strength of some straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whom I doo séeke for continually, with great sorrowe. Therefore I doo desire thée (O soueraigne Emperour) if at any time thou hast passed the paines of loue, that thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest pitie them that are so sore afflicted and vnfortunate, and doo not denie me thy aide &amp; helpe: for if I were the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of base parents, yet in respect I am a woman, thou arte bound to succour and aide me.

The Emperour who was meruailous attentiue vnto all that this faire Ladie had sayd, &amp; very much beholding hir great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he aunswered and sayd. <q>Of my faith faire Lady, I will not let to remedye this thy sorrowe much more then I am bound to doo by my high estate, and will procure by all meanes to ease this thy afflicted euill.

The Emperour although hée sawe that it was a haynous thing at that time to leaue his whole Court and estate, yet did he not showe any such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but with a valiant courage he called for his armor, the which was straight way brought vnto him, being all of russet colour, and the shield of the same colour, and ther was portrayed in it the picture of leane Death, with a sharp flesh hooke in his hand. All the Kings and Lords that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that time, would haue disswaded him from this his enterprise, but specially and aboue all the rest, the auncient Prince of <hi>Clarencia</hi> sayde.

thou (O souereigne Emperour) art more bounde to looke and haue a care vnto your owne subiects, more then to your owne person. And a good Prince ought rather to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect his will to the fauouring of his people, then to please his owne appetite. For which cause, honourable Lord, you must pardon vs, for that we will not willingly consent, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for desire of this pompous same, that you doo pretende, we should loose your person.

So this honourable Emperour without shewing any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aunswered and sayd.
<q>Noble Kings and Princes, and my very friends. I giue you great thankes for the good will you doo showe mée, in that you would not that I shuld be absent from you: likewise you shall vnderstande, that it dooth as much grieue me, to seperate my selfe from your companyes, and I doo thinke my selfe blessed to haue such noble Knights as you bée vnto my subiects: notwithstanding you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that as you doo loue the bodie and person of your Prince, so likewise you should desire and procure his fame and honour, for you knowe you haue many meates that are verye sauourie to the taste of anie man, and yet to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye verye hurtfull to the stomacke. It is a verye good thing to liue vnder compasse, and that gouerning is good, by the which fame and honour is not diminished, as this, for that he that is bounde, must procure, perfourme, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne his promise. For if I of my owne frée will, and to féede myne owne appetite, hadde procured and mooued this iourney, you had had great reason for to haue disswaded mée, but béeing sought for, and procured héereto, by this noble and distressed Damosell for hir defence, then what reason is it that I shoulde abandon my faith? Tell mée
<pb facs="tcp:13973:65"/>
I praie you if now I should falsifie my promise, what hope of confidence heereafter shoulde remaine in you of my ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Of truth I saie vnto you, that Prince which doth not keepe and maintaine his faith which hee hath promised in giuing his word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, hée is vnworthie of lyfe. And séeing that I haue graunted this iourney, although you be displeased therewith, I beséech you comfort your selues, for that by iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice I am constrained to goe, trusting in almightie God to retourne againe vnto you with greate honour and renowne. What woulde the worlde saie, when that for feare of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane thinges I leaue to mainetaine iustice and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the obseruation and kéeping of my worde? Surely they woulde report me for a Prince of small vertue, &amp; déeme you (so perswading mée) not worthie of a good Prince, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> many times God doth shew his power, whereas the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of humane thinges be without all hope. Therefore I doo desire you all (my friendes) that you will not withdrawe mée from this my pretended purpose, for if I were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therevnto, you were all bound to complaine of mée. </q>And making an ende of these his reasons he began to arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
The Empresse that of all this thing was ignoraunt, when shée vnderstood therof by some of them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the Emperour, shée came with shedding of manye teares for to hinder and withdrawe him from his iourney: the Emperours heart was somewhat gréeued to heare hir sorrowfull words, but with an heroycall courage he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded her to returne vnto her closet, and willed all those that were present to goe and beare her companie, and would that none should remaine with him but <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> vnto whom the Emperour in greate secret sayd: That when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> or the knight of the Sun should<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> returne to the court, that hee shoulde tell them that he was gone to <hi>Lidia</hi> at the instaunt of the Ladye, for to restore her againe to her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. With this he did charge him verie much, and that they shoulde straight wayes and without anie delaye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte for that place: <hi>Brandimardo</hi> thought greate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe in this which the Emperour commaunded, and gaue

him greate thankes, with faythfull promise to accomplish the same, and taking his leaue, the Emperour straight weie entered into a Foyst that was there readie with sixe oares on a side, and hoysing sayles they made such waie that in a small time they had lost the sight of the Citie. This faire Damosell was verie gladde, and did exercise her selfe in no other thing but in seruing the Emperour. In this sort they sayled all that daie and all the night till the next morning: this noble Emperour saie in the poope of the Galley, and by him sate this faire Ladie, on the one side, of whome hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the cause why shée brought him out of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Unto whome with manie teares distilling from her chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staline eyes, and with greate sighes that proceeded from her dolorous heart, she said.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I haue tolde you noble Emperour that the force of loue hath brought mée to this extremitie wherein you nowe sée me. Also I tolde you that I am <hi>Lidia,</hi> daughter vnto the king of <hi>Lidia,</hi> and was meruailously and daintely brought vp, and much set by of my parents, and now all alone with no other companie then you doo sée I goe subiect vnto this miserie. The great fame of this my surmounted beautie was so spred abroade, that it was the occasion that manye knightes of straunge Countryes resorted vnto the Court of the King my Father, and amongest them all there was one that came from a farre, whose name was called <hi>Brenio,</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>Lusitania,</hi> beeing of a meruailous beautie and no lesse valiauncie, which did so surmount, that in all the Countrie hath neuer bene séene the like, and cruell <hi>Cupide,</hi> I knowe not whether it was to vse his accustomed pollicies, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was enuious of his beautie, hée stroke mée with his poisoned arrowe, in such sort, that I was constrained by that force to loue this vnhappie knight, and therwith constrained to forget the roiall estate from whence I descended, I did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise my selfe in no other thing, but thinking on his loue, and determined to giue him vnderstanding thereof in as secrete wise as I could, so long it lasted that I waxed blinde in loue, &amp; feared that he would not vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I loued him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

I did plainly declare it to him, which gréeued him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, (but rather vnto my seeming) he was verie well pleased therewith, so by all meanes possible I did procure to speake with him, and imagining which shoulde be the best waie, I thought it good to ordaine a hunting, thinking there to haue opportunitie to be alone in the thickest of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and there to ease and lighten my selfe somewhat of that heauie loue, which by sorrow I receiued, in giuing him to vnderstand the whole effect of my determined minde: so this hunting I put in vre, and tooke the mountaines and woodes, and the hunts men prouided the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so hauing the winde prosperous to their desire, wée ariued verie shortly after at an Ilande called <hi>Otono,</hi> which is adioyning vnto one parte of your Kingdome, whereas wée went a lande. Noble Prince, I did not féele so much force by my imprisonment, neyther did I receiue so much griefe for mine own sorrow, as I did for my best beloued <hi>Brenio,</hi> who was so laden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yrons &amp; chaines, that my heart coulde not by anie meanes suffer it, but I beganne to call them traitours, and that they were no Knightes, but théeues and robbers, saying, that ouer one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

&amp; an vnarmed Knight they haue strength to work such violence, but not able to make anie resistaunce against ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Knightes. And the Gyaunt aunswered, Oh how sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doest thou shewe thy selfe, in thinking that there is anie who is able to resist our strength, and for that thou shalt vnderstande and see howe little wée doe estéeme the strength of men (yea, the strength of the Gods wée make no reckoning of) take this Gallie and all thinges that shall bee necessarie for thy voyage, and take with thée one of these my Pages, and goe and séeke the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> or ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his two sonnes, whose fames are spread throughout the worlde, and bring them hether, and sée whether theyr strength is sufficient for to deliuer this thy knight out of prison. So I put this iourny straight in practise, &amp; departed, and in the voyage I escaped with greate daunger to be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed at sea by rouers and théeues, so in the ende I came and presented my selfe before your highnesse.</q>
The Emperour who was verie attentiue to all this which the sorrowfull Ladie had tolde him, and vnderstanding the cause of all her trouble, he answered.

The Emperour who was mooued with much compassion of the great trauaile of this Ladie, and somewhat to refresh hir in the aire, he caused hir to goe a lande, and taking hir by the hande, he did helpe hir out of the Gallie, and they rested themselues vpon a little mountaine, from which place they might discouer a great parte of the Ilande, and more they discouered a great way from thence, another smal mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

They had scarce made an end of eating, when that they heard a terrible shrike, which was such, that the faire Lady lost hir colour: but the Emperour rose vp on his feete, and looked round about him to sée if he could perceiue what it shuld be, but he could sée no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than he sawe at the first, and so retourned and sate down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but he was not scant setled, when he heard the lyke shrike again. The Emperour turned and rose vp the second time, and said: Who art thou, that dost thinke to make me afraide with these thy shrikes, I tell thée that thou art verie much deceiued: thou wilt rather giue me occasion thus in offending me, to séeke what thou art that makest this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble noyse. And with these words he sayd vnto the Lady, that she should returne vnto the galley, for that he would goe sée what thing it should be, the which she would not consent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but would néedes goe in the company of the Emperour. And when the Emperour saw the determination of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Damosell, he threwe his shield vpon his arme, and laced and made fast his healme, and so a foote they tooke their waye towards the place whereas the light was, for that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes that parte they heard the noyse. And trauailing in the middest of the waye, at the foote of a hill, they found an Image of fine Christall, which séemed to be wrought by the handes of some excellent workeman, all to be spotted with bloud. And it appeared by the woundes that were formed in the same figure, that it was the Image of one that had suffered great torments, as well with terrible cuttings,

of yrons, as with cruell whippings. The legs and the armes did seeme as though they had bene martired and wrong with cordes, and about the necke, as though it had bene strangled with a towell hard wrong, and there was written vpon the breast, with letters of liuely bloud, this Epitath. <hi>I am Herea the Kings daughter of Cimarra, violated and slaine by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldino King of Numidia. And thou knight that this present spectacle shalt viewe, I doo desire thee, that if thou dost goe forward this way, let it be with great courage, for to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce on this crueltie, for that I am not of my selfe able to seeke reuengement.</hi> This Emperour, who had wel considered y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great crueltie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had bene vsed against that infortunate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, being moued with great compassion he sayd, I doo vow that if there be any meanes whereby to be reuenged of this thy death, to procure it with all my power: and with this determined purpose, they proceeded on their waye, and went so farre, that they perceiued, that the light which they hadde séene, did procéede of two gates of fine Christall: and there they sawe in the high way, a great pillar, whereon was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a written table, with these contents: <hi>Knight, looke wel vnto the oath which thou hast taken, for that this is a perilous enterprise: and from this place thou hast license to retourne backe a gaine, and not to fulfill thy promise, for that the King of Cimarra, will not constraine nor force any manner of Knight.</hi> The Emperour said, As well they maye raise from death to life all the famous <hi>Romanes,</hi> which haue ben from the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> vnto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and all the rest vnto this time, as to perswade me to retourne from my promise, which I haue made: and if they were all present liuing, they were not sufficient to cause me to leaue my oath.

When the Emperour sawe himselfe without his shéelde, which that infernall Bird had carryed with him into the aire, and let it fall downe againe a great wayes distant from the same place where he was, it made him to haue alwayes a verie good and diligent eie, to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> griffon to marke when he would descend, who straight way began to descende, vnto his thinking with much more furie then at the first.

And as by force of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Mill carryeth the stone about with greate furie, euen so this worthie warriour bestowed himselfe for to defende him from this furious beast, yet he coulde not doo so much, but that he must néedes receiue some of his terrible blowes, and his swiftnesse was such in rising into the ayre, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, that hée coulde not fasten one blow on him with his swoorde, but he did hurt the Emperour with his clawes sometimes on the armes and sometimes on the healme, but yet coulde he neuer haue anie fast holde on him to doo him harme, for that he neuer stoode still, but moouing héere and there, shunning his blowes, &amp; euen as a furious Lyon, who in the time of sléepe is molested and troubled with small beasts, créeping on him in all places, which he féeling with his mouth, snappeth héere and there on euerie parte rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, so long, til in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end being throughly ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed, at once they paie for all the iniuries that they did him: euen so this vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt Emperour vsed himselfe with this terrible Griffon, flourishing with his swoorde round about on euerie side, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waiting opportunitie at one time to requite him for all the sorrowe that hée did him, but in the ende séeing that it did little profit him in dooing this, he sodeinly bethought him of another remedie, which was to kneele downe with one of his knees on the grounde, that when the Griffin shoulde descend more lower to hurt the Emperour, that then with as great lightnesse as he coulde, he woulde rise vp, and with more ease strike him, which he presently did put in practise, So this terrible Griffon descended downe, and with one of his sharpe clawes he clasped fast holde on the Emperours healme. Then the Emperour seeing this fierce Griffon now to descend down more lower then he did before at other times, he thought it not good to be idle at anie time, but with exceeding greate lightnesse he arose vp and carryed

And when the Griffin felt himselfe so sore hurt, he pulled with so great strength, that if the helme had not left his head, he had pulled the Emperour vp into the aire with him, which wold not haue fallen out well with him, but God was so pleased, that in that time the lases with the which it was made fast brake. This Griffin féeling himselfe pearced with this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wound, cut through the aire, as a whirlwind, with great and terrible shrikes, but straight hée fell downe dead to the earth, for that the wounde reached vnto his heart.</p>
               <p>The Giaunt when he behelde his Griffin to be dead, made no more a doo, but entred into the castle to arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, the which the Emperour well perceiued, which made him to make spéede to fetch his shéeld, whereas this infernal birde had let it fall. So not long after this gyant came forth al armed with armour of a boyled skinne, with a great club full of knots in his hande, saying with a hoarse and terrible voice. Doe not thinke thou knight of the Diuell, for all that thou hast slaine the kéeper of my Castell, that the entering is anie whit the more at thy commaundement, and héereof thou maist be sure, whereat the Emperour answered neuer a word, but rather inuited him to battel, &amp; they ioyned together like two furious tygers, hauing their defence in their hands, burning with great fury the one against the other. Then they thrust themselues forwardes with meruailous force and spéede one against another, discharging their great and mightie blowes that it was wonderfull to beholde. But the Emperour did not determine to receiue the blowes of his enimie fullie and whole, but rather procured that he shoulde discharge them in vaine, and so hée did, for the Gyaunt lift vp his greate and huge clubbe to strike him therewith a maruailous and mightie blowe, which when the Emperour perceiued it to descend, he stepped a side w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so great lightnesse, that it séemed to be wonderfull, in such sort that his clubb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then this valiaunt warriour before the Gyaunt had time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer and lift vp his heauie club againe, stroke him on both his armes such a terrible and furious blow, that he cut them both off, and they fell to the ground. When the Gyant sawe himselfe so sore arayed, like a rauening. Woulfe he ranne to him and would haue imbraced him, but the Emperour with his accustomed knighthoode gaue a thrust at his breast, that by the great strength thereof he thrust his swoorde cleane through his bodie, so that the point came out at his backe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the halfe swoord, wherewith this Gyant gaue so great a fall to the earth, that it séemed a whole Towre had tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled downe.

But what sorrow did I then féele, (nothing thinking of that which shoulde happen, for that my heart was ignoraunt of the knowledge thereof) but to see hir depart from me, for whose absence my heart remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in so great sorrowe and heauinesse: giuing to vnderstand by the outward showes, &amp; by the teares that procéeded from my eyes, the great paine and passion that the lacke thereof wold shortly procure: &amp; in this sorrowfull sort, I was forced almost without any remembraunce, to retourne vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice. And they were not so soone entred into his ships, but as one very gelous to keepe close his treason, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded straight to hoyse vp sayles, and commit them vnto the winde, and hauing too good and prosperous a weather, in a very short time he arriued in his owne Countrie, whereas two leagues from the Citie, he was receiued of his subiects with great maiestie, who brought with them both horse and Palfrayes néedfull for the companie.

And when he sawe his company so farre before, and they two alone together, he stepped on the one side, and ledde the waye into a little groue which was hard at hande, fast by a Riuers side.

O my best beloued Ladie, wherefore wilt thou consent, that for thy cause I shoulde dye, &amp; mayst now very well without being discouered of any, giue mee remedie for the same? Be not then obstinate to denye mée that, which with so great loue I doo desire of thee.

Thinke not false traitour, that the feare of death shall cause mee to yéeld to thy filthie desire. The which béeing well vnderstoode by the king, he sayde. Understande then and bée well perswaded, that either liuing or dead I will performe my will and pretended purpose, which so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure and with vnquenchable fire doth burne in my heart. Thus with great strength she did defend her selfe, and with a manly courage she kepte her honour, but this cruell and lasciuious king séeing that he coulde not fulfill his euill desire, in a greate madnesse he cut off a greate parte of the traine of her gowne, and bound it verie fast to the haire of her head, in such sort, that with the great strength he put thereto, and the tendernesse of the same, together with his euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, all the greene grasse was sprinkeled with the bloud that issued out, whereat he beléeued that she would haue ben quiet, and haue consented vnto him, but she respected not the euill intreating, but the more he procured to torment her, the more angrie she shewed her selfe against him with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deniall.

But for all this, the king did not let to prosecute his crueltie, and with great anger he looked on her, hauing his accursed eyes fixed, in such sorte that he coulde not withdrawe them backe. Then this tormented Ladie séeing him, and béeing verie desirous of the death, with a furious voyce she sayde: What dooest thou thinke thou traitour, the greatest traitour that euer was in the world, wherein dost thou contemplate thy selfe, thou fleshly Butcher, thou vnmercifull Tyger, thou lecherous hogge and dishonourer of the royall crowne, make an ende of these thy tormentes, for it is nowe too late to repent thée, giue mée the death, and sende mée into the bosome of <hi>Diana.</hi> This vnpittifull king, seeing the stedfastnesse that shee hadde in the defence of her honour, with a cruell and infernall

O thou knight that by thy prowesse doest come to read this Harchment, consider the greate constancie and chastitye of this vnfortunate Damosell, and let the griefe thereof moue thee to take vengeaunce of this greate crueltie, shewed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie desert. So when this infernall king sawe that shée was dead, hee tooke his horse and returned from whence hee came, and in a short time he ouertooke his companie, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with so furious and irefull a countenaunce, that there was not one that wae so hardie to aske him where my daughter was, but one of the knightes of my Court which I sent to beare companie with my daughter, hauing a suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the great alteration that appeared in the king, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verie desirous to knowe what was become of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, for that he came alone without bringing her with him, neither coulde he haue anie sight of her, hee then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlye withdrewe himselfe backe, and following the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the horse, he ceased not vntill he came vnto the place whereas this crueltie was wrought, whereas hée found this miserable Ladie lie dead, in the same sorte as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, at the viewe whereof he remained almost beside him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in such sorte that he had almost fallen to the grounde. This Knight remained a good while before he could speake, so when he was come againe to himselfe, hée beganne with a dolorous complaint, crying out against the Gods and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, because they had suffered so greate crueltie to bée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto this damosell, and making this sorrowfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, hée vnloosed her from the trée, and layde her vppon parte of her apparell, and couered her with the rest, and sayde on this wise: O cruell handes, what an infernall heart was that, which did beare thée companie to doe this vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable sacrifice? Was it not sufficient that this surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beautie should haue mooued thée to more pittie. So with these and other lyke sorrowfull wordes that this knight spake vnto the dead corps, he cut downe braunches from the

The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour aunswered and sayde, I am he (who by the helpe of God) may frustrate thy force which thou hast done vnto this Damosell. Then the Gyant sayd, O miserable wretch, how thou art deceiued, what doest thou thinke thy selfe so strong and to haue so much strength to doe that alone, which all the worlde is not able to vndoe, and with greate anger for the wordes which he heard the Emperour speake, he tooke his Speare and did leuell it in his hande, and threwe it at the Emperour with such furie, that the aire did sounde therwith, the Emperour made his defence and receiued it vppon his shéelde, and the point slidde in such sort, that it glaunced and broke in two péeces. When the Emperour sawe that hee threw it at him dart wise, he tooke his Speare fast in his hande, and firming himselfe in his stiroppes he raised vp his bodie and threw his Speare against his enimie with greate strength, who would haue receiued it vppon his sheelde, but the furie was such wherewith it was throwen, that it pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced both through his shéelde and likewise the bodie, that the head was seene come out at the Gyauntes backe, the which terrible blowe béeing séene by them which were in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell, was the occasion that there arose a greate vproare therein. The Emperour gaue thankes to God for this short victorie, and tourned himselfe vnto the Page which came with <hi>Lidia,</hi> and bad him take the Speare out of the Gyants bodie and bring it vnto him, for that it was whole, which presently the Page accomplished. Hée hadde no sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, but hée sawe presently to descende out of the same path waie another great and huge Gyaunt, which séemed
<pb facs="tcp:13973:77"/>
to be no lesse furious then the first.
He came mounted on a a very strong and mightie horse, (for he had neede to be of a great strength, in that he did sustaine the carriage of so mightie a monster as the Giaunt was) and when hée was come whereas the Emperour abode, he looked whether the other Giaunt were altogether dead or not, but when he saw there was no life in him, and that by that onelye blowe hee was slaine, he said: <q>Is it possible mightie brother, that a thing so vile as this is, hath had power so quickly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tourning vnto this noble warriour, he said: Tell me Knight of so wonderfull a courage, what diuell hath brought thee hether, to doo vs so much harme, as the Gods themselues were not sufficient to haue done. The Emperor replied, The Ladie which thou séest héere, brought me hether, to deliuer and set at libertie a knight, which without all reason thou doost kéepe in thy Castle, and which with great treason thou broughtest hether. Of truth I tell thée Giant, that it seemeth very euill in such Knights as thou arte, to commit such outrages, for that nature hath not bestowed on thée these well proportioned members, nor giuen thee a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of so mightie a greatnesse, for to exercise it in dooing of so great wrongs, as you doo daily practise. I therefore doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thee, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour which I owe vnto the order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and for that thy disposition doth greatlye content me, that thou wouldest make satisfaction vnto this faire Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, the which onely I am come to demaund of thée, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that thou wouldest apart thy selfe from these wicked customes: otherwise, beléeue this of a certaintie, that euen as thy brother was slaine with so small a blow, (not béeing by my weake arme killed, but onely by his great tyrannie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded): so likewise if thou dost pretend to lead this tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous life, as thou hast hethertoo done, beléeue me the lyke death will happen vnto thée. Tourne and repeate that once againe which thou hast saide (aunswered the Gyaunt) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thy words may winne me to doo somewhat of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which thou doost request me, although not altogether.

vnderstand that I knowe better how to bestowe my sword vpon thy bones and flesh, then againe to declare that which thou doest demaund, for that I doo see my reasons do little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and that I vtter in vaine my spéeches vnto thee, &amp; thou shalt soone see that the sharpnesse of my Speare shall bée no lesse bitter vnto thee, then it was vnto thy late brother:</q>
and in saying these wordes they retourned their horses the one from the other, like the swift winde, and when they were one straight against the other, both of them stroke theyr hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with the spurres, and bare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Gyaunt with the greate paine that he had of the hurt which he receiued, felt himselfe verie ill, so that his anger did the more increase, and trauesing his horse from the one part vnto the other, procured by all meanes to hurt the Emperour, who was not at that instaunt idle, but according vnto his accustomed valiauntnesse auoyded his blowes, and smote at him such furious and heauie strokes, that hée made the bloud to followe in what place so euer he chaunced with his sworde to hit, and with the great paine that the Gyaunt felte, there procéeded from his helme a verie thicke and hot smoake, his furie and anger was so much to see himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe so manie blowes, and not one of them coulde hurt his enimie, he threw his sheelde from him to the earth, and tooke his swoorde in both his handes, and verie fiercely stroke his horse with his Spurres, which made him to leape the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where as this worthie warriour was, and without

The terrible and fierce Gyaunt would haue giuen him the second blowe, but he could not, for that the Emperour was come againe to himselfe, and being setteled in the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, he firmed his swoorde fast with both his handes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incensed with greate anger and furie, insomuch that fire flashed out at both his eyes, he strake his horse with his spurres, and thrust himselfe forward, saying: Tarrie, tarrie thou furious beast, for that I meane to reuenge my selfe of the blowe past that thou gauest mée, and without delay send thy dampned soule deseruedly to the diuell of hell, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he stroke the diuellish Gyaunt such a blowe vpon the helme, that he made it sound like a bell, and he without anie remembraunce fell downe backwards vppon his horse crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the blowe was so terrible and deliuered with so greate strength, that the bloud started out both at his eies and at his nose. And as the Emperour would haue turned to haue stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him againe, he heard one with a great noise that called aloude and sayd: Stand still vile knight and hold thy hands, except thou wilt die the death. The Emperour lifting vp his head to see who it was that with so great arrogancie threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, beheld another Giant which descended downe from the Castell, of a greater stature, and séeming to be of more strength and furie then the other two, which by reason of his greatnesse was faine to goe on foote, for that there was no horse able to beare him. When the Emperour sawe a thing so monstrous comming towards him, he said with an angry voice: Cursed he that euill and diuellish generation from whence such monsters doth procéede, if it please God I will doe my best to abate this thy courage, and in this time the Gyaunt was come to himselfe and rose vp againe, and was prepared against the Emperour, who seeing him so nigh, with purpose to strike him, tooke the aduauntage, and stroke first, with such an ouerthwart blowe, that by the force ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13973:78"/>
it cut his throate, necke and all, so that the head fell downe to the earth, and the bodie also like the corner of a great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell. This other Gyant seeing his brother dead in such sort, cryed out reuiling his Gods, and with blaspheming of all creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee descended downe the hill, and drew out his huge and mightie sworde, pressing towards the Emperour, with such furie, as commonly the fierce Lyon doth after his praie, which béeing wel perceiued by the Emperour, he auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a little on the one side with his horse, &amp; lighted in greate hast, and with his accustomed courage hee went to méete the Gyant, who was readie with his sword in his hand, &amp; came &amp; stroke at the Emperour a mightie blow, which he receiued vpon his shéeld, that did then deceiue him, and by reason ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it fell downe vpon his healme, and made him s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Emperour seeing that it was not then time to sléepe, and that the Gyaunt had his swoord ouer him to strike him againe, he béeing somewhat troubled, stepped aside and cléered himselfe from the fall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therwith preased to the Gyant before he could againe recouer his terrible swoorde, to bestow on him a blow core<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to his rage, and stroke him vpon the arme, but by reason that the Emperour was not wholy come to himselfe of the former blow he receiued, he could not repaie him with his whole strength as his heart desired, or as he would if hee had ben come to himselfe, notwithstanding it was not so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but that his sword cut his arme to the bone, wherwith he was so sore hurt that he could not lift his sworde from the ground, with the paine whereof the Gyant did feele himselfe verie ill, and was constrained to chaunge his sword into his left hand, with the which he stroke blowes verie much out of order. In this time the Emperour stroke at him so terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thicke, that it did almost amaze him, &amp; when the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant sawe himselfe so ill intreated, he began with a terryble voice to call for helpe of his people from the Castell. The which béeing vnderstoode by the valyaunt and heroycall Emperour, he sayd: no thou traitour, for neither thy strength
<pb facs="tcp:13973:79"/>
nor thy Gods, nor thy people shall deliuer thée, but thou shalt die by my handes, and therewith hée stroke at him the faster and with more courage, but within a small time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he sawe descending from the Castell another mightie gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and in his company more then fortie knights, who with greate showting descended downe the hill, the which beeing séene by the worthie <hi>Trebatio,</hi> he was perswaded certainly that there hee shoulde dye. And although he was somewhat wearie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great trauaile which had passed, yet hée purposed to sell his lyfe verie déere, determining that they should paie well for it before he lost it. Then all they which descended from the Castell did compasse the Emperour rounde about, and stroke him on euerie side without mercie or pittie, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer had bene there to haue séene this worthie warriour, should haue had iust occasion to saie that there was the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> the flower of all knighthoode, for that he alone defended himselfe against his enimies, in that great extremitie, and if those gyants had not so pressed vpon him, he had estéemed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other knights verie little, but it were the gyants that did most trouble and molest him, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he that did come in the daunger of his blowes, might thinke himselfe bewitched or to haue euill fortune, for either he was slaine or else maimed, or beaten downe to the grounde, but yet all this valour that he vsed little profited him, except hée did first procure to destroie these two diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Gyauntes, who through their might brought him into great perplexitie, making him sometimes to decline with his handes to the earth, and at other times also to stagger heere and there. And these shamelesse people by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate noise of their Lordes, procured on euerie side to hurt and molest the Emperour, and with the same noyse there descended from the Castell more then thrée score persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides them that were there before. But when the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> sawe himselfe so euill intreated and beset on euery side round about, he called vppon the name of God, and desired him of pardon for all his sinnes, and that he would haue mercie on his soule, for that he thought verily there to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13973:79"/>
end his life, and therwith he encouraged himselfe a new, and gathered such strength to his heart, that what with the iust quarrell he had, and the great anger he conceiued, hee gaue vnto that Gyant (who had called for succour) such a terrible blowe vpon the wast, that for all the greate force of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, it had almost parted him in two péeces, wherewith hée fell dead at his féet. And at the verie same instaunt hée stroke one of the knightes such another blowe vpon the helme, that he diuided both it and his head downe to the shoulders. The other Gyant when he sawe such meruailous blowes, began to exclaime out against <hi>Mars,</hi> reuiling him, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed so much strength and force on one knight, to declare such prowesse as there the Emperour shewed. The rest of the knightes were somwhat afraide of that which they had séene done, and durst not prease so nigh as before they did, yet by reason of the great feare they had of the Gyant, they did not let greatly to molest and trouble him, and they preased vpon him in such wise that he waxed wearie, so that his good heart and noble courage wold little preuaile him, but that he must néedes be ouercome and slaine. The sad and sorrowfull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Lidia</hi> when she sawe the Emperour in such great perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie, with crossing and wringing her hands, and with bitter wéepings she sayd.</p>

                  <q>O most vnhappie and vnfortunate wretch that I am, it had bene much better that I alone had suffered these my paines and passions, then that this noble Emperour should loose his life in my quarrell, which will be the occasion of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much sorrowe and great tribulation vnto the most high and noblest ladie in the world. O famous knight of the Sun, oh renowmed <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> what may you saie when you shall heare that for my cause your father that worthie Emperour should be slaine, it had ben better for me (miserable as I am) to haue bene transported into a plant as <hi>Daphne</hi> was, &amp; not to haue caused that for my comfort so much harme should be done, vnlesse it had pleased y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goddesse <hi>Iuno</hi> to make an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting memory of this my true and perfect loue, as she did by <hi>Celos</hi> in so many Nymphs, of whom vnto this daie their
<pb facs="tcp:13973:80"/>
memorie doth surmount the high Throne of their celestiall seates. Oh noble Emperour, who by thy surpassing excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hast brought thy selfe to die amongst barbarous people, whereas without all hope of anie helpe, or anie respect of thy mightie estate, thou must receiue the death. Héere I do make a vowe, that before death doth depriue thée of this great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and strength, to destroye my selfe in recompence of the great wrong that I haue committed against thée.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The valiaunt <hi>Rosicleer</hi> which at that time God and good fortune had brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, did cause hir to cease this hir sorrowful lamentation. If you do remember, this is the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell I tolde you of, whereas I lefte <hi>Rosicleer</hi> beholding the great wrong and outrage that so many did against one onely knight. And likewise he did consider the surmounted prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse which that one knight vsed, and because he was armed with contrarie armour, he could not know who it was, and much meruailing at that he sawe, without anie more tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he lighted from his horse and laide hand on his swoord, &amp; with great furie and anger he pressed in amongst these false knights, and the first that he did encounter with, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Gyant, to whom he lent such a blow vpon the legge that he cut it a sunder, and with the force thereof he hurt the other legge by the knée, in such sort that he must néedes fall to the ground, not being able by any strength to sustaine or helpe himselfe. The Gyant séeing, &amp; to his paine féeling so furious a blow, cryed with a loude voice, saying: Upon them valiant warriours, for they are of no force nor abilitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, at which noyse the Emperour tourned his head aside, and sawe whereas the Gyaunt laye all along on the earth, by force of that most terrible and cruell blowe. Also hée sawe howe this noble knight besturred himselfe amongest the rest of the Gyauntes knightes, which was a valyaunt sight to bée séene, wherfore he remained a good while in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and viewing him, till at the last he knewe him to bée his worthie sonne, euen that renowmed and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> I néede not héere to declare the excéeding great
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13973:80"/>
ioye and comfort which this worthie Emperour receiued in seeing him, and especially at such a time beeing in great neede and necessitie, for of long time before that hée had not seene him, neither had he thought euer to haue séene him after that time anie more, if at that instant hee had not come vnlooked for, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he coulde not choose but to haue bene slaine by those barbarous and vnciuile people. Then gathering vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe newe strength and courage, he pressed in amongst those false and wicked knightes, in such sorte that they beganne to runne awaie, as well because they sawe their Lordes and Captaines slaine, as also for that they coulde not in anie wise abide the terrible blowes of the Prince. So these two valiaunt warriours besturred themselues, that they were constrained in hope to saue theyr liues to tourne their backes, and tooke the waie vp the hill towardes the Castell, but this valiaunt <hi>Rosicleer</hi> followed them with so greate lightnesse, that before they came halfe waie vp the hill, hée had slaine the greater parte of them. Then the rest which sawe themselues so euill intreated, tourned altogether and pressed on him in such sorte, that by theyr force they hadde almost constrained him to tumble backwarde downe the hill, at which hée was meruailously wroth, and therewith like a couragious Knight hée pressed amongest them with so much furie, that with cutting off armes and heads, hée made them lesse then they were by the one halfe.
The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour by reason of his great wearinesse and trauaile which he sustained, remained at the foote of the hill whereas the first incounter was, but when he heard the moouing and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the people, hée tooke the waye vp the hill with so great lightnesse, as though the battaile had but then begun, and after him followed the fayre and beautifull <hi>Lidia,</hi> but when the Emperour came in sight, he beheld how the Prince with great courage followed after those wretched people eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the gate of the Castle, for they thought to saue themselues if they might by anie meanes get in at the gates, pretending to make it fast vnto them, but this valiant <hi>Greeke</hi> pursued them with so great swiftnesse that they had no time to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
<pb facs="tcp:13973:81"/>
that, which they hadde determined, for at such time as they would haue shut the gates, he approched them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed their desire with cutting and hewing them, in such sort, that he entered into the Castell in spite of their heartes, and those that were within would haue made resistaunce at such time as he was in the great Court, but this valiaunt Prince did threaten them, saying.<q> O you wicked &amp; contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous villains yéeld your selues prisoners, for be certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded you shall finde more in me by humilitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king resistaunce.</q>
There was one knight which remained, and hauing more ciuilitie then the rest, aunswered and sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Ualyaunt Knight, if we hadde thought euer to haue found in thée so much mercifull clemencie, as wée haue found mightie courage, verily long since we wold haue yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our selues: now therefore we doe desire thée if there bée in thée anie iot of pittie, to manifest thy clemencie vnto vs, for considering wée were seruauntes vnto those Gyauntes, we were by duetie bound to defend them, and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to our powers, offend you. Then this noble prince promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them their liues, conditionally that they should yéeld and surrender themselues.</q>
In this time the Emperour letted not to inlarge his pace for to come to the aide and defence of the Prince, but when he came thether, he found that he was in quiet, &amp; that all those that were left in the Castle requested peace, and when the Emperour sawe that it was then time to discouer himselfe, full of great ioy he fell vppon <hi>Rosicleer</hi> his necke, and sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Oh my sonne, I did well vnderstand that in the time of my greatest necessitie, that thou wouldest neuer deceiue me, with greate reason I may call thée my fortunate sonne, not for that thou wert borne in a good daie, but also that loue did cause so greate affection to thy mother, of whome hath procéeded such finite as thou and thy brother.</q>
Nowe of this worthie Prince what shall I saye, that with verie ioye he was almost beside himselfe when he heard his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperour speake, for by the sounde of his voyce
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13973:81"/>
he did know him. So straight waye the Emperour pulled of his helme, wherewith this valiaunt <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued and without all doubt. When he sawe the maiestie of his regall countenaunce, and his bearde adorned with some royall white haires, his face somewhat high coloured, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great trauaile he receiued in his late battailes, in the which he showed his great power, and the prowesse of the progenie from whence he did procéede: his sonne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe his knées to the earth, and lifted vp the visour of his healme, and kissed the Emperours hands, bathing them with the teares, that fell from his eyes, which was forced by his heart, for the great ioye which he receiued. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour tooke him by the hand, &amp; raysed him from the ground with great loue. If I should héere declare the rest of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, that passed in this their ioyfull méeting, it should be very tedious vnto the hearers, therfore I doo remit it vnto such a father, whose lot it is to haue good children, &amp; therwith their like helpe in necessitie. So without making any more delay, the Emperour would haue deliuered out of prison the Knight of this faire <hi>Lidia,</hi> the which being vnderstoode by them of the Castle, they straight waye brought him before the Emperour, with many other moe, which were pertakers with him in the succour of the Lady. These Knightes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether gaue great thankes vnto the Emperour, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship he had shewed them, in helping them out of this theyr terrible imprisonment. And thus they remained in great ioy and pleasure, as well the Emperour for the sight of his son, as also all those which were prisoners, for the good successe, that they had, but especially and aboue all the rest, was the ioye of <hi>Lidia,</hi> which with the contentment that she receiued to sée hir <hi>Brenio</hi> in hir companie, so that she was almost ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished of hir wits: but in the countenaunce of the Knight, it appeared by his outward showe, that he receiued no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: the which being vnderstoode by this faire <hi>Lidia,</hi> not knowing the cause whereof it should procéede to mooue him therevnto, all hir great ioye and delight, was tourned into despaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:82"/>Then the Emperour commaunded those of the Castle, that they should giue him somewhat to eate, and likewise to all the rest which were taken out of prison: vnto him for the great trauaile which he had passed in this battaile, and vnto the rest, for that they had great néed thereof. So it was straight way made ready, and that in very good order, and they all sate downe together, at the Emperours table.

With these and such like extremities, the night passed away, and when the lightnesse of the daye had entred in at the windowes of the chamber, he arose from his bed, and likewise this sorrowfull Ladie, which had passed all the night, with heauie wéepings, and sorrowfull sighes, without putting of hir clothes, in such sort she went out and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
               <p>The Emperour was then risen and readie, and was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things in order that was necessarye to pacifie and make quiet the people of the countrie: the which was done with great ease, when it was knowen that their Lords wer dead, whom they did without all measure hate, for that they were so great tyrants: and foure great Cities, beside manye other faire townes and villages, did yéelde and surrender themselues vnder his iurisdiction. The Emperour caused them to sweare to receiue <hi>Rosicleer</hi> as their true Lord, and they to be his faithfull subiects, and with them likewise all the whole dominion, the which they did with a verye good will: and the Emperour appoynted a gouernour amongest them, to gouerne all the land. All this béeing finished, and that the Ilande was in peace and quietnesse, he commanded to make readie two galleyes, the one for the faire <hi>Lidia</hi> and hir <hi>Brenio,</hi> and the other for his owne person, for that hée would depart for <hi>Africa.</hi> So all things was prouided pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently in good order, and being readie, the Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the faire <hi>Lidia</hi> to imbarke hir selfe, and to carrye with hir hir Knight, who straight waye went aboorde the galley, and commaunded the marriners to take their course towards <hi>Spaine.</hi> Likewise the Emperour did take his leaue of all them of the Castle: who for his noble customes and valiaunt Knighthoode, after that they knewe who he was, they both feared and loued him with all their hearts. And

when he was imbarked in the galley, he commaunded the marriners to take the way towards <hi>Africa.</hi>

Thus they remained three dayes &amp; three nights in this great danger, &amp; the fourth day they wer driuen a land, at a small Ilande vninhabited, that was called <hi>Rees.</hi> This Ilande was hid in the sea very farre from anye lande, and was poynted with very great rockes. Ther they came to an anker with their galley, and for to refresh and ease themselues of their great trauaile which they had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they went a lande, and commaunded to raise vp a fayre Tent which they brought with them, and therein they made a bed, whereon <hi>Brenio</hi> laye downe to ease himselfe: and this faire <hi>Lidia</hi> leaned on the bed side by him, and was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in quiet, for that she sawe that the sadnesse of her Knight was a little abated. And by reason of the great paine and dolor that she had receiued, and the vnquietnesse in the tempest: and againe, for the contentment she had, to sée her Knight in better quiet, her wearied body required some rest, in such sort, that as she was leaning on the beddes side, she fell a sléepe. This false <hi>Brenio</hi> when he sawe her at rest and in a sound sleepe, in great secret he arose from the bedde, and went vnto the waters side whereas he had lefte the galley, and entering therein, he commaunded all those that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande to imbarke themselues, and to hayse vp the sayles, and wold not by any meanes tarry, til that the seas were calme, but rather did put himselfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peril of these furious waues, then to inioye the swéetnesse of this faire Damosell: and lefte her all alone, in this desolate and vnpeopled Ilande.

This dreaming la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die seeing this, determined to make her owne defence so well as she could, it séemed vnto her that there appeared before her a Centaure, which said, feare not faire damsell, for I am come hether to aide &amp; succour thée: yet for all that, this wilde man did not let to strike her vpon the breast, and as it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to her, her breast was all open, and how that the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taure put his hand into the wound, and pulled out hir heart, and threw it at the wilde man, and sayd, Take vnto thée this heart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without all consideration loued a man, which with such ingratitude hath rewarded her. So straight at the same instant there appeared a Knight, which likewise layd holde on the heart with the wild man, and they two striued great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwéene themselues with much contention, who shoulde pull the heart out of the others handes: but in the end, each of them remained with his péece in his hand, and the hearte parted in two. So the péece which remained in the power of the wilde man, tourned into a harde stone, and that péece which remained in the power of the knight, tourned into red bloud, and being in this great perplexitie, this sorrowfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die did awake, thinking to haue tolde this terrible dreame vnto her beloued <hi>Brenio,</hi> but she found him not in place, and tourning her face to the other part, to sée if she coulde sée him, but she could neither behold him, nor any other person, of whome she might enquire. Wherewith she leaped from the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13973:84"/>
bed, and with a loud voyce, she began to call for hir <hi>Brenio</hi>: but all was in vaine. So with a swift pace she went down to the waters side, thinking to haue found him there. But at her comming thether, she found neither him nor any other person, neither the galley which brought them thether. Then she looked to sea wards, to sée if she could disouer any thing, but she could see nothing but water, which was the occasion that she made great lamentation. And being verye hoarce with the terrible shrike which she gaue, shée went vp vpon a little rock which was nigh the waters side, from whence she did discouer the galley, in the which was her vnlouing <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> whereby she perceiued plainly how she was deceiued, &amp; how she bestowed her affection, whereas was nothing but falshoode: although before time she could not perswade w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her selfe, that so great treason remained in his heart. The great sorrowes and lamentations which this forsaken La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made, was sufficient to mooue the stones vnto compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus being wearie with lamenting, she sate her downe vpon the little rocke, and leaning her chéeke vpon her white hande, she fell in a great sound, in such sorte, that in a longe space shée moued neither hande nor foote, but when she came againe vnto her selfe, she bagan a new to make great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and did publish her paine with terrible shrikes, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<q> Why was I not drowned in the Sea, that the fishes thereof might haue torne my bodie in péeces, or else to haue bene deliuered into the handes of tyrauntes, to haue vsed their tyrannie against me, that my heart might not haue felte this sorrowe, neither my eies haue séene this crueltie? O vnhappie chaunce, oh cruell fortune, why diddest thou not make mée to passe this bitter and sorrowfull life in my childhoode, in such sorte, that it hadde consumed me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Gods permit and suffer mée to liue so long, it had béene farre better that I had dyed in my Cradell, and not to liue to sée my selfe in this greate affliction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all helpe: O you mountaines, O you wilde beastes, O you déepe sea, there is not in you anie sence to hinder me, but that I maye publish heere the greate disloyaltie of that

O cruell and ingratefull fortune, I sée that héere plainly without all pittie, thou doost driue me to the death, and although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault be others, yet thou doost apply the paine to be mine. And in this sort, with great griefe, the sorrowfull and vnfortunate Lady did torment hir selfe.</p>
               <p>So likewise, by reason of the great tempest and torment of the sea, (whereof we before spake) there arriued nigh the same place, a Knight, with no lesse daunger, then the others that landed there before. The Pilot séeing that <hi>Aeolus</hi> had shut vp his windes, and made fast the gates in such sorte, that the sayle beate against the maste of the galley, that they were constrained by the force of oares to retourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to sea. For that they did sée by all sea-faring tokens, that the weather would be troublesome: they did perceiue it also by the <hi>Cornesa,</hi> also by séeing the Dolphins, leaping and plunging in the sea, more then they were accustomed to doo. These and such like tokens the wise Pilot did consider off, who desired to take part where as hee might defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from that terrible weather looked for. So with this great desire they stroke the water with their Oares, &amp; with great furie they tormented their armes, to get to the lande: but the fatall Quéene <hi>Atrapos,</hi> would not consent therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for that at the houre when the troubled Moone, did extend hir beames vppon the face of the earth, and vppon the large and déepe Sea, then the winde <hi>Boreas</hi> began to blowe his blast, so that it constrained them of the galley to bring their saile to a bowe line, and to strike it very lowe, which made the vessell to tumble and roll from the one parte to the other, in such sort, that euerie time of hir tourning, all they that were in hir, thought to be drowned. Then the marriners thought good to strike and amaine their sayle, the which they did in great hast, and laboured to profite themselues with their oares and by the strength of their armes. But in the ende, when they sawe that neither sayle nor oares would profite them, they committed themselues vnto God, and lefte the Galley and all their goods vnto his gracious
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13973:85"/>
will, and the furie of water, which beganne presently to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate them in such sort, that it gaue them plainly to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of their destruction. This was the Galley in which the Emperour departed in, at such time as the Ladie <hi>Lidia</hi> did take her leaue, wherein he tooke but small rest, alwayes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to aide and helpe whereas most necessitie required, in throwing out water which troubled them verie much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driuen by those mightie waues into the Galley. Thus were they tossed and tumbled all the night looking, euerie houre for death, at length the Sun appeared and shewed his golden face, whereby he did declare the cruell stormes &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests which was past, and likewise gaue shew of that which was to come, by reason that it was darkned vpon a sodaine, and shewed a heauie chéere: so the windes began to arise &amp; blew more and more, and the waues increased and rose of a great and huge height, beating vpon the galley with such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent force, that being taken betwéene two billowes, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley brake a sunder in the middest. These sorrowfull marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which vntill that time had trauailed and fought with the wind and sea to defend their galley &amp; to saue their liues, were now constrained to striue with death, and indeauour with all their strengths by swimming for to come to the shoare, but all would not serue for theyr defence, for waxing wearie by the great force of the waters, béeing able no longer to indure, they yéelded themselues into the handes of God, and their bodies to the furie of the sea, wherein they finished theyr liues, the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> being holpen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand of God, vppon whom he alwaies called in his heart, desiring to deliuer him from so terrible a death, praieng him for the merits of that mightie mediator Iesus Christ, that he would succour and defend him, who of his wonted mercie heard him, &amp; would not permit that he should perish, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he laid hold of a boord which was broken from the galley, and made himselfe fast therto, though it were with some labour, neuertheles this distressed Emperour thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ende of his daies were at hand, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mightie waues kept him a great while vnder the water, &amp; when hee discouered himselfe

To the which aunswere one that was in companie, who séemed to be of greater estate then all the rest, sayde: that he doth rather séeme to bée some robber and théefe, and one that doth lead an ill life, more then a knight of prowesse, and that the sword which he weareth, he hath stollen from some trauailing knight, let me come and I will awake him out of his sound sléepe, and I will take this sword from him which doth not become him to weare, for it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him, and without anie more delay he alighted off from his horse to séeke his owne death (as it fell out) for when he came to the Emperour, he pulled him by the beard with so much strength, that spite of his heart he did awake him, but when the Emperour awaked and sawe the hands of that villanous knight fast vpon his beard (which was full of haires) he with his left hand stroke him such a blowe vppon the breast, that he made him to recoile backe, and whether he would or no, he fell to the ground with the force thereof, and with great anger he rose vp, (not making anie outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the great and incomperable trauaile that he had passed) he laide hand on his sword, and without tarrying till the other did arise, he stroke him such a blow vpon the head that he cut him downe to the breast, so that he fell downe dead to the ground, in this sort he gaue him his paiment for his great and vnseemely pride: these knights that came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were eight in number, but when the rest sawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the Emperour did, they prepared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to fight, &amp; lighting from their horses they laid hands on their swords, &amp; wrapped their cloaks about their armes, &amp; then began a cruell battel,

but when this mightie <hi>Trebatio</hi> sawe himselfe so beset with the other seauen knights, he determined to sell his death ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deere, or else to kill them all, and as you doo see the greedie Lyon ranging the Countrie with his haire bristeled, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with great hunger to finde his praie: euen so the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Emperour began to strike with his strong arme, flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing with it in such sort, that on whom it chaunced to light, he had no néede of a Surgion to heale him.

There was a lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie that came with them, which when he sawe this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the knights, tooke the horse of one of them that was slaine, and in great hast he gallopped with him towards the pallace, crieng with a loude voice: Armour, armour, come knightes quickly and helpe, for that there is slaine the Earle of <hi>Modique</hi> his sonne, and all the rest that were with him, the quéene and Ladie of that Countrie, when she heard that great noise, she looked out of her closet, and asked who had done that murther, to whome the Lackie answered, that one onely knight vnarmed, whom they found a slape at the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fountaine, hath slaine them. These wordes caused great alteration amongest all them in the pallace, and in great hast they called for theyr armour to arme themselues, but this faire quéene asked farther of the Lackie, what was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which these eight knightes offered, to cause that knight to attempt so hard an enterprise, who tolde and declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her all that you haue hearde, and when shée vnderstoode the whole circumstaunce, she commaunded straight that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare to cease, and that there should other eight knights goe and procure to take and bring him prisoner, without dooing him anie harme, for that she was desirous to know what hee should be that was of so valiaunt courage and so greate a strength. So straight waie at the commaundement of the quéene these eight knights were readie and armed, and went to the place whereas they were still in battaile, and at such time as they approched, there was but two left of the eyght,

Then the Prince did call to remembraunce, that she should be the Lady which was in the Chariot, as well by her speaches, as by the apparell she wore, to whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and sayd:<q> Ladye, for your great griefe I am verye sorie, and surely I should receiue much more griefe, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should not fall out, wherein I might doo you seruice. Not for so much in that I owe by duetie vnto knighthoode, as it is to be at your commaundement: and more, it is the wil of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor my father, to labor to obtaine you all the ease and contentment, that possibly I could: and therefore onely for this cause and purpose, he commaunded me to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court: so that whensoeuer you thinke it necessarye to put your necessitie in vre.

The Quéene of <hi>Lira</hi> was not a litle ioyfull of this she heard, and gaue great-thanks both vnto the one and vnto the other, for their great courtesie showed, and sayde.<q> Noble and valiant Princes, I doo conceiue very much ioye in this your great curtesies offered vnto me, touching the restoring me agayne vnto my kingdome: but in the meane time that you doo pretend to make me this restitution, and likewise in satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of this great curtesie which you haue offered, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séech you to procure vnto me (hauing so good opportunitie, &amp;

Then the Prince sayd.

His power and strength was such, that he was not onely feared of them of the Iland, but also of all other Kings and Knights, borderers and confines vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Iland. He was fifteene cubites in height, and his face very furious and wilde, and his strength surpassed the power of men. And aboue all he was very cruell, and had vsurped that land of another Giant, who by lineall descent should haue had the gouernment, whose name was called <hi>Galtenor.</hi> This was he, which in a Serpentine figure ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the chamber of the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> and stole away her two children, for that he did knowe by his arte Magicke (in the which he was very cunning and expert) that he could not recouer his Iland, but by meanes of the young sonne, whereof the Empresse shuld be deliuered.

This Gyant did determin not to depart from that place, til such time as they came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to age, for that the countrey did lyke them very well. So they were there sixe yeres without remoouing from thence to any other place, in the which time these Infantes were so great of body that they séemed to be of a dossen yeres of age. <hi>Claridiano</hi> was of a meruailous and faire beautie, but the infant <hi>Rosaluira</hi> was without comparison, more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie humane creature.

               <p>There was nigh that place a shepheard, which kepte cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine shéepe, &amp; with that exercise he passed his lyfe, (although with great miserie) and in a very poore and little cottage, who séeing that Infant all alone, and so gallantlye ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with rich apparell, he drew néere the place whereas she was, and looked round about him towardes all parts, to sée if there were any that came after her to séeke her, or if shée had any kéeper: but when he sawe that there was no body, he tooke her by the hand, and the childe followed him with a verye good will, alwaies looking him in the face. The Shepheard spake vnto her in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> tongue, and the childe spake vnto him in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> tongue, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of him somewhat to eate, with a smiling countenance: this shepheard did partly vnderstand her &amp; lead her vnto his house, and gaue her a dish of milke and sops of bread, and the

childe being a hungred did eate it with a very good will. The shepheards wife, who was somewhat discréete, séeing the great riches, that this infant <hi>Rosaluira</hi> had about her, sayde, Husband, I do beléeue that this child is of some high lignage as it doth appeare by her apparell, and surmounted beautie. It shall be verye well, that we doo kéepe her héere till such time as we doo know what she is.

This shepheard receiued great ioye with the finding this childe, acknowledging all that which his wife had sayd vnto him, to be very good and well spoken: and so in great secret they kept her eight dayes, maintaining her in the best wise they could, with such meates as they were accustomed to eate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hauing a great care, at all times when he went to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roshlima,</hi> to demaund if there were any inquirie for such a childe, although he beléeued for a certaintie, that she was of some straunge Countrey, by reason of her apparaile, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent language, which was an occasion that they put in practise their determined purpose: and laing all feare apart, they tooke from her, her rich apparrell, and put on shepheards apparell, as was accustomed amongest them, wherewith this childe was as well content, as with the other: and vnder that course raiment, she did discouer so great and surpassing fairenesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Diana</hi> was almost ashamed to extend her siluer beames, whereas this young feminine shepheard did walke, who alwayes carried in her hande a litle shepheards crooke, and following the shéepe whereas they did féed, many times with her golden haire about hir shoulders, being of so great beautie, that the glistering beames of <hi>Appollo</hi> passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, appeared to haue no vauntage of it.

               <p>This is that which I denie, aunswered the Prince vnto these words, and with a high voyce, he sayde, Knight whosoeuer thou art, come forth and defende this great lye, which euen now thou spakest, for it shall not be aunswered with any other thing, but with the losse of thy life. So their barkes were ioyned one with another, which the Prince see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he went and would haue leapt into the other boat: but he was disturbed by the comming forth of a verie well set Knight against him, being of a good proportion, who hadde heard the words which the Prince had sayd, and for to sée who it was which spake them, he came from vnder the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the barke. He was armed with gréene armour, the most richest that euer Knight did weare, &amp; was full of these two letters <hi>F.F.</hi> all gylte. This Knight of the barke issued out not hauing his helme on his head, who discouered a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faire face, such as hath not bene séene, but onelye that of the Prince, his beard began to bud as yeolow as the golde, and his haire was of the same colour. And when hée sawe that the Knight of the Sunne had his healme on his head, and that he was a Knight of so gentle disposition, and with so rich armour, he almost suspected who it should be, &amp; sayd with great grauitie, It is not séemelye (especiallye in a Knight of such disposition as you séeme to be) to speake such proude words as you haue vttered, and aboue all, vnto one that doth estéeme them so little as I doo. The knight of the sun at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time was not to strain any curtesie, but answered, It is worse in them which doo presume of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues as thou dost, to speake lies &amp; commit villany, in estéeming so little of them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not onely in beautie far passing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fairnes of this Ladie whom thou so honorest, but also of more, then any in

The Knight of the Sunne came straight waye to himselfe, and lifting vp his mightie arme, he chaunced such a blowe vppon the helme of his enimie (which was as harde and strong as a Dimond) that it gaue such sound, that all the sea was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with the noyse thereof. And made him to boowe with both his knées to the grounde.

                  </gap>, and lent vnto the Prince such another blowe, and with so greate anger, that as it hit him on the wast, it made him to fall sidewards to the fore ship. The Prince didde not meruayle much thereat, but was straight way with him againe, and stroke him so mightie
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13973:98"/>
a blowe vpon the helme, that it made the bloud start out at his eyes and at his nose, and he was so troubled therewith, that he thought a great tower had fallen downe vpon him. The Prince seeing him in this traunce, did procure to leape into his barke, but the gréene Knight by reason he was not fully astonished, with both his hands thrust at the Knight of the Sunne vpon his breast, for to hinder him from his entring, so that spite of his heart he made him to recoyle, and that in such sort, that he lacked but a little to fall downe backwards, which was the occasion, that his anger did the more increase. And either of them firming themselues on their feete, there began a new the battaile, with so great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and furie, that the marriners thought, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at euery blowe the battaile would haue bene ended. Neuerthelesse, the more they did fight, the more their anger did increase, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr fierce blowes wer inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perable. Oh how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sun fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d himselfe troubled to sée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great strength of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> except it were in the Knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> only, he neuer in any other had found the like courage &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, as he did in this Knight with the gréene armour, who lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise did no lesse meruaile at the power of the Knight of the Sunne: and with this, in either of them increased greate courage, with like desire to ouercome their enimies, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to strike the one the other with great furie, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed so their blowes, that neither of them was without his payment. The Prince was meruailously amazed to sée that the courage of his enimie did so long indure, which caused his anger in very straunge manner to increase in such sort, that he strake at him such strong and incomperable blowes that they were not to be suffered, and almost no resistance to be made. So long they indured the battaile, that the Sunne had made an ende of his ordinary course, &amp; the heauie and mourning night began to throwe his mantle euer all the earth, in such sort that they could scarce see: but they were so kindled in their anger, &amp; so furious in their battaile, that the darknes was not sufficient to seperate them, but they called with a great noyse for lights, that they might make

an end of their battaile, but <hi>Tefereo</hi> séeing their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conceiued great griefe that such a valiaunt knight as hée with the greene armour should runne in any danger of peril, he did perswade with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marriners, &amp; made signes that they should vngrapple their barkes, and béeing moued with great compassion they procured to doe it, so priuely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the knights might not perceiue it, the which was easily accomplished, for that they were so blinded in fiercenesse of this their battell, that they could not intend to marke it. The grapples wer no sooner taken off, when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the barke of the knight of the Sun with great force did seperate himselfe from the other, which when the prince did sée, and that he could not finish his desire, he was purposed to throw himselfe into the sea, for to come vnto his aduersarie, but considering that it woulde little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him, he beganne to exclaime against <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> to be his enimie and a robber of his honour, and saying that he was a vile man and of base bloud and lignage: with this and such like reproch, and other irefull thoughtes, the Prince went onwarde his iourney, and vppon a sodaine his Galley stroke a lande, and in a trice hée leapt out of her, and after him went out <hi>Tefereo,</hi> and caused theyr horses to bée ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, and put them into a faire medowe full of verie faire and gréene grasse, where as they did féede. The knight of the Sunne béeing verie full of thoughtes and pensiue, hée woulde not consent that anie shoulde speake with him, but got him amongest a companie of fresh and gréene trées, where as hée remained till the morning. So verie earlye in the morning at the breake of the daie hee called for his horse, and when all that were with him were in a readinesse, hée beganne to iourney, and tooke his waie through a verye straight and narowe path, which brought them vnto a verie broad &amp; common beaten waie, so they had not trauailed long in it, when they sawe comming a Damsell with a verie sad and sorrowfull countenaunce, as appeared by the greate quantitie of teares which procéeded from her eyes, and shée came in greate hast riding on her Palfraie, and when shée came nigh whereas the Prince was, hée and all that were

                  <hi>Tefereo</hi> who was not so troubled in his minde as the Prince was, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and sayde:

At length, the long desired houre drew on, of their appointment, and the Earle repayred vnto the place: he was scant there, when that the Damosell likewise appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, almost at the same instant, and the Earle receiued her with great contentment: but the damsell said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she had no time to haue any great talke with him, but onely my Lorde this I say vnto you, that this night at midnight she wil tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thy comming, wheras thou shalt fulfill all thy desire, and giue thée to vnderstand, how that she is not culpable of all these thy passed sorrowes and griefes, (naming a méeting place, which after shall be declared).

The Earle went vnto his lodging, where he remained, and tarried vntil the time appointed, the which he thought very long, imagining euery minute a whole houre. The houre being come, he went alone vnto the place appoynted, and couered himselfe with a mantle of cloath of golde. He tarried not long ther, when that this infortunate <hi>Tarfina,</hi> put her selfe vpon a wal, wher as she put downe a péece of timber, whereby the Earle shuld laye holde on for to goe vp.</q>

The which when that the Earle sawe, and knewe that they wer her garments, he thought berely that she had bene his Lady so long desired, and without anye more thinking, he fell downe vpon his knées, and taking her by the handes, he kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them many times, and so both of them by great pollicie and deceite, and with excéeding ioye, did fulfill their desires, and tooke their leaue each of other, with many pleasaunt and sweete wordes, fearing that the daye would appeare, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. The Earle retourned vnto his lodging, wheras hée passed the rest of the darke night with great contentment. This Damosell did the like, putting from her those vsurped roabes of the honestie and honour of her Lady the Princes. So the next morning when it was day, the Earle rose vp, and apparayled himselfe with the most richest apparrel that he had, and went vnto the Kings pallaice somwhat betimes, and so walking round about out of one chamber vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill such time as he came vnto the chamber whereas the Princesse was, he lifted vp a cloath which was before the dore, where he might well discouer the innocent Ladye, with a praier booke in her hande, vsing her accustomed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp; daily deuotion.

               <p>Traitour, thou shalt not cléere thy selfe as thou doest thinke to doe, hauing committed so greate treason as thou hast done, and his anger was such, that he stroke at the Earle a terrible blowe, which was more of ire then regarding how he deliuered it, the Earle let the blow slippe by and running in with the same, he stroke the Prince such a blowe vppon the head, that he parted it in two péeces, and hée fell downe dead on the floore. The tumult and vproare was such amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the Ladyes and Damosells, that at their greate shrikes the king went thether, and his comming was in such hast, that this vnfortunate <hi>Lidiarte</hi> coulde not by anie meanes get awaie.

And when the king sawe the Prince slaine, and the murtherer standing by, the king stepped vnto him and tooke the sworde out of his hande, and sayde vnto him. Oh knight without measure or mercie, what hath beene the occasion of this thy follye to kill this Prince.
There was by a Ladie of the Princesses, (who verie gréeuously lamented the death of the Prince) and told vnto the king all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of the matter as it ther passed, and when the king heard of all this enterprise, he receiued so much anger, that he himselfe in person did carrie him into a strong towre which was in the pallaice and put him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner therein and commaunded to put on him verie greate and strong chaines, and without any more tarrieng he called his counsell together, and opened the matter in publike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, whereas he was condemned for a traitour (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were some which did feare much his great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but the king made no reckoning of it) and so before that he would breake his fast, he commaunded him to be hanged

out of one of the windowes of the Towre, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded publikely to be proclaimed all the whole treason, where as to all men was seene his sodaine &amp; sorrowfull death.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13973:103"/>
so that both of them fell to the grounde, whereas they were all broken to péeces, and there she dyed.
<hi rend="margQuotes">The greate altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was in the Court, when they vnderstoode of all this that had past, was straunge and without comparison. And although manie did heare her complaint, yet there was not one that coulde tell wherefore it was, till such time as a Lackie which was nigh her, declared all that you haue heard tolde, for that he had heard it worde for worde, but when the king did knowe the effect thereof, hée was verye much amased at it. And for that he woulde there shoulde be a perpetuall memorie thereof, presently hée commaunded that they should bée buryed both together, in a Sepulchre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> declaring in it the effect of this dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act, the which was forthwith published throughout all the whole kingdome. So when that this vnhappie death of the Earle came vnto the eares of his Father and all his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, they were verie sorrowfull, and receiued for it great griefe, and waxed verie wrathfull, and determined (if it were possible) to reuenge the death of the Earle, and deuised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in secrete what order might best bee taken to bring it to effect. So in the ende of manie inuentions, they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to accuse the Princesse, that shee should be the onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of all this euill. And the better for to compasse and bring this accusation to passe, they did commit it to the vsing of the brothers sonne of the olde Earle, and cousin vnto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diarte,</hi> who was sonne vnto the Earle of <hi>Prouince,</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and valiaunt Knight. The which accusation he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with a verie good will, and for to make their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more strength, they agréed to sende vnto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> vnto a brother of the king <hi>Bramidoro,</hi> with whome they had at that time greate friendshippe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing him that hée woulde sende them some one of his lignage to fauour them héerein, the which he graunted with verie greate good will, and for that they shoulde the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstand the greate desire that hée hadde to pleasure them in this matter, he sent them two of his lignage, and by reason that they were Gyauntes and of a meruailous

huge bignesse (although all the world did knowe that the Princesse is without fault and not culpable) yet they dare not put their persons in aduenture, with those two horrible and disordinate monsters.</hi>
So after they hadde made this their traiterous and false accusation, after manye and great contentions they grew in the end to this conclusion, that the Princesse should within the tearme of fiftéene dayes bring three knightes that with these other thrée shoulde make and maintaine battaile in the fielde for the defence of this false accused Princesse, and if so be that she coulde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that time prefired finde but two knightes, then it shall be at their curtesie to take vppon them the enterprise, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor lesse then they thrée if shee did finde but one knight. Now there is twelue of these fiftéene daies past, so that within these thrée dayes the full time is expired: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noble Lordes and knightes, let me bée resolued what you will determine heerein. To loose our liues for to set at libertie this wronged Ladie, aunswered the Knight of the Sunne, therefore it is conuenient without anie more delaye that wee take our iourney thether-ward. Then the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell sayd, how is it that you will take the enterprise in hand and bee but two, and they bée thrée, and besides, almost inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. Then <hi>Tefereo</hi> aunswered, the iustice on the Princesse parte shall be the thirde person, take you no care fayre Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell for that, for although we are but two, we doe little esteeme them. When the Damosell sawe their liberall prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and determination, she was verie gladde and content, and straight wayes she leaped vpon her palfraie and they on their horses, and so rode towards the Citie without making anie farther delaie or tarrieng.</p>

So in this sort they passed the time, till they thought it to be the houre to goe vnto the defence pretended, so when the time drew nigh, they perused their armour in all pointes, and armed themselues and leapt on horse backe. <hi>Tefereo</hi> if it had not séemed vnto him to bée a point of cowardlinesse, wold haue procured to haue distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed this battaile, for they against whome he shoulde fight were his kinsefolkes, but yet he thought that he was more bound by the order of knighthoode to kéepe companie with him with whom he came, and to resist such like wronges in the defence of truth and iustice, then to haue anie respect to his kindred, and especially in such like false accusations. Hee therefore determined to dissemble it and say nothing, so with these and such like thoughtes they went forwardes till they came into the citie, vnto the place appointed for this battell, whereas they found the Princesse set vpon a scaffolde, all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with mourning robes of great sadnesse, which did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and shew her great sorrowe and vndeserued trouble. So likewise all the whole scaffolde, and all the Ladyes and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosells that came with the Princesse were couered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled correspondent vnto her attire. The king was at a windowe of his Pallaice with no lesse sorrowe and sadnesse to sée his honour put vnto that blemish as it was. And that which gréeued him most was, that not one knight in all his Court durst giue the enterprise, yet was there present
<pb facs="tcp:13973:105"/>
all the whole companie of the knightes of his Court. So these two Gyaunts and the other knightes came armed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place with verie fayre and strong armour, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon greate and mightie strong horses, sauing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of the Gyauntes, for that there was not any horse that coulde sustayne so mightie and huge a waight: wherefore he was mounted vpon an Elephant. So looking round about, the Prince sawe on the other side of the fielde the Knight with the gréene armour, which he had fought with all in the Barke béeing at the Sea, as I haue tolde you, who was in a readynesse to make the battaile in defence of the Princesse. This knight there by had hanged vpon a péece of timber all the Images that he brought with him, in such sorte as they were hanged in his Barke, the which when the Prince saw that the Image of the Dutchesse was aboue that of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, his anger did so increase, that he had cleane forgotte wherefore he came thether, and spurred <hi>Cornerino</hi> his horse with so much furie, that by his force he made the grounde whereas he came to tremble and shake. And when he came vnto the place whereas the Images were hanging, he with his strong arme laide holde vppon the deuice and brake the chaines wherewith they were made fast, and swinged it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head with such greate strength, that hée made them flye to the highest partes of all the Pallaice, the which was done in such great hast, that when the knight with the greene armour was come to disturbe him, it was too late, for that his Ladye was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13973:105"/>
him againe, the Prince was come vnto himselfe, and setling himselfe vppon his horse backe, being firmed in his stirrops, with greate furie he threw his shéelde to the grounde, and tooke his swoorde in both his handes, and pricked <hi>Corneri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> towardes the place whereas his aduersarie was, who was likewise in a readinesse to discharge his blowe, so both of them together discharged each vppon the others helme, with such furie and force, that the Prince of the Sunne was constrained to fall vpon his horse necke as though hée hadde bene dead, for that neuer blowe that euer he receiued before that time did bring him to the like perplexitie, but onely one, the which he receiued at the hands of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> when he had battaile with him. Lykewise the knight with the gréene ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour did nothing aduance himselfe of his déede, for the blow which he receiued was so terrible, that he fell from his horse to the ground, and the bloud issued out at his month and nose with great abundaunce, and he stretched his armes and legs vpon the sandie ground as though he hadde bene altogether dead. The king and all that were with him were very much amased, to sée that so cruell and sodaine a battell should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, without knowing the occasion wherfore. And more they did meruaile, imagining a little by the tokens of the horse who that knight should bée, which hauing his enimie for so valiant a knight in so short time had brought him into such extremitie. Now when <hi>Tefereo</hi> did sée the Prince thus put to his shiftes and in such great necessitie, and howe that hée laie vpon his horse necke without anie remembrance, hée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to crie out vppon fortune, and with great furie he drew out his swoorde and went against the defenders of the euill accusation, and called them traytours, (although they were his brothers children.) Héere you may sée what great force and strength the truth hath, that although they were his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers childen, yet he did procure their deaths, for that they came out of their owne Countrie, into a straunge and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine lande to defende treason. The sonne of the Earle of <hi>Prouince</hi> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first that did offer to put himselfe forwards, to whome <hi>Tefereo</hi> gaue such terrible and strong blowes
<pb facs="tcp:13973:106"/>
vpon his helme, that without remembraunce hée made him fall to the ground as one that were dead. The Gyants when they sawe themselues so ill intreated, both of them set spurs vnto theyr beastes, and drawing out their great and sharpe cutting swoords, they did procure to hurt him with theyr heauie and terrible blowes. In this contention the valiaunt <hi>Sardenian</hi> did shewe his mightie and strong courage with greate pollicie and cunning, nowe striking at the one, and then at the other, and alwayes prouiding to let their blowes slippe aside without receiuing anie harme, and such was his pollicie and lightnesse, that in a great while they coulde not fasten one full blowe vppon him. Nowe was the knight of <hi>Prouince</hi> come to himselfe, and séeing himselfe on the grounde, and his enimie so couragious betwéene these two mightie Gyauntes, he approched vppon the one side where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Tefereo</hi> coulde not sée him, and cut off one of the hinder legges of his horse, the horse when hée felte himselfe hurte, woulde haue risen vpright before, but by anie meanes hée coulde not, but recoyled backwarde with his crouper to the grounde, which was yet in such sorte that <hi>Tefereo</hi> had time to goe out of the saddle, with so greate anger, that the bloud burst out at his nose, and without anie feare before him, he pressed at the knight of <hi>Prouince,</hi> and thrust such a foyne at his breast, that his armour coulde not denie the passage but that the swoorde came out at his backe, so that hée fell downe starke dead to the grounde: hée had scant drawen his swoorde out of the bodie of the knight, when that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie pollicie to defende himselfe, hée receyued such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blowe with the breast of the Gyantes horse, which came with such greate furie that (albeit agaynst his will) he was constrained to fall tumbling vnto the grounde, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fall was somewhat heauie and gréeuous vnto him, yet with a trice hée was a foote againe, and séeing both the Gyauntes readie prepared against him, for his better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he thought it good to put himselfe on the other side of the dead horse.</p>
               <p>At this instant the knight of the Sunne came agayne

My pen is not heere sufficient to signifie vnto you the great furie, that on a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine came vnto this worthy knight of the Sonne: so that I suppose no Diamond rocke had bene at that time able to make resistaunce against him: for with a furious &amp; hoarce voyce he sayd, Away, away you vile Knights, not worthy of these your great members, and double forces which you doo possesse, seeing that with so much shame this daye you haue maintained such great treason. The prince carried his sword in his hand, hauing reared it on high, redy to strike him that first came in his way, and raising himselfe in his stirrops, he stroke the Giant with the Elephant so terrible a bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The other Giaunt in the meane time had stroke the Prince such a terrible blowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the healme, that it made him to gnash his teeth together, with the paine he felt, which was the occasion that he was whollye incensed with anger, insomuch that he pressed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him with no lesse rage, then the Hawke which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth the Hearon, and stroke such a blowe at his head, that for the defence thereof, the Giant was constrained to lift vp both his armes, and the blow descended in such sort vppon them, that it cut them both in péeces, and his sworde being fast in his handes, they fell altogether to the ground. All the whole Court greatlye meruailed at these fierce and terrible blowes: and hauing thus concluded all that they had to doo the Prince returned vnto <hi>Tefereo,</hi> and sayd vnto him, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doo you remaine héere, till such time that all be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that is héere necessarie to be done, and in the wildernes of <hi>Ardenia</hi> you shall finde me, in the very same place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we did rest our selues this day, and I desire thee to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb facs="tcp:13973:107"/>
to know who is that Knight with the gréene armour, and whether he be dead or no. And without any more tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he spurred his horse, who made as swifte waye as the thunderbolt, and presently departed the Citie, and neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted till he came vnto the place, whereas he tolde his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion he would remaine. Then <hi>Tefereo</hi> went vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and asked them if there were anye more to be done, in the defence and fauour of the Princesse: and the Iudges an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it was sufficient which was done, and that ther was no other thing to be done in that matter. When <hi>Tefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reo</hi> sawe that all was done that was néedfull, he went vnto the place, whereas the Knight with the gréene armor was, and pulling off his helme, he saw that all his face was swol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len with the terrible blowe that he had receiued, and hée sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as though he had bene dead. At the same instaunt, the King was come downe from his windowe, into the place whereas the battaile was: onely for to honor these knights and to knowe who they were. And when he could not sée the Knight of the Sunne, he asked for him, and straight way it was tolde him in what great hast he went from that place and out of the Citie: for the which the King was very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and if they had not tolde him, that it had bene labor lost to seeke him, he would haue followed to see if he could haue séene him, and haue made him to retourne to haue honoured him in his court. Then the King with amorous wordes requested of <hi>Tefereo</hi> to tell him who that Knight was, and he tolde him with a very good wil. And when the king knew that it was the <hi>Greeke</hi> Prince, he receiued great sorow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not doo him the honour, as vnto such a knight appertained. But considering that they could not impute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him anie fault for the lacke thereof, he commaunded that the Knight with the gréene armour, should be carried vnto the Pallaice, and asked his Knights what he was, &amp; it was tolde him, that he was the Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Torismundo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when the King vnderstoode, that he was a Knight
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13973:107"/>
of so high linage, he commanded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all his Phisitions shuld ioyne together, and prouide all remedies possible for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, and that they should apply no lesse core vnto him, then vnto his owne proper person, the which presently was done, and they did apply the best remedies that could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, till such time as they brought him somewhat to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, although it was with great labour. The prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> when he sawe himselfe in his naked bed, his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe was verye much: and calling to his minde all that which had passed, the very griefe he receiued, was almost the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Tefereo</hi> knew who that Knight was, and that there was no more to be done, without any tarrying he tooke his leaue of the King, and of the Princesse, who wept very sorrowfully at his departure. <hi>Tefereo</hi> tooke the horse of the lame Giaunt, (who with very anger to see himselfe in that pickle, woulde not consent to the receiuing of anye cure, neyther would he eate any thing, but there desperately dyed) and leaping vppon him he went to seeke the Knight of the Sunne. Where we will leaue them: for that I am nowe inforced by the swéete dartes of <hi>Cupide,</hi> to refresh the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eares of the hearers, and to declare some of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing woundes, and to leaue the furious sword of <hi>Mars</hi> for a while.</p>
               <p>Now to retourne to the storie that is past, whereas if you doo remember, that the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into that barke wherein the Knight was, which would haue forced a Ladye, and how that vpon a sodaine their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes did seperate themselues, so that he lost the sight of his Cousin the Knight of the Sunne, and of <hi>Tefereo,</hi> and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entered, he woulde haue made resistaunce against his aduersarie, for to disturbe him, that he should not commit the vyolence that he had offered. But vppon a sodaine they were all vanished, so that he sawe neyther Knight, nor Ladye, nor Marriners, nor yet anye other person, but onely himselfe in the Barke, with his inchaunted Horse,

neither could he sée who brought him thether: and thinking to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ourne again into the galley whereas his cousin was, he could not finde him: but looking about, he discerned no other thing, but the Element &amp; the water. When the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> sawe himselfe absent from his beloued cousin, his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was very great that he receiued, and began to curse all the wise inchaunters, and all those that doo permit &amp; suffer them, for that they were the occasion that in the world, ther was so much euill done. When this Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> sawe himselfe all alone, and not one with whom he might passe away the time, there came vnto his minde his <hi>Florisdama,</hi> which was the occasion that he tourned to his accustomed sadnesse, and imagining that he was in her presence, he said:
<q>Oh cruell Ladie which dost now reioyce thy selfe, and art at ease in the Kingdome of <hi>Dacia</hi>: art thou fully pleased with these my paines? Art thou now pacified, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast brought me into this extremitie and trouble? wherein, I am in the power of I know not whom, and doo nauigate I cannot tell vpon what. Thy cruell heart I am sure is now content, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that without desert, for thée I doo suffer so many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: which as yet I am not certaine, whether thou hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or procured it shuld be so or no. Oh cursed inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how many euills haue you wrought by the help of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells, so that by reason of your inchauntments, many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye Knights are brought into such like troubles as I am. Héere you may sée into what extremitie this Magicall arte hath brought me, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I can by no meanes profite my selfe of the strength of these my young armes, but am héere in the power of a diuel, who wil ouerthrow this barke: but that which doth most gréeue me, is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am brought into a place to dye, where of my death shall be lefte no memorie, but must die disdained of that cruell Lady.</q>
So with great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and trouble, he passed thrée dayes, in the end of which, he discouered a very small Iland, which was in the middest of the sea. The barke made thether with great switnesse, so that in a small time he was fast a ground vpon the sande. It was not long after that the Prince leapt a shore, &amp; when
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13973:108"/>
he found himselfe out of the barke, he looked rounde aboute him on euery side. And towards his right hand amongst a company of greene trees, he sawe a small tent armed. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which the prince directed his way, with an easie pace, and entring into the Tent, he sawe no bodye, although hee remayned a while, and hearkened if he coulde heere any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but he could neither heare nor see any thing: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he found the print of a lyttle foote vpon the sand, and hée had a great desire to know whose footesteps they were, for that they seemed to be of some Lady or Damsell, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trace, he followed them, and the more he went, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto him that the more hast they made, whosoeuer it was that had lefte that signe, which made him more earnest in his desire to see the ende thereof. So long he followed that trace, that in the ende he came vnto a little mountaine, whereas he found scattered about yeolow haire, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be threds of golde: and stooping for to gather them vp, he perceiued that some of them were wet with spots of bloud, whereby he well vnderstoode, the great anger where with they were pulled of from the head. Likewise he saw in diuers places, how the earth was spotted with drops of liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bloud. Then with a more desire then he had before, hée went vp to the top of that little mountaine, and hauing lost the footsteps, he recouered it by gathering vp y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> golden haire, he had not trauailed farre vp the mountaine, when that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the water side he heard a great complaint, which sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the voice of a woman, and by the faint sound ther of he might well perceiue that they waxed wearie, for that a while they would rest and be still, and straight way wold returne vnto their accustomed sorrow and complaint. And the words (which the Prince did well vnderstande) were these.
<q>Oh loue, now shalt thou no more reioyce, neither haue any longer dominion ouer me, for that gentle death wil shew me so much fauour as to finish these my sorrowfull passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and therewith vnloose and frustrate this string of loue, with the which thou hast bounde me, hauing a desire to aske re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement of him, which hath bene the occasion of all this

euill.</q>
I haue asked the same reuengement, but it hath not pleased the Gods to heare my request: nay rather they haue stopped their eares agaynst these my continual complaynts: and with this she helde her peace, giuing a very sorrowfull and terrrible sigh. The Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> tourning his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that place, from whence he heard this comylaint, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered amongst certaine gréene trées, a Lady, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with maruailous great beautie. It was so excellent, that it depriued him of his heart, which he neuer thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to haue lost. She was with her haire all about her eares, and meruailously ill intreated by the violence that she vsed against her selfe, and leaning her chéeke vpon her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and white hand, which was all to be spotted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bloud in many places, which was constrained by the scratching of her nayles. The spots was the occasion to dissolue the great passion which the Prince did féele for his <hi>Florisdama,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting in his heart, the figure of this heauie and sorrowful Lady: who seeing her of so great beautie, and in such afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ouertaken and wounded with the demeanour of her faire face, and gréeued to sée her so euill intreated, in such sort, that in a sound he leaned to a gréene trée (amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other which were vpon that mountaine) cleane without any remembraunce.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Cupide,</hi> thou béeing but a boye, why doost thou vse these cruell kinde of feates. Who hath taught thée to vse such deceits, which is the occasion of great and endlesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes.

How is it possible that thou doost make vs beléeue, that without séeing thou canst hit so right with thy arrowes, and that with so good an aime thou dost wound wheras thou wilt.

It is sufficient thou showest thy selfe naked, for that thou art void of all pitie.

And without anie more carrieng with great speed he leapt to the shoare, carrieng his swoord in his hand, and his sheeld on his arme, he pressed in amongst them all, saying.</p>

wherefore are you not ashamed so great a number of you to fight onely against thrée knightes, and therewith stroke such a terrible blowe on him that he did first meet, that he made him in two péeces to fall to the ground, so that in a short time by his furious entering was knowen the greate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his arme, in such sort, that whersoeuer he went, he made a broad waie, and with small trouble he ioyned with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thrée knightes, who when they knew of the helpe that was come vnto them, each of them recouered new strength, and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to doe straunge feates, because the other should haue no aduauntage of them. And they verie much meruailed who that knight should be of so great prowesse, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the blowes which he stroke might well be knowen from all the rest, for if it had not bene by the armour that he wore, they woulde haue thought him to be one of the sonnes of <hi>Trebatio.</hi> These foure knightes kept so good order in their fight against their enimies, that they gaue ouer to fight with them, and began to showte and crie against them, so that they were constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to goe and séeke their enimies, the which they founde to be no good remedie, for that they did intreate them euilly at their backes, and béeing verie angrie héerewith, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to put themselues amongest the thickest of them, which did not fall out well with them, for that there was of them together more then ten thousand, the which this valiant <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno</hi> séeing, he threw his shéeld at his backe, fullye incensed with anger, and with his swoorde in his hande all alofte, hée pressed vnto that parte whereas most people were, and the first he met withall, hée parted him in the middest, and the second hée cut off his head, and so went forwardes cutting and wounding nowe one and then another, with so greate furie, that there was none that durst abide his blowes. Is there anie doubt that whilest this Prince was thus trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and molesting his enimies, that the other thrée knights which were with him did stande by and looke on, no not so, but for to sociate his worthie actes, they wrought such wonders in armes, as the reporte woulde séeme almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creadible vnto the hearers, in striking such terrible blowes

               <p>Oh immortall Gods, is it possible that foure knights hath done all this harme, that a thousand of very good knights are not able to doe, and is their strength and pollicie such, that not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue receiued anie hurt. O wretched knights what had you rather to die in my power then to sweare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so iust a demaund as they haue asked of you in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> behalfe of the king <hi>Noraldino.</hi> Then <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> who hearde the wordes which the Gyant had sayd, aunswered. There is not one of vs, that for the feare death will sweare vnto anie thing, but first we wil knowe if the cause be iust, because we will not fall vnto anie crime of that which shall be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto the order of knighthood. So then I doo perceiue said the Gyaunt, that you do not purpose to sweare in any thing except it be first declared vnto you what it is, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof. To the which aunswered <hi>Zoylo,</hi> no. Well héere I sweare vnto you by the high Gods (sayd the Gyaunt) that I my selfe alone will bring you all to that staye, that you woulde willingly sweare, but then you shall haue no time. And therewith he drewe out a broade and glistering swoord and flourishing therewith he pressed forwardes, then the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> stepped foorth and requested the other that they would let him alone with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant, the which although it were against their wills, yet they consented to it, and the other putting themselues all on the one side, they beganne againe theyr mortall battaile. The Gyaunt with the greate

furie hée had, did discharge his blowe, but it was in vaine, for that the Prince did let it slippe by, in such sorte, that hee coulde not strike him, and in putting the blowe aside, hée cut the sayde Gyaunt vppon one of his legges, and made a wounde, which although it were not greate, yet there ranne out of it verie much bloud. When the Gyaunt did féele him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hurt, and that he sawe his bloud runne downe, hee did so kindle in ire, that he let his shéelde fall to the grounde, and laying holde on his greate and broade swoorde, with both his handes he lift it vp, and stroke at the <hi>Dacian,</hi> thinking with that one blowe to haue finished the battaile, but the Prince for that he was nimble and light, did procure straight waies to cleere himselfe from the force thereof, the which he did in such sort, that the swoorde fell downe to the ground, and by reason of the great force and furie wherewith it was discharged, the Gyant was constrained following his blowe to fall likewise downe vpon the earth. Héere the <hi>Dacian</hi> was not idle, but with both his hands stroke him vpon his strong helme with great courage, and although he could not cut it at that time by reason of the hardnesse, yet it astonished him &amp; brought him out of his remembraunce.

The Gyant when he sawe him comming woulde haue stroken him, for to disturbe him of his blow, but he could not, for that this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> stroke him such an ouerthwart blowe, that lighting on his foote, he cut it cleane off, and the Gyant chaunced a blow on his helme, that it made the knight to tumble on the sand, the gyant seeing him downe, would haue turned to haue stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him againe, but he could not for the lacke of his foote, for when he thought to firme his foote on the grounde to prease forwards, he could not make a step, but gaue a terrible fall to the ground, and béeing sore troubled with the wound of his head and other wounds, he yéelded vp the Ghost, and sent his soule to whom it did appertaine. The Pagan people when they sawe their stout Captaine dead, with great showts and shrikes they pressed altogether vpon those foure knightes, but they found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither dastards nor cowards, but they gaue them well to vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were of great val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then they ioyned themselues together backe to backe, and stroke such straunge blowes vpon their enimies, and with so great force and furie, that he which had receiued one blowe would not turne to them againe, with great feare they were so scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> being incensed with anger, at the fall that he receiued by the blow of the Gyant, it caused him to claspe his sword fast in his hand, and with double furie he pressed amongest his enimies, that vnhappie he might thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that came to the receit of the first stroke, for that with an ouerthwart blowe, he cutte his head cleane from his shoulders, and returned vnto another, and stroke him vppon the wast, so that it had neere hand parted him in two péeces, so with such like blowes and feates of knighthood they made them to retire. And at the same time they sawe comming forth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie a great number of knights &amp; gentlemen, which they iudged to be about sixe thousand in an armie, and all on hors backe.

So the King tooke her by the hand and bare her company, till he came vnto the Citie, and carried her vnto his pallaice, which was very rich and great, for this king was one of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Princes in all <hi>Africa.</hi> So straight way it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

When they sate downe to dinner, they pulled off their helmes, which before that time they had not done: and when the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> had pulled off his healme, all the rest did thinke verelye, that it had bene the valiaunt Knight <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> (for that as I haue tolde you) he was very much like him) complaining for that he had kept himself so close, without shewing what he was in so long time.

The King was very well content and pleased that he had such Knights in his company, &amp; told vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great circumstance of treason, cleane contrarie to that it was, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying all the iniurie to be offred vnto himself, mingling his tale with counterfet teares, which caused these Knightes to giue credit vnto his words, in such sort that they did sweare vnto the King all that he would demaund, of the which this traiterous King remained greatly contented, and ordayned for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very faire &amp; rich chambers to ease the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, with all seruice néedfull, &amp; likewise for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faire <hi>Lidia,</hi> for he lodged her in the Queenes chamber, &amp; caused many Ladyes and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells to come and beare her companie, and to serue her in all that was necessarie, for that he perceiued how the Prince <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno</hi> did receiue great pleasure therein. In the end of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayes that these Knights had soiourned with the King, there came one and aduertised the King, how that ther was arriued in the port of the Citie, a faire ship, and how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther descended out of her a Knight, and a well proportioned Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt: and by reason that they would not hearken vnto the accustomed oath, which they that didde arriue there shoulde sweare, that there was begun a meruailous and stout bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, with them that did keepe the Port, wherein the knight did meruailous &amp; worthy feates, and likewise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giant. The which being heard by those knights y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, they called for their armor, &amp; wer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a trice armed, &amp; there were

brought vnto them very faire and strong horses, which the King had commaunded to giue them, and mounting on their backs, in great hast they went out of the Citie to the hauen side, to the same place whereas they fought theyr owne bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, whereas they founde these two knights with no lesse rigor &amp; furie, then they themselues were before. So straight way, three of those Knights did knowe, who that Knight &amp; Gyant was, which were in battaile, &amp; sayd, that it was <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerindo</hi> and the King of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> whom I told you depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Greece</hi> in the quest of the Emperour, and by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune they were driuen into those parts, for that the King might haue more ayde for to execute his tyranny. Then the valyant <hi>Zoylo</hi> pulled off his helme and sayd. What is the matter valyaunt Prince, that you show your selfe so furious against him, which in all poynts is redy to be at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. At which words, the Prince lift vp his eyes, and when he behelde those thrée Princes and knewe them, he very much meruailed to see them, and lefte off his battel, and so likewise did <hi>Bramidoro,</hi> and all thrée w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their armes abroad, came to imbrace him. And <hi>Clauerindo</hi> saide, It had not gone very well with vs in this conflict, if these knights had not knowen vs, and in saying these wordes, he threwe his armes about their neckes with great ioye that he recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to sée them: and with no lesse ioye and pleasure all the rest did showe themselues &amp; sayd. We are those which haue most gotten in the knowing of you, for that we haue put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the great battaile that was prepared for vs. So with the like courtesie they receiued the Prince of <hi>Dacia,</hi> who, if that the other had not tolde him what he was, he wold haue beleeued that it had bene <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> So with these and such like reasons, at the request of the other Princes, they went with them vnto the Citie, at such time as the King came foorth, accompanied with a faire companie of Knightes and verye well armed, who receyued them with great cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, &amp; caused y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince of <hi>Fraunce</hi> to ride w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him side by side. So they altogether returned vnto the Citie, and then to the Pallaice, whereas they were meruailously well intertained,

and there the King tolde vnto them all his contrarie and chaunged treason, wherefore these two knights did swear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The prince <hi>Clauerindo</hi> had so great affection vnto the Prince <hi>Eleno,</hi> that he would not at any time departe from him, neither would the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> doo otherwise vnto <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> declaring vnto him all his euills and strange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures. At which communication was present the king of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> and when he heard him tell of his aduenture in <hi>Tinacria,</hi> and of the battaile that he had made with <hi>Tefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reo,</hi> and how that he was ouercome, he with more affection behelde him, and requested him to heare the whole estate thereof.

The Emperour seeing him come, he had greate care of himselfe, and being in a place that neither to the one parte nor to the other he coulde slip backe to saue himselfe from that blowe, he did determine to stoope with both his knées and shorten in his bodie, for that he was sure he coulde not ouerrunne him with his horse, by reason
<pb facs="tcp:13973:117"/>
of the fountaine that was at his backe. The Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himselfe in such sort, that the speare without dooing him anie hurt went ouer his head. The blowe was not so soone past when that the Emperour rose bolt vpright, and cast such a thrust at the horse breast, that his sword entered in vp to the hiltes. The horse when he felt himselfe hurt, gaue a leape into the aire with so great swiftnes, as though it had bene a whirlewinde, and in the ende, he fell downe to the earth with great force, &amp; in his fall, he caught y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Earles leg vnder him, in such sort, that he could not by any meanes arise. Heere might the Emperour haue slaine or hurte him, but hee would not, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he séemed vnto him to be a knight of great estimation. Then all the people that were there, both them a foote &amp; those on horsebacke, with great showts and shrikes they would haue set vpon him: but they could not come nigh him at their wil, for that the dead horse was betwéene them: &amp; againe, the Earle was a shield for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who was prisoner vnder his horse right before him.

               <p>The Emperour did well vnderstand all that the Quéene had sayd vnto him, but he made as though he did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand her, and tourned to aske her what she had sayd, in saying, that he did not vnderstand the language, and howe that he was a Grecian borne. Then the Quéene who was very discréete, and could speake the Gréeke tongue very wel, renewed her tale, and spake that in the Gréeke, which before she had done in the Tuscan tongue.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:118"/>In the ende séeing that they did so ill intreate me and in such manner, I did determine first to dye, then to yéeld my selfe vnto them as prisoneer, neither would I haue altered my intent, if it it were not now by occasion of your greate beautie, accounting my selfe happie to die at the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of so excellent a Lady: all this time that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was speaking vnto the Quéene, she neuer withdrew her eyes, from beholding of his personage, and had great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to see the Maiestie of his countenaunce. O cruell <hi>Cupide,</hi> wilt thou nowe beginne to vse thy accustomed mallice. O false tyrant, I can neuer talke in these or suche lyke matters, but thou art alwayes at hande.

Uali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Knight, I doo account my selfe verye happie, for that I haue had so much strength, that only with my person I haue mooued your stout courage to so great humilitie. And with this she caused him to put vp his sworde into his sheathe, and promising him safetie, she led him with her into the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, and commaunded that the Earle should be taken from vnder the horse, for at that time he had not so much strength to cleare himselfe from that fall: for that it was in suche sort, that it did broose and intreate him very ill. And when they came vnto the Pallaice, the Quéene commanded that there should be giuen him a meruailous faire and rich lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And for the great complaints which were made of him, she commaunded, that he should be kept in good warde, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prison which she gaue vnto him, was not so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, as that which the Emperour had giuen occasion vnto the Quéene to haue, &amp; although it wer not very grieuous, yet the Emperor could not choose but feele it, when he saw himselfe locked vp, being neuer accustomed vnto any such trouble: the Quéene had great care of him, and caused him to be healed of those small wounds which he had, and that with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in such wise, that in a small time he was whole of his paine, swellings and other griefes. In all this time, the

Earle and all the kinsfolkes of them that were slaine, made great hast and sute vnto the queene to execute iustice vppon this knight that was prisoner, but she did defend the case ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much, and excusing him in declaring vnto them the small right she had to doe it, and giuing them to vnderstand how that they had their paiment according vnto their deserts, but by reason of the great importaunce that those knights made, she was constrained to keepe him straighter in prison, which was vnto her so greate paine, that she could scar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So the Quéene beeing thus sore troubled shee went vnto her chamber, and there was betwéene her chamber and that, where as the Emperour was but one wall, and out of the Queenes chamber there went a doore, whereas manye times shee communed with him. Thus béeing verie pensiue and sore troubled, for that she was constrained to commaund that which her heart would not consent vnto, she went her selfe close vnto the doore to sée if she might comfort her selfe with the sight of her prisoner and captiue, and she chanced to come the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It hadde béene better for me to haue dyed in the deapth of the Sea, or else with the edge of the Swoorde lyke a knight, then to sée my selfe in the power of barbarous people. O Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> now after so many and great troubles in the which thou hast séene thy selfe, and hast ouer passed them, and by this misfortune thou art put vnto that greate necessitie, that neyther thou cannest profite thy selfe of thy valyaunt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, neither of the strength of thy worthye and valyaunt knights.</q>

To whom he answered, I can make no other answere, most mightie La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but the verie same which you your self may think, if you were prisoner, especially for such an occasion, as you ought rather to receiue fauour and camfort, and therefore I cannot but muse at your highnesse, knowing in howe little fault I am, that you set me not at libertie, but I doo well see that you are a Damosell and subiect vnto the will of your subiectes, for looke what they ordaine you dare not resist against them, therefore faire Ladie I dooe desire you if you pretend to set mée at libertie (as by promise and iustice you are bound) let it bée out of hand, and if anie of your subiects will say to the contrarie, I request the acceptation of the battaile for the defence of my right, with eight or tenne, or if they will, with twentie of the best in all your kingdome, and I doubt not but in mine owne person against them al, to deliuer my selfe from this enthralled perill: vnto whom the queene answered with a verie good grace. I dooe well vnderstande gentle Knight, that the highnesse of your heart cannot suffer such straight imprisonment, as well for that which I haue seene of thee, as also for that which I haue heard. So likewise thou maist well beléeue, that which I haue done, hath bene partly to content my subiects and people, for that this euill hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out vpon the person of the most mightiest man amongest them, and of this be you assured, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thing which you would haue done, and so much desire, shal not be done, onely for that you are without faulte, although they charge you with it greatly, but also for that thou art Father vnto that excellent knight of the Sunne, whome in this my Ilande they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for one of the most high and souereigne Gods, as a

restorer of the same, and againe, that it is not decent that so high and mightie an Emperour shuld in this Iland be so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously intreated, as that his cause should be determined by the tearmes of iustice, vnto whome not onely they, but the whole world, willingly ought to serue, for that thou art an Emperour, and father vnto such a sonne. The Emperour was verie sore troubled when he perceiued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the which this faire Ladie marking, went forwardes in her talke, and sayd: Doe not vexe your selfe, neither bée anye whit troubled (most mightie Prince) for that you are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, considering that of such a one as thou art it is reason we doo estéeme, according to thy desert, neither can my captiue heart consent vnto anie other thing but the exalting of thy honour. Alasse what shall I saie, who hath receiued most wrong for their imprisonment, it hath bene onely my christal breast and captiued heart, they haue wronged thy bodie but for a time, but me, loue hath bereaued of my former libertie, in wounding my hart, so that it is almost vncurable. In this (my good Lord) you may vnderstand that I a lone am shée which hath the greatest wrong. Thou valiaunt Emperour hast taken awaie from the Earle of <hi>Modique</hi> his sonne, but thou hast robbed me (most infortunate) of my heart. Oh how much better had it bene for me to haue bene pertaker with him of death, then now to liue, not knowing what cruel loue will doo. Oh immortall Gods, how is it that you haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that the tender hart of a poore damsell, béeing alwaies willing to offer vnto you sacrifices, and exercising of my self daily in your seruice, and now in payment of all this, you haue permitted it to be sacrificed vnto the cruell will of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide,</hi> who hath forcibly pearced my feeble heart with his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious darts. I beseech thée (O Emperour) doe not denie mée this my vnreasonable demaund, although thou séest it so far to exceed the meane. Oh virginitie, thou maist well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto a rose, which so long as the leaues are reserued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

All this the quéene deliuered with such sorrow and lamentation that it would haue caused a stonie heart to haue relented. But the emperour who with a single heart did loue the Empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> and moreouer béeing a verie good christian, was not moued with one of these lamentable words, neither made he anie shew of loue vnto the quéene, but wishing rather to haue had battaile with one of the hardiest knightes in all the world, then to haue found himselfe so sodainly assailed by this amorous woman: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when this faire Ladie had plainly declared all the whole secret of her heart, the Emperour vsing his accustomed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, did shew himselfe to be verie heauie and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Emperour did leane his chéeke vpon his hande ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pensiue, all the time that this Ladie was declaring her complaintes, not for that he was without pittie, but for that he was mooued with greate compassion, and yet not with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to satisfie her disordinate appetite, but with faire words to put her in good hope of remedie. And verye faine she woulde haue aunswered, but that shée was cut off by a Damosell which called her. The Quéene dissembling her heauinesse in the best wise she coulde, went out of the chamber to sée what they would haue, vnto whom the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell saide. Ladie, there is a messenger come from the king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> which dooth tarrie for you belowe in the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, wherat this faire quéene did féele her selfe troubled, the occasion was, for that this king was in loue with her, who was verie valiaunt and of great force, and began to gouerne his kingdome verie young, with another brother of his, who at that time was not knighted, neuerthelesse to heare him named in all <hi>Africa,</hi> it made the people to tremble with feare, therefore manie times by reason of his greate pride his fame was much abated. This king did determine with himselfe to marrie with the Quéene, eyther by fayre meanes, or else by force, and for to put this his pretence in practise, hée sent vnto her his messengers, and for a more maiestie, hée made his owne brother Lord Embassodour. And séeing this historie will most intreate of this young man who was called <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise author wold discouer

And many times it hath ben séene, when his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had ben past, he would haue weapt with great sorrowe for the hurt which he had done, he hadde one custome which was verie diuellish (béeing no small blemish vnto all the rest of his good qualities) that he woulde neuer pardon them of whome he had receiued iniurie. So when this Pagan was come into the pallaice, and in the Quéenes presence, with a graue countenaunce and hardie voice he declared his embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and by reason that at that time the quéene had not her heart at libertie, she gaue him for answere, without tarrying to take anie farther counsaile, that her intent was not as yet to marrie, for that she was verie young, wherwith this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan departed, and did returne to giue this answere vnto his brother <hi>Bramarandus,</hi> at which he was verie irefull, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to make sacrifices vnto <hi>Mahomet,</hi> praying vnto him for to chaunge the will of the Queene, that shée might marrie with him. Then there was made aunswere vnto him (by the Diuell which hadde entered into that infernall Image of <hi>Mahomet</hi>) that hée shoulde not tarrie for anye other hope to obtaine her, but by force of armes, and that hee shoulde procure with all his strength and power for to marrie her, adding that from her shoulde procéede an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, at whose valyauntnesse and strength halfe the world shoulde tremble and stande in feare. This false God did well diuine and prognosticate, but yet he did deceiue the wretched <hi>Bramarandus,</hi> in saying, that of his séede shoulde procéed such a child, &amp; when he heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> answere of this accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

The good Earle of <hi>Modique</hi> with a sad voyce said. Oh mightie <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> how well thou hast payed thy selfe for the great curtesie which thou hast showed vs, in giuing vs for our Ladyes and gouernours, the fairest damosels in the world.

And with this, they did all determine, rather to haue warres with honour, then peace with shame: waying the little good will the Quéene had to marrie with him, &amp; to take him for hir husband. And with this determination, they gaue him for aunswere, that the Queene was not intended to marrie as yet: so that if hée pleased to tarrie the time he might, if not, he might doo as he thought best, and that they would not let, but defende the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Lady and Quéene.</p>

And when he was gone, all the Quéenes Knights determined to fortifie themselues in the Citie, and make all things very strong, and so they gaue the Quéene to vnderstand thereof, whereof she was verye well content, séeing them so well incouraged for her defence.

<pb facs="tcp:13973:123"/>
and put it vnder her lefte arme, and in her right hande shée carried a light that she might the better finde the dore, the which she opened as softly as was possible, at such time as the Emperor, was very fast a sléepe, and when she saw that he did not heare her entering in, she went vnto the beddes side, with the light in her hand, that she might contemplate her selfe in beholding the graue and faire face of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and vnto her it séemed that in all the world there was not such another, nor that there could be any greater thing to be desired, then that which her heart did require.

               <p>
                  <q>My Lord, I wold very faine know what thou dost pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend towards me, most vnfortunate Quéene, wounded with the darte of <hi>Cupide,</hi> onely by the sight of thy excéeding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage. For knowing it, with thy aunswere I woulde put in order, that which I haue to doo, concerning this my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable life. I doo well know my Lord and Emperour, that this my bolde discouering of my selfe, hath bene too much, and beyond all reason: but if at any time thou hast loued, and doost know the great griefe that loue doth cause, thou wilt not blame me, nor put me in any fault: &amp; I would y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I could show thée my wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded hart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in séeing it so sore afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thou mightst take some compassion of me, &amp; that which doth most torment me, is, that I haue yéelded my selfe vnto one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath so little pitie on me. Who hath euer heard, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men shuld wooe &amp; require of men to loue them? But I most vnfortunate Quéene, haue broken that lawe and custome. O immortal Gods, what haue you conceiued against me? Is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apparant which you vsed against my sister, &amp; now wil you vse it also w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me. I shuld be requested of Emperours &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13973:124"/>
Kings: and now I come to request one, that maketh no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of me, neither dooth my present destruction mooue him to any pittie. Go too Emperour, make an ende and aunswere me, that therewith I may receiue either life or death.</q>
Héere may you, which haue knowen what loue is, iudge what the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> might conceiue in himselfe, in this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell case. One way he did consider the great loyaltie that he ought vnto the Empres his wife: and this constrained him to deny her. Another way, the great desire that hée had to see himselfe at libertie, and the great loue that he did know <hi>Garrofilea</hi> bare him, caused his hart somewhat to yéeld.
Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, he did procure with faire and swéete wordes, to sée if he could cause her to chaunge her thought and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose saying,<q> Lady, I doo sée very well, that the force of loue is so cruell, that whosoeuer he doth wound, he leueth them in a manner without remedye, except it come from them, on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue fixed their heart. I doo not deny, but that your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous desire is such as he hath ordained it, who spareth no creature. But considering your highnesse and great estate, &amp; the honour that all such as you are, shoulde haue by your royall marriages, I doo more reioyce that you suffer payne, then you should take your ease with that, vnto which sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue doth constraine you. Most souereigne Quéene, héere I doo desire you, to bridle your affection, and restrayne your appetite, that you fall not into that infamie, which will bée the onely blemish of your estate, séeing it appertaineth so much vnto your honour.</q>
The quéene séeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his reasons did not incline vnto that which she desired, shortened his talk, &amp; said:<q> Emperour, all that which thou hast sayde, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that thou canst tell me, I doo already vnderstand, and there is nothing that may be spoken héerein, but I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time considered of it. Notwithstanding, loue hath more force, then any regard or consideration I should haue vnto my honour. Therefore I am héere come, fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make a second sacrifice vnto my gods, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards shall be lamented by thée.</q>
And in saying those words, she tooke out the sworde which she brought in secret vnder
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13973:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her roabes, and with great hast she set the pommell thereof vnto the ground, and would haue throwen her self vpon the poynt thereof. The worthy <hi>Trebatio</hi> seeing her in this des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate minde, leapt quickly out of his bed, and with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie courage caught holde of her, and tooke the sword out of her hand, saying: Oh blinde quéene, what diuelish determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is this? The Lady answered, Unlouing Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not longer liue, as one dying. And saying these words, she fell in a sound in the armes of the Emperour. Heere coulde not the stoutnesse of the Greeke heart make such resistance, but that with great loue he tooke her, and cast her vppon the bed, shedding many teares with much compassion, and considering the firmnesse of the loue that the Queene hadde showed him, he was confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in his owne thought, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to haue done that which hee neuer thought to haue done, and so purposed to giue her all her whole contentment: and so ioyning his mouth to hers, he remained kissing her till such time as this sorrowfull Lady came againe to her selfe. But when she perceiued she was of him so louinglye imbraced, being the thing she onely desired, she straight-way recouered all the strength that she had lost, and cast her armes about his necke with excéeding loue, which grieued not the Emperour any thing at all: &amp; in such sort they vsed themselues, that the Queene was made Lady, with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment vnto them both. So with like sport they passed the rest of the night, in great ioye and pleasure.

The Quéene was very gallant and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt, whereat all her subiects receiued great delight, and in the chiefe stréete of the Citie, there was erected the Images of two Knights, made all of stone, of a maruelous good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and they had ouer them a couer like a Tabernacle, very rich and well wrought, because the water shoulde not fall vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor any other thing to hurt them. As soone as the Emperour saw those figures, he knew that the one was the Image, of his sonne without reading of the supercrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but when he came nigh vnto it, he read the same, which sayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>This is the great Prince of Grecia, called the Knight of the Sunne, restorer of the auncient kingdome of Tinacria, &amp; the abater and breaker of the strength of the most strongest Giants in all the world.</hi> And going a little farther, he sawe vpon the other Knight this title: <hi>Prince Eleno of Dacia, cousin vnto the most valiant sonnes of Trebatio, the well-spring of all our quietnesse.</hi> Upon this he looked with great affection, and earnest desire to sée his perfect personage. The Quéene did well vnderstand the great ioye that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour receiued, in beholding the figure of his sonne, and of his brothers sonne: for which cause she commanded that to be told publikely, which was spoken in secret: &amp; then entred into the Quéenes pallaice, and the Emperour was carryed into a verie faire and rich lodging, whereas by force hée must be shut in, to make as if he were prisoner, for that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Realme, would not consent that he shoulde goe abroade at his will. The third daie following, this braue <hi>Bramarando</hi> with all his Knights, came before the walls of the Citie, and spred abroad their Ancients: and he himselfe vpon a fierce horse, drew towards the walls of the Citie in great hast. He was armed with very strong armour, and had at his necke hanging a verie rich horne of Iuorie, and when he came to the gate of the Citie, he lifte vp the visour of his helme and set his horne vnto his mouth, &amp; began to sound it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13973:125"/>
very strongly, to the end that the knights of the Citie shuld come thether to heare what he would say. So when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> some of them, such as were néere at hand, approched, he sayd.
<q>O you Knights of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> whom the souereigne Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, that according as I am informed, by your counsell, I cannot inioy as mine owne that faire <hi>Garrofilea.</hi> What doo you, that you come not forth with your armor agaynst me? and show your selues if you be as valiant to ouercome, as politike to giue counsel.</q>
Some of the nobles of the court, did well heare what this Pagan did say, and straight waye, they went vnto the Quéene, for to sée what was to be done in this case, to whome she aunswered.
<q>My friends, you dooe well sée and vnderstand, how little knowledge I haue in such matters, béeing but a weake and fraile woman: in such a case as this is, vnto you it belongeth to take counsell, for that you are knights, and together you may establish that, which is conuenient, for héerin I haue little knowledge and can say almost nothing: </q>and with this she held her peace. These Earles, séeing that with great reason the Quéene had answered them, they would argue no farther with her, but called a counsell.
At which time, the King the second time did sound his horne, to call them again to hearken vnto his speach: and being attendant vnto that which he would say, he vttered these wordes. O vile <hi>Tinacrians,</hi> what doo you, why come you not forth with your armour?
<q>How is it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you are not ashamed to hide your selues from one onely knight, which calleth you. Héere I doo promise you, that your high walls and déepe dithes which you haue about your Cittie, shall litle profit you, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you shal all dye in my hands lyke vile knights. And if amongst you ther be not one that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make his partie good in the field with mée alone.

Unhappie was he that hée stroke, although it were but with halfe a blowe, for it made him that he had smal minde to returne againe, but by reason that they were verie sorrowfull and angrie for the losse of their king, many of them did strike at him on euerie side, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to defend themselues, and not to come nigh his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes. The Emperour then remembring that if he did not procure to come whereas the prisoners were to set them at libertie, that it wer possible that they would intreat them euill. Wherfore he put himselfe among the thickest of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, wounding and killing all that he found in his waye, and all that he could ouertake, although his armour were as hard as Diamonds, yet he could not escape from the death, so in this sort in spite of all the Pagans he came vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings tent, and séeing that there ioyned together much people to make resistaunce at the entering, it gaue him the more desire to enter into the tent, not knowing that the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> were there prisoners. The <hi>Mauritanians</hi> with all their powers they had made resistaunce, but their strength did little auaile them, for in spite of them all the Emperour went into the Tent, whereas he met with the Earle of <hi>Modique,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Mondeli,</hi> who were put there in prison. At this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time <hi>Don Rubio</hi> of <hi>Tinacria</hi> when he sawe that the Moore of <hi>Africa</hi> was ouercome, and the great villanie of his knights, he made great hast to goe out of the Citie, and with eight hundred knights, all verie well armed, they pressed on their enimies with so great force, that they made them looke better about them, then before that time they did. When the Emperour sawe the diligence of this knight <hi>Rubio,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to set the prisoners at libertie, the which thing béeing done, he sayde vnto the Earles sonne of <hi>Modique.</hi> Gentle knight, this succour doo you receiue and your honourable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in recompence of the great griefe which I caused you to receiue, and without speaking anie more words he returned vnto the battaile which was verie much increased, but when he came amongst them it was quickly brought to an end, for by reason that they had no gouernour to gouerne them, and
<pb facs="tcp:13973:133"/>
that the furie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke was not to be suffered, they durst not abide, but with great shame they began to runne away, Then those of <hi>Tinacria</hi> did follow them till they came to the sea side, killing and wounding all that euer they coulde come by. So when the Emperour saw that all this conflict was brought to a good end, and that the valiant <hi>Rubio</hi> was by him, he called him vnto him and sayd. My friend, go and tell your Mistres the Quéene, that I request her to pardon me, for that I doo not retourne againe into her Citie, for I was so ill receiued the first time, that I haue no will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne the second. And more, I desire her of my part, that she doo intreate better, and giue better intertainment vnto such Knights as I am, then she gaue vnto me, least she get vnto her selfe the name of a wrathfull Quéene, and be accounted as one subiect vnto hir own opinion: &amp; of all other things, if any thing doo chaunce, let her thanke none but her selfe, for that she hath bene the onely cause therof. And moreouer, I doo desire her not to trouble her selfe in sending to séeke me, for that I say, not her power alone, but all the power in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> is not sufficient to retourne me againe into so great straights, as once she had me in. And so without any more speaking he spurred his horse, and rode a reasonable pace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sea side, which was not farre from that place, and when he came thether, he sought to sée if he could finde by chance any barke or galley, to carry him whether he wold, with his good will or els by force. He had not gone farre, when that he sawe a very faire and great barke at the sea side, hard aboord the shoare. The Emperour entered into it to sée if there were anye marriners: his horse which was hard by him, without being constrained by the Emperour, very lightly leapt into the Barke. He was not so soone with in, when that the Barke began to make waye, in such sorte, that in a small time they were very farre at sea. At y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which the Emperour was greatly amazed: but there was a voice, which did satisfie him, that sayd: <hi>Mightie Trebatio, Lyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeo doth gouerne thee</hi>: at the which the Emperour was very ioyfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:13973:133"/>So he put his horse in a place by himselfe in the bark, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he found sufficient of all things néedefull.

               <p>And when all this was finished, she straight way dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a messenger to <hi>Grecia,</hi> with a letter vnto the Emperour, the which she sent by a damsel that was verie trustie &amp; one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she loued well, whereas now I will leaue them till time doo serue for to tell you of the knight of the Sun. But first for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is necessarie to this our historie, we will declare what <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldoro</hi> said, when he knew of the death of <hi>Bramarando</hi> his brother, king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who béeing certified by them y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> escaped aliue out of the hands of the <hi>Tinacrians,</hi> and wer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sorrowful for the losse of their Lord and king, and landing in their owne countrie they went and carried the newes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> the which when he heard, he felt in himselfe so great paine &amp; sorrow, that in a sound he leaned himself vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a chaire because he would not fall, he was so farre beside himselfe, in which trance he did not long indure, but came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his remembraunce, and wish a terrible and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full voice he sayde: Is it of truth that my brother is dead, and the messengers aunswered and sayde, that it was too true. Oh traitours, aunswered this fierce young man, how durst you come before me, except first you had taken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13973:137"/>
of his death. Then they aunswered and sayd. He y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> did kill him, is not a man so soone to take reuengement of, for that after that we were cléere of his diuellish furie, it was tolde vs that he was a christian and the Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi> called <hi>Trebatio.</hi> Oh vile people, aunswered the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, yet will you replie against my words, get you out of my sight, if it were not but that I am letted for lacke of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of knighthood, I would with my owne handes teare you all to péeces. Oh false <hi>Mahomet,</hi> thou lyar, periured, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all faith, is this the honour that my brother should haue out of <hi>Tinacria</hi>: to be abated and slaine by one alone christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and in saying these wordes he entered into a chamber, where he had the Image of <hi>Mahomet</hi> all of golde, with twelue Angells on both sides, this youth tooke a heauie club and with both his handes he stroke this poore God such a blowe vpon the head, that he made him to fal to the ground, and not resting with this, he tourned against them that bare him companie, &amp; stroke on them so many blowes, that in a thousand péeces he made them fall to the ground, and sayde. O thou false traitour, heere wil I giue thée thy paiment and reward for that which thou hast done vnto my beloued bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Héere I doo forsake and denie thée, and all them that do beléeue in thée, for that I wil neither beléeue in thée nor serue thee, but if I did knowe the waie vnto the place, where as the diuell hath thée, I woulde goe and séeke thée, to giue thée to vnderstand that my furie is more then thy power. And when he had concluded with this, he went foorth of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and with a terrible noise he called for his armour, the which was straight waie brought vnto him, and without tarrying to bée made knight, he commaunded to arme him, with armour that was all white, &amp; made by art Magick, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he commanded a ship to be made readie &amp; furnished, &amp; entred into it, with intent to go to <hi>Grecia,</hi> and there to aske the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of knighthoode of the Emperour, &amp; when he had receiued it, to defie him to mortall battaile, but it chaunced not vnto him as he thought it would, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the sea with some of his accustomed torments carried him vnto the coast of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;

by reason of his small patience, once béeing a land, he would not retourne to imbarke himselfe in his ship, but remained with onely two lackeyes, and commaunded the vessell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe againe, and so went traueling whether his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would carrie him two dayes.

So all that daye he trauelled in that wildernesse, not knowing which way to take: and had eaten nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he any thing to eate, the which did trouble him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much. So when night drewe on, he discouered a heard of cattell, which were there féeding in the wildernesse, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to goe towards that place whereas the heard men were, who receiued him very well. This Knight did aske of them, if they had any thing to giue him to eate, for that hée was very hungrie: the heard men bad him that he should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and that they would giue him of such as they had for themselues. So he alighted &amp; did eate with a very good will, and so good a stomacke, as one which had not his heart nor minde occupied with the cares of loue, and there with those heard men, he passed all that night, till it was morning. So when it was daye one of the heard men did bring him into a very great &amp; occupied way, to whom he gaue great thanks. Then the Knight tooke that waye forwards, which led him towards <hi>Prouince,</hi> intending to sée if he could méet with his friend, and did determine to trauaile thereabouts, to sée if Fortune would bring him that waye: he had not trauailed farre, when that he discouered another way, which did crosse ouerthwart the same way, in which he was.

it was the waye which led strayght vnto <hi>Paris</hi>: of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which he was very ioyfull, and remained a while, thinking which way he might take for to finde <hi>Tefereo.</hi> And beeing in this muse, he heard towards his right side a great rushing of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and armed Knights, and casting his head on the one side, he saw that there was about a ten knights which came running towards him with their speares very low, calling him traytor: as soone as the Knight of the Sunne saw them he put downe the visor of his helme, and layd hand on his sword: and at the same time, he beheld on the other side, as many moe Knights armed, which made towards him as the other did. In the ende he was compassed rounde about on euery side with fortie Knights, which all cried out saying, kill the traytor, let the traytor dye, of the which the Prince did greatly meruayle. So altogether they set vpon him, and ranne at him with their speares, and stroke him all at once, yet for all that, he mooued no more in his saddle, then if they had made their incounter against a strong Tower: but at the passing by, he stroke one of them vpon the visour of his helme, that he cut halfe his head a sunder, and he fell dead to the ground. All the rest retourned with their horses against the Prince, some with their swords in their hands, and other some, whose speares remayned whole, ranne at him againe, what on the one side and what on the other, they made a very fierce and strong incounter, as of those which were the whole choyce of them that were in the Citie, onelye to kill him. When the Prince sawe himselfe so inclosed on euerye side, his wrath and anger began to kindle in him, insomuch that he tooke his sword fast in his hand, &amp; stroke such blowes, that whosoeuer he chaunced to hitte, was either slayne or maymed.</p>
               <p>At this present time arriued in those partes at the Sea side, as I haue tolde you, <hi>Brufaldoro:</hi> and this was the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, wherein he sawe so many Knightes against one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Knight. This Moore did stande and beholde them, and was verye much amazed to see the power of one Knight, who brought so many as they were, into such great distres,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:141"/>
which made them to repent and were verie sorrie that euer they began that enterprise, but by reason that they were all chosen knightes, they would not but assault him verie fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was the occasion of their farther harme &amp; destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that the Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ire did so much increase, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to double his blowes, in such sorte, that some he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out right, and some he wounded, that in a small time he left not one vpon his horse, but all brought vnto the state that they could make no resistaunce, and when the Prince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So the Prince left them, and woulde not speake anye word more vnto them, but his intent was to get him out of the Countrie, for that he well vnderstood that neither he nor <hi>Tefereo</hi> should haue anie good intertainment at their hands, and when he would haue departed, there came vnto him <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> and did salute him verie curteously, the Prince did returne him his salutation, and had a great pleasure to beholde his good grace and gentilitie. So the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan first to speake and sayd. Gentle and valiant knight, the first boone or gift that euer I did demaund since the time that I was borne, is this that I will aske of thée, and the occasion which doeth driue me to aske it, is constrained by the great valour and prowesse which I haue seene in thée, &amp; sure it is an easie thing on thy part to be fulfilled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doo desire thée to graunt me my request. The heroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Grecian</hi> which had his eyes fixed vpon him, with great pleasure that he receiued at his gentle disposition, answered: As yet I neuer denyed anie thing that was demaunded of mée, being iustly demaunded and in a iust cause, neither had I anie respect whether it be easie to be done, or difficult, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle knight aske whatsoeuer pleseth thée, for if it stand with iustice and reason, that I may graunt it thée, I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

This noble Greeke did accept his demand, and asked of him, if that he had watched his armour. The Moore aunswered, I suppose I haue watched them inough, for that it is now eighteene dayes since I haue hadde them continually on my backe. And for me there needeth no ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes: for that I am no Christian, neither Pagan, nor Moore, nor Iewe, nor Gentile, neither doo I worship nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue in God: For that the God of the Christians, I take him for my enimie: and as for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> I knowe he is little worth, and can doo lesse: and the Gentiles haue for their Gods, stockes and stones: and as for the Iewes I hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as base and vile people. Therefore I doo neither worshippe the one, nor beléeue in the other: but onely follow my own proper appetite. The Knight of the sunne could not refrain from laughter at his words, in séeing him to be a man of so much libertie, and aunswered him, saying. By God King, I doo sweare vnto thée, that I haue séene fewe or none of thy Religion: but whatsoeuer thou art, I will héere accomplish thy desire and request. Then the Prince asked him, Wilt thou be a Knight? The King aunswered, This I doo desire, and séeke no other thing, and putting on his right spurre, he kissed him on the chéeke in token of honour, and taking a rich sword, which a page of his carried with him, hée stroke him a blowe with it vpon his shoulder, and putting of it vp againe into his sheath, he hung it about his necke &amp; sayd, Now King, thy desire is fulfilled, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou art a Knight. With great good reason may it be sayd, that in the fields of <hi>Prouince</hi> was giuen the order of Knighthood, vnto the most valiantest Moore in all the worlde, and by the hands of the
<pb facs="tcp:13973:142"/>
best Knight that euer was. The King was very glad to sée himselfe a Knight, and gaue great thankes vnto the Prince for the same, requesting him very earnestly that hee woulde tell him his name, for that he might know at whose hands he receiued the order of Knighthood: the which the Prince with a good will declared.
And when he knew that he was sonne vnto the Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> whom he accounted for his mortall enemie, altering his voyce, he sayd.<q> Oh <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> thou vile God, and full of all treasons, thou hast not lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Héere I doo say vnto thée va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyant prince, that I would it had cost me my kingdome, that I had not receiued knighthood at thy hand, for that thou art sonne vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> the fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The prince somewhat angry aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him saying, King, it is not séemely in such as thou art, to speak words which be so false. It is very true, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is my father, and the mightiest Prince in the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall worlde. And not as thou doest account him a traytour. For the which cause I doo tell thée that thou doost falsly lye, like the most vilest Pagan in all thy kingdome: and in the defence thereof I will driue thée out of the field, and depriue thée of this order which I haue giuen thée, that thou shalte not excercise it, by taking from thée thy life.</q>
This miserable Pagan, who straight way was subiect vnto his furye, with great alteration sayd.
<q>Oh wretched and vnfortunate knight, doost thou thinke that I am one of those Knights that will be tamed by the strength of thy arme, I wish thée not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue it. For if thou doost proue my strength, thou shalt bée sure to finde another manner of rigor and force, then thou hast found in those; with whom thou hast got thy honour:</q>
the prince, whose patience could not suffer such great pride, but as wrathfull as a Lyon replyed. <q>Thou proud Pagan, arme thy head, and prepare thée to the battaile, for by God I doo sweare that I will doo my best to cut of such an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

The Pagan, without any more replying caused his helme to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Prince likewise was readie to discharge his blowe, who raysing himselfe vp in his stirrops, stroke so strong a blowe vpon the pagans helme, that the sound was heard a great way in the fieldes, and it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him whether he would or not to make reuerence, &amp; to holde downe his head béeing so astonyed, that it séemed a great tower had fallen vpon him: and as he woulde haue setteled himselfe againe in his saddle, he stroke him such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other vpon his shield, that he droue it vnto his head, which made him to tourne vp the white of his eyes with the great griefe which he receiued: and to kéepe himselfe vp from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, both he and his horse staggered on the one side, which made the Prince to loose many a blow, notwithstanding, he pressed on him so fast, that he had no time to tourne him to strike againe. This Moore was verye much amazed at his great force and strength, and strake at the prince so furious and strong a blow, that he made him to loose his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and almost to stoope with all his body vpon his horse necke. The prince came straight way to himselfe, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moore with so much furie, striking such a blow vpon his shield, which although it séemed to be as hard as a Diamond, yet for all that, he cut it in two péeces, and the blow descended vpon his sholder, with such a great waight, that the mountaines eckoed with the noyse: which made the pagan for feare of falling to hold himselfe fast by the Horse mane, very much marueling y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in one Knight there shuld be so much strength. Then he threw from him the rest of his shield which was left, and tooke his broad sword in both his hands, and droue such a blowe at the Prince, that lighting vpon his visor, it depriued him of his sight, &amp; forced him to fall vpon his horse necke without any remembrance. This stout Pagan would haue retourned to strike him again, but he could not: for that his horse béeing skarred with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow, lept on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side, which saued him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. Yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pagan folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accomplish his will, which he could not doo so spéedely,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:143"/>
but that the Prince did settle himselfe in his saddle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered againe his sword, and committing himselfe to God, as he alwayes was accustomed to doo, he sayd: Oh holy Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su for thy names sake, ayde and helpe me. And therwith he spurred his <hi>Cornerino</hi> with great furie, that he made him runne like the winde, and in his course he sayd, Tarry, tarry, thou man without faith, and doo not thinke that thy blowes hath done any other thing on me, but onely caused my yre &amp; anger to increase the more, for to procure to bring thée to thy ende, and to sende that excommunicated soule of thine to the diuell: and in the running of his horse, when he drew nigh him, he threatened him with his sword, shaking of it in such sort, that he gaue him to vnderstand, that at the next blowe he would make an ende of the battaile: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he stroke him such a blow on his helme, that the bloud ranne out at the visor thereof, and he fell downe backwards vpon his horse crouper almost dead. The great force that the Prince gaue to strike him, was the cause that he brake the lether of his right stirrop, and therewith he fell to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground from his horse. But strayght way with great lightnesse he arose vp againe, and in the best manner he could he made it fast, and leaping into the saddle, he retourned towardes his enemie: who was with great trouble setling himselfe in his saddle, and looking vp to the heauen, he showed a pittifull countenaunce, as though he had bene very sore hurte, as in truth he was. And when he sawe himselfe so ill intreated, and all his head bathed in bloud, he beganne to crye out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
<hi>Mahomet</hi> saying. Oh <hi>Mahomet,</hi> thou art the falsest God, amongst all the Gods, cursed be all they that doo trust in thée, and beléeue in thée. And of this be thou sure, that I doo not beléeue now in thée, neither will I so long as I liue: and this I doo promise thée, that wheresoeuer I finde anye Temple or Image of thine, to breake them downe with the strength of mine owne hande and furious arme. And with this anger he lifte vp his sword alofte, going towards the Prince, who was tarrying for him in the same manner, and with like furie. And both together, they discharged their

heauie and terrible blowes, but the Moores blowe was the first that lighted vppon the knight of the Sunnes healme, so that it made him to shake in his saddle, and hee lacked but a little to fall downe, the greate force and heauinesse of that blowe was the occasion that the blowe of the Prince could not be executed with the furie wherwith it was discharged, for that peraduenture if it had, he had not found himselfe so well as afterwarde hee did, for although it hit not right, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stroken with so much madnesse, yet it made him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would or no, to stoope with his head, and therwith he straight wayes sett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prince at that time had not his hart so quieted within him, as to aske her anie questions, but without saying anie worde he followed her, till they came vnto the filde whereas he sawe the Barke wherein the Damosell had come thether, into the which she entered, and after her followed the Knight of the Sunne, but when they were setteled within the Barke moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nothing at all, wherby they well vnderstood that it tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for more companie whome he thought to be for his friend <hi>Tefereo,</hi> and as you before hearde, he with greate furie on horse backe rode after the Moore, and made so much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hast in following him, that he ouertooke him in a plaine fielde, and at the greate noyse and calling that <hi>Tefereo</hi> made, this Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish king looked backe, beléeuing that it had bene the Knight of the Sunne, but when he sawe him and knewe by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that it shoulde not be he, he tarryed for him, and when they drewe nigh together, he sayde!

sad, &amp; not a little disquieted, yet for all the anger which the Prince had, he could not choose but saie that the king was a good knight, and of as much might as <hi>Bramarant,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more valiaunt and politike, and meruailed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe whether he were his sonne or no. So when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan sawe that he coulde not execute his furie and rage, hée beganne to roare lyke a Bull, and although he was not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed anie more to imbarke himselfe to sea, yet at that time hée was constrayned to chaunge his pretence, and finding op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie by reason of certaine Merchauntes which were fraighting of a shippe to <hi>Grecia,</hi> hée determined to goe into her. There hée imbarked himselfe, and the winde béeing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie prosperous they departed, and in a verie short time they ariued at a hauen in <hi>Grecia,</hi> where as hée went a lande, and trauailed in the Countrie certaine dayes. So it happened one daie that hée founde by a house of pleasure, a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Knightes, Ladyes, and Damosells, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating of themselues. What they were, and what the king did, in following the Storie you shall vnderstande, and I will nowe leaue him for to tell you of the heroycall sonne of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> who for the space of sixe dayes sayled on the Sea with greate pleasure, often talking of the great strength and force of the Moore, the seauenth daye he ariued in a verye faire hauen or port, which was nigh vnto a verie sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Citie, the which was furnished with greate shippes and Gallyes, and other small Barkes and Foystes. Amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest all these they passed verie quicklye, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of anie person, till such time as the Barke was fast a grounde, and perceiuing that it was there conuenient that they shoulde disimbarke themselues, they leapt a shoare, and lykewise tooke out theyr horses, and straight waye they leapt on theyr backes, and tooke the waye which lead them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie, wherein they discouered on the one parte a verie fayre and greate armie of men, and lykewise all the fielde was pitched with verie rich Tentes, and as they looked aboute, straight wayes they sawe come foorth of the Citie fiue mightie and strong Knightes, and a verie greate
<pb facs="tcp:13973:146"/>
and strong Gyaunt, and in the other parte of the armie one onely knight, whose armour séemed to bée of a passing fine Rubie, all to bée spotted with starres of golde, and set with Pearles. This sight did lyke them so well, that they were looking on that one Knight a greate while verie earnestly, and tooke greate pleasure to sée his good demenour. The Knight of the Sunne was imagining with himselfe what knight that shoulde bée, that was of so gentle disposition and proportion, beléeuing certainely that it coulde bée none, but some of his lignage. This knight passed harde by those two friendes, who did beholde them verie much, yet hée made no staying, but without speaking anie worde he passed on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and when hée was come into that place of the fielde that was appointed for the battaile, he put his speare in his reast, at the which token one of the sixe knightes came foorth to make resistaunce, whome the knight of the Sunne did knowe.</p>

his gallaunt and rich shéelde, with a comelye and graue countenaunce he went towardes the Citie, and of the first that hée met withall, he asked what lande or Countrie that was, for that hée was ignoraunt thereof, and straight waie it was tolde him in the Sarasin language, that hée was in the kingdome of <hi>Cimarra,</hi> whereat hée was not a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and considering the knowledge of the wise <hi>Lyrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo,</hi> he went forwardes on his waie without staying, till he entered into the gates of the Citie, and all they which met with him, did verie much beholde him, greatly meruailing at his grauitie, good disposition, and wonderfull stature. There were sundrye that aduertised the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as soone as hée was come a shoare, howe that there was a knight which did disimbarke himselfe at the Port or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which came without gouernement, béeing armed with verie rich and costly armour, and one that was of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent stature and good disposition. The auncient King of the Countrie who was aduertised thereof before by the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo,</hi> did straight waie knowe that it was hée which had passed the terrible kéepers of his murthered Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>For you shall vnderstand, that as soone as the Emperour was departed from the Ilande, the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the bodie of the Ladie shoulde bée carried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cimarra,</hi> aduertising her Father, that the long looked for reuengement was not farre of. And lykewise how and in what manner the knight which did it shoulde come into his lande, and also who that Knight shoulde bée. Wherefore as soone as the king was giuen to vnderstande of his ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, without anie more tarrying, béeing accompanyed with all his noble men, and leading in his hande a very fayre and young childe, about twelue yeares olde; the most best proportoined that euer nature coulde frame, of whome you shall heare no more in this booke, for that in the seconde booke it shall bée declared at large of him. The king went forth till he came to the chiefe place of the Citie, there to méet
<pb facs="tcp:13973:147"/>
with the Emperour, whereas likewise he met with this old and auncient King, who boowing his knées to the earth, and shedding of many teares, with ioye, receiued him, saying.
<q>O high and mightie Emperour, giue me héere your hands, that I may discharge the dutie that all humane creatures do owe vnto your highnesse: how much more I, that am bounde therevnto, for that with so much firmenesse thou wouldest confirme thy oath, and take the charge in thine owne person to worke my reuengement.</q>
The Emperour was in a great confusion, to heare himselfe named, and neuer gaue anye in all that lande to vnderstand thereof, but strayght waye hée suspected, that <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> should aduise him of his comming. And héerewith vsing of his accustomed bountie, hée tooke him by the hand, and lifted him from the grounde, saying,
<q>Good King, the debt which thou sayst is due vnto me, thou hast repayed in showing the noblenesse of thy heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and otherwise I am constrained by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and iustice, to make reuengement of that cursed facte, which was without all pitie committed vpon thy daughter. And seeing that there can be no other remedy but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement, héere of my part I doo offer thée to doo all, that in my power is possible to be done, desiring thée that thou restraine these teares, and giue order that with great spéede there may be ioyned together all thy power, to the end that we maye goe and conclude that which in me lyeth. The King with a sad voyce aunswered. High and mightie Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, this hath bene prouided for before, for all my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and shires are at an houres warning, to goe to the ayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of so iust a cause, and we tarryed for nothing but onely your royall person, who must be the sword of my reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus with these and such like communications, they went vnto the Kings pallaice, which was hanged all with blacke clothes, for others he would not consent to haue han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, since the death of his daughter <hi>Herea.</hi> There was the Emperour vnarmed, and serued with as great highnesse and honour, as though he had bene in <hi>Grecia.</hi> Notwithstanding

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> people should march forwards vnto a hauen which was at the vttermost parts of all the Kingdome, wheras they found ships and barkes of all sortes, verye well furnished of all things that was néedfull. There was thrée hundred ships one with another, in the which there was imbarked fiftie thousand Moores meruailously well appointed, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their sayles vnto the winde, all this Nauie tooke theyr voyage towards <hi>Numidia.</hi> So they nauigated, and founds the winde fauourable, which brought them vnto a porte or hauen, which was but two leagues from the Kings house. There, with great ioy and pleasure they went a shore, with out any resistaunce or gainsaying. So when they were all out of the shippes a lande, they displayed their ancients, and in very good order they marched forwards. And at such time as <hi>Apollo</hi> had made an ende of his iourney, and that the darke night came on, they came in sight of the Citie, and without taking any rest, towards the lande side they pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their tents, and fortified themselues in the best wise they could, in such sort, as their good Captaine which did gouerne them had commaunded, without dooing any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. So when all things was put in good order as they would haue it, he commaunded that all the armie, should go vnto the gate of the Citie that was most néerest, the which was straight waye done: and in thrée dayes after they did no other thing but ease and rest themselues: for that the people were somewhat out of quiet with their great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle.</p>
               <p>The fourth daye, the Emperour séeing that there was no sturring in the Citie, (the which was done by pollicie, tarying to sée what the enimies would doo) the Emperour called for his armour: and being armed, there was brought a verye fayre and mightie horse vnto him: and with his accustomed courage he issued out from amongst his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, and rode towards the wall of the Citie, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into a faire gréene playne nigh vnto the walls, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:13973:148"/>
vp the visour of his healme, he set his horne vnto his mouth, and did sound it very strongly, which was to warne them that were in the Citie, to come to the walls and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what he would saye:
and when he sawe that there was much people, attending to heare him, he began to saye.<q> O King <hi>Noraldino</hi> of <hi>Numidia,</hi> how carelesse thou art in this thy strong countrey, thinking that the strength thereof will defende thée, that thou payest not the price of thy naughtie treason, which thou didst vse with that vnfortunate <hi>Herea.</hi> Take vnto thée thy armour, and for that thou hadst a heart to commit this euill déede, haue now likewise a courage to make thy defence: come foorth of these thy walls, thou trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and destroyer of the royall bloud.</q>
All they which were on the walls did heare the threatenings, and straight waye went and tolde it vnto the king of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who was at that time in communication of warres and of armyes, and of all things that belonged therevnto, and when he hearde these newes, giuing a great sigh he sayd. <q>Oh ye Gods, are not you content to sée me in this perplexitie, and so much wronged, but likewise with sound of trumpet suffer me to be outraged in calling me traytor.</q>
These fayned griefes and sorrowfull words had so much force, that it moued the harts of the Princes that were with him, for to goe out into the field for his defence: and in great hast they commaunded, that their harnesse shuld be brought vnto them, with deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to dye, or to defend his cause. And there was none that had any feare, but onely the Gyant, for that he would not giue any credit vnto the Kings words, although he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled neuer so muuch: but by reason that he had sworne therevnto, hée was constrayned by his oath to goe foorth with the rest.</p>
               <p>So in this order as I haue told you, they went foorth of the Citie all sixe together: and he which gaue the first onset was that valiant and amorous <hi>Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia</hi> brothers son vnto the Emperour, who with a gentle behauiour when hée came nigh the Emperour, sayd in the Saracen tongue:<q> It is not the part of good Knights to speake any villany, especially
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13973:148"/>
against Kings whom they are bound to haue in reuerence &amp; honour. To whom the Emperour aunswered in the same language. Art thou <hi>Noraldino</hi> King of <hi>Numidia? Don Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> replyed, No, but I am a Knight, and a very stranger in this countrey: but yet by firme oath, I determine to dye in the defence of his right. The Emperor aunswered: He hath neither iustice nor right on his side, but it is most apparant wrong which he doth maintaine, and there is no reason that such a traytor as he is, shoulde be by anye other defended: neither is it séemely that anie Knight of price should charge himselfe in his behalfe, for that he is a traytor. And likewise he that doth defend him and take his part (in this, that hee will sustaine and maintaine so great vniustice) is pertaker of his treason, and meriteth a traytors name. And for that thou art his defender, héere I giue thée to vnderstand, that I care not for thée, and lesse I doo estéeme thée: for that hée which doth take vpon him to defend a traytor, may well be accounted a traytor. This valiaunt <hi>Eleno,</hi> when hée sawe himselfe to be so ill intreated, aunswered: Thou lyest in so saying, for that I was neuer traytor, neither doo I procéede of the lynage where traytors euer were: notwithstanding, thou shalt pay me with thy head, the great vncurtesie which thou hast vsed vnto me. Therefore it doth stande thée in hand to looke vnto thy selfe, and take that part of the fielde which thou thinkest best for thy purpose, and leaue off these blazing words to ioyne with me in battaile, that I maye sée if thou canst as well defend thy quarrell, as thou canst han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thy tongue. </q>At which words, there drew nigh them the Prince <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> and as the Emperour woulde haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to put himselfe in battel, he did behold him, &amp; straight waye knew him.
And casting his eyes on the one side, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise knew the other thrée, but he could not knowe who the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> should be: and for the great desire which hée had to know what he was, he sayd:
<q>Knight, I doo desire thée for courtesies sake to tell me what thou art: &amp; if thou wilt not grant me this, then I pray thée to lift vp y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> visor of thy helme, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I may sée thy face? for héere I giue thée to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb facs="tcp:13973:149"/>
thy foure companions I dooe knowe, which is the occasion that I haue no desire to enter into battaile with thée. Then <hi>Don Eleno</hi> aunswered and sayd: Pagan, of the two things which thou doest aske of mée (although there is no compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) yet will I pleasure thée in fulfilling one of them: </q>and in saying these wordes, he lift vp the visour of his healme, and when the Emperour sawe him, he beléeued that it had béene his sonne <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and with a loud voice he said.
<q>Oh migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, how can this be true, that vnto knights of my lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage should chaunce so vile a spot, who hetherto in all their dooings haue got great honour and praise, and now are come to defend such apparaunt wickednesse and treason. Thou shalt vnderstand knight, that I am the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and would not willingly now be called thy Father, for that thou art come to defend so apparaunt and knowen an euill, for I knowing the vnreasonable naughtinesse that this king hath committed, am come to take this conquest in hande, for in all my life time I neuer tooke a more iuster cause in hand, neither was there euer in all the worlde a thing more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier of punishment then this, and séeing that my fortune hath béen such, that my first enimie that shuld come against me, séemeth my sonne, put thy selfe héere now before thy high progenitour from whence thou doest descend, and for Gods loue doe not blot thy stock, in defending traitours &amp; treason, &amp; therwith in few words he told vnto them all the whole hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, as before I haue tolde you. Then this excellent <hi>Dacian</hi> answered. High &amp; mightie Emperour, although by my name thou hast not knowen me, yet in calling me sonne thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest happen on the truth. For thou shalt vnderstand that I am called <hi>Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> sonne vnto the king of <hi>Dacia</hi> thy brother, and in that which thou hast sayde that we doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine treasons, we are to the contrarie informed, neuertheles I beséech your highnesse to tarrie héere a while, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he and the Prince in a great confusion returned to the place whereas the rest of his companions were, and turning his talke vnto the king, he sayd. King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> thou shalt vnderstand that yonder knight is the Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:13973:149"/>
my vnckle, who in that small time which we haue ben with him, hath told vnto vs all the effect of this thy matter, cleane contrary vnto that which thou hast declared vnto vs. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King, there is no reason, that Knights of so high bloud and name as we are should be set to defend lyes and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: but if it be to the contrary of that which he hath told vnto me, haue no doubt but tell vs the truth. For héere I sweare by the loue that I beare vnto that vnlouing <hi>Lidia,</hi> that I will trauayle so with my vnckle, that greatly with thy honour thou shalt goe thorough with this conquest. Then this false King aunswered. O Knights which doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your selues to be Christians, and by the God whome you doo worship haue made a solemne oath to helpe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me by the strength of your armes: how happeneth it now y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> without any care of your oth, which you haue sworn, you will leaue me desolate, and goe from your words, béeing doubtfull of the very truth. The couragious French man aunswered: Doo thou not thinke King, that our oathes and words shall be abrogated, rather first we will léese our liues, both I, the prince, &amp; all our companions: but consider king, that God will not that we shall imagine amisse of <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> who is a prince of great veritie and truth, and agayne, our verie nigh kinsman. Therefore this, and that which hée hath tolde vs, hath moued vs to come and tell thée, and doe saye, that none of vs will goe from his word and oath if thy cause be iust. Then the valyaunt <hi>Eleno</hi> did cut off his reasons, and tourning vnto the King he sayd. King of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> héere I do most humblye desire thée, that with false il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions thou putte not vs vnto so great trauaile, for that then it can not be, but either wée must dye in the hands of him whome we doe desire to serue, or els, (though farre vnlikely) to kill him. Is it possible king, that thou hast brought vs vnto this estate, that crueltie should gouern our wills, without hauing power to doe any other thing. </q>The King when he saw that the Knights were very earnest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to sweare with great oaths that his cause was iust, and that he had tolde vnto them the truth of the matter, and if
<pb facs="tcp:13973:150"/>
so be that the Emperour had tolde them any other thing, it was onely to deceiue them, and to tourne them, that they should not make his defence, and charged them againe with their oath which they had made and how that they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their words to be his vpholder and defender.
This wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Dacian</hi> tourning vnto his companions sayd. <q>Knightes, what doo you thinke in this matter, what is it best that we doo héerein? For well you doo sée, that we are so bewrapte &amp; bound one against another, and cousin against cousin, yet for all that we cannot by any meanes excuse the battaile. So they did all determine to retourne vnto the Emperour, and to desire him for to accept it in good part, and to leaue off that battaile, &amp; to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beléeue that he was falsly informed, &amp; when they came vnto him they said. Worthy Emperour, and our onely Lord, looke well vnto this false information, wherewith they haue informed you, and hauing well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thereof, we doo all request you, for the loue which vnto your sonnes and cousins, and vnto all your friendes you doo owe, that it may moue you to take no occasion to put vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this extremitie, for that by anie meanes we cannot goe from our oath and word. Unto the which the Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and sayd. My louing friends, if that you haue giuen your word and oath to procure to make defence of so false a King, doo you likewise indeuour to performe the same: for the like will I doe to accomplish that which I haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for that there is no more reason for the one then for the other. But this one thing I doe tell you, that it is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that you will maintaine the treason of this false King, as it appereth plainly by many reasons, which I haue told vnto you: and the principall cause, wherin you maye sée plainely his treason and falshoode, is the little hast that hée doeth make himselfe vnto the battaile, and if he knew that he doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h maintaine the truth, let him come forth and make his owne defence.</q>
At the which reasons they all helde theyr peace, considering the great reason which the Emperour had declared, and determined that the next daie they woulde conclude, what were best to bée done, &amp; so these sixe knights
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13973:150"/>
returned vnto the Citie, and the Emperour vnto the campe. Of all this that happened, he that receiued the most content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was the Prince <hi>Eleno,</hi> for he desired verye much to retourne vnto the Citie, for that at his departure he left his Lady very sicke, so that he thought not to finde her aliue, and comming to the Citie, hée was no sooner alighted from his horse, but hée went straight vnto her Chamber, whereas hée found her with a mightie burning ague, and séeing her in that case, he was as one that was beside himselfe, and the more that her ague increased, the more furious she did shew her selfe and farther out of quiet. So this gréeuous and sicke Ladie did aske paper and inke for to write a few lines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him which was the causer of all this her harme, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an ende of her writing, without power to doo any other thing, with the great féeblenesse shée felt, she fell downe vpon her pillowe, &amp; speaking vnto <hi>Eleno</hi> she sayd.
<q>Ualiant knight, behold héere thy <hi>Lidia,</hi> at her last ende: for that there doth not remaine in me strength for to giue thée thankes, for so great benefits as I haue receiued at thy handes: yet I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one great comfort with me, which is, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> although I dye, yet thy great loyaltie doeth not dye, neyther my firme faith, and although I was vnloued of an vnfaythfull Knight, yet am I beloued of the most couragious knight in the worlde.</q>
This sorrowfull and troubled Prince woulde not suffer her to goe forwards with her talke, but with shedding of manie teares from his eyes, he sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Oh my swéete Mistresse, doe not giue me to vnderstande that thou wilt dye, if that thou meane I shall remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. Oh my loue, I would rather that my heart shoulde be parted in twaine, by the greatest enimie that I haue, then to remaine without thée. Oh my louing Mistres, let this thy youthfull yeres and great beautie which thou hast, incourage thée, &amp; die not in this order:</q> this feeble <hi>Lidia</hi> for to shew with more feruentnesse the good will which she did owe vnto the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

for his great curtesie forced her selfe to holde vp her head, and he lifted it vp with such quicknesse, as though her weake members had felt no griefe, &amp; as though the furie of

But one thing, (oh my swéete and true louer) I will desire thée before that I doo dye, which is, that thou wouldest procure, that this letter maye bée giuen vnto that cruell Knight, who hath brought me vnto this estate, giuing him to vnderstande of this my troublesome death, the occasion whereof, was his vnreasonable crueltie.</q>
And making an end of saying this, this miserable Lady fell downe, without hauing any more strength to sit vp, but let the letter fall out of her hande before her true louer, who tooke it vp and sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Oh all my ioye, what a cruell knife is this to my heart, to heare thy complayntes, in giuing me to vnderstande the great crueltie that loue hath vsed against thée, without anye desert or reason: and verely I doo beléeue, that these thy great thoughts and griefes, but most of all thy absence wil be the occasion of my death. And if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> my enimies are not of power to giue it me, héere I doo sweare vnto thee by the great and true loue which I beare vnto thée, that I my selfe with my owne hands will procure to pull this heart out of his place, for that it knew not how to giue thée contentment paying therwith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dutie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ow vnto thée.

               </p>
               <p>Then this weake <hi>Lidia</hi> sayde:<q> Gentle Knight, there is nowe no time all béeing past, for that I doe féele my selfe that this is the last fight. The sacred Gods will not permit, that before my death I shoulde sée his face: for if I did, I verily beléeue that I should receiue some comfort. O immortall Gods, into your diuine bosomes I doe commend my soule, asking no other reuengement against the causer of all my euill, but that hée die of the same infirmitie.

How is it possible my swéet Mistres, sayd the Prince, that now thou art in doubt of my loue, I promise you that my true loue doth not deserue this suspition, and héere I giue you to vnderstande, that first the mightie riuer of <hi>Tigris</hi> shall forsake her course and runne backe againe, before that anie lacke shall be found in me of that I owe vnto thy loue, neither anie forgetfulnesse to bee the occasion to withdraw me from doing anie thing that you shall commaund me, therfore swéet mistres aske what your pleasure is, for that thou canst aske nothing at my handes, but it shall be all thine. This weak Ladie, whose power and strength was wholy decayed, and that her houre drew nigh at hande, with a weake and feeble voice she said. That which I desire, gentle Lorde, is, that this my letter may come vnto the handes of <hi>Brenio,</hi> wherein he may see how cruell he hath bene vnto his <hi>Lidia.</hi>
                  </q> So this dead Ladie spake neuer a word more, for at that instaunt the destinies concluded to cut the thrid of her lyfe a sunder.
Heere the Prince lacked both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and patience, heere he lost all his comfort and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; comming vnto the dead bodie of <hi>Lidia,</hi> he fell in a sound, &amp; when (by the procurement of the Ladies and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
<pb facs="tcp:13973:152"/>
that were there present) he came to himselfe, he arose vp with a furious wrath, saying:<q> Is it of truth swéete soule that thou art departed &amp; gone without me? Is it possible my <hi>Lidia</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shall not follow thée whether thou doest goe? Alas what shall I doe? where am I y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I doo consent to let thée depart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? how is this my onely loue, shall I loose thée? What is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this cruell heart aileth, that it renteth not in péeces. O <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno</hi> is this the loue that vnto thy <hi>Lidia</hi> liuing thou diddest shew.</q> At which great noise the other foure Princes entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chamber, who were meruailously altered to heare his lamentations.
So either of them in the best wise he could did procure to comfort him, but this amorous knight with the great anguish that he had, fel in a sound in the armes of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerindo,</hi> who requested the Ladyes and damsells which were there in companie with the dead bodie, that they woulde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine some thing to bring him againe to his remembraunce, and so with such remedies as they did make he came againe vnto himselfe, who then with great rage crieng out, called for his <hi>Lidia.</hi>
                  <q> Oh my <hi>Lidia,</hi> what is become of thée, who for loue in another mans armes didst die, &amp; now I die for thy loue? Oh the whole staie of all my life, where art thou my <hi>Lidia,</hi> my comfort, doest thou heare me? Doest thou not carrie with thée this thy heart? No, no, for yet I doe féele it. Is it possible that I can liue, or life will long sustaine me? I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beléeue it. Oh my ioy, doest thou come againe, I pray thée bée not so ingratefull, but stay a while for I will come vnto thée. For now I am certainely perswaded that I am alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without life. Fond <hi>Eleno</hi> if thou be dead, wherefore doest thou talke so much of vanities, wherefore doest thou not hold thy peace.</q>
And with these &amp; such lyke reasons he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained without any feeling, in such sort that it séemed that he was dead.</p>
               <p>The other Princes which were there present sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in that case, tooke him betwéene them, and carried him vnto another chamber, and procured that <hi>Lidia</hi> shoulde be buried, which straight waie was done, for that the King commaunded his Sepulchre shoulde bée open, in which they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13973:152"/>
put this dead Ladie. The Prince of <hi>Hungaria</hi> did remaine in companie with the Prince <hi>Eleno,</hi> for that he woulde not let him alone, for hée loued him out of all measure, because hée did resemble so much the valiaunt <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> So hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there till such time as hée came vnto himselfe, and the first worde that Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> sayd, was: Where is the Letter of my <hi>Lidia. Liriamandro</hi> did giue it him, who taking it in his hand, he sayd.</p>
               <p>Oh worke, and the last worke of that white Iuorie hande: héere I doe sweare vnto thée by the honour that I doo owe vnto knighthoode, not to a part it from my heart, till such time as the heart of that cruell <hi>Brenio</hi> bée cut it péeces, and in speaking this hée kissed it a thousand times, vttering a thousande varieties. And straight waye with a furious anger, hée arose vp and sayde: What is this <hi>Eleno,</hi> doest thou beléeue that with lamenting thou shalt recouer thy welbeloued <hi>Lidia,</hi> and not performe that which by her was commaunded thée. It is more requisite that thou doest trauaile and wander, till such time as thou hast performed that which thou hast promised, gather vnto thy selfe strength and courage, for to performe that which thy heart is bounde to doo. So with this anguish he arose vp at such times as <hi>Aurora,</hi> with his glistering beames hadde spread ouer the earth.</p>

to suffer the great griefe that his heart did féele, he sayd. Oh my swéete <hi>Lidia,</hi> if thou doest heare my griefe and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let it appeare by some outwarde shewe in these harde stones, which hath bewrapt and inclosed thy white and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate body, that receiuing griefe at these my lamentations, it may giue place that I may sée thee, let this my anguish gréeue thée my <hi>Lidia,</hi> likewise let this my misfortune gréeue thée. But alasse what shall I say, is it not sufficient that the great paine that I doe sustaine for thy death, but I must bewaile my owne sorrowe: Oh mistres, at thy death thou madest an end of all thy paines, and mine doth more and more increase. And in saying these and such like lamentations, he drew out his Dagger, and with the point he wrote an Epitaph, which was as followeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>HEere Lidia lou'de and vnbelou'de doth lie,</l>
                  <l>Whose great good will to her small good did bring:</l>
                  <l>She loue did feele, which causelesse did applie</l>

               </q>
               <p>So when he had made this Epitaph, he arose vp, saying: héere I doe promise thée <hi>Lidia,</hi> since my fortune is such that I haue lost thée, there is no other that shall enter into this my heart and hard breast. But how can I saie that it is hard, did it not open at the houre when it felt thy absence, and so without saying anie more, he went out of the temple, with all the rest of his companions, and taking their horses, they altogether issued out of the citie, at such time as the Emperor was arming himselfe in his rich tent. The fierce king of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denia</hi> when he sawe that they returned againe, vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which the daie before they did intreate of, he could not bée in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but sayde.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13973:153"/>

<q>Well, doo not thou thinke that it shall be so, but perswade thy selfe, that thou shalt be the first in the incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that thou maist proue how euill it is to suffer the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urie of the Emperour of <hi>Grecia.</hi> O worthie king of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the king of <hi>Numidia,</hi> how the great affection which thou hast vnto the Emperour, doth cause thée not to giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit vnto this my iustice and right. Héere I doe require thée by the oath which thou madest vnto me, that thou be the first to put thy selfe in the defence of my person. To which the <hi>Sardenian</hi> aunswered: First, the heauen and the earth shall ioyne together, before that I wil consent that my arme shal mooue it selfe against him, whom I take for my Lord and master. And héere I saye vnto thée oh king, that if thou doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est but once againe will me héereto, I sweare to thée by the soueraigne God, that neither thy power, nor all thy subiects shall be able to deliuer thée out of my hands.</q> So their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was cut off by séeing the Emperour to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them vpon a very faire horse, who showed so greate furie, that it was a wonder to sée.
At this present time there appeared comming from those parts which was towardes the sea, two Knights, who were very well armed. If you do remember, these were the two valiant warriours, the prince of the Sunne, and the strong <hi>Sardenian.</hi> The great desire that the Emperour had to sée himselfe with the <hi>Numidian,</hi> was the occasion that he little estéemed the tarrying for those two knights, for that he thought the houre was come of the battaile, and that the defender should be (as he had demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) that false King and traitour, he put himselfe forwardes towards the place wheras the Princes and the king came. And when they wer together, these Princes with very faire and amorous wordes and of great fidelitie, indeuoured so perswade the Emperour for to leaue the battaile, and that therein they should receiue meruailous great contentment, if he would accept it. The knight of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sunne stood &amp; did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their reasonings, &amp; did looke for no other thing but furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous battaile, by all tokens y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shewed with their handes and other demeanors of their bodies: &amp; knowing fiue of the
<pb facs="tcp:13973:154"/>
knightes, he very much meruailed what shoulde be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and with this desire he had to knowe what should moue them to this controuersie, he sawe a Lackie which passed by, and he called him, &amp; asked of him in the Saracen tongue, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: Friend, tell me if thou cannest what is the occason that doth cause them to make this cruell and furious battaile, and who they be that doo make it. This Lackie (by the riches of his armour, and by his good proportion) iudged him to bée a knight of estimation, he saide: Gentle Knight, the cause of this controuersie and defence, if I should stand to tell you it all, it would be verie tedious, but of all the rest that thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est aske me, I will giue thée to vnderstand that which I dooe knowe. You shall vnderstand that the knight which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the mightie Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and that which hée doth maintaine is great iustice and right, and will giue great punishment for the same, which is that that the others doe defend. The knight of the Sunne was very much amazed at that which he hearde, and therewith he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them before they had made an end of their reasoning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so without anie shew of trouble he sayd vnto the Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi> (who was still sore troubled with the sorrowe, as you haue heard). Art thou <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> my cousin, and brothers sonne vnto the Emperour, my Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I am he aunswered the <hi>Dacian,</hi> who ought not for to dye, before I giue thée thy death, for that thou hast caused so much euill to come vpon me, that liuing I doe now die. The knight of the Sunne béeing almost in a confusion to beare his drie reasons, answered: Louing cousin, I féele my selfe somewhat troubled at these thy wordes, and greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed that thou art fallen into so great pride to lift vp thy armed hand against thy naturall parents, and more béeing informed, that which thou doest pretend to defend is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant treason. The Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> did cut of his talke and said. Oh my cousin, héere I doe tell thée, that I doe séeke no other thing but death, therefore procure to giue it mée, for that I shal thinke my selfe happie to die in thy hands, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding defend thy selfe as thou wert wont to do, for that thou
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13973:154"/>
knowest it doth so behooue thée. With this furie and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnderstanding, speking no more words, he turned about his horse, crying out and saying: I will liue no longer, seeing I haue lost that, beside which, to me can be no greater losse. The knight of the Sun verie much meruailed at these his short reasons, not knowing of anie thing that had happened vnto him, &amp; wondering that his true heart should commit or maintain such wrongs, he turned about his horse for to make his defence, in such sort, that all the knights that were there, were not sufficient to disturbe him, but with great fury they met together with their speares, yet not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their saddles, but remained as though they hadde bene two towers, and straight way with no lesse force they began to lay hold on their swordes, and for that the knight of the Sunne had a respect vnto him, he did rather procure to make his defence, then in anie thing to offend him, but <hi>Don Eleno</hi> stroke such a blowe at his cousin, that he made him to stoope with all his bodie to the horse necke. The knight of the Sun would haue taken reuengement of the same blowe, but hée considered that he was his cousin, and that he was ignorant of the cause that should moue him to commit this folly, for the which consideration he did suffer him, and would make no reuengement. <hi>Tefereo</hi> who sawe all that had passed, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his first place without remouing, til time did serue him to accomplish that which he had determined in his mind to doo, and when he sawe occasion for the same, he threw his shéeld vpon his arme, and put his speare in his rest, &amp; made a shew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would be doing with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; he put himself in a readinesse, but more to giue him to vnderstand what he was, then to hurt him. This furious <hi>Sardenian</hi> stroke his horse with the spurs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him run like the commet which falleth from the side of <hi>Trion,</hi> &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came in the middest of his course, he turned his horse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the place whereas the king of <hi>Numidia</hi> was (who had put himselfe a part from the rest) with so great swiftnesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by no meanes he could kéepe or defend himselfe from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, but by reason of the strength wherwith it was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:155"/>
he threw them to the ground, very euill intreated. He was no sooner fallen when that this couragious <hi>Sardenian</hi> leapt from his horse verie lightly, and found that the king of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia</hi> was on foote readie for to defend himselfe, and crying out: Knightes, succour, succour, or else I am but dead. At the which noise all the other fiue knights looked about, and when they sawe the king in the power of that valiant knight, they would haue rescued him, but the light of all knighthoode which was the father and the sonne, did disturbe them, and put themselues before them, and would not suffer them to giue anie such aide, but did there great wonders, striking on euerie side, in such sort, that now one and then the other they made them to recoile backe. The strong and furious <hi>Eleno</hi> did but little harme with his swoorde, neither made he anie great resistaunce, the Gyant with as little hast as might bée went to helpe the <hi>Numidian</hi> king, &amp; with a reasonable pace he went towards the place whereas the king was, (but for that reason would not consent that such as he is should bée holpen) with the hast that he made, his horse stumbled, in such sort, that horse and master fell to the ground, of the which he was verie sore hurt and brused, as it appeared by his slow rising vp againe. The valiant <hi>Sardenian</hi> with great pollicie procured to bring to an end his desire, before that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie did come to disturbe him, and béeing lighted of his horse he made hast to the King and sayde: Thou traytour, it shal little profit or plesure thée to call for help, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in my hands thou shalt leaue this thy traiterous soule, who doeth deserue to suffer all the euills that may bée, and therwith hée stroke him such a blowe vppon his healme, and with so greate furie, that he made him in spite of his heart to knéele with both his knées vppon the earth. So when the <hi>Sardenian</hi> perceiued him to bée in this case, with greate valyauntnesse he straight wayes layde holde of his healme with his lefte hande, and pulled it cleane from his head, and with his right hande he smote him such a blowe vppon the head, that hée parted it in two péeces, and immediatly hée fell downe dead to the ground, and looking about to sée whether his horse wer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13973:155"/>
gone or no, he found that he was nigh at hande. Then hée tooke the dead king and made him fast vnto the stiroppes of the Saddle, and with a trice hée leapt vpon his horse, and so without anie helpe of his stiroppes, hee made his horse to runne, and so drew the king after him throughout all the fielde. The Gyaunt would haue succoured him, but all was in vaine. In this sorte went <hi>Tefereo</hi> drawing the king af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him before all the knightes that were there present and sayde: Knightes, what doe you meane to bée so still? Why doe you not vpholde and defend this trayterous king, in whose strength was all his confidence? Beholde now where he hath receiued the payment, that such euill workes as his deserued, and therewith he rode round about the fielde as hée did before. The Emperour when hée sawe that this fact was ended, would that his cousin <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> and the Prince his sonne shoulde leaue theyr battaile, which was betweene them begunne a newe, and they were giuing one another terrible blowes, but not with such great furie, for that they did knowe the one the other, otherwise it woulde haue gone ill on both parts. The Emperour put himself betwéene them and said.</p>
               <p>Oh Knights, cease your battaile and hearken vnto my wordes. <hi>Eleno</hi> which was still kindled in wrath, hadde no respect vnto those wordes, neyther woulde hée part, but lyke a man distraught from himselfe, hée doubled such a blowe vpon the visour of the Emperour, that hée made him loose the sight of his eyes. The Emperour who was verie angry and not a lyttle grieued, at the small regarde that he had of his wordes, woulde presently haue reuenged the blowe, but that hée was disturbed by the Gyaunt, who pulling off his healme went towards the place whereas these thrée wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie warriours were, and with a heauie and troubled voyce he sayde.</p>
               <p>Heare mée O noble Emperour and you worthie knights, cease this your controuersie and staye your vnweakened armes, till such time as I haue vttered that which I will saye. Then the Emperour with his accustomed méeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:13973:156"/>
sayd. Noble King, what is it that thou canst demaund of me, that I would not willingly accomplish? To whome he aunswered. Well, séeing it is so my Lord, I doo desire you to returne vnto your Tent, and take your ease, and to leaue off this, and such like controuersies: for that the cause ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, my cousin and brothers sonne, hath taken away from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene you. And when he had sayd these &amp; such like words, he retourned vnto his companions, and perswaded them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to retourne vnto the Citie, to the which they all consented, although it was cleane contrary vnto the will of <hi>Don Eleno.</hi> So when they were entered into the Citie, they found that all the people and burgesses thereof were in great lamentation for the losse of their king and Lord, and the more, for that his death was so shamefull and odious. But they rested not till they came to the Kings Pallayce, whereas they were receiued, and were vnarmed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the dinner to be made readye, whereat they were meruailouslye serued.

               <p>Worthy Princes, and my Lords and friends, you doo well know, and héere you haue séene, how that all our trauayle which we haue had for to defend this king, hath bene great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against our honours, and that neither our threatnings nor words were sufficient for to disturbe the will of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour héerein: for that he knew that his quarrell was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certaine and iust, which was the occasion, that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this fact in all things hath bene fauourable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto his desire. And for the better verefieng of the same, at that present time you saw come in place, his worthy son, accompanied with my brothers sonne my cousin, that with their aide he should conclude to put in execution his iuste &amp; true desired reuengement: which hath bene a great reproch and ignomy vnto vs all, neither was there in any of vs so much force or st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let euery one doo as he thinketh best, for that the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince will not let to be the same, which his fortune hath ordained, and therewith he arose vp from the table, and made as though he went vnto his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but he did not: for incontinent he called a Lackey of his, and armed himselfe, and commaunded him very secretly to carrie his horse out of the Citie, and to tarrie for him there, and the lackey did as the prince had commanded him. So when he was out of the Citie, he leaped vpon his horse, and carried in no place till he came vnto the waters side, and by chaunce he came vnto the place whereas the barke was, that brought his cousin thether, into which he entered, and his lackey put in his horse.

               <p>Now I will retourne vnto the Princes, who after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reasonings, determined to goe foorthwith vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours tent, and went vnto the chamber of <hi>Don Eleno</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to perswade him to doo the like, but when they came ther, they neither found him nor his armour, for the which they were very sad and sorrie, imagining straight waye what he had done. And séeing that it was labour lost to goe and séeke him, they themselues determined to departe without him. And when they came vnto the scowtes of the host, it was asked them what they fought, and what they would haue? The Giaunt sayd vnto them: Friends, goe vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and tell him that héere are the Knights with whom he had all his late contention, that are very desirous to speak with him. So the scoutes sent a messenger straight way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperor.

The next daie in the morning the king of <hi>Cimarra</hi> did arise, meruailouslye richlye apparelled, with roabes of cloth of golde, and went vnto the knightes, giuing them to vnderstand that he was more contented and in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et then anie other king, in that he was reuenged in such sort as you haue heard. This good king neuer ceased in giuing thanks vnto the Emperour for the great curtesie which hee receiued at his hands, and there they gaue order that all the whole camp should returne vnto their owne countrie, for that which they came for was concluded, and that their departure shuld be in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people shuld not do anie harme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was straight waie accomplished, &amp; they appointed for king ouer that countrie a valiant knight, of whom we will intreate in the third part of this historie.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore in the historie, if you doo remember, the fierce Moore <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> came vnto the place whereas a companye of Ladyes and damsells were, whereas he stayed to looke and beholde them: and with them wer sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting knights of a good disposition, and well proportioned. At which time as we began to intreate of them, I did not tell you who they were: but now you shall vnderstand, that they were the two Empresses of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> and <hi>Trapisond,</hi> who were come vnto that house of pleasure for to recreate themselues, which was verye nigh vnto a faire village. And the occasion of this theyr going foorth, was the great estéemed Quéene of <hi>Lira,</hi> (of whom till now our historie hath made no mention, nor of hir surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing excellencies, but hath referred them till time did serue) Shée béeing manye times with the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:13973:158"/>
heard her teil of some feates of knighthoode that had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by her, the which the Quéene with great contentment gaue eare vnto, imagining within her selfe to be of as good disposition, and haue as much strength as she, yea, and rather more: and knowing that her strength was much, she purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed verye secretlye to proue her selfe, and taking this place (whether as they went to recreate themselues) to be very fit for to performe her will, with all secrecie in the worlde, she commaunded that her armour (which <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto her) should be carried thether, which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and done by the damosells, for that they all had a great delight to pleasure and serue her, she was of them so welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and her excellent vertues deserued no lesse. So when they were come vnto the house of pleasure, she went foorthe to recreate her selfe with two Ladyes towards a fountaine somewhat out of the waye, whereas the Empres &amp; her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes were set downe. And for that the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> did vnderstand, (whether by her owne imagination, or that <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> had aduised her) that in such place commonly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fall out some aduentures, she commaunded to giue vnto her, her armour, which she caused to be brought vnto that house: and whilest she was arming, came the Moore <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldoro,</hi> thether: who séeing so faire a company, had a great desire to knowe who they were, and comming vnto a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell which was thereby, speaking with great courtesie, hée sayd. Damosell let me obtaine. I pray you, so much fauour at your hands, that you will tell me who they be that are in this faire company. This damsell séeing that with so great curtesie and good manners he did request her, and being a knight of so good disposition, she said. Sir knight, they be the Empresse of <hi>Grecia</hi> and her Ladies, which are come to this place to recreate themselues: and haue brought hether for their sauegard these well proportioned knights. When the Moore vnderstood that there was the Empresse of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> there entred straight way many things in his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many thoughts troubled his minde, till such time, as he dermined to doo that, which I will tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:159"/>So with a determined purpose he came vnto the place wher as the Empresse was: and without saying any worde, hée tooke her vy the arme, and with great strength lifte her vp, till he had her on his saddle bowe before him, and tourning his horse about he tooke his waye towards that place, from whence he came, with purpose to imbarke himselfe againe, in that shippe in which he came thether, and so to carrie her away: but the noyse and shrikes of the Ladyes and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosells were so pitifull and lowde, that there came vnto them the knights that were dispersed abroad in the forrest and other places. And when they came, and saw all that had passed, they altogether followed the Moore, so fast as theyr horse could runne: and in a short time they came for to take away his bootie, so that whether he would or not, he was driuen to let her goe, for to defende himselfe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blowes which the knights layd on him, who on the one side and on the other, began to strike fiercely at him: but he made no more reckoning of them, then the huge and mightie Rocke doth of the troublesome waues of the seas, beating against it continually. Euen so were the blowes which the Gréeke knights stroke vpon the Pagan, who séeing himselfe hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his purpose, drew out his sword, and stroke one of those knights such a blowe vpon the shoulder, that he cut him downe to the girdle, so that he fell downe dead to the ground: and not content héerewith, but began so to bestur himselfe, that in a small time, he seperated them all, some slaine and some very sore hurt &amp; wounded. In this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ime, that these knights were in their battaile, the Empresse <hi>Claridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi> was armed, and set vpon a mightie strong horse, and came with great yre, and sayd. Oh infernall Pagan, what diuell was that, which made thée so bolde with those vyle &amp; wicked hands to come and take holde of the Empresse: and in saieng these words, she drew out her sworde, and stroke him such a blowe vpon the healme, that she made him boow his head vnto his breast: but straight wayes the Pagan came to himselfe, and firming his féete in his stirroppes hée made her aunswere, with a blowe no lesse furious then that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13973:159"/>
that he had receiued. So there began one of the best fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten battailes that euer was betwéene two Knights. The Empresse when she sawe her selfe cleare out of the handes of the Moore, got on the one side, and sate downe vpon the gréene hearbs and did beholde the battaile. All the Ladyes &amp; Damosells when they sawe her at libertie, ranne vnto the place whereas shée was, and in small time they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed her with a milde lamentation. At the same time out of the thickest of the Forrest came foorth a Knight verye well armed, with gréene armour, all to be spotted with Lyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes; and his shéelde of the same manner, but in the middest thereof was painted a hand, which séemed to be in a lake of water, holding in it a Lilly flower. And as he saw that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious battaile, he went vnto one of the Ladyes, and with a gracious courtesie he demaunded the occasion thereof. The effect thereof she tolde, and declared vnto him which was the knight that was in the Empresse defence. At this time the battaile was so kindeled, that with the furious blowes that were giuen, it had bene sufficient to haue cut a rocke in péeces. This strong Empresse was so wrathfull, that her battaile was more gouerned with yre then by pollicie, and with the great choller that she had, she stroke the Pagan so terrible a blow, that he fell downe vpon his horse necke, without any remembraunce, and with the sound of that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blow the horse was somwhat scarred, in such sort, that he carried his master a while about the fielde. The Empres following him with her light horse, thinking that she hadde made an ende of the battaile, when that in the middest of her course, the Moore came to himselfe againe, and with madnesse, he fomed at the mouth, and beginning to vse his accustomed cursings against <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And recouering his sword, taking it fast in both his hands, he went towards the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> threatening her with a furious blowe.</p>
               <p>The Empresse who sawe the blowe comming, shée lyfte vp her shéelde to receiue it therewith, the blowe fell so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:13973:160"/>
thereon, that it parted it in two péeces, and lighted on her healm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in such great force and furie, that it made her to fall backwards vpon the crouper of her horse without anie féeling, voyding much bloud out of her visour, with which blowe the horse was scarred, and ranne rounde about the fielde, the which when the Pagan saw, he followed after the Empresse, as the hauke, when you haue taken of her hood, discouering the Heron, with great fury flieth at her: euen so went this Moore saying. Now will I sée Empresse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the strength of this knight be sufficient for to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, that I carry thée not into a place, where <hi>Mahomet</hi> shall not be able to deliuer thée, nor take thée out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Then the gentle Knight of the Lillyes, did put himselfe before the Empresse, and sayd. Stande thou proud Pagan, for first before thou dost that which thou thinkest to doo, it standeth thée in hand to looke to thy selfe, and in saying these words, he drew out his sword, and stroke him such an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart blowe vppon the visour of his healme, that he was ready to fall downe on the other side, and with the strength thereof, it depriued him of his sight, and after that hée stroke another blowe on the other side, that the Moore was not able to make any defence, but that he fell downe vpon his horse head. The Moore being kindeled with great madnesse, to sée two such mightie blowes giuen him, and he not able to make any defence. when he was come to himselfe, he went against his aduersary with his sword fast in both his hands, who was in the same sort tarrying for him: &amp; they strake both together such terrible blowes, that both of them were constrayned to imbrace their horse neckes for not falling: but setteling themselues again, they recouered their swords, and pressed the one against the other, as commonlye the wilde Bulls doo in their fight, with the lyke yre these two ioyned together, making one of the most perillous battells in the world, striking one another whereas they might doo most harme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:13973:160"/>It was so much without pittie, and with so furious wrath, as though it had bene two Lyons, and giuing such notable blowes, and battering of the copper and yron with such great noyse, that it did not onely glowe in the eares of those Ladies and the rest that were looking on, but the mountaines thereabout were moued with compassion and pitie, to sée their great crueltie one toward another. At this time the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> was come to her selfe, and when she remembred the great peril in the which she was, she called vnto God for his helpe, and tourning about her light horse with so great swiftnesse, that wheresoeuer he did put his foote, there was no signe séene, she came vnto the place whereas the battaile was. The Knight with the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Lyllyes with a high voyce sayde.

               <p>Then the Empresse and all her Ladyes did call her and sayd.

At this present time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched the two lights of all knighthood, the Emperour of <hi>Grecia</hi> and his sonne, and with them the Giaunt and the rest of the Princes that came with them. You shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande that these were the two knights, that in the high waye they founde in cruell battaile, and meruailing verye much at the power that was in the two warriours, they stayed to behold them, not knowing who they were. The Knight of the Sunne who had his eyes more fixed on them then the rest, did knowe the Pagan, as one which had first proued his furious force, &amp; turning vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he told him all that which had hapned vnto him in the fierce battaile which he hadde fought before with him in <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they estéemed much the knight with the Lilies, to sée how well and how valiauntly he did behaue himselfe, not onely in this subtill defence, which against his aduersarie he made, but also his pollicie he made in offending his enimie.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13973:161"/>
So the knight of the Sunne with the greate desire that hée had to reuenge himselfe on the Pagan, mooued his horse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him. At which time there came forth of the village a Knight with white armour, all full of Garlands of golde, made by subtill art. Likewise his shéelde was white, and there was painted on it an Emperiall head, which shewed as though it had béene cut off with a cruell knife, the throat all so bée rayed with bloud, verie artificially wrought, and when hée sawe the battaile, hée put himselfe to behold them, at such time as the valyaunt Gréeke approched vnto the two knightes that were in battaile for to speake vnto them, and hée sayd: Worthie knight with the Lyllyes, for curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies sake (if this battayle be of small importaunce) that thou wouldest let me alone with this Pagan, for that I haue a iust quarrell against him. This excellent Ladie looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the knight of the Sunne as one which had neuer séene him, meruailing much at his fayre disposition, and replyed, saying: I woulde be verie gladde sir Knight, for your great curtesie and gentle demeanour, to leaue to you the battaile, if the occasion were not of so greate waight. Therefore I dooe desire you that you would stand aside, for if my successe fall out vnfortunatly, there will time inough remaine, for to execute your anger. The Moore did well vnderstand the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde of the Knight of the Sunne, and knewe him verye well to bée the same that gaue him the order of Knighthood, and when hée sawe him, hée roared lyke a furious Lyon, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Oh vile and base Knight, to whome <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath giuen more power and strength then hée hath himselfe, come, come, and bring with thée in companie all these that bée there with thée, for of all you together I dooe estéeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, and in saying these wordes, hée pressed vnto the Knight of the Sunne, verie fiercely and with greate courage the knight of the Sunne met him in the waye, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before the Quéene, but this excellent Ladie with great lightnesse returned and did recouer her standing, and said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>

                  </gap>ed againe by the lefte side to put himselfe before her, and gaue the Pagan so terrible a blowe, that he made all his bodye to shake. The knight with the Lillyes did put himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine before and sayde. In an euill houre doest thou vse this greate vncurtesie with one that thou doest not knowe. The fearce Pagan in all this time was not idle, but at such time as the Quéene did crosse the waye for to take her roome, the Pagan stroke her so stronglye, that it lacked but a little, that shée fell not from her horse to the ground. The knight with the Emperiall head when he sawe that, set his spurres to his horse, and sayd.</p>
               <p>O men of small estimation, come hether to mée one of you, and dooe not occupie your selues in such controuersies. And with saying these and such lyke wordes, hée stroke the Quéene such a blowe, that he made her téeth to chatter in her head, in such sorte, that shée had almost lost her féeling, but hée had no cause to boast himselfe verie much of that blowe, for that quickly she retourned his salutation with so great strength, that shée gaue him well to vnderstand her cauragious force. Nowe there beganne a rigorous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, and the Knight of the Sun remained alone with the Pagan: Oh wise and warrelyke <hi>Eliza,</hi> giue mée to drinke of that water which the nine sisters did discouer, that by the helpe of that swéet liquor I may make sharpe my rude tongue, so that mixing the spéech of <hi>Mercurie</hi> with the prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse of <hi>Mars,</hi> I maye vnfolde this furious battayle which these foure knightes made, who with excéeding and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull blowes stroke one another, without anie casing, that they made them whether they woulde or no, to incline their bodyes to theyr horse head, without anie féeling. In this sorte continued these valyaunt and warlyke knightes a good space, till such time as the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> came in great hast, running with her light horse, and making a great noise, without anie consideration, but onely to bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And without anie more speaking shée put her selfe before the knight of the Sunne, and beganne to laye on the Pagan with her furious blowes. The Pagan was nothing abashed at that, but as one which had strength and courage inough, he receiued them. Then the knight of the Sunne with greate anger sayde. Tell mée knight what is the cause which hath mooued thée to offer such lyke villanie. This womanly warriour retourned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and straight waye shée did knowe him to bée the Knight of the Sunne. Héere all you true louers may iudge the greate ioye that shée receiued when shée beheld before her, him who with so great loue she loued, and the greate desire she had to heare of him. So shée replyed with verie amorous wordes, and sayde.</p>
               <p>My déere and welbeloued Lord, séeing that fortune hath brought you hether at this instaunt, procure ioyntly with your reuengement to work mine against this Pagan. Then the knight of the Sunne did knowe that it was his Ladie, wherewith his strength increased, and also his anger, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the Pagan had vsed discurtesie agaynst her, and sayd: How is this thou false Pagan, that thou hast ben so hardie, for to anger and disquiet such a Ladie: Tarry, for héere I wil giue thée thy reward according vnto thy deserts. And with a new strength and valiant courage he pressed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. This pagan was amazed in séeing his enimy to shew more strength and better courage, which continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more and more, yet for all that hée shewed no kinde of faintnesse, but rather he stroke at him such terrible blowes and with so greate strength, as at anie time before hée had not done the lyke. At this time the Emperour, (which tyll that time did beholde all that had passed, and suffered not himselfe to be knowen vnto anie, by reason that he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had his healme on his head) pulled off the same, that the more better to his contentment he might sée and beholde this furious battayle. Then the people of the Uillage

Oh happie is this daye, in the which wée haue séene the excellent face of our renowmed Emperour, &amp; therewith altogether they ran to him for to kisse his hands, and he which could first come vnto him, he thought himselfe most happiest. For he was the best be loued Prince amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest his subiects in all the world. Many of them with great hast went to tell the Empresse, for to get a rewarde.

So with like furie this valiaunt Pagan past thorough amongest the people that were there, so that some he threwe downe from their horse, and others he lefte very sore hurt, and with this perillous assault he put himselfe into the thicke woods. The Quéene which was fighting with the knight of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall head, did sée very well, how that the the Moore was es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, and with the great anger which she had to sée him runne away without taking reuengement of him, she gaue so terrible a blowe vnto her aduersarie that it made him to ioyne his head with his breast, and lefte him without any remembraunce, and without any more tarrying, shée went
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13973:163"/>
and followed the Pagan. The knight of the Sunne, who at this time was come to himselfe, and had fully recouered his remembraunce, and could not sée his enimie, he demaunded for him. And there it was tolde him of his desperate run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away. The Prince would haue followed him, if the Emperour had not letted him. Likewise the Knight with the Emperiall heade came againe vnto himselfe, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haue made payment of that blow vnto his aduersary, he looked round about and could not sée her, and beholding all the rest which were in that company, he sawe that they were all well content and very ioyfull, and full of pleasure, wherefore without any more tarrying he put himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the forrest, leauing the Emperour and all the rest, verye desirous to know who he was, as also of the knight of the Lillyes: the which was straight waye tolde him by a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell of the Quéenes, at the which they all remained much amazed, iudging it to be one of the most notablest things, that was in all the world. The Empresse when she vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the good newes, straight waye went forth for to sée the Emperour, with so much ioye and pleasure, that she scantlye knew where she was: &amp; when she came to cast her armes for to imbrace him she sayde. My Lorde, I doe not compare this imbracing vnto that, which an vncurteous Knight did giue me not long since.

So there they declared vnto the Emperor of the departing of <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:164"/>There was no lesse ioye betwéene the Knight of the Sunne and his spouse, for the one receiued the other with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing. For by reason of the water that he dronke at the fountaine, he had cleane forgotten and lost the loue he had to <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> which was the occasion of a double delight with his welbeloued Lady. This faire Empresse somewhat dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muling the sorrow which she had for the losse of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, declared it vnto her déere beloued spouse, who with no lesse discretion, did giue her the hearing, not suffering her to knowe the griefe that he receiued, but rather comforted her, and gaue her to vnderstande by outwarde showes, that hée was very well content of all that had happened, which was vnto her great and perticular ioye and pleasure. So in this order they went talking together, till they came vnto the village, whereas they were receiued of all the people, with great ioye and reioycings, and with sundry pastimes, and there they dined: and in this sort they passed the rest of the daye.</p>
               <p>The next daye in the morning they went towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> ane there was not one who sawe the Emperor and his company but receiued great pleasure. But <hi>Sindera</hi> the Dutchesse, and Aunt vnto <hi>Archisilora,</hi> was greatly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for hir absence. As they trauailed by the way, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight of the Sunne determined to giue the Emperour to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande of all the loue that had passed betwéene him and the Empresse <hi>Claridiana.</hi> So the Emperour when he vnderstood it, was nothing sorrie for that which had past, but rather did determine to sende and call for the subiects and vassalles of the Empresse, and so in publike to marrie them together: yet at that time he did not giue him to vnderstande of the losse of the two children,</p>
               <p>So with this and like communication, they came vnto the Citie, whereas they were receiued, as vnto their estate appertayned. And at their entering into the Pallaice, there came forth to receiue them, the Princesse <hi>Tigliasa,</hi> and the faire <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who for the discontentment which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the absence of their Knights, would not goe forth of

                  <hi>Constantinople.</hi> What shall I saye to you of the <hi>Tartarian Zoylo,</hi> he was so out of quiet and troubled to sée the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, that he was almost beside himselfe, and chaunged his coulour, and lyke a man without vnderstanding hée came downe from the Pallayce, making a great noyse: and with out taking any rest, he went out of the Citie, and with great fury he put himselfe into the woods and wildernesse of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> leauing the sorrowfull Lady with so much care, that if the wise <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> had not comforted her, she thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely to haue dyed at that present time, by whose counsell she was willed to goe and séeke him, and to carrie in companye with her two of her damosells: and he promised her so to remedie her sorrow, that she should be fully satisfied. The which did fall out cleane contrary: for that the knowledge of man doth little auaile to hinder the will of the Creator of all things. As héereafter shall be tolde you in the third part of this historie.</p>
               <p>Now to retourne vnto the great pleasure which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the Emperour receiued for his comming: it was in such sort, that they did no other thing but make feastes and pastimes. In the meane time whilest they were making all these pastimes in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they sent to call the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes and vassalles of the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who came straight waye without anye delaye: and they which came, were the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the King <hi>Simonia,</hi> and the great Duke of <hi>Alafonte.</hi> Unto whome was declared the whole occasion wherefore they were called. And when they knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shuld obtayne for their Lord so royal a prince, they were meruailously well contented and receiued greate pleasure: and without any more tarrying they made them sure together, whereat was made great feasts and pastimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there he was sworne Emperour, and they desired them, that they would goe &amp; acknowledge their lands &amp; countries, and gaue them to vnderstande, that the long absence of the Empresse was the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many dissentions, wherein some rebellious people did begin to shew their cankered thoughts.

To the which they graunted with a verie good will, and they carryed with them <hi>Tefereo</hi> and his vnckle. What shall I héere declare vnto you of the honorable receiuings and great pastimes and sportes which were made vnto them, it were too much héere to write, so the possession of all the Empire was giuen vnto them, wheras they determined to take their rest, till such time as fortune caused the contrarie, whereas they reigned with the most highest fame that euer any other obtained.

to beholde the excellencie of the workmanship of the horne, and the great riches thereof, and taking of it in her hand, she sawe that round about it there were certaine letters, which béeing read, she found to be thus: <hi>In sounding of me the gate shall be opened to thee.</hi> The which when shee vnderstoode, without anie more carrieng, she tooke that rich horne and set it vnto her mouth, and began to sound it, the which sounde was verie thrill to be heard, she had scarce made an ende of blowing, when that the gate was open.

And while she perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in this her purpose, shée hearde a voyce which sayde: Wo bee vnto mee, wherfore doo you in this manner so greatly torment me, let not the coueting of this bough ouercome thée: let all this euill suffice thée which thou hast béen the occasion of to mée.

this second companie, then at the sight of the first, but the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and sorrowful words which the Empresse vttered did moue her to beare her companie, if that at that time shée had not séene come forth at a doore which was in the hall, a Ladie, séeming to bée of great authoritie, accompanyed with two faire Nymphs, all apparelled in russet Satten, pinked &amp; cut, and lined with gréene Satten, which coulours were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pleasant, and greatly delighted the sight. And when shée came nigh vnto the quéene she sayd: Knight, whosoeuer thou art, and doest shew thy selfe to be so furious, why doest thou hearken and giue eare vnto this lamentation: tell mée out of hande, without anie farther delaie who thou art, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou commest hether, for that thou shalt vnderstand that this place is prohibited to all knightes, except he first bring with him some signe or token of the braunch of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trée, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he who was murtherer to his owne daughter is inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if it hath ben thy fortune to atchieue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cutting either of the braunch of gold or siluer, shew it me forthwith, if not, vnderstand that thou shalt die a terrible death. This worthie Quéene who with a sober countenaunce gaue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eare vnto the sayings of the Ladie, and beholding much her great sobrietie: likewise the beautie of those which bare her companie, held vp the braunch of siluer in her hande, and with a high voyce she sayd: Ladie, I woulde not haue ben so bolde to haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched hether, except I had brought with me the token which you speake off: therefore I ought not to incurre the paine prouided, beholde is this it which you sée, and therwith shée shewed her braunch. The Ladie when she knew that to be the braunch of the trée that she spake of, did abate her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that she before had, and shewed a merrie countenaunce, and taking her right hand from the shoulder of the Nymph, she laide holde on the armed hand of the quéene, and holding it verie fast, she sayd: Excellent Ladie, many dayes past I was giuen to vnderstand of thy great worthinesse, and that thou shouldest giue some contentment vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afflicted hearts, wherefore come with me and I will shew thée my habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that vnto thée the sight hath bene graunted, and not

vnto anie other: come on Ladie and reioyce the selfe in the sight of that which héereafter shall come to passe, without all doubt. And in saying these wordes she carried her in at the same doore whereas shée came forth in great hast, for that shée did knowe the tendernesse of her heart which was moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the lamentation shée heard, and there shewed vnto her greate riches and verie faire buildinges, but especiallye shée carryed her into a verie faire and foure square Court, which had at euerie corner foure pillers, and vpon the toppe of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them an Image, meruailously wrought, and euerie one of them had his title written what it did signifie, and shée tolde her that those which shée had shewed her, were kings and Princes, and famous Lordes, that were there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted. And how that all that should be made frustrate by one of the best knightes in all the world, who shall bring for his deuice blased on his shéelde, a braunch of golde, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieng the same which she sawe in the first Court, in the which was inchaunted the Emperour of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Likewise he shall deliuer the daughter of the sayd Emperour, whome hée supposeth he hath murthered, and shée was the fayrest Damosell in the whole world. And for that in the end of the third booke of this historie shall be declared the rest, where you shall receiue more contentment in the reading: <hi>Lyrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo</hi> will now goe no farther héerein. And telling vnto her these and many other thinges, they went farther, and passed through verie manie and fayre halls, the which were ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the stories of the notable actes of worthie knights, but in one hall, in the middest of a Cloth, shée sawe the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a knight of a greate stature, who was nine foote in height, and armed with Purple armour, and his shéelde of the same coulour, without hauing anie deuice, and his face was verie fayre. The Quéene coulde not by any meanes, but by sight thereof staie a while and beholde his greate beautie, and felt within her heart a new and strange wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of loue, which tourned afterwarde into an amorous fire. This Ladie did well perceiue her newe imaginations, and with a gracious smiling shée tooke her by the hande, and

carried her out of that Chamber, (although shée coulde not bring her out of her newe conceit) shée went out so troubled, that all which the Ladie shewed her afterwardes, shée little respected, and when she thought least shée found her selfe out of the Pallaice, betweene the déepe Moate, and the fayre and rich walles, euen as one that had béene newe awaked out of his sléepe, and tourning her selfe vnto the Ladie, dissembling her newe paine she sayde.

I doe not know wherefore these vnfortunate knights will occupy themselues in profering to defend that, which manye other would haue done, and yet were neuer able. Goe thy wayes, and tell them that they make no tarying to come and receiue their death. <hi>Brandimatdo,</hi> who well behelde theyr fierce disposition, sawe that it was no time to spend wordes in wast, but to put in practise the execution of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which they came for, and without any replying vnto their words, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto the place whereas he lefte the Prince, vnto whom he declared all that had past. So without any more a doe <hi>Rosicleer</hi> leaped vpon his mightie horse, and they lace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their comming thether was at such time as <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far</hi> and <hi>Mandroco</hi> came forth of the Pallaice, all ready and prepared for the battaile, and brought in their companye a great number of Knights. At that time the place was very full of people, who desired secretly in their hearts, that the straunge Knights might winne the victory, that they might be cleare and at libertie from that great subiection, in the which the Gyaunts helde them: the which they thought to be almost impossible, considering the great worthinesse and strength that was in the giants. And when they wer altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, <hi>Mandroco</hi> with a milde voice sayd: Miserable knights, at such time as you offred your perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quéene <hi>Archisilora,</hi> with whom did you thinke to haue battaile, that you gaue credite, supposing your selues to haue sufficient force to execute your wils. Wherfore if you doo now thinke your selues deceiued, we shall be héere content to set you
<pb facs="tcp:13973:172"/>
at libertie of your former promise, with condition that you shall goe and tell her, that she ought to send Knghts of great prowesse and strength, and not such as you are. Then <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> sayd, Thou art very much deceiued Giant, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou saist, for we did very well knowe with whome we shoulde haue battayle, and were fully informed thereof, and purpose to take the head from thy body, in satisfaction of these trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which thou dost vse. The anger and yre of the Giant was such, that without any more tarrying, with great fury he turned about his horse, and his father did the like, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Knights also did the same. And when they were right the one against the other, at the sound of sundry instruments of warres, they ranne the one against the other, in such sorte, that not one of them missed his blowe, but made the shiuers of the speares to flye in very small péeces in the aire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiuing any griefe. So they altogether returned with their swords in their handes. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> encountered with <hi>Bulfar,</hi> for that he found him next at hand, and pressing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he stroke at him very great and heauie blowes, and the Gyant rendered him the like. With no lesse furie pressed <hi>Brandimardo</hi> against his enimie, making a very furious &amp; well foughten battaile. At this time, the fierce <hi>Bulfar</hi> séeing the great resistance of his aduersarie, threw his shéeld at his backe, and his sonne <hi>Mandroco</hi> did the like, &amp; both together they stroke such blowes at the knights, that without féeling it caused the horse of <hi>Rosicleer</hi> to giue a tourne in the place, and the like happened vnto <hi>Brandimardo</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Héere his vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fortune would, that his horse should carrie him thether, whereas <hi>Bulfar</hi> was, who assailed him at his ease on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one side, and stroke at him with both his hands such an vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull blowe, that lighting vpon his helme, which was néere hand as hard as a Diamond he cut it ioyntly with his head, and being very sore hurt this vnhappie Knight fell downe to the ground, at such time as the Prince was setling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon his horse, &amp; séeing <hi>Brandimardo</hi> downe, &amp; so much bloud running from his head, he did verely beléeue that hée was dead. Wherewith his rage was so much, that the fire
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13973:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
came forth at his visor, and setting spurres to his mightye horse, he made him to mooue like the winde, and said with a loude voyce.</p>
               <p>O vile beastes, that so villanously haue slaine him, who is more worth then both of you. Héere I doo sweare vnto you by the liuing God to force my power in such sort, that onely w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> two blowes I will send you vnto hell, which is your habitation, &amp; therwith he came vnto <hi>Mandroco,</hi> who likewise came towards him, &amp; stroke him such a blow vpon the helme, that the strength thereof little profited him, for by the fury of his arme he parted it in two péeces together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the head, so that the Giant fell down dead to the ground, &amp; by reason of his great wayght, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fall séemed almost to shake the earth. The Gyant <hi>Bulfar</hi> when he sawe his sonne dead, with so desperate a blow, roaring out against his Gods, he lifte by his sword to strike the Prince: but he, who had as much pollicie as prowes, spurred his horse a litle forwards, &amp; with a furious leape he cleared himselfe from that blow, and finding himselfe on the lefte side of <hi>Bulfar,</hi> he threw at him so terrible a foyne, that his harnesse deceiued him, and his sword entered into his body vp to the hilts, and at the pulling of his sword out, he drew out therewith his infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall soule, and he fell downe dead to the grounde. Then when the people sawe the good successe that their desires had, they began to crye out with mightie voyces, saying: Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, Libertie, and ranne vnto the Prince, some kissing his handes, some his skirtes of Maile, and some his féete, in such sorte they pressed on him that he coulde scantly stirre himselfe, but by reason of the greate griefe and sorrowe which he had for his friend <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> who coulde not receiue anie pleasure at all in this high and mightie victory: and without any care thereof, he alighted from his horse, and went vnto him, and tooke off his healme, and lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:173"/>Then this weake knight somewhat lifting vp his eyes, and séeing himselfe in the armes of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and vnderstanding that the battaile was finished, to the honour of his Lady and mistresse, with a féeble &amp; fainting voice he sayd: Ah my Lord, and perfect friend, héere may you sée how contrarie fortune hath bene vnto me, in that she woulde not consent that I shuld reioyce in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> triumph of this victorie: it doth not gréeue me to die, for that it is in defending the right of her whom I best loued. There is nothing that doth gréeue me so much, as that I cannot obtaine the reward I looked for. Héere I do desire thee my Lord, that by you she may vnderstand of all this my paine: and doe my heartie commendations vnto that my great desired <hi>Archi.</hi> Héere he could not make an ende to speake her name, but yéelded vp the Ghoast, his vnfortunate bodie remaining in the armes of the Prince, and with great wéeping he turned vnto the people that were there, and sayd. O you knights and Gentlemen of <hi>Lyra,</hi> how déerely is this your libertie bought, for in the recouerie thereof was slaine the best knight in all <hi>Asia.</hi> Then he séeing that there was no remedie for the harme that was done, he commaunded that hée should be carryed vnto the pallaice, and by the agréement of all the nobles he was buried in that place whereas the kings of <hi>Lyra</hi> were accustomed to be buried. So when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> had séene the funerall of his friend, he would staie no longer in that kingdome, but by the consent of all that were present, he left the gouernement in the power of a worthie knight and noble gentleman of the realme, and tooke his oth that straight waie they should surrender it to their quéene &amp; Ladie. And therewith he departed out of the Citie, &amp; when he came vnto the water side, and woulde haue entered into the ship in the which he came, he sawe nigh vnto it the barks wherein he was wont to trauaile, and considering y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it should not be there without occasion, without anie more deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he entered into the same, who straight waie beganne to moue her selfe with her accustomed furie, and so without tarrying in anie place, he trauailed sixe dayes &amp; sixe nightes, in the end of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the Barke brought her selfe a ground
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13973:173"/>
into a faire wide and sandie Baie, whereas he sawe vppon the shoare manie knightes which made battaile against one alone knight. The Prince seeing all that passed, with great anger he went out of the Barke to helpe him, who with great courage and pollicie did defend himselfe, whereas now we will leaue them, and retourne vnto <hi>Grecia</hi> for to make an ende of our first part. You doe well remember how that the knight with the Emperiall head, when he sawe himselfe cleere of that blow which the Queene of <hi>Lyra</hi> gaue him, put himselfe into the forrest, euen vnto the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he thought that it was time, he went vnto the Court and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for the Emperours pallace, when he came thether, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted from his horse and went vp into the great hall wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Emperour was, with all them of his Court, exercising courtly pastimes and pleasures, and without making anye reuerence hee went vnto the place whereas the Emperour was, and he sayd: Good and noble Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi> this speake I for a truth (according vnto that which I haue heard reported of thée) that thou art one of those Princes that doth maintaine all iustice and equitie. The subiects and vassalls doe not alone make this report, but all the world is ful of it. And (as I vnderstand) although it be euen against thy owne person, yet thou wilt not let to doe that which is right, iustice being demaunded of thée, wherfore I doubt not but vnto me shall be graunted lisence héere in thy Countrie to put a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vnto whom it shall thinke me best, certifieng thée that it shall be a iust thing. The Emperour who knew him by the deuice that he had on his shéeld, that it was he which made the battaile with the Quéene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> with a sober countenaunce he sayd: Knight, although my fame be not such as you haue héere published, yet demanding any of this with equitie (as you doe certifie me you will) I cannot but graunt it vnto thée. And therefore héere I doe giue thée lisence that thou maist propone all that thy pleasure is, although it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:13973:174"/>
my selfe. The Knight who was very attendaunt to all that the Emperour sayd, and saw that license was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to aske at his pleasure, he sayd. O mightie Prince I would to God that my demaund were not that which it is, that without it I might inioye and comfort my selfe in beeing in your company, and the more that I doo certifie my selfe of thy vertue, I doo finde my selfe the more troubled, meruailing, how that in so noble a person, should remaine so great naughtinesse, as that which thou didst vse with the Quéene of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> who comforting &amp; refreshing thée, when thou arriuedst there in great pouertie and distresse, in the ende, thou didst leaue her very sorrowfull and made a mock of her. Looke well vnto it Emperour, for that thou canst not make satisfaction for so great a fault, neyther will shée take any of thée, except it be with sending thy head, I will not that thou makest any amends, but that for her, I doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thée to mortall battaile, onely thy person and mine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I may fulfill the promise that I haue made vnto her: and if it so fall out that Fortune be to me contrary, I will remaine for the payment of my fullye, with my heade out from my shoulders. And with this he helde his peace: and looking on the one side and on the other, very ioyfull to sée so goodly a company of Knights as was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time with the Emperour, he expected his aunswere. The Emperour who well vnderstoode his reasons, without showing any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in his countenaunce, aunswered. I doo not knowe whether my aunswere shall be sufficient for to excuse the fault, which the Queene without all reason doth burden me with. For the which, valiant Knight, I wold, as the Quéene hath tolde you the little reason that I had, so she shuld haue tolde you the great reason I had to doo that which I did. Héere I doo certefie thée that my thought doth not deserue, that she should be vnto me so cruell, nor extend so farre, for to desire my death. And certainly in this, the Quéene hath no reason, for that the head of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> maye doo her more seruice liuing, then it can doo being dead: but séeing it is her will. Héere I doo tell thée, that so long as I doo liue, I will
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13973:174"/>
practise no other thing but onely to pacifie her, and so lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise will I procure to keepe and defende my head, and not onely mine owne, but also the heads of those which at her commaundement doo come, thinking to take away mine: &amp; in this she shal vnderstand how much I am desirous to serue her. The battaile heere I doe graunt it vnto thee, and if thou wilt, let it be out of hand, and heere I doe promise thee Knight to procure to ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pe my head, and likewise to keepe thine. Oh how the Moore found himselfe troubled, when hee heard the Emperours answere, and the little reckoning that he made of the battaile, and somewhat touched in pride, hee replyed and sayd. I know well Emperour, that the greate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence which thou hast in thy self, maketh thee to esteeme little of the King of the <hi>Garamantes</hi> whom thou hast in thy presence: but I doe hope and trust in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that before one hower when we are in the field, to make thee to lose thy confidence. And in saying these words, he went downe out of the Pallaice, and leapt vp vpon his horse, and went into the fielde, which was right agaynst the Pallaice, ordayned for such like occasions. The Emperour demaunded for his armour, and called for that with the starres, the same which the Queene <hi>Garrofilea</hi> gaue him. So in a trice he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not without many teares of the Empresse, who sayd. Ah my Lord I do well vnderstand, that of so long absence, there can grow nothing but great troubles, as doth appeare by this sodaine battaile. The Emperor not letting her to go forwards with her talke, but casting both his armes about her necke, and with shewe of great loue, he sayd. Thou my Lady and Empresse wert the occasion of all that euill, for if it had not bene onely for the losse of thy sight, I vowe that thy Emperour would first haue dyed the death, then meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the name to be disloyall. And that in not fulfilling her intent, there should not onelye haue happened one euill, but a great number. So it was Gods will that I shuld escape out of the battaile, as more at large I will tell you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more leasure. And in this manner hée departed from the Empresse, leauing her verie sadde and sorrowfull.
<pb facs="tcp:13973:175"/>
And the Emperour went to take his horse, carrying with him the king of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> who carryed his healme, and the Prince <hi>Claueryndo</hi> who carryed his shéeld, &amp; his speare the Prince of <hi>Hungaria</hi> carryed. And when they went forth of the gates of the Pallaice, they beganne to sound a greate number of instruments, which indured till such time as they were entered into the field, whereas he put on his healme, and the rest of his armour giuen him which those Princes did carrie. So with a gallant demeanour he put himselfe on the one part of the field, awaiting a token or signe that shuld be giuen them. So it was not long after that the Prince <hi>Bargandel</hi> did sound a Clarion the which he had in his hand, at the sound whereof they ranne one against another with great furie, and in the middest of their course they gaue such incounters with their Speares, not missing of their blowes, but it was with so great force that they brake all to small p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Moore when he sawe that the Emperour remained in his saddle, hée was ashamed, for that he did beléeue that onely with one blowe with his Speare to make an end of all that worke, his force and strength was such: And as you doo see a fierce Ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Moore had well thought that the Emperour had bene dead, and stoode still and sayd. Well, I doe beleeue Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour that thy promise shall be in vaine, and mine shall fal out true. At that time the Pagan spoke the truth, for that

Most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Lord, the great contentment that I do receiue at the sight of this young man, hath caused me to forget to bee in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and I did occupie my senses in such sort, that I coulde not doe that which I am bound by duetie to do. O king thou maist account thy selfe for happie, for that thou hast obtained so much fauour, as to bring vp so gentle a youth, worthie to be had in as much reuerence as the mightie <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the king he sayd: There commeth a messenger fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Heere my Lorde, I doe certifie thee, that it had bene the more to haue bene feared, if thou haddest found thy selfe without this young man in thy companie, who is the flower of all men. The king when he heard these newes could not but receiue some alteration, and it was in such sort, that he was constrained to sit downe to talke with <hi>Galte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and sayd: I sweare by God my friend, séeing it is so, let your discreation remedie that, which mine is not able to comprehend, that wee fall not into the power of so cruell an enimie. <hi>Claridiano</hi> who was verie attentiue vnto that which <hi>Galtenor</hi> had tolde vnto the king, and lykewise vnto the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king made, kneeled downe on both his knées, and with greate humilitie hée desired the king to graunt him two things, the which he wold aske, the which the king by the counsell of <hi>Galtenor</hi> did graunt, and did lift him vp from the grounde imbrasing him verie louingly.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13973:177"/>
and the second is, that you doo giue me license to answere the messenger of <hi>Arginaria.</hi> It grieued the King very much, for that he had graunted him these two things, for that he did well vnderstand his intent: but séeing that he could doo no otherwise, he was content. Great pleasure receiued <hi>Galte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> to sée with what good grace, <hi>Claridiano</hi> did aske these two things of the king, and for to put away part of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment which they shoulde receiue at the messengers hand, he tolde vnto them some pleasaunt and ioyfull deuices. So straight way it was accorded, that <hi>Claridiano</hi> shoulde that night watch his armour, the which was giuen him by <hi>Galtenor.</hi> They were all white, and bespangled with twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling starres of golde, and his shield was also all white, and in it one onely <hi>Luzero,</hi> which did occupie all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole shield, all garnished with fine pearles, that it made them that did looke on it, almost to lose their sight, the brightnesse was so great that procéeded from them, and they were such, that no Lorde in all the worlde had the like. When this famous youth was armed with them, the delight was so much, that the king <hi>Delfo</hi> receiued to sée him so well set and so gallant, that he could not refrayne but distill some salt teares from his eyes for very ioye, and sayd. My brother héere I doo desire the soueraigne Gods, that they make me so ioyful with thy good fortune, as I am now at thy sight. The prince did watch his armour that night, and the next daye with great solemnitie, he was armed Knight, and gaue that daye many and great gifts. In the afternoone was ordained great Iustings and daunces of all sorts, of very faire Ladyes and damosells, which the King had commaunded to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the same effect. But they who did most participate of all these pleasures and pastimes, was the heroycal young man, and his nourse, whom he tooke to be his mother. So that in the Kings Pallaice, there was no other thing but feasts and pastimes, tarrying for the Embassadour that shuld come: and they of the Citie had care in the fortifieng of the same, as well with victualls, as repayring the wals, and putting all the people in good order, in such sorte, that
<pb facs="tcp:13973:178"/>
within eight dayes they found within the Citie tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Knights, meruailously well appointed, at the which <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano</hi> did receiue greate contentment. The ninth daie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hée was made knight, there was brought newes how that the messenger of <hi>Arginaria</hi> was come a lande: of the which the king béeing aduertised, hée sate himselfe in his royall seate abiding his comming, beeing accompanied with verie rich and well estéemed knightes, and on his ryght hand was <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and on his lefte hande the banished King of <hi>Arginaria,</hi> and béeing all in this manner as hath béene tolde you, the Embassadour <hi>Bruno</hi> entered into the hall, with a furious countenaunce, and without humbling or making anie kinde of reuerence, he drew nigh vnto the king, and with a wrathfull voyce he sayde: King, what diuell was that which put it in thy head, to denie that tribute that thou wert wont to giue vnto my mightie brother, and thou doest not onely denie it, but I sée that thou makest thy selfe in a readinesse to make resistaunce, for the which héere I doe tell thée, that there is no punishment that can make satisfaction of thy boldnes and follie, notwithstanding if thou wilt cléere thy selfe better then thy ouermuch pride doeth deserue, giue mée straight waye double tribute, of that which thou art bounde to paie, but if thou doest it not, by the mightie Gods I sweare to thée, that he will take of thée and thine reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with such rigor, that the mightie Gods shall tremble when they sée it. All this he spake with so greate pride and wrath, that it made them all to quake to sée his furious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, saue onely he to whome all the honour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode belonged, who did little estéeme his vnreasonable and proude wordes, but with greate sobrietie he aunswered. They dooe not denie anie thing which they ought for to giue vnto this tyraunt whome thou doest name for thy Brother, and although he did loose the Ilande that he doeth nowe pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, yet shoulde hée loose nothing that hath bene his, for that with tyrannie hée hath vsurped the same. Therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie more tarrying, get thée hence and tell thy brother, that the king of <hi>Trapobana</hi> wil not onely detaine from him
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13973:178"/>
the tribute which hée doth not nor neuer did owe him, but also with armed arme he doth pretend to recouer againe all that which without reason he hath receiued &amp; carried awaie, and he doth giue him to vnderstand, that hée will not rest till such time as he doth thrust him out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iland, which with so great tyrannie he doth possesse, &amp; from which he depriued my father <hi>Galtenor.</hi> So w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this answere thou maist returne vnto him who sent thée hether, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out anie hope of other. The giant stood &amp; did behold him very much, &amp; with a fearful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance his eies turned into a sanguin coulour, &amp; laughing or smiling in manner of mocking, he said: I sée without anie outward proofe, but onely by thy foolish wordes, that thou art but a young and new made knight, &amp; as such a one I wil est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>éeme &amp; intreate thée: &amp; if my comming hether were not more for a messenger, then for a warriour, for this thy boldnesse which thou dost shew, I would vse thée in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere shuld little auaile thée, &amp; yet I should remaine satisfied of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anger which thou hast caused me to haue. The prince <hi>Claridiano</hi> when he heard that with so great disdaine he was rauiled, with as much anger he went towards him, and with an altered voice he sayd: By all the Gods that are in heauen I sweare vnto thée, if I did not consider &amp; respect the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie which is due and ought to be shewed to Embassadours, I would bereaue thée of this thy brauerie, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when thou art before such a king as now thou art, thou shouldest bridle thy tongue, &amp; euer after haue in remembraunce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I would giue thée, but not respecting thy follie, but onely my estate, I will stay my selfe from correcting of this thy ouermuch pride.

The Prince when hée sawe this, stayed without doing anie more harme, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée would not disgrace the king, but put himself on the one side: the king did shew himselfe verie much gréeued for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, for if it had not ben done by him which did it, who so euer els should haue done it, would hardly haue escaped w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

with the great paine he felt, vnderstood all that was spoken, and without making anie aunswere, hee went out of the kings Pallaice, and returned vnto his Galleyes where hée was cured, and put his Sailes into the power of the winde, and in a verie short time he ariued at <hi>Arginaria,</hi> and went a shoare, carrying all his face wrapt and bound with bondes and rowles of linnen cloth, and his mouth all to be plaistred. In this sorte he went and presented himselfe before his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and sayd: I haue giuen thy Embassage vnto king <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo,</hi> as thou hast commaunded me, and to giue me aunswere there arose vp a new and young knight, whom I doe beleeue and as I haue proued the same, that he hath in his bodie all the infernall strength, and in his fistes all the Legyons of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells that are in hell, as it did appeare by the greate furye wherewith he hurt mée, that he did not onely strike out my téeth, but also threw me to the ground as though I had bene a child.

And not content with this, but with the same fury he tooke a great club, and what on the right side, and what on the lefte, he threw downe all the Images of his Gods that were there, and broke them all to péeces. One of the ministers that alwayes did assist them in their sacrifices, sayd with a bolde courage. Wherefore do you so euill intreate and misuse your Gods. The Giaunt stroke him such a blow on the forhead with his fist, that hée broke it all to péeces and threwe him dead to the ground &amp; sayd. Get thée hence, and goe and make relation vnto <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and vnto the rest of the Gods, of this greate repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension that thou hast done me. And looking about, he sawe all the rest of the ministers halfe amazed, without speaking any word, vnto whom he went with great hast, and said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Uile villaines, what doe you tarry héere, why doe you not go after the figure of that God, whom you do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and honour, and laying on them with his club, he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sixe of them, and so he would haue done with all the rest if they had not runne away. Then one of the two Giants which were bretheren, came vnto the Kings tent, all armed with his strong armour, &amp; mounted vpon a great Elephant and said. Be in quiet my Lord, and abate this thy vnsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable anger, and I will bring vnto thée straight waye him, who hath bene the occasion of this thy disquietnesse and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And without tarrying for any aunswere, he tourned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his great and vnwieldie beast, and went that waye, whereas the Prince was: who when he sawe him so well proportioned and furnished, he had well thought that he had bene the King of <hi>Arginaria,</hi> as one which had neuer séene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of so mightie a stature, and there with he put down y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of his helme, &amp; tooke vnto him, a great &amp; knottie speare, purposing not to spend the time in words.

The Giaunt when he sawe him speake with so bolde a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, with a dissembling laughter sayd.

And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou shalt not haue any more time to speake such folly and foolishnesse, eyther retourne the way from whence thou camest, and repent thy selfe of this thou hast sayd, or els prepare thy selfe to mortal battaile. The Giant when he heard that vnsauorye answere which he gaue, he tooke vp his speare and put it on his shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which was made fast in the middest of the staffe Darte wise, and raised himselfe in his stirrops, and threw it at the Prince with so great fary, that by the force therof, he hoped to haue concluded that enterprise. But this new Knight sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the speare comming, he put his shield before him where on the sharpe poynt stroke, &amp; pearced it through, till it came to his fine and strong armour, whereas it lost his force: but with the strength wherewith it came, it bowed in such sort, that it brake in two péeces, without hurting the knight or once mouing him in the saddle. This valiaunt and stoute <hi>Greeke,</hi> when he saw that in that sort he would haue slaine him, he clasped fast his speare in his hande after the same

manner, and said. Tarrie and thou shalt sée, whether I can better throw a dart then thou? And therewith he threwe his great speare at the Giant, that without hauing anye power to defend himselfe from that blowe it pearced his shield, and bored through his armour, and not staieng there, the sharpe poynt passed through his body from the one side to the other taking from him that miserable s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At all that passed, was present the proud &amp; strong <hi>Geredeon,</hi> who with an infernall wrath threw fire from him, and in great hast called for his armor: at which time the other giant, brother vnto <hi>Belorophonte,</hi> no lesse irefull and furious, whose name was <hi>Bolifo,</hi> sayde with a great voyce. Mightie <hi>Geredeon,</hi> and Lorde, let me take this reuengement, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of right it appertaineth more vnto me, then vnto thée. And heere I dooe promise thée (or els the Gods shall be false in dooing iustice, and my strong arme without vertue) that I will take cruell reuengement of that diuell: and so without speaking moe wordes, he went towards the place wheras this new knight was, who without any feare with a great speare in his hand, did tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie his comming. This Giant who was blinded with his vnreasonable anger without any reasoning, he set spurs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Elephant, and likewise, the new knight set spurres to his horse, and met together in the middest of their course, so that neither of them lost his blowe: but the incounter was with so great force, that the Gyant did pearce through the shéeld of the Prince, without doing anie other harme, &amp; the speare shiuered all to péeces, but this warlike youth with his speare gaue vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant so strong an incounter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through his shéeld, &amp; made him to fall backwards vpon the crouper of his Elephant, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made the great beast to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with his legs, and falling downe he fell vpon one of the giants legs. The Prince when he saw him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extremitie, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not arise, he leapt from his horse w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great lightnes, &amp; did help him to take out his leg from vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Elephant: likewise he did helpe him to arise vpon his féete, and sayd. Doe not thinke Gyant, that thou shalt haue anye occasion
<pb facs="tcp:13973:183"/>
to praise thy selfe, in saying that by a disgrace I did subdue thee. Therefore now doe what thou canst doo, for to defend thy selfe. The Gyant without any consideration of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie showed him, clasped fast his broad sword, striking a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fearfull blow at the Prince, who by leaping on the one side, caused him to loose his blowe, &amp; stepping on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side, he gaue him such a stroke vpon the waste, that the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse broke, and his sword hid it selfe in the Giants flesh, and hurt him very sore, whereat ran out very much bloud.

This diuelish giant, when he saw him in that case, would haue stroke him another blowe: but at such time as he would haue discharged it, this inuincible Knight arose vp with so great wrath, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a thicke smoke came out of his visor, and without any more tarrying, he threw the péece of the shield that remained from him, and with a light leape he ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his enemie, and stroke him so horrible and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a blow vpon his helme, that it did little profite him the strength of the stéele, but he cut it in two péeces, head &amp; all, and he fell downe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. Oh what great disturbance and feare this vnmeasurable blowe caused vnto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well to those of the Citie, as to those of the contrary part. But aboue all this, <hi>Geredeon</hi> was much amazed. And with the great anger and wrath which he had to see the two Giants slaine before him, he thrust himselfe amongst all the people, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so great rumour, as when a strong rocke by force of an earthquake, when the fierce and furious winde dooth take it, and teare and rent it out of the place and scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas it was wont to stand: and with the terrible &amp;

Knight, I know not what to saye vnto so hainous a matter that by thée is committed against me, for séeing thy great boldnesse which thou hast had to disquiet and anger me, it doth cause me to procure to haue reuengement of thée. And to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie I sée thou art one alone knight, and therefore I dooe take it for a dishonour and rebuke to lift vp my furious arme agaynst thée. Therfore that which I desire thée, is this, that thou doest returne vnto the citie and cause to be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one hundreth of the best knights, chosen out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the rest, and sée that you come straight againe, for that of you all together, I wil take this my desired reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And yet for all this, I doe tell thée, I shall not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the great anger &amp; wrath the which I haue against thée. Whosoeuer had bene present to haue heard him speake these wordes woulde haue trembled with feare, but hee in whome feare could neuer take place, and one which tooke no care nor did not esteeme his words, sayde: I doe not knowe wherevppon thou doest staye, if thou doest meane to take reuengement of him who hath so much offended thée, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye hauing him before thée: but thou shalt vnderstande, thou diuellish Gyant, that thy furious looke, nor thy beastlye body, neither thy monstrous members, can put me in feare, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being as thou art, furnished w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a cruell heart, &amp; so great a friend vnto tyranie, &amp; héere I tell thée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the aduauntage
<pb facs="tcp:13973:184"/>
which thou biddest me to take, I doe not desire it, neither I will not take it, but rather I will thée that thou make thy selfe readie for thy defence, and procure if thou canst to driue me out of the field, and when thou hast ouercome me and got the victorie, then maist thou make thy combat with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ninetie and nine. And with this he did put himselfe a parte, shaking his sword with a meruailous good grace. When the Gyant sawe this, in manner of mocking he sayd: Go get thée hence thou vile thing, and take vnto thée the fauour and aide which I doe will thee, and doe not thinke that thou shalt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of me so honourable and end, to be slaine of me in equall battaile. Héere this new knight by anie meanes coulde not suffer his outragious arrogancie, but sayd vnto him: Thou cruell tyrant, subiect to all pride, defend thy selfe, and leaue off these reuilinges and boastes. And in saying these wordes the Prince pressed to the Gyant, and stroke at him so strong a blow vpon one of his thighs, that his strong armour did fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie, and he made a little wound, out of the which issued very much bloud. When this infernall monster felt himselfe thus hurt, and séeing that he made little account of him, but rather despised his wordes, without anie more tarrying, he lift vp a verie heauie mase of yron, which was greate and long, and had hanging at the ende thereof fiue balles of stéele, each of them hanged by a stéele chaine of greate strength. The king <hi>Delfo</hi> was meruailously troubled, when he sawe the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med weapon which was raised in the aire, making a greate noise, and with greate furie readie to be discharged vpon the head of this warlike knight, who when he saw it comming, with his accustomed lightnesse did procure to deliuer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from so horrible a blowe, and in such sort it came, that all those fiue balls fell together on the ground, at which fall by reason of the great waight of the mase, he was constrained to fall forwards with the blowe. The Prince which at that time was not without care, but séeing him in that sorte, hée stepped quickly vnto him, &amp; stroke him so mightie and great a blow vpon his strong helme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great strength wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was giuen, did constraine the gyant by pure force to

The Princes swoord was not so fine &amp; strong to suffer so great strokes, but broke in péeces with those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blowes, which was the occasion that as then the battel was not finished. So the Prince when he saw himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his swoord, thought it best to withdrawe himselfe backe, and the <hi>Arginarian</hi> king when he beheld himselfe so vsed, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing terrible rorings, he arose vp, so that he made all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth to shake, and when he was on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Gyaunt felt this great harme, he let loose his holde from the mase with his left hand, and clapped it vnto his face. The new knight, who receiued no griefe at his extremitie, but waying the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie into which he was driuen, for lacke of a weapon, but seeing the Gyant occupyed in feeling of his face, and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bodie at the griefe thereof, he did procure to winne from him his mase, and giuing a contrarie leap, as the Ounce doth when she is oppressed by the hunter, layed ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The Gyant when he saw that he had lost his mase, and that it was in the power of his enimie, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnto him for to catch him betwéene his armes, but this new knight, who was nothing desirous of such imbrasing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himselfe from the same by putting himselfe on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side, and as the Gyant passed by, he stroke him with that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mase so terrible a blow on the backe, that he made him to go forwards spite of his téeth, which made him forget to desire anie more to come to wrastle. So when the Gyant had stretched himselfe vpright, he drew out his broad and sharpe sword, and with a gallant demeanour, his sword all aloft, he pressed vnto the new knight, who was with his mase readie at his standing, abiding his comming. The new knight did first discharge his blow, for that he might strike him a farre of, and chaunced with one of the balls to hit him vpon the left arme, with so strong a blowe, that the bone of the wrist he brake in péeces, which made the Gyant to loose his furious blowe.

Who at this time shoulde haue séene the countenaunce of the king of <hi>Argina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and the king <hi>Delfo</hi> would well haue iudged theyr greate trouble of mindes. This warlike knight was verie much troubled with that great griefe, insomuch that many times he thought to haue imbraced with the Gyaunt and wrastled with him, which certainely he would haue done if the griefe had continued, but he felt that the paine decreased, which was the occasion that he went dalying with the gyant, who with hastie and terrible blowes followed striking of him, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prince felt himselfe cléere of the paine, and that hée was able to lift vp his arme, hée tooke the mase in both his hands, and setled his féet verie strong on the ground, and kept in his breath, that he might with more strength discarge his blow, detayning it till such time as the Gyants blow was stroke, which was with so great strength, that falling on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, the sword entered into the earth more then halfe of it, and it was the occasion that the Prince had better time, for to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his mightie and determined blowe, and discharging it, with two of the balls of stéele which hung at the mases end, he let driue such a blowe on the Gyaunt, that he made him to stoope with both his knées to the ground, and séeing him in that plight, he stroke at him another blowe, which was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his helme, which gaue such a sound, as though it had ben stroke vpon a bell: wherewith he fell with all his bodie to the ground, and stretched out his huge members, making no more mouing, and when this new knight sawe that he moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not, he pulled of his healme, and perceiued that the blowe was such, that it beate out his eyes and the braines out of his head. Then the young Prince gaue thankes vnto the Gods, for that he had no perfect knowledge of his descent, nor anie lyght that he was a christian, &amp; taking vp the mase,

He was so much importunated by so many knights, that he could doo no otherwise but goe take his rest, and lie downe, wheras he was cured &amp; healed of such blowes as he had receiued, which was black and blew, and there was ministred vnto him such ointments as did mitigate the pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In me thou foundest so much fidelitie, that I did furnish thée with armour and horse, that with them thou shouldst delyuer me from those, which did séeke to haue me against my will: But I with my good will did yéeld my selfe, I say my selfe vnto him, which now doth séeke my death. Ah Emperour, remember, that I sawe thée depriued of all helpe: an vnhappy day for me, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in making much of thée, and giuing thée ioye, I bereaued my selfe of all, and lost the possession of my libertie and honour: and although thou hadst not estéemed, nor tooke any care of the sorrowfull Quéene of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> yet thou shouldest not haue moued thy selfe to haue made a mocke of the perfecte loue which I did shew thée, and the great desire that I had to serue thée. Thou shouldest haue had some care and griefe séeing that I defended thée from all my Nobles &amp; Knights who sought thy death, thou hauing depriued so manye of my knights of their liues: thou shouldest haue had pitie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that had pitie on thée. O loue, that so quickly diddest make me blinde, &amp; depriuedst me of the knowledge which I should

If thou hadst pretended to mocke me, thou shouldst haue put me out of all doubt, and not haue suffered me, to loose so much as I haue lost for thy sake, but haue procured that I might haue eschewed all this harme, whereof thou hast bene the occasion. Tell me, why didst thou not suffer me to execute my will, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I might haue opened my white breast with that sharpe sword: it had ben better for me to haue dyed then, than now, for now liuing, for thée I dayly dye. Remember thy selfe Emperour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the harme that will come héerof, and doo not vse so much crueltie with them, that haue not deserued it at thy handes.

The Damosell which brought the Letter, all the time that the Emperour was reading of it, she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer withdrewe her eyes from looking on him: and when
<pb facs="tcp:13973:189"/>

Dost thou thinke that it is sufficient to excuse thee from the paine that is pretended to be giuen thée. Dost thou not sée, that when thou couldest giue remedie (thou wouldest not) vnto them, who now are without all hope, and tarryeth for no other satisfaction but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy head. O false Emperour, diddest thou not sée that she was not a ladie to be thus moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and deceiued. Surely thou hast recouered to thy selfe a verie good name, for the exalting of thy lygnage. Thy sonne whom we honour there for a God, may well praise himselfe for his descent, in hauing thée for his father. O false and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, is this the inheritaunce which thou diddest inherit of thy most famous bloud? Is this the great loyaltie which thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est shew vnto thy sonnes? O vile Greeke, how doe the Gods consent that so disloyall a knight should liue in the world. Is it not possible that these sorrowfull &amp; continuall complaints of <hi>Tinacria</hi> doe not open your eares, and cause you to sende downe punishment, for this greate offence. O ingratefull Gods, receiue the sacrifice of my chastitie in paiment of the reuengement which from your high heauens I hope shall bée done vpon this counterfait without all fayth, and make that my bloud héere shed vpon this stoore, maye shewe the single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and cleane loue of <hi>Garofil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in vttering of these &amp; such like sorrowes she tooke forth a naked sword which shée brought readie for the same effect, and put the pomell to the ground, and cast her breast vpon the point, the which she did with so great hast, that the Emperour nor anie of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there present could not succour her, nor take her from doing that fact. All that were present remained verie much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to see so sodaine a mischaunce. The Emperour verie full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13973:189"/>
would not consent that any one should speake a word vnto him. The couragious Empresse with a royall stomacke &amp; great discretion, dissembling her griefe in the best wise shée could, commaunded her body to be caried out of the pallaice, and in the Court of the pallaice she commanned to be made a rich tombe, in the which she was buried: there was made her proportion, which did shew what chaunced vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: and about the tombe was written an Epitaph, which did declare the occasion of her death. All the time that this damsell was a burying, the Emperour neuer came forth out of his closet, neither would he haue come forth when hée did, and if it had not bene by the great importance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. Whereas now we will leaue them, for to tell you of the chaunces and aduentures which hapned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince <hi>Eleno,</hi> the time that he trauailed in the world, the which for that he was as noble as warlyke, and of great strength, it is not reason, that he should passe so long without making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mention of him. You doo well remember how he wente out of <hi>Numidia,</hi> with one onely Page, putting himselfe to sea, in that inchaunted barke of the Knight of the Sunne. He was so heauie and sorrowfull for the death of his Ladie and Mistresse, that he was cleane changed, and appeared not to be him that he was woont, neither had he so great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to gouerne himselfe. In this manner he trauayled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a whole yeare, and neuer could méete with <hi>Brenio,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he was commaunded to giue the letter from <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> neither could he heare in any place whersoeuer he came, where he might goe to séeke him: in which his trauaile, he did not let but to méete with some aduentures, the which, with great honour to his person, be finished. Yet for all this he could haue no ease of his sorrow &amp; griefe, which brought him in such perplexitie, that if he had not considered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great losse of his soule, many times he would haue slain himselfe, So it happened y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one morning very early, the barke had put her selfe a ground, giuing him to vnderstand, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite there for him to goe a lande. The Prince who was very desirous thereof, quickly went a shore, and after him
<pb facs="tcp:13973:190"/>
his page, who as you haue heard, that by reason of the great hast that the barke made, he coulde not retourne a lande to <hi>Numidia.</hi> His name was called <hi>Fabio,</hi> who was to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster such companye that many times he would comforte the Prince, when he was most troubled with very comfortable words and perswasions, and did serue him with great loue and fidelitie. The Prince and his Page began to trauayle a foote with an easie pace through a narow and straight path, and with a meruailous and diligent eye, he did beholde that countrey, and it séemed vnto him, that he should know it, &amp; that before that time he had passed by that waye: but the firme loue that he had to <hi>Lidia,</hi> was the occasion that it was out of his remembraunce. So with this sorrowe he trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, till such time as <hi>Phoebus</hi> had passed the fourth parte of his iourney, when that being wery with the long way, &amp; the great waight of his armor, he was forced to take some rest &amp; ease, vnder the fresh &amp; gréene mirtle trées, whose leaues did hath themselues in a faire &amp; cléere fountaine, whereas he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a new to haue in remembrance his former paine, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of Fortune, he published his great griefe, making thow of the great sorrow that he felt, &amp; although he was we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of complaining, &amp; seeing himselfe so without all remedye, he called for his lute, for that <hi>Fabio</hi> did alwayes carry with him, &amp; taking it in his hands, onely to giue some ease vnto his tormented hart, he began to sing these verses following.</p>

               <p>His Page <hi>Fabio</hi> did cause him to leaue off his singing, for with the great attention that he gaue to heare his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he likewise heard a lamentable sound, which séemed to be of a Lady. Likewise the Prince, when he had ended his swéete musicke, did hearken to heare it: and giuing a very attentiue eare, that although she did complaine with a lowe voyce, yet he might heare that the sound of the voice, came forth of the thickest from amongst those trées: and without any more tarrying, he left his lute with his Page, and went that way from which he thought the voyce came, and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went, the better he might heare, that weake and fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voyce. Still he went forwards, til such time as he might see who it was that made that lamentation. And he saw that it was a very faire Lady, that was bound vnto a trée, all naked to the skin, she had all her haire spred abroad vppon her naked backe. The Prince came vnto her, and before that he sayd any word, he did vntie her, and cut the cordes wherewith she was bound, and tooke a gowne which was there of the Ladyes, and couered her delicate and white bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. The Ladie was very much ashamed to sée her selfe loose and at libertie: and sitting downe vnder a gréene Oake, the Prince asked of her who he was, that without respect of his owne honestie and honour, had lefte her in that sort. This fayre Lady sayd: Knight, thou shalt vnderstand that I am Daughter vnto a verye good Knight and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who was Lorde ouer thrée Castles of the best in all this Countrey.

he was one of them that was slaine by the handes of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marandus,</hi> whom afterwardes the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> slew in battaile. So I remained all alone, very much made off, &amp; well beloued of the widdowe my mother, and we kepte our selues in a very faire castle of ours, not far from this place, whereas we did passe our solitary liues. So I was required of loue, of a Gentleman, more richer in goodes and landes, than in linage or vertue, and I vnderstanding his litle esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, did alwayes esteeme him as little, and neuer made any reckoning of his messages: the which was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that his desire was the more stronger, in such sorte, that he séeing himselfe by me not estéemed, but put off, with the great griefe that he receiued for my loue, he dyed, and at the houre of his death, he neuer left naming of, <hi>Felina, the cause of all my harme.</hi> At such time as he dyed there was a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his present: and hearing him to declare the causer of his death, there kindeled in him so much anger and wrath, that he bare vnto me a perpetuall hatred and did procure to haue amends for the death of his brother. So it hapned on a time, that I went out of the Castle without any mistrust, in the company of other two damsells, at which time I was stole away by him, and other foure Knightes, who broughte me vnto this place, which is to my great sorrow and gréefe, whereas they bound me in that sort as thou hast found me gentle Knight, and not content héerewith (but for my more paine and sorrow) they left me naked, with greater desire to die then to liue.</q>

The Knight returned, and gaue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother blow, that it made the sparks of fire to fly out of his healme. Then the <hi>Dacian</hi> full of yre, let goe his shield, and clasped fast his sword in both his hands, and stroke him so terrible a blow vpon his helme, that he cut helme and heade in two péeces, and he fell down dead to the earth. The other seeing their companion dead, all thrée together set vpon him: but this valiant <hi>Dacian</hi> who in such like aduentures neuer had any feare, did receiue them with his accustomed furye, striking on them both on the right and lefte hand with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall blowes.

Oh my gods, I am in no falt, in the loosing of my chastitie, for that it was violently taken from me, in the thicke forrest. There shall be none able to disturbe, but that I will execute my fury vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my selfe, although I doo not deserue the same: and in saying these words, she tooke the sword of that dead knight, and put the poynt to her breast, and threw her selfe thereon, in such sort, that <hi>Fabio</hi> could not succour her, although with great hast he would haue done it. The <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head on the one side, and saw the harme done, he pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed forwards with great furie and yrefull wrath, and lifte vp his sword, and stroke such a blow at one of them vppon his right arme, that arme and sworde together fell to the ground, and strayght tourned vnto another, and with an ouerthwart blowe, he stroke him on the making fast of his

But the <hi>Dacian</hi> perceiuing it, before that hée could put in execution his desire, he stroke him such a blow vpon his helme, that being parted in péeces with the head, he made him to beare company with his dead companions. So when he had concluded this battaile, he went vnto the dead Lady, and hauing great sorrow to sée her he pulled the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die sword out of her body, and commaunded <hi>Fabio</hi> that in the best manner he could to make a graue, and to bury her.

Oh soueraigne gods, that this Loue might be séene, whom all you doo account to be a God &amp; Lord, that you might at your ease reioyce in his simplenes, &amp; know him that hath brought you out of all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, as it doth appeare by your varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble resons, &amp; ill placed words, which without anye order be vttered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I promise you, if we shuld turne &amp; make reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall at night, of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which you do talk on in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, you shal not finde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is any agréement therein, as by their songs gentle Knight you may know, &amp; with what Philosphie they wold giue vs to vnderstand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> two bodies haue but one hart. And héere I sweare vnto you, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might &amp; power of <hi>Alfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> restorer of our Countryes, &amp; by the great valor of the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in what sort soeuer you will tumble and tosse these variable reasons, ther is no vnderstanding of man can cause me to beléeue, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two bodies are gouerned by one heart alone, at least wayes I would not be he that should be without a heart. Likewise heare the reasons of my other companion, who tumbleth together and maketh a mixture
<pb facs="tcp:13973:195"/>
of glorie and paine, and paine and glorie, as though we should mixe honnie and gall together: and if I should let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much, they woulde goe about to make me beléeue that which neuer chanced: but remaine you with these your amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thoughtes, or as I might better saie, with your foolish conceits, and let me haue continually my cattell well fed and gouerned, and in as good plight as now they are, béeing so fat as the skinne may holde, and not to be as you are, that hath lost all your owne reason and vnderstanding, and therewith forget and loose the care that you should haue of yours, who for lacke of looking vnto, be so leane. And making an end in saying these words, he sate himselfe downe, and séemed to bée verie angrie to sée his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions so without reason &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and blinded with loue. The which words was the occasion, that the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> was constrained to doe that, which since his departure out of <hi>Dacia</hi> he did not, which was, that he laughed to heare the simplicitie of this shepheard, and taking in hand to aunswere him, he sayd: Friend, I doe tell thée that thy resistaunce is great: likewise thy vnderstanding is verie much, that being conuersant dayly and hearing the great complaints and communication of so amorous sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, thou art not intangled with the same. And héere I do desire thée, that thou hold thy selfe firme in the same, and kéep thy selfe still as thou art, least peraduenture that which thou doest now call follie, héereafter thou wilt call discreation and wisedome. Thou mayst now well account thy selfe happie, for that without all care and sorrow, thou mayst reuile them who doth complaine of so manie miseries. With a greate laughter this shepheard aunswered and sayd: Nowe gentle Knight, I doe tell thée, that I will as little contend with thée as with thy companions, for that it séemeth vnto mée that thou art also a vassall vnto that foolish loue, and I doe more estéeme my libertie, thus simple as thou doest sée mée, then all the wisedome which thou dost presume to haue: it is much better for the shepheard to haue care and kéepe of his cattell, to guide them in good féeding, and not euerie small time to call for his crowde, and singing two thousand songes, the
<pb facs="tcp:13973:195"/>
which the Diuell cannot vnderstand, and although they sing them, yet I thinke they vnderstand them not themselues. So one of his companions cut off his reasons and sayde: <hi>Tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> doest thou not know, how at mine owne libertie, in times past I did gouerne my selfe, and mocking and iesting at them who did publish the lyke complaintes. Héere I dooe desire the Gods to maintaine thée in this estate, and to kéepe thee y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> loue doo not extend his furie vpon thée, for if hée do, he will make thée repent a thousand times these wordes which thou hast sayde.

               <p>With the great paine and sorrow that <hi>Eleno</hi> felt, he was not able to goe forwardes with his song, for that there came to his remembraunce the sodaine departure of <hi>Lidia,</hi> which constrained him to leaue it of, and one of the shepheards that was there sayd: Oh gentle knight, how the queene our Lady would reioyce to heare you, for that she is likewise afflicted by loue, for which cause and for that she would at some time take ease of her sorrowe and paine, she doth commaund vs to sing our louing and amorous songs, who doth solempnise our swéet and loiung vearses, with teares distilling from her sorrowfull eies: Then <hi>Eleno</hi> asked of them who was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, that the quéene, without hauing anie power to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die her selfe should suffer such like torment. The shepheard
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13973:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did declare vnto him all that hath bene tolde you in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie past of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and of all that passed with the Quéene. <hi>Tarido,</hi> who of all this had no care, but onely to the féeding of his cattell, did breake off this conuersation, in rising vp to put abroad his Cattel into the gréene medowes, the other shepheardes that were in companie with <hi>Tarido,</hi> desired that the night wer come, for to returne and to reioyce themselues in hearing the swéet and well consorted musicke of the Prince, &amp; so they made agréement to returne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place, but it fell not out as they had determined, for that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a sodaine and vnawares <hi>Eleno</hi> heard a verie dolorous sigh towards his left hand, which was so terrible, heauy, and bitter, that it made him giue attentiue eare to sée if he coulde vnderstand what it should be, and with the quiet eare that he gaue, he might discerne that the occasion of all that euill was loue, which caused him to say: Oh almightie God, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that this is the place wher in olde time they reported to bée planted the dwelling of the Goddesse <hi>Venus,</hi> for that since my comming hether to take my rest, I haue hearde no other thing but lamentations, and so with making the least noise possible, he arose vp and began to goe towards the place whereas he might sée what it was, and there hée behelde a knight verie well armed, which thou didde alight from his horse, vnder a fayre and gréene Myrtle trée, his armour was all russet, and full of barres of blacke stéele, which shewed to be a verie sadde, sorrowfull, and heauie enamelling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hée was somewhat of a bigge stature of bodie and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and there séemed by his disposition to bée in him greate vertue, and with sorrowfull sighes hée laide himselfe downe on the gréene grasse, and with sadde and heauy words he sayd.</p>
               <p>Ah heauie and peruerse fortune why doost thou consent that so naughtie and euill a man as I am doe liue so long: Oh my <hi>Lidia,</hi> with how much reason maist thou complaine of the cruell outrage that thou receiuedst at the handes of <hi>Brenio,</hi> béeing nothing of him considered:
<q>O <hi>Brenio, Brenio,</hi> whereon was thy thought &amp; vnderstanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which did induce
<pb facs="tcp:13973:197"/>
thée to commit so great euill, in leauing all alone and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort, the thing, of whome thou wert most beloued in the world, giuing and leauing her, vnto the will of the wilde and furious beasts. It is possible indéede that they will haue more compassion on thee my <hi>Lidia,</hi> then he who had more reason to comfort and loue thée. Oh cruell, and without all faith, thou wert born into this world, for thy own torment, when with thy selfe thou didst consent to commit so greate treason. Where was thy vnderstanding that thou couldest not remember thy selfe, &amp; take pitie on her, that did forsake her affinitie and Countrey, for thée and thy loue. O <hi>Lidia,</hi> who made me to forget all the great paines and trauaile which thou tookest, in wandring by lande alone lamenting, and sometimes by sea sorrowing, and all for to set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie him, who lefte thée prisoner amongst the wilde beastes. Oh happy beast is he, that chaunceth to bury thée in his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and woe be vnto me traitor, without any knowledge of vertue or pittie. What doth it now profite me to fill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire with my lamentations, séeing that the harme and euill is alreadie past, and without all remedy or hope of comfort: </q>&amp; héerewith he gaue a terrible and grieuous sigh, &amp; so held his peace.
<hi>Don Eleno</hi> by those heauie and sorrowfull wéepings together with his reasons which he heard, knewe him to bée that <hi>Brenio,</hi> whom so long time he had laboured to séeke and find out with so great trauaile, and knew him to be the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the death of his Lady and Mistresse, the paine and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe was so extreame the which he felt, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained without anie féeling to fall down to the ground, but yet the furie of his couragious heart woulde not giue place that he should so remaine long, but straight wayes with the great anguish that he had, he arose vp againe on foote, with great desire to fight with <hi>Brenio,</hi> but calling to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance all that which was commanded him, he would first performe the same, in giuing him the letter, and then when hée hadde made an ende of reading the same, to demaunde of him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So with this thought and determination, he went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place whereas <hi>Brenio</hi> was, who, when he heard the

noyse, straight wayes on his féete: then <hi>Eleno</hi> did salute him with a voyce somewhat heauie. And <hi>Brenio</hi> did return vnto him his salutation, with no lesse showe of griefe. Then this amorous <hi>Eleno,</hi> tooke forth the letter out of the place, whereas so long time he had kept it, and taking it into his hand he sayd.
<q>Is it possible that thou art y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forgetful and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall <hi>Brenio,</hi> the which left <hi>Lidia,</hi> with so great paine and sorrow, all alone in the power, of the wilde beasts.</q> 
                  <hi>Brenio</hi> when he heard him to saye these words, he began to behold him, although his eyes were all to be blubbered and wearie with wéepings, he aunswered him and sayd.
<q>I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thée gentle Knight, that which the high heauens doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The teares were in so great abundance which this sad &amp; heauy knight did shed in the time that he was a reading this dolorous letter, that he all to wet the same, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> messenger like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise did not let to beare him companie, and to solempne his heauinesse with so many more teares distilling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his eyes.

but with an inward lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which did torment his hart, he called continually vpon <hi>Lidia,</hi> and with that diuellish fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wherin he was, he drew out his dagger, and lifting vp the skirte of his shirt of mayle, he thrust it into his body, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himself this vnhappy death, with calling vpon <hi>Lidia,</hi> he finished his life. The <hi>Dacian</hi> knight remained in a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion to see this sodayne chaunce, and that in such sort, that he could put no remedy therein, but with the great heauines and sorrow, that he receiued, he fell downe in a sounde, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remembraunce of himselfe. The Page which <hi>Eleno</hi> brought with him, did then procure all remedies that were possible for to bring him againe vnto his remembrance, and laboured to doe it with great loue, but yet for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could do or procure, ther was no possibilitie of his recouery, til such time as <hi>Phoebus</hi> had made an end of his iourney, &amp; that <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> had begun hir gouernment, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he began to come a litle to himselfe, &amp; looking on the one side, and sawe that <hi>Brenio</hi> lay dead by his side, with a dolorous voice he said vnto his page. Ah <hi>Fabio,</hi> wherefore hast thou procured to put remedy vnto my bodye, and consented that it shoulde indure so terrible paine and euill, thou shouldest haue sufferd me to haue dyed, and not to haue ben the occasion that now I liue dying, and hauing no more power to speake, he held his peace. At this time he had great néede of the force and strength of his chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian courage, for to assist him that he did not that, which should cause him to beare company with this dead <hi>Brenio.</hi> His Page <hi>Fabio</hi> did very much comfort him, and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by all meanes to giue him ease: but all that euer he could doo did profit very little, or giue any contentment vnto his paine, till such time as he hearde a greate noyse of armed knights, which was the occasion that he came vnto himselfe, and for that he would not be discouered, he put him selfe into the thickest of the bushes, &amp; with the helpe of <hi>Fabio</hi>; he carryed <hi>Brenio,</hi> drawing him from the place wher he was, and couered him with boughes and leaues, till such time as they might haue opportunitie to burie him, as héereafter you shall vnderstand. So there he continued all that night till the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13973:199"/>
morning, with great sorrow and paine, lamenting much his vnhappy lot, in a place whereas he could not be discouerd or heard, not for any feare that was in him, but onely to haue time to lament, weepe &amp; bewaile his vnhappy fortune. Then at such time as the bright <hi>Apollo,</hi> did spred abroade his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den beames, ouer all the fields and cragged mountaines, he did perceiue that those which did lodge themselues nigh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place wheras he was, did procure to depart, he let them goe, without any desire to know who they were, but rather being still, did let them passe forwards on their way, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to put in execution his former intent. But first of all he caused to vnarme <hi>Brenio</hi> of his armour, the which was according vnto his passion, in colour and all things, and as strong as a Diamond, &amp; made by Arte Magicke, with great lamentation he armed himselfe with them, and tooke also his shield, which was all of a russet field, and in the midst ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was put <hi>Cupide</hi> with two faces, the one was very faire and bound with a cloath about his eyes, and the other was made meruailous fierce and furious. He continued and was so long in arming himselfe, that he heard a great number of Knights, which passed along by the sides of the forrest, and amongst them there was a dolorous lamentation, which sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be of Ladyes and Damsels, and it séemed that they were forced and constrained against their wills, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the courage of this <hi>Dacian,</hi> to desire to know what it was. And leaping vpon his horse, his Page tooke the horse of <hi>Brenio,</hi> which was very good, &amp; with as little noyse as was possible, they went out of the forrest into the high waye, whereas they might sée all that which in the chapter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall be told you.</p>

And there he discouered thirtie Knights, which rode before a chariot, that was drawen with foure horses, and therein a companye of Ladies and damsels, apparailed with meruailous rich robes, making great lamentation and sorrowe: and in the midst amongst them, ther was a very faire Lady, who had before her two childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: and before the Chariot rode a Giant of a fierce and furious countenaunce mounted on a wonderful beast, and after the same went another giant, not altogether so furious as the first, that was mounted on a mightie horse: these made great hast to trauaile forwards. When this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Dacian</hi> saw this aduenture, he was in a great confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that he found himselfe so leane and weake, yet for all that, the great valour of his person, and courage of his hart, would not suffer anye sluggishnesse, but determined to set them at libertie, and to punish so great outrage, or els to die in the demaunde. And with this determination he said. Let life suffer the paine, and let not the honour be blotted with cowardnesse, and perusing well his armour, he committed himselfe vnto God, and issued out of the forrest with a swift pace, at such time as the Chariot with the great hast that it made, had passed by a good space, and setting spurres, vnto his horse, he made him to flye lyke the winde, and with a high voyce he bad them tarrie. At which calling, the Giant that was hindermost looked backe, and when he sawe that it was a Knight that called him, and that he came running towards him with great swiftnesse, he said vnto those that gouerned the Chariot. Goe and kéepe on your waye, and let me alone to sée what that vnhappie creature would haue: and he turned about his horse, at such time as that warlike <hi>Dacian,</hi> was come nigh vnto him, the Gyant sayd vnto him: Knight what hast is this that thou makest. The <hi>Dacian</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: It is to amend if I maye this outrage which I

suppose thou dost vnto those Ladyes, which thou dost carrie away with thée in the waggon. The Giant smiling, and as it wer, séeming to haue him in derision, disdainfully sayd. I doo tell thée of a truth knight, that if I did not beléeue, that folly doth make thée to speake that which thou hast vttered, thou mightest well take me to be the vilest person in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to haue so small courage, to put my selfe before one alone Knight in this demand. The <hi>Dacian</hi> did well perceiue that these words proceeded of great pride &amp; presumption, and without giuing him any aunswere, he drew out his sharpe sworde, and then without anye more tarrying, he stroke him vpon his helme so great a blowe, that it sounded like a bell, and made him to decline his head downe to his breast. But straight way he had his payment for the same, for that the Gyant layd hold on his great and cutting sword, &amp; with straunge swiftnesse, he stroke him vppon the fine and harde helme, that he almost made him to loose his féeling. By which blow, this couragious <hi>Eleno</hi> perceiued, that it stoode him in hand, not to be idle, and hauing great feare, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time while they made their battaile, the rest would go away with their pray, and then all his labour and trauayle should be in vaine, he let his shield hang at his backe, and clasped his sword fast with both his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; stroke him so furious a blow vpon his helme, that the strength therof did litle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him; for that it was not able to make any defence, but it was cut in péeces with the head, and the Giant fell dead to the ground, &amp; without any more tarying, he followed after the waggon, and did procure to disturbe them, that they should not goe forwards on their way. So all those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went with the waggon, were alighted from their horses, ready to imbarke themselues into a small barke which they tarried for, to carry them vnto a great and faire shippe, which was there, a litle farther from the shore. This <hi>Dacian</hi> called with a loud voice, &amp; said. Tarrie, tarrie, &amp; do not thinke, so much at your ease to carry away your praye, for that I hope first to take away your liues, or els to be slaine in their defence.

And when they saw and knew that it was the Knight that remained with the Giaunt, and séeing him come in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they were all meruailously astonied. The other Giaunt which was yet still vpon his beast, and was not alighted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned against him, more furious than a Tiger, and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a thousand varieties, he asked where he remained that made battaile with him. <hi>Don Eleno</hi> sayd: Put at libertye these Ladyes which thou dost carry away by force, and aske not for him: for he wanting life, hath finished all his euill déedes and workes, and without tarrying for an aunswere, he lifte vp his sword, all to be bathed with the bloud of the dead Gyant, and stroke at him so terrible a blowe, that hée gaue him to vnderstand very well, the strength of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie arme. The Giant who felt the blowe to be very strong drew out from his side, a broad and heauie sword, and stroke at him such a blow, that almost it brought him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, if it had not bene for the great force, which he put in firming himselfe in his stiroppes, which was the occasion that in a trice he setled himselfe againe in the saddle, &amp; séeing himselfe so euill intreated he pressed towards him, and began to laye on him so sharpe and strong blowes, that he made the sparks of fire flie out of his armour, and although he was meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously occupied in striking of the Gyant, yet did he not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to haue alwayes an eie vnto Chariot wheras the captiue Ladies were, to sée if they did procure by anie meanes to do them harme or damage, and he sawe that they went about to take them out of the waggen, and to put them a land, for to imbarke them, which made him to make more hast in his battaile, and knowing the strong enimie, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and inraged with that sodaine sight, to sée them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking, and that if they should carry them to sea, then by no meanes he could neither fauour nor succour them, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued so great wrath, that he threw his shield at his backe and tooke his cutting sword in both his hands, and went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Giant on his left side, and firming himselfe in his stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops, he stroke him so terrible a blow, that he made him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13973:201"/>
and to void at his mouth and nose great abundance of bloud, and without anie tarrying he spurred his horse and in great hast he went towards those knights that had those Ladies in kéeping, &amp; began to sturre himselfe amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in such sort, that when they remembred themselues to make resistance, there was thrée of them slaine, then all the rest ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues together, &amp; put backe to backe, &amp; made a round circle, with their swords in their hands to make their defence. At this time the prince <hi>Eleno</hi> had forgot the great vertue which his horse had, but because he wold not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shuld kill him, he alighted from him, the which was the occasion that he put himselfe in great trauaile and perill, notwithstanding with the great anger which he had, he pressed in amongst them, &amp; stroke &amp; wounded them on euery side, without taking anie rest, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a wonder to sée, and he so besturred &amp; tossed his cutting sword vpon them that made resistaunce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made them to know and féele his great strength, although that they were chosen &amp; valiant knights, &amp; they did not let to intreate him very euill, in such sort, that many times they made him to stoope &amp; féele the griefe of their blowes: notwithstanding the courage &amp; strength of <hi>Eleno</hi> was such, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in a very short time he brought twelue of them to the ground before him. The marriners which sawe the great furie that was in that one knight, in great hast put of their barke from the waters side, and with the feare which they had likewise to be there slaine, retourned vnto their shippe, forcing their barke with the great strength of their armes, striking in the water with their oares, and when they came to the ship they called aloud giuing &amp; making a great noise vnto the rest of the knightes that were in the ship, which was to the number of twentie, that they shoulde come and giue aide and succour to those which were a land, for that some of them were slaine, &amp; some verie sore hurt, and other some standing stil in their defence. In the meane time this furious <hi>Dacian</hi> did so behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe amongst them, &amp; in such sort, that quickly he had cléered himselfe of all those, if at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> present time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant which was before astonied &amp; beside himselfe, had not come wheras they
<pb facs="tcp:13973:202"/>
were, for being come againe vnto himselfe, and sawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great perill wherein he was brought, I cannot nor am not able to declare héere the great and vnmeasurable furie the which hée had, and it did the more increase in him when he saw so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knights slaine and dead, onely by the power and strength of that one knight: his wrath was so greate, that he began to cry out against his Gods, and alighted from his beast, &amp; toke his sword into his hand, and with a furious pace hée went towards whereas the Prince was, but when the valiant <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno</hi> sawe him, he could not but thinke that he shoulde passe great trouble with him, notwithstanding for that he sawe no other thing but death amongest those barbarous and rude people, he did determine to sell his life verie déere, &amp; had good regard vnto the blows which the Gyant shuld strike at him, and in the best wise he could he cléered himselfe from them. In this sort went this valiant knight maintaining his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, &amp; damnifieng his enimies when opportunitie did serue, and alwayes had a good hope to cléere himselfe of that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, although that there were come a land thrée and twenty other knights, against whom he made his defence at his ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for that they feared his terrible blowes, and had hurt &amp; wounded them in many parts, although the wounds wer not very great, for that he could neuer fasten on them one blow to his contentment. At this time there came another Gyant a shore out of the barke, which had remained in the ship, and with him came other twentie knights, and thirtie men with hatchets and other weapons, which made great hast to come a land. At such time as this warlyke <hi>Dacian</hi> was intangled &amp; in battaile with the other, this gyant came before all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest and stroke this knight behinde him so terrible a blow that it made him to bow both his knées to the ground, but his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie courage which in such like chaunces alwaies recouered strength with great hast &amp; a valiaunt heart, he put himselfe a foote againe, and looking about him to sée who it was that so tormented him, he sawe that it was a mightie and terrible Gyaunt, who with a greate clubbe was readie to giue him the second blowe, the Prince with good aduisement did put
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13973:202"/>
himselfe a part from the force thereof, and made him to spend his blowe in vaine, and tooke his sworde in his handes, and pressed vnto the Gyant before he could defend himselfe, and stroke him such a terryble blowe vpon the right knée, that he cut it a sunder in the middest, and the heauie and fierce Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant fell dead to the ground. At this time all those that came out of the ship pressed on him for to kill him, that by reason of their thicke and mightie blowes, so many together, he was constrained to fall downe to the earth, but when he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this great perill, he did procure to kill all that euer he could of them that put themselues before him, which was the occasion that he had space to arise vp againe on foote, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe in this great daunger, he began to call vpon Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, committing vnto him his soule, and besought him that he would take mercie on it, and therwith he pressed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his enimies, and with double force he laide on them on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie side, but all was in vaine for him to make resistance, for that the companie was so great that did compasse him about, striking at him as though they were desperate men, so that this good knight was constrained to retire vnto the sea side, and to put himselfe into the water vp to the wast, whereas he made his backe sure, that they could not come behind him, &amp; there hée made his defence somewhat with lesse trauaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that did procure to offend him: the Gyant which sawe so great a slaughter of men committed by one knight, with a furious voyce retourned vnto the people, and reuiled them, calling them cowardes, and cursing himselfe for that hée woulde accompanie himselfe with so naughtie and vile a generation, and sayde vnto them: Enter into the water and followe him, for it is but one knight that is before you. And therewith he put himselfe into the water, then all the rest for verie shame were constrayned to doe the lyke. At this time this valiant knight sawe himselfe in the greatest daunger that euer before that time in all his life he had bene in, and made not anie reckoning to liue longer, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he thought to sell his lyfe verie déere, with the death of all such as hée might possiblie fasten one blowe vppon:
<pb facs="tcp:13973:203"/>
But at this instant came vnto his minde his beloued <hi>Lidia,</hi> and he sayd with a déepe and profound sigh. Ah my <hi>Lidia,</hi> what great delight doo I féele in my selfe, héere to make my ende, and to set me at libertie of so great sorrow and care, which I doo suffer in not séeing thée: but therewith remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himselfe, he sayd. O Lord what is this, what haue I sayd? I doo finde my selfe at the poynt to be slaine, and doo I now call to remembrance her, that I know is in the depth of the earth. Am not I a Christian? It is better for me to returne vnto thée my God, vnto whom I doo commit my soule: and Lord, for thy mercies sake, doo not looke vpon this my weaknesse, but according vnto thy great mercie take pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vpon me. And although he was weary, yet was not his valiant armes at this time vnoccupied, but rather with a more strength he did procure to defende himselfe, working such wondrous feates, that séemed euen impossible, but vnto them that sawe it. And he recouered vnto himselfe a newe courage and force, in such sort, that the water of the Sea did giue testimoniall of his great prowesse, for that vnto more then ten of them which did pursue him, hée gaue the sea for their sepulchar: and if it had not bene for the Gyaunt that did trouble him very much, he would before he hadde bene slaine, made that very few of the rest should haue remained, for to brag themselues of their victory. But I promise you, he was in such plight, that of very féeblenesse he was forced to make his strength. This wearied <hi>Eleno</hi> was in this sorte as you haue heard in great weaknesse, and voyde of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane strength, although he lacked no courage in his heart. At which time there arriued in great hast a barke at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shore side, in the which came one alone Knight, armed with verye rich armor, who (if you doo remember) was the valiant <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer,</hi> that after he had made an ende of that perillous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile at <hi>Lira,</hi> in the which he lost the company of that good Knight <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> he full of sorrow and griefe, retourned vnto the sea, whereas by fortune he found his light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted barke, which with her accustomed swiftnes did ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, whereas he saw was made a fearefull battaile, the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13973:203"/>
which was this that héere before I haue tolde you that the afflicted Prince did make. So that when <hi>Rosileer</hi> sawe that one alone Knight with so great courage did make resistance against so many, who did molest him without all pitie, it mooued in him a desire to helpe him, which straight way he put in vre, and leping a shore with his accustomed courage, he went towards the place whereas they were in battaile, and hauing his sword fast in both his hands, he pressed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those vile people, and when he saw that he which did most trouble the Knight, was that furious and diuelish Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, he stroke him such a blow vpon his left shoulder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and body altogether he cut downe to the wast, &amp; made him fall dead into the water where he was. Yet his fury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted not with this, but striking about him, at foure blowes he brought foure Knights to their end. And as the watered hearbes or flowers doth recreate themselues when they are couered with the beames of the sonne of <hi>Tona,</hi> in such sort did the Prince <hi>Don Eleno</hi> reioyce at the comming of this new succour vnlooked for, and therewith recouering newe strength, with one leape he sprong out of the water, and put himselfe by the side of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and layd vpon his enimies, with great and mightie blowes. The worthy <hi>Rosicleer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued with the great outrage that those vile people did, wrought such valiant wonders, that it was to be meruailed at, and vnhappy might he account himselfe, who chaunced to receiue a blow at his hande. They made so great hast in cutting, wounding and killing of those vile people, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing some dead, and other sore wounded, others running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to deliuer themselues from the furie of their vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull blowes, these knights wer frée &amp; at libertie of all their former perill. This valyant <hi>Eleno</hi> would haue gratified the Prince for his good sucour and ayde, and went towards him for the same effect: and when he woulde haue spoken, hée knewe that it was <hi>Rosicleer</hi> his Cousin, by the deuice that he had in his shielde which was <hi>Cupide</hi> painted in it, and therewith in greate hast hée pulled off his healme, and sayd.</p>

The <hi>Greeke</hi> was very attentiue vnto the wordes that <hi>Eleno</hi> spake and when he sawe his face discouered and his his helme off, it séemed vnto him, that he saw the proportion of his owne naturall face, as though he were looking of him selfe in a glasse, and he receiued great contentment at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight of him, although he did very much meruaile to sée him in that place, and therewith he pulled off his healme, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered that seuere and faire face, with great delight vnto all them that did beholde him, and it was the more to be reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at, for that they were the one so like the other (that except it were for the little bearde that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had) not without great difficultie they could know, which was the one, and which was the other. The two Knights could not perseuer in their communication, for that they were disturbed by the lamentable noyse of those Ladies which were prisoners, for that some of them had their hands bound, &amp; some both hands and féete, and they cryed out for succour and helpe to those Knights, and for that they did see them to prolong the time, they made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more hast in crying for their libertie, at whose pitifull cryes they were constrained to goe vnto them, &amp; to cut asunder the cords wherwith they wer bound.

pictured in her heart: and suspecting what it should be, shée gaue very attentiue eare vnto the wordes which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> vttered, remaining with as great delight of his curtesie and discretion, as when she was whollye yéelded vnto the loue of his father: and for that in the ende of all their talke <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> did demaund of her who she was, she could not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wise do other then tell them, and with great curtesie she aunswered and said. Worthy knightes, in whom the Gods hath made so great equalitie and likenesse, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that I am Quéene and Lady of this Iland called <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacria,</hi> who without all good fortune was mocked by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> false Emperour of <hi>Grecia. Rosicleer,</hi> when he heard his father so euill spoken off, could not take it in good part, yet reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring himself that it was a woman, and that she spake it with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he therefore accordingly did frame himselfe to answere her, and sayd. High and mightie Lady, ther is no reason that I doo aunswere you vnto those words, which your troubled heart hath pronounced against him, that I am sure, and doo right well know, in your seruice would loose his lyfe, &amp; not he alone, but also all his sonnes and subiects, for the greate good wil y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> to you we haue, as it doth appeare in this ayde &amp; succour which now we haue made. And if you doo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider (high and mightie Lady) the great seruice which the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knight of the Sunne, and sonne vnto the Emperour my father, being accompanied with the Prince <hi>Don Eleno</hi> our Cousin, who is héere now present before thée. If as I saye, it were well considered, the seruice which they haue done vnto you, it wer great reason and with desart, that the error of the father should be forgiuen, if he haue committed any. And if these be not sufficient to make satisfaction, take in company with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which now at this present, was she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto thée, whereof part of it was done likewise by his sonne <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> And if it be so, that still your hart be harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the desire to take reuengement.

               <p>The Quéene had her eyes fixed on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, &amp; without
<pb facs="tcp:13973:206"/>
hauing anie power to make resistaunce against so terrible a blowe: she did shew verie plainely and cléerely what she felt in her, and giuing a great sigh which procéeded from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of her heart, she sayd: Alasse for me, O fortune, canne this be true, that that which I receiued for glorie, is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a troublesome paine. So she sayd no more, for that she was disturbed by a great noise which a damsell made, by reason of two men, who when they sawe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Rosicleer</hi> &amp; <hi>Don Eleno</hi> were occupied in talking with the quéene, they went running to put themselues into the barke of the Prince, and procured to put it from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shoare, thinking to saue their liues in rowing awaie with the Barke. And when <hi>Rosicleer</hi> sawe them, not hauing anie time to put on his helme, he carried it in his hand, and leapt out of the waggen, as light as a Hart amongest the cragged mountaines, and in a trice hée was with them, yet the strength of those two men was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to launch the barke from the shoare, the which <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> had forgotten, and for couetousnesse that he would not loose his horse, he went to disturbe them, and leapt into the Barke: he was no sooner within it, when that with his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed swiftnesse the barke began to mooue it selfe from the shoare, the which when these two men sawe, they woulde haue leapt into the water, but <hi>Rosicleer</hi> caught fast holde of the one, and staide him, but the other he could not, for that it was so quickly done. Whereas we will leaue them for to tell you of his cousin, who when he sawe that the Barke so sodeinely did departe awaie, I cannot héere declare the great heauinesse and sorow that he receiued, because he could not delight himselfe in his good companie. The like sorrowe made the Quéene (although she did procure to hide her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire) yet her sorrow was great, and because <hi>Don Eleno</hi> was the first that did begin the battaile for to set them at libertie, they did honour and worshippe him as a diuine thing.

The sighs of this Moore were so great &amp; terrible, that all the woodes and mountaines did sound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. O thou outragious and hardie Pagan, how strong and stout doest thou shew thy selfe, thou shalt quickly know and haue thy payment for these thy reuiling wordes, in subiecting thy selfe vnto them, that nowe thou doest publish for false. O Ladyes and Damsells aske reuengement of so cruell an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that with so many reasons doth reuile you all to naught. So with these lamentations the which I haue tolde you the Pagan passed awaie the night till the morning, that <hi>Apollo</hi> began with his glistering beames to couer all the earth, the which béeing séene by the Pagan, with a trise he arose vp, and tooke his horse for to prosecute his iourney begun, and lifting vp his eyes towardes the heauens, he did discouer hanging vpon a high and mightie pine apple trée which was nigh him the armour of <hi>Bramarant,</hi> which was put there for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, as hath bene tolde you in the first part of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The armour had all lost their coulour, yet for all that, it did shewe the great value of them, and looking about, he sawe the Epitaph which the two bretheren had made there. And

vnderstanding the reason thereof, it gaue him a farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to take them downe, without respecting the harme that might thereof procéed, not making anie reckoning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words that were there manifested. And for that he might the better bring to passe his pretence, he vnarmed himselfe, and climbed vpon the trée, and tooke them from the place where they wer and brought them downe, and when he was below, and saw the armour to be so good, he armed himselfe with them, and when he lacked no more to put on but his healme, he hearde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voyce of a knight which sayd: Be not so hardie thou knight as to vndoo this <hi>Tropheo,</hi> erected by the Gréeke Princes, and looke well to thy selfe for thou shalt die for the same. The Moore at the noise which he made, east his head on the one side and sawe that he that spake those words was a well set and armed knight, but for all this he did not let to make an ende of arming himselfe, and without setting his foote into the sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop he leapt into the saddle, and setteling himselfe therein hée went towards the demaunder with his sword in his hande. You shall vnderstand, that he which did threaten him was the <hi>Tartarian Zoylo,</hi> who if you do reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber departed in great hast from the amorous <hi>Tigliafa,</hi> and vnawares entered into this wildernesse, and by reason of his wearinesse in making so great hast in his trauaile, it caused him to be verie drie, and hauing great desire to drinke, he crossed héere and ther in the forrest, at last there appeared before him a verie auncient old man, who had his beard and haire all white with age, who did succour him with water, and gaue him a great cup full, &amp; with the great thirst that <hi>Zoylo</hi> had he dranke well thereof, till such time as he felt himselfe satisfied, and returned the cup againe vnto him, and when he thought to haue giuen thanks for his curtesie shewed, he was vanished cleane out of his sight, so that he sawe him no more. For you shall vnderstand that it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise <hi>Lirgandeo,</hi> which brought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup ful of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fountain of <hi>Merlin,</hi> who vnderstanding by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirst <hi>Zoilo</hi> had, brought him of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, for so mitigate his drinesse, increasing in him a new desire to the loue of <hi>Tigliafa.</hi> He had scant made an ende of drinking
<pb facs="tcp:13973:208"/>
when that he felt in himselfe a new thought of loue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting himselfe of all hatred past, béeing ouercome by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fixed in that new loue, he determined to retourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and craue pardon of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, but that cruell <hi>Atropos</hi> who had his blow readie, wold not graunt vnto him anie time for the same, neither was the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> able to deliuer him from the death. And so it fell out, that when he woulde haue made his retourne to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he chaunced to come to that place whereas <hi>Bramarant</hi> did kill himselfe, and whereas <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme himselfe, and armed himselfe againe with the armour of the <hi>Tropheo.</hi> And the valiaunt <hi>Tartarian</hi> knowing the great harme that would procéede vnto them which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to come vnto the <hi>Tropheo,</hi> he woulde giue aduisement vnto him that was so bolde to giue the attempt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée might vnderstand, that it would be demaunded at his hand. And so he did aduise <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> in that sort as you haue heard, who without anie aunswering came against him with his sword in his hand, inuiting him to mortall battaile. <hi>Zoylo</hi> who sawe his determination, did procure to defend himselfe and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his enimie. Oh my Muse, that nowe I had so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and eloquence for to set out and declare the greate harme that this daie happened in this vnfortunate Forrest. This valiant <hi>Tartarian</hi> when his enimie came vnto him, stroke him so terrible a blowe vpon the visour of his helme that with the furie thereof he made sparkles of fire to issue out thereof with great abundaunce, and to bowe downe his head vpon his breast. The Pagan did returne vnto him his salutation, and stroke him such a blowe vpon his helme, that with the great noise therof it made a sound in all the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Now began betweene them a meruailous and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full battaile, at the great noise whereof, Fortune willing to vse her extremitie, for to amplifie a farther euill, caused the Princesse. <hi>Tigliafa</hi> in the companie of her Ladyes and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells to come vnto that place whereas these knightes were, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13973:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in great anguish with her selfe. These Knights thought on no other thing, but either of them procured to bring his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie to his ende, striking at eache other suche terrible blows, and with so great fury, that many times it made ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them to loose his féeling: and both séeing the greate force of one another, were meruailously incensed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. This fierce <hi>Tartarian</hi> threw his shield at his backe, that with more force he might strike and hurt his enemie, and therewith gaue him so strong a blow vpon his helme, that all astonied he forced him to fall vpon the crupper of his horse, who carried him a great space round about the fielde, without any féeling. But when he came againe vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, this fierce <hi>Mauritanian</hi> setling himselfe in his saddle, stroke at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Tartarian</hi> so terrible a blow, that if it had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on him, it would haue turned him to much griefe, but with great discretion he cléered himselfe therof, in such sort, that it was stroken in vaine, and with great lightnesse, hee retourned, and stroke the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> so, that he made him once againe to fall vpon the crouper of his horse all astony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there appeared by the visour of his helme, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of bloud that issued out of his mouth, and his horse béeing gréuéd with that blow, stooped with his forefeete to the ground, and being amazed, with great fury he rose vp &amp; with his great kicking and flinging backwards, he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that the <hi>Tartarian</hi> could not come nigh to hurt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanian,</hi> which was the occasion that he could not haue any time for to giue him the second blowe, although he neuer left to follow him, to see if he could make an end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, which would haue made much of his part, not to haue giuen way that this fierce <hi>Mauritanian</hi> should haue retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to himselfe so quickly which was in so short time, and with so great anger, that the smoake which came from his mouth, seemed like a myst about his helme, so that almost it could not be seene. Then this furious diuell set spurres to his horse, &amp; blaspheming against his Gods, hauing his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sword very fast in his hande, he ranne towards his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who without any feare of his fury, went forth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="tcp:13973:209"/>
him, and when they met together, they discharged their blowes at once, but it fortuned that the <hi>Mauritanians</hi> blow did first fasten, with so great strength, that for all the helme which <hi>Zoylo</hi> had was so good, it was not sufficient to make defence, but that with the diuellish furie wherwith it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, it bended, in such sorte, that it brake all to péeces the scalpe of that vnhappie <hi>Tartarian,</hi> wherewith he gaue a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fall to the ground. So when the Pagon sawe his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie on the earth, with a loude voyce he sayde: Nowe shalt not thou bée he that shall disturbe mée, that I carrie not this armour with mée. This sadde and heauie Princesse when she sawe her swéete and welbeloued friende on the earth, with great suspition what was happened, beganne to wéepe bitterly. And as a Lyon who séeing before her her young Lyon euill intreated of the hunter: euen so she leapt from her Palfraie and ranne vnto her welbeloued <hi>Zoylo,</hi> and with greate spéed shée pulled off the healme from that woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded head, and with a fayre linnen cloth she wiped of the bloud from his mortall face, and when she was certaine that it was hée that cost her so déere the séeking, and that he was without lyfe, with furious madnesse she tore her attire from her head, and all to rent her golden haire, tearing it in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and retourned againe and wiped that infernall face, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such sorrowfull lamentation, that whosoeuer had seene her woulde haue bene moued to haue had compassion. Then shée tooke the head betwéene her handes, and did procure without dooing it anie harme to lifte it vp, and to put it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her lappe, and séeing for all this that there was no moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in him, she ioyned her face vnto the face of that vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Zoylo,</hi> and with sorowfull wordes shée sayd: Oh my loue, open thine eyes and beholde me, open them, I saie, and looke vppon this thy Ladie most vnfortunate, and while lyfe remaineth giue mée some contentment, if fortune be so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable: Oh my Lorde, strengthen thy selfe to looke vpon me, wherein I shall receiue such delight, that willinglye I will beare thée companie: Ah <hi>Zoylo</hi> and my onely loue, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in former time my teares were not sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime

thée in anie parte, make me satisfaction for the greate trauaile which I haue taken in séeking thée out, come nowe in death and inioye this thy vnfortunate louer, and dye not without séeing me, open these eyes and beholde mée, giue me I praie thée some comfort: Ah my Lorde, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in séeing me thou shalt receiue paine, or no, for that at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie time thou neuer delightedst in anie thing that was mine, but now I will gratifie thée in dying with thée, and séeing that in thy lyfe time I coulde not reioyce in thée, nor haue anie companie with thée, I will now in thy death séeke thée, and peraduenture thou wilt nowe haue more pittie on mée. The Princesse sorrowfull lamentations and greate wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings were such, that she almost sounded. But this discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted Ladie comming to her selfe and sawe that her loue made no appearaunce of lyfe, shée beganne againe to wipe his face, for that it was againe all to bée bathed with bloud, and with her white hande she felt his eyes and mouth and all his face and his head, till such time as shée chaunced to put her hande on the mortall wounde, and when shée knew that there was all the harme, she held her hand still, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him whether he mooued or no, with the greate feare which she had that he woulde die, without giuing her anye comfort to speake vnto her, she made a meruailous and great lamentation, and cryed out with terrible shrikes, the which did augement much heauinesse and sorrowe in them which were in companye with the Princesse, and she sayd. Ah my loue, how many troubles and great trauailes haue I passed in seeking thee, by mountaines and hils, by vallies, wilde fields and high wayes, watering them with my amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous teares, alwayes demaunding for thee, and alwayes in vaine calling thée, yet was I neuer desolate of the true loue which I bare vnto thée: Oh howe many times in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for thée, haue I bene answered by the ecko, which was vnto me great dolor and griefe, and nowe that fortune hath brought me into the same place whereas thou art, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create and reioyce my selfe with thy beutie, the same fortune

Oh cruell Fortune, I haue not deserued to be thus ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vsed at thy hands: for when I thought to be cléere of all sorrow and trouble, now I finde my selfe most afflicted therewith. Ah my Lord, séeing that in thy lyfe time thou gauest me so bitter and euill a life, for that thou didst hate &amp; abhorre me, now in thy death giue me some comfort. Open these swéete eyes and behold me, lift vp this wounded head and giue me some comfort before thou dyest. Ah <hi>Zoylo</hi> my ioye, if euer thou didst beare me any loue, it is now time to giue me to vnderstand thereof, before thy soule depart from thy body, and in saying these lamentable words, she was constrained to hold her peace, for that she saw that this wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This sad and discomforted Ladie answered: Ah <hi>Zoilo,</hi> what doest aske of me, what wouldest that I shuld giue thée, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes was thine, I haue nothing of mine owne, I am all thine, it were now a straunge thing to beginne a new to loue thée, for all that euer I could giue thée, I gaue it thee long ere this, oh my loue, why doest thou not vnderstand this: alasse what shall I saie, I that am without all good fortune, for now I sée that thy time draweth on, &amp; that my contentment, ioy, and comfort is verie short: Ah my Lord, dost thou request of me to giue thy bodie a Sepulchre: well, I see that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to séeke some to giue it vnto vs both. And without stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to procéede anie farther in spéeches, she kissed the face of her welbeloued &amp; so long desired <hi>Zoilo,</hi> with great sobbing &amp; sighs making within her selfe a terrible conflict, tarrying for the answere of her welbeloued friend, who with no lesse paine &amp; anguish of death sayd: Ah my Ladie and mistres, I do know that thou wert alwaies mine, &amp; I thine. That which I will now desire of thée, is, for that I was beloued of thée in my life time, that now in my death I may be fauoured of thée. Oh cruell loue, oh what a wish is this, a case neuer the like heard of before, that I shuld desire the death of her that so long time hath trauailed and taken paines and sorrowes with terrible wéepings and sighs for my sake. Ah my mistres, how happie shoulde I be, that thus imbracing one in the others armes we might depart together: Oh what a happie death would it be, oh swéete Fortune, I haue no other griefe with me but to leaue thée behinde me: Oh vnhappie that I am, I neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to desire thy death, but nowe, and onely for that I woulde not leaue thy companie. The Princesse béeing very much troubled with griefe and sorrowe, aunswered him and sayde: Oh my loue, therein take thou neyther griefe nor care, for héere. I dooe promise thée by the greate loue that I doe beare vnto thee, that if death doe shew himselfe any thing contrarie vnto mée, that I will procure it with mine owne handes, for that the Gods will not consent that I should liue and thou die, therefore I saye, that if hée doe contrarie mée, I will giue thee this contentment, for that without thée I shall
<pb facs="tcp:13973:211"/>
finde héere no ioye nor comfort at all for me, neyther yet any ease of this my great griefe, so that I shall thinke it for the best to loose all my ioye, and now I doe finde in my selfe that death will be my friend. Ah my swéet loue and Lord, ioyne thy face vnto mine, let vs kisse together, and let vs make our departure both together. The Prince béeing troubled with the anguish of his hastie death, sayd: Héere I doo desire thée my <hi>Tigliafa,</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firme &amp; faithfull loue which thou doest beare me, not to consent that I be the occasion, that with a cruell death thou doest finish thy life, but to sustaine &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it so long as the Gods doth permit the same, and when that I am dead (which shall be verie quickly) let me receiue this fauour at thy handes, that thou wouldest vouchsafe to giue a Sepulchre vnto this my bodie, for with great ease and comfort shall I depart, séeing that I die in the armes of my Ladie and mistres, and a greate deale more comfort shall I receiue if I knew of a certaintie that thou woldest performe this, that I doe craue and desire at thy hands: Oh my loue, doe not denie this my supplication, and for that I am certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that thou wilt performe the same, héere I take my leaue of thée, farewell, the Gods preserue thée, and take me to theyr mercies. And when he sayde these wordes, he inclined his necke vpon the face of the Princesse. When this sorrowfull Ladie sawe that the soule had got the victorie and departed from the bodie, she kissed the mouth of the dead bodie, and giuing déepe and dolorous sighes, she beganne a meruailous and heauie lamentation, calling her selfe vnhappie and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and laide her selfe vppon the dead bodie, cursing her selfe so that it was lamentable to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

griefe, which procéeded from the bottome of her heart, and sayde: Ah my good friend, what small benefite haue I recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for all my trauaile and paine, the which I haue suffered in séeking of thée, and nowe in finding of thée it is the more for my griefe, for that I came to sée thée die: Ah most vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie that I am, where was I when I sawe descend vpon thée that mortall sworde? Whereon was my thought? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did I stand still, and did not with great lightnesse make resistaunce against that terrible blowe? And if my strength woulde not haue serued me, yet at the least I shoulde haue borne thée companie: Ah you furious beastes, that now are hidde in your dennes and déepe caues, where are you nowe? Why doe you not come and take pittie of my griefe, and put remedie therein, in taking awaie my life, for in so doing you shall shewe your selues pittifull, for that I doe abhorre this dolorous lyfe. Yet she did not forget the promise the which she made vnto her welbeloued <hi>Zoylo,</hi> which was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that she did somewhat cease her lamentation. And taking vnto her selfe more courage then her dolorous griefe did consent vnto. With the helpe of her Damselles, she put the dead bodie vnder that greate and mightie Pine apple trée, where the armour did hang, commanding some of those that were with her, that they should goe vnto those villages that wer nigh at hand, to cause some people to come thether, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

owne libertie, whether he would, without gouerning him. So his horse brought him into a great plaine, where a farre off he discouered an armed Tent pitched, which séemed to be faire and rich, and by it vpon the gréene grasse, ther lay foure great Gyants, who had in the midst among them, a verye faire Damsell, who was very heauie and sorrowfull, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her chéeke vpon her hand. The Pagan being nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Giants, did kéepe his way, till such time as hée came whereas the Giants were laid, and he came so nigh, that he might sée the face of the Damsell, which séemed not to be any humane creature, by reason of her excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, with hir golde yeolow haire dispersed all vpon her backe, and her Lilly white hand whereon she leaned her chéeke, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering her faire face, with her eyes shut, which showed her well set browes, from vnder which, distilled many toares which séemed to be orientall pearles, dispersed vpon her faire and white face, and sundry times giuing déep and sorrowfull sighes, which declared the great paine and griefe that she did suffer.

The Gyaunt with greate pride put himselfe on foote, and in lacing and making fast his helme, he sayd. My sword shall wholly and fully certifie thée, of all that which thou dost demaund, and in speaking these words, the one pressed towards the other. But the Pagan for that he would not that he should kill his horse, was constrained to put himselfe somewhat on the one side, and lighting from the saddle, he lefte his horse alone, and layde hold vppon his sword, wherewith his enimie stroke at him a mightie &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blow, who with a strange lightnesse caused it to be stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vaine, in stepping on the one side, and therewith hée closed with the Giant, and threw at his breast so terrible &amp; strong a foyne, that his armour was not sufficient for to make resistaunce, but that the fury thereof must be executed, and pearced him thorough vnto the backe, wherewith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant gaue a terrible fal to the ground, at which noyse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other thrée Giants did awake, and one of them put himself quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on foote, and without tarrying for to put on his healme, or to take his shield, but blaspheming against his Gods, he ran against the Pagan, who abode his comming with such like courage, as his presumption did require. The Giaunt with both his hands, stroke at him so monstrous a blow, that if it had chaunced on him, it would haue put his life in great ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie.

And therewith the other Gyant lyke a furious Lyon blaspheming against his cursed Gods, not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to arme himselfe with more armour then at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent he had, for that there they were all with their healmes vnlased and from their heads, he tooke holde of a great &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie club that was there with both his hands, and pressed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a large pace against the Pagan, with determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take reuengement of the others death, but this young furious <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> did tarrie and receiue him with his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed courage and valiauntnesse, the fearefull Gyaunt did strike at him so terrible a blow with his club, that swinging with it in the aire it made a fearefull sounde, but the Pagan, who without all feare did abide the comming of the blowe, determined with himselfe to let it passe in vaine, as hee hadde all the rest before, and so it fell out, that when he sawe the blowe descend he stepped on the one side, in such sort, that the club fell to the ground, with so terrible a waight &amp; strength, that the blowe made all the trées that were nigh at hande to tremble. This terrible blowe was no sooner passed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth when that this valiant Mauritanian stroke a blowe at his armes, which was with so great strength, that he cut them both off by the wristes, and his hands béeing fast to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> club, they fell all to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. The Gyant who felt himselfe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; lame, would haue imbraced with the Pagan, thinking by his great strength to haue crushed him to death, but this <hi>Mauritanian</hi> with great valiantnesse did put himselfe before him, his sword in his hand with the point forwardes, so that the Gyant (with the great paine that he felt of his wounds, and the great anger he had in his heart,) without anie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration he pressed himselfe forwardes, &amp; the Pagan followed in his determination in such sort, that the sword entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gyants bodie vp to the hard hilts, falling downe dead to the ground, with no lesse noise then the rest. Then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth Gyant which remained, did put himselfe on foote, who was
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13973:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a greater and huger stature and bignesse then the other which were dead, and taking in his hand a great and mighty speare which laie on the ground by him, with a terrible and fearefull voice he sayd: O thou infernall diuell, for that thou canst not be other, séeing thou hast slaine my three compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for I tell thée that the Gods in the heauens did tremble for feare of them. Héere I doe promise thée that thou shalt not depart without thy reward and punishment, neyther I without taking vengeaunce of thée. The valiant Moore who verie well heard and vnderstoode his wordes, made little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his proude spéech, but sayd: Make an end thou furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diuell and come vnto the battaile, delaie not I saye, that thou mayst beare these thy companions companie. Then the Gyant lifted vp his arme aboue his head, hauing fast in his hande that greate and mightie Speare, which was all full of knots, with the barke remaining still thereon, and threw it at him with so great strength, that it made a meruailous sound in the aire, but this valyant Mauritanian was not without great care of the comming thereof, but with a counter pace he put himselfe on the one side, with so greate pollicie, that the blowe passed on the one side, and the Speare stuck fast in the ground, and by reason of the greate force wherewith it was throwen, it made it to shake as though it would haue flowen in a thousand péeces, and turning round like a Snake when she doth make hast to goe awaie from him that woulde kill her. Then the strong and stout Mauritanian being very ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to sée so great villanie, he ranne vnto the speare, and with great strength he pulled it out of the ground, and in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it againe at the gyant, he said: O thou furious beast, take vnto thée thy dart. It did wel appeare that it was not throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by a sluggish arme, for that by reason of the great strength striking on his shéeld it pearced it through, yet it did not ther remaine, but likewise pearced his armour and shirt of maile and neuer stayed till such time as it shewed it selfe at his backe all to be bathed with bloud, wherewith the Gyant fell downe dead to the ground, whose fall was so terrible that it made the earth tremble, and all the trées that were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

The valyaunt Moore did pull of his healme, and did discouer his face, which did represent a great maiestie &amp; seueritie, such as his state did require, and although he was of a great stature &amp; bignesse of bodie, yet his faire face did giue greate delight vnto all them that did beholde it, and when he came nigh vnto the faire la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, he knéeled downe on the ground and said: Faire Ladie, I know not whether you are discontented, or haue receiued a small benefit or seruice in this which I haue done, but of this be you assured, that my determined thought was to doe you seruice, beléeuing that so faire a Ladie shoulde not with her good will keepe companie with so monstrous people: she with with great curtesie did aunswere him &amp; sayd: Gentle knight I cannot denie but that I was constrained by force to kéepe companie with these proude and ill conditioned Gyants, and much lesse can I kéepe in secret the great ioy which I haue to finde my selfe at libertie and cléere from them, but one thing there is which I doe greatly feare, that is, that nowe I falling into thy hands and power, I dread to come into a new prison, therefore I beséech you to giue me frée libertie, with the seguritie which belongeth vnto my honour. The Pagan who was verie attentiue vnto the words of the Ladie, would haue made her answere, but this faire lady did disturbe him, desiring him first to sit downe by her, for that she was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that with the great trauaile which he had taken in the battaile with the Gyants, it could not be but that he was wearie, and therewith taking him fast by both the hands she made him to sit downe, to whom <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> sayd: Ah fayre Ladie if I did knowe that my heart were as frée and cléere of your loue, as you are sure of me for offering you anie vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then with great reason I might account my selfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, as well in the doing of your seruice, as in giuing you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, but I am he Ladie that must aske libertie of your beautie, desiring you not to haue anie doubt of me. So with

déepe &amp; sorrowful sighs this Moore did giue her to vnderstand how his troubled heart was tormented with excessiue loue. The Ladie when she vnderstoode and knewe that she had of him so sure a pawne, was nothing discontent with all, for that he séemed vnto her to be a knight of a verie good disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of great value, more then anie other, and for that he shuld receiue some contentment, she answered and sayd: Sir, I am verie well satisfied, that a knight in whom is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended so great beautie, cannot be without the curtesie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in so worthie a warriour, for the which cause I doe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate and put all my honour into your handes, and beléeue me that time shall not lacke to put remedie in this your new griefe and paine, without incurring vnto my selfe anie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, but to maintaine and kéepe my honour, as belongeth vnto the royall bloud from whence I do descend, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time gentle knight, I would craue one boone at your hands, which in telling you I would not haue it denied me: Oh how great was the ioye that this valyant Pagan receiued when he vnderstoode so good hope which she pronounced vnto him, and therewith he turned vnto the Ladie, and whether shée would or not, he kissed her hands, with great thanks for the grace and fauour which she shewed him, and therewith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remembring the wordes which passed by the Nymph at the riuer, he sayd vnto himselfe: How is it that not long since I made a mocke and a iest of the aduice the which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan me, and now I doo sée that I made a mocke &amp; a iest of the aduice which is turned into good earnest. And in saying these words he returned vnto the Ladie and sayde: What is that faire Ladie that I should binde my selfe vnto you to do, nay what is it, that lying in my power to accomplish, I woulde not do, being wholy yours, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> my heart is your prisoner, &amp; my libertie subiect to your wil, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you shuld desire the graunt of me, but commaund me to fulfil all your will and request, but yet fayre Ladie, before that you doe procéede to your request, I doe desire you that I maye know the occasion of your kéeping companie and trauailing with these foure furious Gyants in this Countrie of <hi>Grecia.</hi>

This wil I declare vnto you with a verie good will answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this fayre Ladie. You shall vnderstand that I am daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto the king of the Ilandes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> my parents had no more daughters but I alone, the which was the occasion that I was the more made off and estéemed of them. And by reason of my beutie, they put me into a strong tower, which was nigh the sea side, whereout many times for my recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I issued in companie with many Ladyes and Damsells, which were with me to beare me companie: so it chaunced one day when I was abroad in my accustomed recreation &amp; sport, I was beset with this infernall companie, who carried me into their mightie and strong shippe in this order as you doe sée me, whereas I did no other thing but lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my sadde and heauie misfortune. So the first Gyaunt which you did kill, séeing me make so great lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation, with louing and amorous wordes did procure to comfort me, and did offer me, that all which was my will to be done, he wold fulfill the same, and I séeing his greate curtesie, and agayne, that my remedie was so farre from me, vpon a sodaine ther came a thought into my minde, which I supposed to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good and requisite for to redresse my harme &amp; griefe, and I desired of him to graunt me a boone, this gyant did graunt me my request, and the rest did promise to fulfill all that I would aske them, and my demaund was, that they shoulde carrie me vnto <hi>Grecia,</hi> vnto the court of the Emperour <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio,</hi> and that they should for the space of twentie dayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my beautie and fairenesse, making a challenge agaynst all other. These Gyants by reason of theyr great pride, didde thinke it good to accomplish my request, the which they did graunt vnto me in such sort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no other thing coulde disturbe them.

fortune, or their great pride I know not, that wold not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that they should come thether, but first they should heere end their dayes. And being in this discourse, they saw a great number of people comming towardes them, which séemed to be householde seruants or such like, who came with all theyr beastes laden with victualls and other necessaries, who were all seruants vnto those Gyaunts, and when they came nigh the place and sawe that wonderful spectacle of their masters: euen as you sée the small birdes howe they will hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues amongest the bushes, briers, and thicke trées, from the sight of anie rauenous foule: euen so did all these seruants of those vile Gyaunts, hide themselues in the thickest of the woods and mountaines of the Forrest, fearing the like inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. This valiant Moore when he sawe the sodaine fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, without hauing anie care of them, and making little reckoning, he tooke that gentle Ladie in his armes and set her vpon her palfraie, and he himselfe without putting foot in his stirop, leapt vpon his horse backe with great lightnes, and tooke their iourney towards the place whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others had left their ship, into the which he entered with great spéed verie ioyfull of his good hap, &amp; straight waie he commanded to hoise vp their sailes, &amp; to take the waie towards <hi>Maurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> whereas we will leaue them for to tell you the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment that the valiant knight <hi>Claridiano</hi> had, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his long tarrying in the Iland of <hi>Trapobana.</hi> O om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God, I doe desire thée to giue me wisdome &amp; discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to declare the great worthinesse of this young knight, for without thy helpe I do not finde my selfe able for to set forth so many and so meruailous feates of armes as was done by this worthie knight, as in this chapter following and in all the rest shall be declared.</p>

This young knight thought the time to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie long, which was the occasion that he was verie sadde and sorrowfull, in such sort, that his fayre and beautifull face had lost part of his naturall and liuely coulour, and dayly hée did exercise himselfe in no other thing but to goe to the sea side, and there to set himselfe vpon a rocke, hauing no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation but to beholde how the water with greate furie and force did strike and beate vpon the sayd rocke. So after long time vsing this disport, it chanced on a daie at such time as the Sunne had made an ende of his iourney, hée saw at the foote of that Rocke a Dwarfe, who with an outragious and irefull voyce sayde: <hi>Don Claridiano</hi> of <hi>Grecia,</hi> what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou thinke that the hardnesse of that Rocke is sufficient to blaze thy fame and to get vnto thée honour?

had no sooner made an ende of his spéeches, but that vppon a sodaine hée vanished cleane awaie, and was not anie more séene. The sorrowe and heauinesse was verie much which the Prince then felt in himselfe, in hearing the wordes and reasons of the Dwarfe, and the more, when that hée vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode that hée was not sonne vnto him whome he alwaies thought he had béene, the which caused his courage greatly to alter within him, and made him to saie: Unfortunate that I am, what doe I make héere amongest those which are not of my lignage, I had thought for certainetie that I had beene with my Father and kindred, and nowe I doe sée that it is to the contrarie, and that I am kept in this Ilande lyke a weake and sillie woman: O <hi>Galtenor,</hi> séeing that it was thy pleasure that by my handes thou shouldest bée restored vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy kingdome, and for that effect thou hast had mée he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in thy kéeping: Why doest thou now consent that my fame perish and decaie, I remaining in this Ilande<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall <hi>Mars,</hi> to thée I do inuocate, that being by thée holpen and with thy fauour I may stretch forth the bright beame, which with thy partiall hande thou gauest me. So vttering these and such like complaints, he passed a few dayes, till that vpon a certaine daye, following his accustomed exercise, hée saw comming towards the shore a Foyst, which was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with foure marriners, and beholding who was therein, he saw come from vnder the hatches, a very faire Damosell, who was all apparailed with mourning apparaile, and with her two auncient Squires, who led her by the armes, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>railed in the same manner and guise. This Ladies face was all to bedewed with teares, and her countenaunce did declare and showe, that she suffered great sorrow and anguish. This valyaunt and worthy young knight very desirous to know the occasion of her greate lamentation, mooued himselfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and hauing saluted her, he desired her if it were her plesure, to declare vnto him the occasion of hir complaint.

This sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ladie séeing her good fortune would not loose the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but with a new lamentation and complaint shée knéeled downe before him and kissed his handes for the great offers which he made vnto her, the Prince did take her vp from the ground with great reuerence, then the Ladie with amorous wordes sayde. If that by the occasion of king <hi>Delfo</hi> (gentle knight) we shall receiue anie disturbaunce: héere I doe desire thée by the honour which thou dost owe vnto all vertue, that we make no farther delaie nor detainment, for héere I doe giue you to vnderstande that there remaineth but a small time for the remedying of my sorrowe and griefe.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>What shall I saie of the king <hi>Delfo</hi> and the Princes nurse, when they could not heare of the Prince what was become of him, but onely that he was departed awaie. But if I did not put before me the great duetie which I do owe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the grauitie of a Prince, I might saie that he did things more lyker a mad man, then a Prince, &amp; surely he had great reason, for he had lost the companie of the best knight in all the world: so this warlyke Gréeke did saile vppon the Sea with an indifferent thought, béeing in companie with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faire Ladie who likewise went verie well content, for that with so great ease she had found and obtained him that she sought for. But this I can certifie you of <hi>Claridiano,</hi> that he had not forgot y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words which the dwarfe had tolde him, but alwaies remembring the same, it put him in great confusion, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did not remember to demand of the Damsel the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of her griefe, who with such dilligence went to seeke him. At such time as <hi>Diana</hi> did spred abroad her golden haire ouer all those troublesome waters, he discouered that there came towards them a barke, in such hast, that in a smal time they were come vnto them, the which barke came without anie gouernment, and he sawe sitting on the poope of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barke a gyant, who had his head and beard verie white, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with roabes of estate, who was straight wayes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by <hi>Claridiano</hi> to be <hi>Galtenor,</hi> for the which he receiued great ioy. When the barkes were ioyned together <hi>Galtenor</hi> went and imbraced the Prince, saying: Sonne do not thinke to depart awaie in such sort, but that first I will reioyce my selfe with the presence, for it shal be more profitable vnto thée then thou doest thinke for, as well for the remedie and ease of thy thought, as for the adorning and sauegard of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. To whom the Prince aunswered and sayd: I do verie well know my Lord, that from you can procéede nothing but that which is good, as alwaies hath bene the vse and custome hetherto. Then the Gyant sayd vnto him: This thou maist perfectly beléeue, that so long as my soule is ioyned and knit with my bodie, that it shall not exercise it selfe in anie other thing but in thy seruice. And now for that thou stand est in

Also I doo bring thée a meruailous precious sword, forged and made by my great skill, such a one as in all the worlde there is not a better. And this shall continue &amp; indure with thée, till such time as thou shalt be in battaile with the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Lyon, then shall it loose his vertue and valor, for that thou shalt recouer another of no lesse price, and of a greater fame, ioyntly with thy honor in the acknowledging of thy vnknowen parents, and in that time thou shalt loose all thy seruice, that euer thou hast done in the honour of <hi>Cupide,</hi> béeing in company with the disguised Hinde, all though alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thou shalt not loose thy great loue, till such time as by the Goddesse <hi>Venus</hi> shal be throwen at thée the <hi>African</hi> launce, which shall pearce thy heart cleane through. Then did he declare vnto him, how he was stoln out from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lap, certefieng him that he was sonne vnto the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Emperour in all the world: but more light then this, hée would not giue him, neither the place wheras his sister was lost, and therwith he tooke out from vnder the hatches of the barke, a fardle which was bound vp, the which he did dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto the Marriners, that they should laye it vp safe, and imbrace him againe with great loue, and put vpon the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the heart, on his left hand, a King, which had in it a precious Diamond, that was of so great cléernesse, that in a darke night it gaue as great a light wher it was, as though a torch were lighted. This did he straightly charge him to kéepe, for that it was of so great vertue, that so long time as he had it about him there was no inchauntment that should hurt him. This excellent young Knight woulde haue sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered greate thankes for his precious giftes, but at such time as he wold haue giuen it, <hi>Galtenor</hi> was departed vpon a sodaine a greate space from them, who made so much hast, that in a verie small time he lost the sight of him. This young knight remayned with greate contentment, in knowing that hée did descende from so high a generation:

and lykewise for the succour he receiued in the armour hée had brought him, the which he commaunded to bée very well kept till such time as occasion shoulde serue that he had néede of them: in this sort he passed away all the nighte, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the wordes of <hi>Galtenor.</hi> So the next morning this young knight sitting on the poope of the Foyst, with this faire Lady, he requested her to tell him the whole occasion of her comming to séeke for him. The which this Lady with great lamentation began to tell him, saying. Gentle Knight you shall vnderstand that I am daughter vnto the King of <hi>Mesapotamia,</hi> which is a prouince scituated betwéen the two great riuers <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris.</hi> Of long time was I of him welbeloued and made very much on, till such time as my fathers Court was in great heauinesse, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could not heare any newes of a brother of mine, who was prince of that kingdome, whose absence at this time is verye grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto me. There came from the other side of the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> a prince, whose dominion was ouer the Prouince <hi>Palestina.</hi> He was the proudest and arrogantest Knight that euer hath bene séene, in such sort, that by reason of his fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he was not onely feared of them, who of dutie did owe it him, but also of all the Prouinces that ioyned with his kingdome, which extended from that riuer vnto the mayne sea of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> the mount <hi>Libano, Gamogenia,</hi> and the high and mightie cragged rockes and mountaines <hi>Nabateos.</hi> To conclude, almost all <hi>Asia</hi> did tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at his furie.

So like wise came thether the Prince of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> a Knight of great price, and adorned with many vertues, vnto whom I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes showed a better countenaunce, and made acceptation of his seruice.</p>

The departing of the Prince was verie gréeuous vnto the Princes <hi>Antemisca,</hi> and she vnderstanding that it was in vaine to say to the contrarie by reason of his determination she pretended to beare him companie, and sayd vnto him.

This couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous knight when he sawe himselfe alone (after that hée had left the Princesse) with great hast he put himselfe into the caue, and going about from one place to another, he chanced into a great hall, which was made in manner like vnto a great court, sauing the place where the light entered, was a a louer hole, which was in the middest thereof, and going round about the same, he chaunced into a place where manie bones &amp; skulls of dead men were, which did amaze much the Prince, and caused in him a newe desire to knowe what it should be. And going farther in where the light shewed most, he sawe where was a woman laide along vpon a bed, who was the most deformedst person that could be séene, and by her laie a young child which séemed to be of a yeare olde, who was of the stature of a meane man, and on the one side hée sawe a doore, which was verie strong and all of yron, out of the which came forth that sorrowfull voyce.

it did profit him much, for so soone as the arrow did strike on it, it recoyled backe againe a great waie, at this present time did the knight finde himselfe in greate perill and daunger, for that he must make his defence against that infernall monster, and likewise against that diuellysh and furious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who continually assaulted him with her arrowes, and then he could not profit himselfe of his force and strength, but onely of his great lightnesse, shunning the furie of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie blowes, so by little and little he drew nigh vnto the place whereas the Gyauntesse was, who hauing spent all her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, she tooke in her hande a mightie clubbe and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her furious husband to helpe him. This valyaunt Gréeke founde himselfe in greate extremitie, and with the greate anger which he had, it changed his eyes into sanguine coulour, and was determined to cléere himselfe of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall woman, and with that purpose he tourned towardes her, and letting her blowe to passe by, he stepped in to her on the left side, and thrust so terrible a foine at her brest, that his swoord entered in vp to the hard hiltes, and she fell downe dead to the ground. The Gyaunt who at that instaunt was not idle, stroke the Gréeke such a monstrous blowe vppon his backe, that hée ouerthrewe him to the grounde as dear, without anie remembraunce or token of moouing, the Gyant seeing him in this case threw from him his clubbe, and tooke the knight in his furious nayles, and with the greate rage and wrath which hée had he woulde haue eaten him vp at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> instaunt, but it fell not out with him as he thought it would, for that hée found the armour which hée had on was verye harde, and when the Gyaunt sawe that his sharpe téeth did lyttle profite him, hee beganne to tumble and toosse him vp and downe from one place to another, and by reason that he was not expert in the lacinges and buckeling of armour, hée did nothing but tumble and tosse him héere and there, to sée if hée coulde finde a place where hée might beginne to teare him in péeces. Whosoeuer should at that instaunt haue seene the greate affliction of those two Damosells, might verye well haue iudged in himselfe the anguish and sorrowe

which they receiued, iudging themselues to be wholly lost &amp; destroyed. But the Princesse <hi>Antemisca,</hi> lifted vp her eyes vnto heauen and sayd. I doo sée O <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that thou art very well pleased, that I doo suffer this grieuous pain and sorow. Ah Fortune, it is now great reason to leaue me, and not to persecute me any farther, and if it be so, that as yet thou hast not accomplished thy whole desire. Oh <hi>Iupiter</hi> make sharpe thy cutting sword, and therewith take awaye my life. Oh <hi>Mars,</hi> behold that now thy strength doth faile, if thou dost permit that this Knight doo perish. O what woman amongst all women hath bene so infortunate as I? Oh Gods, I doo not know wherefore you doo thus persecute me, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue bene alwayes obedient vnto you, and now séeing that you had giuen me a Knight for to be my defence, (against y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust cause, which was laid against me) you shoulde likewise haue suffered me to giue testimonie of my truth, and theyr false accusation? Oh thou chast Goddesse, be fauourable vnto me, séeing that <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath forgotten me, turne and take my cause vpon thée, and be fauourable, for that I neuer offended thée. These and such like complaintes vttered this afflicted Princesse, and hauing concluded, the Prince was come again to himselfe and recouered his memorie, and séeing himselfe in that perplexitie, he did procure by all meanes and pollicie to cléere himselfe out of the Gyants clawes, and béeing cléere hée put himselfe on foote, and recouered againe his swoord, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming against the smal power of his Gods, and was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailously kindled with wrath and anger, the Gyant likewise recouered his mightie club, and stroke at the Prince a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie blow, who séeing it comming did procure to cléere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the furie thereof, and letting it passe, he stepped in to the Gyant, and stroke at him so terrible a blowe on the wast, that it little did profit anie defence that he had, but that his mightie sword must needs cut him a sunder in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of his body, and he fell a sunder, each part from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other dead to the ground.

This worthie Gréeke was in a great confusion, yet he did not let to go first to one and then to another, comforting them, and made them to ride a pace, which they might doe verie well, for that their their horses were not so vnprouided as the masters, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the goodly grasse that was there in those woods, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they filled themselues euerie night. The Sunne had well passed two partes of her iourney when they came into a great field verie plaine, and in the middest of it was a lyttle mountaine, out of the which there appeared smoake to come forth, which gaue them to vnderstand that there shoulde bée fire in that place.

The Prince when he sawe him stayed his horse and sayde: Holde thy hand thou furious Gyant and staie, for that I haue not procured thée anie euill, but rather I doe desire thée that of thine owne free will thou wouldest giue vs whatsoeuer thy pleasure is to bestow vpon vs: O man of small valour, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Gyant, what dost thou thinke by craft and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie to aduantage thy selfe of me: Well, for that thou shalt sée how little I doe estéeme thee, tarrie a while, for with my fists and buffets I will beate out thy braines, without the helpe of my club. And in saying these wordes he threwe his heauie club from him, and came towardes the Prince with his fist bent for to strike him, in the like sorte did this noble warriour, and for to strike him at his ease he was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to raise vp himselfe in his stirops, otherwise he could not reach his head, but yet he lent him so terrible a blowe vpon the forehad, that he droue the bone to the braines, and beeing therewith amazed he fell downe to the ground, and with the great force and strength that he put to strike that blowe, it lacked little that he fell not from his horse, but incontinent he stroke him againe the second blowe, wherewith he made an end to beate out his braines, and there remayned dead. The Prince was greatly amazed in beholding him, for as he lay along vpon the ground he séemed to be a greate Oake blowen downe with the winde, the knight could not refraine himselfe but that he must néedes laugh, and sayd: Of truth I am a notable guest, for that before I doe enter into my

lodging, I doo paye the shot. At this instant the Ladies came to that place, with as much ioy at that present, as before they were sad and sorrowfull. When the Princes <hi>Antemisca</hi> did see the greatnesse of the Gyant, and the deformitie of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, she sayd vnto the Prince: If thou shouldest giue like payment (worthy <hi>Trapobanian</hi>) vnto all them that should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thée for guest, I doo not know, nor I cannot beléeue, that they woulde take the paine to serue them that shoulde come after thée.

Then sayd the Gentlewoman that was released out of prison, if I had not feared a farther perill, with the great ioye which I receiued when I sawe him fall downe, I promise you I could haue laughed hartely, to sée how he trauailed to catch holde of you.

I doo promise you of my faith Ladies sayd <hi>Libernio,</hi> with greate feare that I had, to haue receiued some knocke or blowe, I neither receiued pleasure in the one, nor griefe in the other. Then the Princesse said vnto the Gentlewoman her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it shall be better for vs to goe and sée, what victualles, our host hath prepared for vs to eate, for the good hope that I haue to prooue of that which he hath ordayned for vs,

And entring therein they saw that he had put to rost a whole Déere, which was a very great one, and séeing that which should giue them comfort, euery one of them fell to worke, hoping for their trauaile to eate part of that déere. The olde Squire tourned the spit, and the Ladyes made the fire, and the Prince pulled out coales, so that there was none idle, in hope of the benefit to come: and with the great hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they had, and desire to eate, that when the déere was scant hot on the spit, they thought it ouer rosted and halfe burned, likewise they procured to sée if they could finde any breade. <hi>Claridiano</hi> descended into a roome, he had vnder the caue, whereas he found two great loues, so great in compasse as the cyrbe of a well, and two great flagons full of béere, with great ioy and pleasure the Prince came forth out of the caue, and for to giue contentment vnto the Ladyes, he brought it forth, &amp; shewed them what he had found. And when the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies saw so good prouision, they made hast of the déere, and hauing nothing wherewith to cut their victualls, the Prince vsed his sword at that time in stéed of a knife. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince and the Ladies began to cut and to eate at their will: but <hi>Libernio</hi> by reason that he was occupied in tourning and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, he could not profit himselfe with his hands for to eate, and when he saw, that the déere was almost halfe eaten, hée sayd.

Who be you that doo saye, that you haue passed the Mountaynes <hi>Nabateos,</hi> without anye perill to your persons. To whom <hi>Claridiano</hi> sayde, We are straungers, whose fortune hath brought vs hether, and we do desire thée to doe vs to much pleasure as to receiue vs into your castell this night, that we may take some rest: Friends, aunswered the knight of the Castell, we are héere so feared with a grat diuell, whose habitation is in the height of the mountaine, that not onely in the night, we dare not open our gates, but also we keepe them shut all day. Who is this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so much trouble and vexe you, sayd <hi>Libernio.</hi> The Knight sayd. A mightie great Giant, and of a maruelous height, &amp; formed like vnto a diuell. I doo sweare vnto thée by <hi>Iupiter</hi> sayd <hi>Libernio,</hi> that from this daie forwards thou néedest not to feare him, for that this daie verie much against his will we were his guests, &amp; did eate of that which he ordeined for himself, paying first for our victuals with two buffets, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he lost his life. When the Lorde of the Castell heard this he commaunded the gates to be opened, although with

some feare, for that he was not certaine of that he had heard spoken. But when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight &amp; his company were within the Castle, he commanded that the gate shuld be shut again: so they altogether entred into a faire &amp; large court, &amp; were by the Lord of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Castle receiued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great loue, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

We shall quickly sée whether it be true or not, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euerie night this diuell commeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giuing terrible shrikes, &amp; for that he should quickly depart, I doo command to throw him prouision, out at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest window of this Castle, and yet he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therewith by reason of his great pride, but he is so euill inclined, that if he méet anie of our people he pardoneth none, but killeth them.

So when they had made an end of their supper, for to passe away the time, till they should goe to take theyr rest,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:233"/>
The Prince sayd vnto the Ladie which he released out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: It shall be good faire Ladie now that you are at liberty and out of all daunger, that you doe tell vs the occasion of your imprisonment, and how it hath bene, if so be that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring doth not trouble you. The Damsell aunswered: Of truth my Lord, this will I doe with a verie good will, and if it were but onely for to giue you contentment, and it is great reason and iustice, for that you did put your person in greate daunger for my deliueraunce: You shall vnderstand, gentle knight, that along the huge and mightie riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> towards the Orientall partes, there is a mightie Citie called <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> the which is not far from the head of the said ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, on the other side of the riuer towards the Sunne setting is there another Citie called <hi>Sabiosa,</hi> of these and of other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and townes there about, my Father is king and Lorde euer. The Gods who were so pleased for to inrich mée, not onely of goods, but also of beautie &amp; fairenesse, more then anie other in all the kingdome, or in a great part there abouts, the fame of my great beautie was published in all places, which was the occasion that there repaired vnto my fathers Court many Lords &amp; knights of great estimation, amongst whome there came one young knight and a straunger, who was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall of the kingdome of <hi>Tigliafa,</hi> and Lord of the Citye of <hi>Zina,</hi> and he béeing in loue with me and I lykewise of him, and before that eyther of vs could manifest our loue the one vnto the other, ther passed a long time, but onely by our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards showes, we did declare each to other the abundance of our hearts and signes of loue, the which indured many daies.

and her daughter. And when they were all past by, the prince <hi>Claridiano</hi> turned vnto his former iourney, it was not long after that there came a Damsell towards him with as great hast as euer she could make her palfraie to goe, and when she came nigh vnto him, she did salute him verie curteously, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Knight of the Ladyes, <hi>Don Petildo</hi> Earle of the déepe Lake doth send me vnto thée, to aske thée what was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that thou diddest apart thy selfe out of the waie, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering they were men which did passe by, whether thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest it for that thou wouldest not iust with them, he sayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou maist goe whether thy pleasure is, neuerthelesse if that there be in thée so much valour as doth appeare by thy dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, he would be verie glad to breake a speare with thée in the seruice of his Ladie. To whom the Prince sayd: Fayre Damsell and friend, I woulde be verie gladde to satisfie this his request, if that I did finde my selfe subiect to loue, as it doth appeare that he is, therefore tell vnto this knight that I haue no will to iust neyther to be in loue. Then the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell sayd: I doe well beléeue, that it is more thy will to take thy ease and rest, then to take anie paines, and this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause that thou wilt be cléere from amorous delights, and so she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with this aunswere, and when she hadde tolde them, ther was a great laughter amongst them, in mocking of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano,</hi> &amp; determined amongst themselues to send the damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell backe againe, to tell him, for that he was not determined to iust in the seruice of his Ladyes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would iust with one of those knights, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it doth touch much the order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and is also his dutie, with condition that if he be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, onely to loose his armour, for that it séemeth vnto vs to be verie good, &amp; if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other be ouercome, likewise to loose his armour, &amp; when the damsel had declared her message, <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano</hi> answered: Faire damsel, tel those knights y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am not determined to iust, neither with condition nor without, for if I shuld loose my armor, I shuld not so quickly get other, &amp; if they haue such a desire to iust, in <hi>Nabatea</hi> they shal find them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will accomplish their desire by iustice: Cursed be these thy excuses, sayd the damsell, which are so much to thy dishonor,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13973:235"/>
how ill is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rich armour bestowed on thée, it is not without cause I perceiue, that they are so whole vppon thy bodie, for thou doest shew that thy warre is more with wordes then with armes and feates of knighthood. Let it be what it will be, sayd <hi>Claridiano,</hi> for I will not meddle in this iust. Well, adew knight of small reputation, said the Damsell, happie be those Ladies that doth trauaile with such a kéeper and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and therewith she returned backe to her companie, but the Ladies that were with <hi>Claridiano</hi> made great laughter, for that they were certified of the valour of their knight, what he was, but <hi>Fidelio</hi> when he heard the excuses of his master, thought verilie that he did it for feare, and for this cause hée was verie heauie and sadde, and the Ladies perceiuing, had thereat greate pleasure and sport. So trauailing forwards, they came vnto a bridge which was ouer the riuer <hi>Tygris,</hi> &amp; on the other side there was a Tent armed which was verie rich, wherein was a knight armed which did defend that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and there were set vp against a trée a greate number of Speares, and when the dutchesse with all her knights &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie entered the bridge, there appeared vnto them a knight of a gentle disposition, who with great lightnesse leapt vpon his horse, and sent a Squire vnto them to tell them that they could not passe that waie, but first they should confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be ouercome by the best knight of all the world, but if they will stand vnto the iust, he that receiueth the foyle to loose both his horse and armour, so in a trice they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in order, at which time the Prince <hi>Claridiano</hi> came vnto that place, and when he sawe that they did make readie and addresse themselues vnto the iust, hee stayed on the one side whereas he might verie well at his pleasure see them. It so fell out, that in twentie iusts all these twentie knights were ouerthrowen and fayled, at which the Dutchesse recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued great sorrow and griefe, and sent the same damsel (which the other had sent before) vnto the Prince, and when she came vnto him, she sayd: Knight, enimie vnto iusts and trauaile, my Ladie, the dutchesse of the valley doth desire thée, for that it was not thy pleasure for her knights to shew thy bounty,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:236"/>
that now at her request thou wouldest make frée this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, &amp; do that which her knights could not. Friend sayd <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano,</hi> goe and tell vnto thy Ladie the Dutchesse, that I will procure to make the way sure for me and my companie, and will her highnesse likewise to bring knights that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende her, as well as they can with theyr scoffes knowe how to make a iest at one they know not. The damsell said: Cursed be the reasons &amp; excuses of so euill a knight, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Ladie of estimation, nor knight of prowesse, will bée moued to vertue, and héerewith she returned to giue her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the aunswere. So straight way came forth many men for to pull off the armour of those ouercome Knights, the which when <hi>Claridiano</hi> saw, he spurred forwardes his horse with his speare in his hand, ready at all assayes to the iust, and went towards the Dutchesse saying. Lady, now will I shew vnto you, whether I can better kéepe my whole armor, then your Knights their broken, and therewith he called vnto that Knight which kept the passage, that he should make himselfe ready &amp; come to him, and being both set in their places, they mooued their horses the one against the other with great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in the middest of theyr course they met together, and neither of them did misse his blow, but met with so greate force, that the speare of the Knight of the Passage was shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered all to péeces, and made the Prince to encline his body vpon the saddle, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Passage receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither his shield, nor his armour could make any resistance, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> speare showed it selfe at his back, wherewith he fell from his horse dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The Dutchesse when she saw it, receiued great ioy, although the folly of her Knights was a griefe vnto her, in such sorte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she sayd. Oh what doo they deserue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valour of a person wil haue him in derision, for we may wel consider that the Gods can bestow their giftes on persons of small valour, at the least on them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue small capacitie for to vse it, for héere you may see this knight, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those knights which did beare me companie, déemed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did refuse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iust with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of verie cowardnesse, &amp; yet he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deliuereth them,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13973:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they might not altogether be shamed: Oh disordinate pride, enimie to all vertue, such is it that doth remaine in our estates, that altogether it doth make vs to forget all goodnes, yet in our subiects meaner persons we may learne that which is requisite for our commoditie and honour, and yet we doe thinke that all which the Gods doth giue vs, we doe deserue, and yet we finde not our selues satisfied. At which reasons of the Dutchesse, <hi>Claridiano</hi> was verie attentiue, &amp; thought wel of her repentance, for that which her knightes had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and was verie well content, &amp; had her in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be verie honourable, &amp; drawing nigh vnto her he said: Faire Ladie, héere you doe sée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with great reason the horse &amp; armour of these your knights is mine, &amp; doth pertaine vnto me, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their experience was such to be lanched out of their saddles, as also to mock and iest at trauailing and venterous knights, therefore your pleasure may be to commaund them to be deliuered vnto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they knew not how to defend them. The Dutchesse was cut off from her answere by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the comming of a knight with great pride that sayde: The horse and armour is none of thine, first I do giue thee to vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we will defend them with the losse of thy life. And in saying these words he drew out his sword, &amp; before that the Prince could make anie resistance, he cut off one of his horse legs, and the Prince perceiuing it, before his horse did fall, with great lightnesse he cléered himselfe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and like vnto the winde he went against that vncourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Knight, with his sword in his hande, he stroke him such a blow vpon the head, that he cut it in two parts, and he fel dead to the earth. The rest of the Knights which saw this, came vnto him with their swords in their hands, and for all the crying out of the Dutchesse &amp; her daughter to withdraw them, they did compasse him about altogether, striking him with terrible blowes on euery side: but yet they found him not so weake and without courage as they thought, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a valiant hart he made his defence, &amp; did intreate them in such sort, that afterward it grieued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that enterprise, for the Prince so behaued himself, that at thrée blowes he brought three of them dead to the ground, and for that they were all chosen knightes, for the losse of those that were slaine, they would not leaue to perseuer against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie warriour. The Prince when he perceiued that they dyd still procure to intreate him euill, with great ire and wrath he beganne a new to plague them with his strong and fury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arme, in such sort, that in a small time he made that the halfe of them had lost their strength for to strike at him, the rest which remained when they sawe that there they should looke for no other but death, except they made theyr defence better, or else procure to kill him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which straight way they did put in vre. Then the Prince when he perceiued that stil with great furie they did persecute him, he let slip his shéelde and threw it on his backe, and tooke fast holde of his sword in both his handes, and stroke so terrible a blowe at him which came first to hand, that hitting him on the shoulder, he cut him downe vnto the wast and he fell dead to the ground, then casting his sword about, with an ouerthwart blowe he stroke another on the throate, that he made his head to flye from his shoulders, &amp; in that furie he brought other two dead to the ground, the other sixe which remained séeing his diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish furie began to withdrawe themselues. Then the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Dutchesse séeing the other knights to retire, came vnto the Prince, and with great grace and curtesie she said: Valiant knight of the Ladies, I doe desire thée for curtesies sake to cease thy furie, &amp; let not the force of thy strong arme procéede farther, but let this my desire and request moue thée to that which twentie knightes of valour could not obtaine. This noble warriour although he was blind and ouercome with anger and wrath, yet could he not but pacifie himselfe, seeing with what humilitie this faire Gentlewoman did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him, and without anie more replying he did withdrawe himselfe, and leapt vpon the horse of the knight of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, for that <hi>Fidelio</hi> did take and brought after that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horse of his master was slaine, and therewith he passed ouer the bridge, and began to take his iourney forwards, leauing all

So they trauailed with great haste, because they would come vnto their lodging before night, &amp; making hast, they came vnto a mans house, who did lodge them, being in great feare, the occasion shall be told you in the next chapter following.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T such time as the bright <hi>Apollo,</hi> woulde spread abroad his beames vpon the cold and moyst earth, was that valiaunt knight <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano</hi> on horseback, with all his company, for to prosecute his iourney, and vppon a sodaine, he heard with a great noyse &amp; rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they shut the gates of the house. Then the Prince asked what was the occasion of that great noyse, and it was told him by his hoast, how that it was for to kéepe out two great Gyants, which of late dayes did vse all those wayes &amp; fields, dooing all the harme possible, in taking and killing all that euer they might, and they doo carrye with them fifteene Knights, for to help them to doo all this euill, for which cause all this Countrey standeth in great feare, and dare not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile by the wayes, and vnderstanding that many doe come this way, to goe sée the triumphs and feasts at <hi>Nabatea,</hi> they doo vse héere great pride and arrogancie, carrying away with them many prisoners, as well men as women. So when the Prince heard this, as one that did procure no other thing, but to augment his honour, and increase his fame, he sayd. Commaund that the gates may be open, for that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accompt my selfe in the number of Knights, but that I will cause them to leaue off dooing such harme, and also set them at libertie, whom they doo carry captiues, and ease thée of this great feare in the which thou art. O for the loue thou

dost beare vnto the Gods, gentle Knight, sayd the Hoste of the house, doo not put these thy tender yeares in perill to bee slaine, or carried away prisoner by those furious beasts. To whom <hi>Claridiano</hi> aunswered. It will be rather a shamefull reproch vnto my fame, if there shuld lack in me, that which I am bound by the order of Knighthood to performe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my good Host, let this suffice, that neither your request nor any others peticions, shall perswade me to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but that I will goe forth and procure to abate so greate pride and harme, for that in making an ende of my dayes, in defence against these cruell people, then haue I performed that I am bound to, &amp; haue promised to doo, therfore I pray thée comnaund that the gates may be opened. When the Host saw his determined purpose and will, he commaunded the gates to be opened. The two Ladyes receiued great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and griefe, for that which the Knight did: but much more was the griefe of <hi>Fidelio,</hi> although he was throughlie certified of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valour of his Lord, yet he letted not but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feare his returne, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the enterprise was very daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and doubtfull, and would very faine haue gone with his Lord, but he wold in no case consent thervnto, but wold alone goe forth vpon this enterprise. So this noble warrior rode forth with the visor of his helme vp, and his shield on his arme, and a mightie cutting sword in his hand, and put himselfe in the middest of the high waye, and in a smal time after, he saw a chariot which was drawen with sixe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the Giants saw his great hardines, one of them,

which by reason of his deformed members, trauailed on a mightie great horse, came foorth before all the rest, whereas this Gréeke was: and when he came nigh him, he sayde in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> tongue. Thou Knight, what diuell hath caused thée to commit so great folly, for to abide my fury, arte thou so certefied of thy great valor, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wilt sée the proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Then the valiant sonne of the great <hi>Alphebo</hi> answered. Neither my folly, nor yet the trust which thou saist I haue, hath moued me, but onely this thy crueltie &amp; euill customes which thou dost vse, for that the immortall Gods are verye angry, that they haue indued you with so mightie members and strength, and you thus imploye them, exercising nothing but vilenesse and crueltie, and therefore they doo send me, as their messenger, to make manifest vnto you their great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wrath, promising great punishment, if you doo not leaue to follow these peruerse customes which you doo vse, &amp; if it be so that you are determined not to leaue this euill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and amend your life, héere in their names I doo defie you in mortall battaile. The Giant with the great pride he had, and with the anger that he receiued, when he heard the spéech of the Prince, the words doubled so in his mouth, that he could not make any aunswere, but threwe out from his mouth and nose great abundaunce of smoake, which almost tooke away their sights like a myst, and spurring forwardes his great beast, who was very light, that with a trice he was with the Prince, and before he could make any resistaunce, he stroke him so terrible a blow with both his handes with his heauie clubbe vpon his fine and hard stéeled helme that it made him to stagger, and to fall down vpon his horse neck, and his spears fell out of his hande, and his armes hanged downe, as though he had bene dead and out of his nose and mouth procéeded great quantitie of bloud.</p>
               <p>His horse who was verye swifte and strong, gaue a spring in the aire, and tourned about, carrying his master a long time about the fielde, sprinkeling with bloud all the waye whereas he went.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:239"/>The Giant did not remaine content after that he had giuen him this blow, but did follow him for to double it, with the which he thought to make an ende of that worke: but this thought lasted not long, for that this Gréeke Knight was come againe to himselfe, and as he was setlyng himselfe in his saddle, he perceiued very well the great daunger, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ord, and went towards the Gyaunt saying. Tarie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thou furious beast, for héere I sweare vnto thée by the immortal Gods, that very quickly I meane to giue thée thy paiment, which thy terrible blow doth deserue. The Prince at that time was so full of wrath, that he might well haue bene counted hardie, that durst at that time come to him face to face. And when he came whereas the Giant was, he stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched himselfe vpon his stirrops, and stroke so terrible a blow vpon the giants shoulder, which was with so great strength, that all that quarter he cut cleane awaye, and threwe him dead to the ground: which caused great contentment vnto all those, that were in the house beholding them. The other Giant when he saw his companion dead, with great wrathe he commaunded the fiftéene Knightes, that altogether they should assault that mortall enimye, who were not slacke in accomplishing his commaundement. Oh vnhappy people, if you had considered, how that this young Knight had lost the reynes of his pacience, you would not haue bene so hardy to assault him, for that strong mountaines were not sufficient to make resistance against him, neither would ye haue ben so bold, to giue him any occasion of offence. This worthy war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour when he saw this his shamefull assault, without loosing any part of his courage, he went and encountred them, laying about him, striking on the right hand, and on the left hand, with so much fury, as a Lyon, when he is compassed about
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13973:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with expert hunters, euen so be vsed himself. These knights were all stout and chosen knights, and of the lineall descent of Gyants, and did not let to strike him manye and furious blowes, which made him many times almost to léese his wittes, which was caused by his great ire and wrathe, for it was such, that he felt in himselfe no increasing of force: yet for all that, he did so imploye his blowes, that ten of them, some with their heads clouen in péeces, and other some with their armes cut off, he ouerthrew dead to the ground. The other Giant was meruailously amazed to sée so incredible a thing, but puffing and blowing like to a Bull, he set hand to his mightie and great cutting sword, and with great furye he likewise assaulted the valiant Knight on the one side, and stroke at him such a blow, that he made him to stoope &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his body to his horse necke, but quickly he raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vp againe, and with great lightnesse he cléered himselfe from the second blow, which he sawe descending vpon him, and therewith he stroke two blowes at two of those fiue Knights which remained, so that he brought them both dead to the ground. The Gyant when he saw so much strength in one Knight, being very much kindeled in wrath, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the thrée Knights which remained, to withdrawe themselues a parte, so that the Giaunt and the Knight made their assault together with such terrible blowes, that it was wonderfull to see. The Knight with both his hands stroake at the Giant, so that both their blowes descended together, with so great strength and noyse, that it made a meruailous sound throughout all the mountaints. The Giaunt was he which receceiued the most harme, by reason that his armor made but small resistance against the terrible blowes of the Knight, which was the occasion that he was hurt and wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in many places. The Giant séeing his great resistaunce roared like a baighted Bul, procuring withall the power he had to hurt the Prince. In this sort they indured more then an houre without taking any rest, at which time the Giant did féele in himselfe some wearinesse, and would with one blow make an ende of this battaile, or put his life in ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:240"/>
and therewith he stroke with all his force so terrible a blow at the prince, that he made him to fall vpon his horse crupper, but straight waye he was setled againe in his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and striking his horse with the spurs, he came vnto the Gyant, at such time as he had his sword aloft, to discharge it vpon the Prince, but he thrust at him a foyne at the sight of his healme, which was very large, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he stroke him betwixt both his eyes, and the sword passed through to his necke, so that the Gyant fell downe dead to the ground, which was no small ioye vnto all the Prisoners that were in the Chariot. The other thrée Knights when they saw all things to goe so ill on their parts, they let loose their horse bridles, and with great hast they procured to hide themselues in the thickest of the forrest. The Prince made no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, but let them goe, and went straight waye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chariot, and lighted from his horse, and went vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it for to vnloose those prisoners which were bounde, and sayd vnto those Ladyes. Receiue this seruice of me, not for any courtesie that I found in your Knights, but for the great bountie and vertue, which is in the Dutches and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Earle of the déepe lake aunswered and sayde. Of truth, gentle Knight, it had bene better that you had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our demaund, which we asked in the seruice of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: for that being subdued by your great valour, we had not come into so great miserie and trouble in the which we haue séene our selues. Sir Earle aunswered the prince <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano,</hi> my heart is so cleane voyd of the subiection of loue, (putting apart my bounden dutie towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that by the oath that I haue sworne to the order of Knighthood, that it is not to be meruailed if I did denie your demaund, putting for intercessour that, which my heart was neuer subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Then the Dutchesse with a goodly grace sayd: Yet I do certefie you gentle Knight, that at this time you shall not remaine so much at your owne libertie, but that by me you shal be constrained to be my guide to the Citie of <hi>Nabatea.</hi> With condition sayd the Prince, that the day of the iusting, you doo not manifest my person, vnto any creature.

I cannot deny anything y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you doo aske of me, said <hi>Claridiano,</hi> for that you haue power to commaund me, and therefore I doo accept, and graunt vnto all things that your highnesse shall demaund. And being in this communication, the Princesses thet remained at their Hostes, came whereas they were, and in their companye the Knight of the house, who was almost in an extasie with the great ioye and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he had, to sée the two Giants and his company dead, and requested them instantly, that they would goe vnto his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to take their rest: to the which they did graunt, for the necessitie which did mooue them. <hi>Galtenor</hi> did declare vnto vs what shuld be done vnto these Giants, and said that they were Lords of the faire Ilands, enemies vnto the King of the <hi>Nabateos,</hi> and as they had vnderstanding of the greate triumphs and feasts which was proclaimed in <hi>Nabatea,</hi> thrée of those Giaunts, which were all bretheren, went forth to doo all the harme they might, in company with their mother who was a great inchaunter. The one of the Giants who was more furious and of a mightier strength then the other two, wold goe alone, and these two came together of whom wer haue tolde you. The Knights of the Dutchesse wer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailously ill intreated in the battaile which they had with <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and it was requisite that they should remaine a few daies in the castle, for to ease &amp; comfort themselues: but the Prince his hart could not in any wise suffer to tarry so long to ease himselfe, but tooke his leaue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dutchesse for to depart, who did graunt it vnto him with a very good wil, for that she would remaine in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Castle, till such time as her knights wer better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted &amp; amended.

And when they vnderstoode that the time of the Triumphes drew néere, they tooke the waye which led them straight vnto the Citie of <hi>Nabatea</hi>: and for to goe thether, they must néedes passe thorough a woode of eight miles long, in the which they trauailed til it was noone time, and therein they discouered a very faire castle, and fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themselues somewhat weary, they went thether for to refresh themselues, the which chanced vnto them otherwise, as in the chapter following you shall vnderstand.</p>

Then this <hi>Pastora</hi> did open hir faire and christalyne eyes, looking earnestly vpon the knight, and giuing a greuous and sorowfull sigh, she withdrew hir selfe from the grate, which caused the gréeke knight to haue great desire to know who it should be, suspecting that by force of some inchantment, she should be put therein, where-with there kindled in his heart a new Fyer of loue: And casting vp his eyes agayne to sée if he might sée her, he could not, but saw in the very same place, a woman, of a very great stature, who was all armed, with a sword gyrt at hir wast, &amp; had hanging at her neck a bowe, and a gylt Quiuer, this lady was of so greate beautie, that she seemed almost to excell the <hi>Pastora,</hi> so that the Prince, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight which he had before him, forgot that which was past, and fixed his eyes on hir. But in the same sort vpon a sodayne, she went away as the first dyd, leuing the knight with no lesse trouble in his thought, then before he was. This knight had not much tyme to bewayle the absence of that Ladie, for that without séeing any body, he was stroken such a blow with so great fury vpon his back, that he was constrained to stoop with one knée to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Yet with a tryse he arose vp agayne: and looking about him to sée who it was that stroke him, he perceiued that it was
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:13973:242"/>
a knight, which with great hast ran in at a dore which was at one of the corners of the court. And with the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which the Prince reseiued, to sée him selfe in such sort so ill intreated, he followed him with his accustomed light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, following after that Knight in at the dore. He was not two steppes in at the dore, when that he fell downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a déepe caue, which was couered ouer in such subtyl sort, that whosoeuer dyd treade on it, he straight-way fell down into the caue, except he were aduertised thereof. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the caue it was very darke, and no light appeared. The Knight séeing himselfe so betrayed in that trappe, he feared to receiue some harme in the fall. But yet verye lightlie he put him selfe on foote, with his Sword drawen in his hand, for to make his defence, againste whatsoeuer should happen. But by reason of the great darknesse, he could not see any thing, neither discouer wherein he was fallen, but determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to settle himselfe againste somewhat, if he might fynde where, groping to sée if he might fynde any other dore of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into that darke Denne.</p>
               <p>And as the knight went groping and féeling, he found that he trode on no other thing but dead mennes bones, which caused him to stand still. And not long after there was open a louer hole, at the which entred much clearenesse, and gaue great light into the place whereas he was: whereat appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a very olde woman, who was so leane &amp; so ful of wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, that it seemed she had nothing but skin and bones on hir, who sayd vnto the Prince, in an euill houre thou camest he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; so shall thy lodging be, and thine entertainment, for that thou art now in place, that thou maist looke for no other thing, but to be meate vnto a furious beast. And thy surmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted strength shal not be able to make any defence. The prince who was very wrath, answered, Oh false &amp; cursed Witch, whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods confound, who hath taught thée to vse so great disceit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy false &amp; diuelish vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, thou dost work so much euil against all traueling &amp; ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trous knights. I hope to come forth out of this caue, in spight of al thy mischiefe, &amp; with my strong arme to breake all thy bones a sunder.

All that thou doest and wilt doe sayd the olde woman, I wil suffer at thy handes, onely for the reuengement I will take of thée, and that verie quickly, and therewith she went from that windowe and shut it fast againe. So not long after at his backe he heard a noise, as though they were opening of a doore little and little, whereas there appeared a little light, the Prince procuring to go thether, saw that the bones wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he trode were of two humane bodies, which appeared not to be verie long since their flesh was torne of with hard and cruel téeth, but this consideration could not indure long with him, for that he heard a great rumor, &amp; looking what it should be, he sawe that there was comming forth of another den a mightie Serpent with wings, as great in bodie as an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, which had onely two féete which appeared out of that monstrous bodie but a span in length, and each foot had thrée clawes of thrée spans in length, she came with her mouth open of so monstrous and huge bignesse, and so deformed, that a whole armed knight might enter in therat, and she had on her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But that terrible blow was not so soone passed ouer him, but straight waies he was on his feete, at such time as the furious beast came towards him. Héere the Prince hauing a great confidence in his owne strength, did so high and valiant prowesse, that you may put in obliuion, all the valiantnes that euer was done by his predecessors, and put this in perpetuall memorie. For that he threw his sword out of his hand, and went vnto this monster, and imbraced himselfe with her, &amp; did so quease her betwixt his mightie armes, with so much strength y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beast could not profit her self of her sharp clawes, but only with her wings, she beat him on euery side, this valiant

clawes, for that hée is so quiet, although he hath bene a great while in making of it ready, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant asked &amp; said: Was ther anie of you which saw what armor this knight brought &amp; what recognices he had, then one which was there eating said: I did sée what recognices he had, then the old magicall witch said vnto her sonne, now that you certainly know he is dead, I wil tell you who it was: You shall vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the knight that slew my two sonnes &amp; thy brothers. The gyant when he heard this, stroke with his hand a great blow vpon the table, saying: Oh Gods, &amp; wherefore did you not tel me thereof before, that I with my own hands might haue taken the reuengment, cursed be thine inchantments, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are the occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mightie force of my armes do loose the glorie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do deserue. All this which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the knight heard, &amp; by their reasons he knew that they were all of the lineall desent of those gyants which he slew, for to set at libertie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princesse of the valley, &amp; hearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so vilely spoken of he could not indure to stand there long, for his cholar did so ouercome him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger refraine, but set his shulder vnto the doore with so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble strength, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he threw it downe to the ground, at which fal it made a terrible noise, which caused al them that were ther to be greatly amazed, but yet their wonder was much more to sée that the knight was at libertie &amp; cléere from that vgly beast, who they thought had ben dead and deuoured by her, but when they sawe him they all procured to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and to runne away, so that the Gyant remained all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in that place, &amp; rising vp from the boord, stretching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on his féet, he said: O my Gods I do giue thanks for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you haue deliuered this vile knight fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> furious beast, that I with my hands may take reuengment of him. And in saying these wordes hée drew out a mightie sword which he had hanging at his side, &amp; went towards the prince striking at him a terrible blow, from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which this Gréek did cléere himselfe with his accustomed lightnesse, &amp; being past y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blow he sayd: Gyant, goe &amp; arme thy selfe, and héere I will tarrie for thee, by which meanes thou maist defend thy selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:245"/>
and make thy reuengement as thy heart desireth, and do not thou thinke that I will glorie in the abating of thy courage, but with the great valour the which my high minde doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. The Gyant when he sawe himselfe derided and that the knight made little account of him, was with the greate anger which he receiued almost beside himselfe, and sayd: Oh vile and miserable creature, is it possible that the Gods will doo me so great outrage, as to consent that I shall take ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour against thée, and that thou hast so much force, as to driue me vnto that necessitie. And in saying these words, he lift vp againe his broad &amp; mightie sword against the prince, who lykewise cléered himselfe of that blow as he did of the first. Then the Prince sayd vnto him: Thou deformed beast without any humane reason, doo not procure by thy greate pride to spot or staine the nobilitie of my person, to cause me to strike thée, without hauing any armour, to make thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The Giant made little accompt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counsell he gaue him, but rather assalted him with more terrible blowes. But all that euer he did was in vaine, for that the Prince with great experience and lightnesse cleered himselfe from them, and tarried y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time, that he might haue opportunitie to close with him, for to shew him the fruites of his fists, for at that time he had not drawen his sword. A good while they were in this contention, till such time as those Knights which ran away (which was to the number of ten) had time to arme themselues, and to returne againe into that place whereas they were eating, who came all in a readinesse with theyr swords in their hands. When the Prince saw the great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill which was towards him, he was constrained to drawe out his sword for to make his defence against that wicked company. The olde Witch called with a mightie voyce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her sonne, that he should enter in and arme himselfe, for that she suspected as a Deuine, what should happen. (O cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed heart, that is so great a friend vnto cruell reuengment: how dost thou procure to heape vpon thy selfe such shame &amp; reproch, seeking without all Iustice to doo that, which it wer better for thee to haue left vndone.) Full little did it profit

this olde Witch her great crying out, and inchauntments, for that the Giant would not hearken vnto her, but followed his prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnarmed as he was, against him, who although he had bene armed, his furie would little haue profited him, so by reson that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other armed Knights did so much trouble him with their blowes, it was the occasion that the Giant did the more molest him, causing him many times with the fury of their blowes to boow his knées to the grounde, the which did constraine him to vse all his power against them, striking about him on the one side and on the other, that in a small time he ouerthrew fiue of them dead to the ground, yet for all that the other fiue which remained did not let to vse all the extremitie they could against the Gréeke, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that furious Gyant whom the knight would neuer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to strike with his cutting sword, but alwayes waiting opportunitie that he might close with him, for to giue him one blowe with the pomell therof, and when time did serue, he would not loose it, but being verie nigh him, he stroke him so mightie a blow with the pomell of his sword vnder his eare, that he droue it into his braines, wherewith the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant fell dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. The other fiue knights when they sawe that terrible blowe, they threw their swords vnto the ground, and yéelded themselues vnto the curtesie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke knight. The olde Gyantesse when she sawe her sonne dead, and those knights yeelded, with a great furie and terrible shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king she put her selfe before the knight and sayd: O cruell Butcher, the destroyer of my welbeloued sonnes, make now an end of her who doth more deserue the death then they, and doe not thinke that thou shalt obtaine so much victorie as to carrie me awaie with thée aliue, and if that with thy cruell hand thou wilt not make an end of her that is without all good fortune, I promise thée that I will procure to giue it my selfe with my owne hands. And in saying these wordes shée went vnto the place whereas he sonne lay dead, and layde holde on his sharpe sword, and with a trice she thrust it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her bodie, that none that were there present had anie time to withdraw her from doing it, which béeing done, her mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:13973:246"/>
soule was scant out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnhappie bodie when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the Castell began to shake, and with the noise of a terrible thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der clap it vanished awaie, in such sort that all those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there present remained in the plaine field without anie signe or token of castel to be there or anie other kind of buildings, for that you shall vnderstand, that this Castle was made by Art of inchauntment by that olde Witch. Surely it caused great admiration to all them that remained a liue: but much more was the griefe of the Ladies which tarried for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, when they saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he tarried so long, &amp; also afterward when they heard that great noyse of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at the breaking vp of that inchaunted Castle. It was no lesse to be wondred at, to sée the huge and mightie Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, &amp; the great giant with his mother, and the fiue knights that were slaine, vnderstanding that the Prince had made all that destruction. So the fiue Knights which yéelded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Then the Prince and his company retourned onwards to their iourney, making greate hast in their trauaylyng, that they might get out of that great Woode, before that the night shoulde come vpon them, whereby they might get to some towne nigh at hand. And at such time as the gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Apollo</hi> began to hide his face, and to couer himselfe, according to his accustomed order, they came vnto a fayre Castle, which was a little without the woode, whereas of the Lorde thereof, they were verye well receiued: yet much more royal was their entertainment, and farre greater was his affection towards them, when he knew of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> destruction of that inchaunted Castle, for that he had felte and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the inconuenience of that ill neighbour.</p>

The Prince of <hi>Camogenia</hi> made his encounter whole, &amp; stroke the Pagan without missing any poynt: but the pagan stroke the other in such sort that he heaued him out of the saddle, &amp; he fell to the ground, wherewith the Pagan Knight remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with great pride and gladnesse. In the meane time that these two wer in the Iust, there entred in a Knight of <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> who entred in with great pompe and pride, who when he saw that the Prince of <hi>Camogenia</hi> was ouerthrowen, he put himselfe vnto the Iust. Little did profite him his great pride and arrogancie, &amp; outward show to be a strong knight against him of <hi>Siria,</hi> for that at the first encounter he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him to the ground: in like sort did he vse other fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene Knights of diuers Prouinces. So straight way entred the Prince of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> who was a meruailous well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned knight, armed all in white armour, wrought with excellent knots of gold, and he brought in his companye an hundred Knights, all apparailed in white satten, and riding about the place, he shewed his obedience vnto the King and all the Ladies. Then he put himselfe at his standing, for at that time ther was not a knight to iust withall. So straight way they sounded the trumpets, at which noyse the Knights mooued themselues to the Iust with their horses, and made their encounter so strong, &amp; with so great fury, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the strong Pagan was cast to the grounde, and the like he did to other sixe ventrous Knights, which entred into the place.

but the prince was caryed ouer his horse buttocks, &amp; caryed the saddle with him betwixt his legges, which was a great griefe vnto all them that dyd see him, for that he was wel-beloued of them all. This arrogant gyant was so encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, &amp; so furyous that in a small tyme he left not a knight remaining in their saddles on horseback. And being in this great pryde, there was hard a great noyse and russhing, in maner of a tumult in the place. And loking what it should be, they saw that it was the knight of the Damsells which entred, who was armed with his riche and strong Armour, all of Purple, full of golden Starres. And before him came the two Damsells, which alwayes were in his company. The Princes of <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> caryed his shield, &amp; the Princes of <hi>Mesopotamia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> his Speare. Showing by his person the highnesse of his discent. Who passed by the royal seat wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the good King was, in whose company was his sonne the prince, armed with very rich armour, also the lord of mount <hi>Libano,</hi> a very auncient knight and of great authoritie. So on the other side was the princes, the daughter of the King of <hi>Nabatea,</hi> who was the bryde, a very fayre and comely gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and with her the Dutches of the valley and her Daughter. And behinde them, was the Earle of the déepe Lake, who was still very weake of the passed battaile, and was richly apparelled with blew cloth of Gold. And as this knight passed by, the knight arose vp and showed him cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie. The Dutches of the Ualley could not refraine hir selfe but that with a high voyce she sayd vnto the King. Mightie king, this is the knight in whom the gods hath put all their power &amp; strength, that his valour may be more then theirs. This warlike knight, although he heard very well what the Dutches had sayde, passed on, and descembled as though he had hard nothing. And when he came to the Iust, he toke his shylde and his speare, and prepared himselfe redy to the Iust. So strayght wayes being in a readinesse, they sowned the Trumpets, where at which great fury, they moued their Coursers, &amp; neither of them missed theyr blow at theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, but by reason that the Gréeke had great good will to

extol his fame, he stroke the gyant so mightie a blow, that he ouerthrew him to the ground. So the prince passed alongest, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great magestie, without any show of disdaine. The people with a great shout sayde. The great mightie &amp; royal <hi>Agilao</hi> is ouerthrowen to the ground, so that his mightie strength hath little auailed him. Then the prince of <hi>Fenicia,</hi> would proue his aduenture with the Greke, but with great ease he was turned to the ground. So all the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights that were of any estimation, made their Iust, but they were all w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great ease ouerthrowen to the ground, in lesse then the space of two houres. So at such time as the bright <hi>Febus</hi> would make an ende of his long iourney, there apeared to enter in to the place the braue and mightie Gyant, brother vnto the king of <hi>Silicia,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a mightie great speare in his hand, whose glystering poynt of Steele showed through all the field. He brought with him but one only squyer, which brought with him another speare, and without any care of courtesie due, he put himselfe into the place. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Squire which brought his other Speare, went vnto <hi>Claridiano,</hi> &amp; sayd: Knight, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der valiant gyant doth send vnto thée this Speare, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thée that thou dost procure to doo the vttermost of thy power before that the Sunne doth set, for that he will doo the like: &amp; likewise he saith, that he doth not only defie thée in the Iust, but also to mortall battaile.

Gods for to take away his great pride and arrogancie. At this time the two warriours tarryed the signe to be made by the trumpets: which being giuen, these Knights mooued their coursers, with their speares in their rests, with so great yre and desire the one to hurt the other, that they both fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in theyr incounter. The Giant who was verye proude, when he saw that he had erred his blow, he returned against <hi>Claridiano,</hi> carrieng his speare vppon his shoulder, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming nigh him, vpon a sodaine and with great fury he tooke it from his shoulder, and before the Gréeke could cléere him selfe, he strake him a mightie blow vpon the armour, so that his staffe broke by reason of the finenesse of the armour, and made the good warriour to double his body backwards vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Horse crupper. But when he saw the great villany which the Giaunt vsed with him, his anger increased verye much, &amp; taking his speare in the same sort, he went towards the Giant and sayd. Thou furious and proude beast, what didst thou thinke to goare me lyke as thou wouldest doo a wilde Boare, tarrie, and I will make thée to vnderstand, if I can make my knottie speare to flye in the aire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he threw his speare at him with so great furie, that he stroke him on the breast in such sort, that the speare passed through his body, and showed it selfe at his backe, so that this Giant fell downe dead to the ground, and all that were there present, were very much amazed at the great-strength and force of this Knight. At this time the Sunne had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his course, hauing nothing aboue the Horizon but his gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering beames, then the Iudges of the feastes commaunded with sound of trumpets that the Iusts should cease, &amp; make an ende of the day. So the King descended from the place where he was into the Court with all his Knights for to receiue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She had hir golden haire dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed abroade on hir backe, behind hir eares, and had in hir hand a shepheards hooke, very well wrought, with the which she gouerned a fewe shéepe, that she had the charge of. Hir face semed so faire as <hi>Diana,</hi> at such time as hir beames hath most force. And when the Shepard saw hir, he began a new to make vnto hir pitifull lamentations. But for all that the <hi>Pastora</hi> made no rekoning to giue any eare vnto him, nor to
<pb facs="tcp:13973:252"/>
his complaints, but rather with a smiling laughter, made of it as a iest, which caused vnto the Shepehard more torment. Then <hi>Cupide</hi> who was tarying his tyme &amp; opportunitie, at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time discharged his golden Arrow, with great furie, in such sort, that the heart of the Prince, who aforetime was voyd &amp; at libertie, was now brought in subiection &amp; made subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his lawes &amp; customes. For so sone as he had séene this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stora,</hi> he straight way remembred the <hi>Pastora</hi> which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Ierosolima</hi> had told him of, &amp; also of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he saw in the inchanted Castle, leaning on hir breast at the Yron grate. And reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring himselfe, he cast his head a side to behold hir that was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasion of his new harme, but for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed alongst with hir shéep, he could not sée hir. Then he began to complaine against his vnhappie fortune, saying, Ah heauy hart, that in the time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wert a knight &amp; at libertie, thou diddest subdue and hadst power to ouercome so many strong warriors: wher is now thy strength become, wherwith thou didst ouercome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And in saying these words, he fell in a sownd to the ground. And forsomuch as he was absent &amp; taried a long time, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ladies saw he came not, they went out to seke him, &amp; found him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sort as I haue told you, which caused great disturbance vnto them. Notwithstanding in the best maner
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:13973:252"/>
they could, with bowing of his finger, &amp; other diligences, they brought him againe to his remembraunce, but not in so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sort, that he knew who was with him in presence. And therwith he gaue a greuous sigh, &amp; sayd: Oh merciful <hi>Iupiter,</hi> show vpon me thy power, &amp; do not permit that <hi>Cupide,</hi> may haue so much might against this sorowful knight. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a new he fel down in a sownd, as at the first. Both the princes wer greatly amased, not knowing what it should be, which hath caused so much alteration. And therwith <hi>Fidelio</hi> ran vnto the riuer for water, wherwith they all to be bathed his face, that he came againe to himselfe. The Ladies musing betwen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce should procede this his griefe. Straight way they suspected y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had sene that faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> which a little before they saw passe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst those grene trées. <hi>Antemisca</hi> who had more care of the princes griefe then the other, when she saw him somewhat come to himself, she said: What is this worthy knight, is it now time to leaue me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, the time being so nigh at hand to make my defence, &amp; almost at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates of the citie, pul vp your hart, &amp; let not your valiant courage at this time faint. The knight when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ladies wer ther, he procured to raise vp his body, &amp; to sit down, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before he was layde all a long. And dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best wise he could, he said. I do not know what should be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a maruailous great grief which stroke me to the hart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without any power to make resistance, it ouerthrew me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, in such sort as you fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me. I do wel beleue, said <hi>Antemisca,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the occasion of this grief is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies are in most fault. For if thou hadst not sene the faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> thy hart should not haue felt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> passed paine. To this <hi>Claridiano</hi> answered nothing at all, seing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasion of his griefe. But he made hast to make all things in a redines to go onwards on their iourney, &amp; being all on horsback they hasted towardes <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> where they were receiued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great triumph, méet for such worthy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The olde king &amp; Quéene gaue great thanks vnto their gods for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> retorne of their lost daughter. <hi>Claridiano</hi> remained ther in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> sixe daies, greatly against his wil.
<pb facs="tcp:13973:253"/>
For that the new wound would not suffer him to take any rest, which caused him to take his leaue of the king and his daughter, and departed, and toke the way towards <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> with great desyre to be there. So trauailing, they left behinde them the Citie of <hi>Damasco,</hi> &amp; passed by the one syde of <hi>Armenia</hi> the great, and so entred into the great playne of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> and from thence without taking any rest, they came within ten myles of the citie of <hi>Mesos.</hi> From which place they sent the olde Squyre, which was with them, to giue the king to vnderstand of the comming of the Princes, who with great care trauailed in such sort, that he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pallas, at such tyme as the king was acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with all his knights, not with lyttle sorow for the absence of his daughter, for that the tyme appointed for hir defence, drewe on. On his one syde was the prince of <hi>Palestina,</hi> who was as merry and glad, as the King heauy and sorowfull. But whan <hi>Libernio</hi> entred into the great hall, the king knew him to be a man of great estimation in his kingedome. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no power to discemble his great ioye, in seing him, he forgot his royall authoritie, and rose vp against him, &amp; sayd: Ah my friende where hast thou left my daughter <hi>Antemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> tell me quickly, as thou wouldest that the Goddes should fauour thée. Then <hi>Libernio</hi> with a cherefull countenaunce sayde, mightie King and Lorde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy daughter the Princes is very well, although very wery of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And if it be so that your highnesse doth accept thereof, and giue them lisence, he will come he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and defend hir right. The prince of <hi>Palestina</hi> when he hard that which was spoken, with great laughter, although not very well content, sayde. And who is he that is so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; foole-hardie, to come, and gaine-saye my fury, the truth being on my syde. <hi>Libernio</hi> sayde, it is he that will make thee to acknowledge thy falsehod, and will make thée forget thy fury &amp; mightie strength, by vsing of his valiant prowes. Whereat <hi>Brandemoran</hi> was so full of wrath, and his eyes
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:13973:253"/>
sparkling lyke fyer, he sayde: If it were not for that I am before the royall presence of the King, I would giue thee to vnderstand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy gray haires had not spake with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which thou oughtest to haue. Then the King sayd, prince pacifie your courage, &amp; be quiet, and thou <hi>Libernio</hi> retourne, &amp; tell them that they may come when their pleasure is. And for the right of my daughter, (if she haue any) he shall haue safe conduct to come and make hir defence. And if it be so that they haue néede of any thing, speake that they may haue all furnished that is requisite. Go thy wayes and tary not, for that I haue great desire to sée either my shame or honour. For I am in such a stay, to se my selfe so dishonoured, that I think it better that I were dead. Ah what a goodly thing is it for a man to dye when he is in so great troubles. So <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> put in order his departure out of hand, leauing the king somewhat content, &amp; almost without suspection of any euill, seing that his daughter was returned to defend hir right. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernio</hi> when he had got mourning apparell for the Princes, departed to the place whereas he left them, declaring vnto hir all that hir father had sayde, and what passed in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. So therewith they procured and made hast, to finishe their iourney. And they made so much hast, that before it was night they came within two myles of the citie wher as they rested all that night, with great desire that the morning wer come. So verye earely in the morning at the breake of the day, they put them selues on horseback, and went forwards on theyr iourney. So that one houre after the Sunne had stretched forth his golden beames vpon the moyst earth and fragrant flowers, this Gréeke knight and the Princes entred into the citie of <hi>Mesos,</hi> not resting in any place, til they came vnto the kinges pallaice, wheras they alighted and went vp into the great hall. <hi>Claridiano</hi> led <hi>Antemisca</hi> by the hande, his Helme fast vpon his head, and his purple Shylde on his shoulder, but the visor of his Helme was vp, so that all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might sée his fayre &amp; great visage, and all that saw him, dyd iudge him to be of a high lynage. Then the King was aduertised of theyr comming, and dyd abyde theyr comming
<pb facs="tcp:13973:254"/>
in the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of presence, accompanied with all his nobles &amp; knights of prowes. And when he saw his daughter to enter all couered with mourning apparel, his royal highnesse could not show the great loue he had vnto his daughter, but made showes of great sorow, shedding many teares from his eyes, which ran down vpon his chéekes, &amp; al to be washed his gray haires. This faultlesse lady dyd prostrate hir selfe at hir fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>te, but <hi>Claridiano</hi> remained a fote, with so great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, as though he had known whose sonne he was. This painefull &amp; weried lady, did aske hir fathers hands to kisse them, but neither the king nor his daughter could speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny word more. They remained so a great while, til such time as the king constraining his princely courage, sayde. I know not what wil fal out, for that I sée before me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which of long time I haue desired, &amp; yet I do not know it to be myne. The lady vnderstode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of hir father, gathered stomack vnto hir selfe &amp; said: I am <hi>Antemisca,</hi> your welbeloued daughter, although at this time I am abhorred, I am she who vniustly hath gone wandring, paying such debts as I neuer made, for that I did neuer let but to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lady I ought to be. I am she that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valour of this mightie &amp; worthy warriour, do liue, and not by the compassion that thou hast had of thyne owne proper daughter. And I do thank my Gods, that they haue so much fauoured me, in giuing me his mightie &amp; strong arme, for to defend my truth, and for to punish that euill, the which that traytour <hi>Brandemoran,</hi> hath layde and raysed vpon me. The braue <hi>Palestina,</hi> who was present at the words which the Princes sayde, was so full of pryde and yre, that without any respect vnto the kings highnesse, he sayde: Oh false adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse, wherfore wilt thou deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> had thy virginitie, and that with thy consent. And what knight is he that is so hardie &amp; hath so much courage, to saye vnto the contrary. The Greke dyd very much beholde the <hi>Palestinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> perceuing by his wordes, that to be he that had procured all this harm against <hi>Antemisca.</hi> And although his proud words dyd moue his pacience, yet would he not make any outward show, neither aunswere vnto him, but rather with great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13973:254"/>
he tourned vnto the King and sayde: High and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Lorde, in this controuersie there is no neede of disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither farther rehearsal. But may it please your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to commaund, that the Prince of <hi>Chaldea</hi> may come in presence, and to know of him, if he be content, to referre all his right into my handes. The King who (was considering and beholding his mightie prowesse, in the demonstration of his person) straight wayes commaunded to be brought the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Chaldean,</hi> with sufficient kéepers with him, which was straight wayes done.</p>
               <p>And when he came in presence, the King sayde vnto him: prince <hi>Gelerosio,</hi> my daughter hath brought hether this kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght, for to defend hir and thy right, (if thou haue any.) Here would I know of thée, if that thou art content to referre all thy right and iustice into his handes. The prince <hi>Gelerosio</hi> somewhat heauy, aunswered the king and sayd, Unto the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Goddes and vnto him, I doe commit all my right although I had rather with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength of myne own armes make my defence: and tourning vnto the Gréeke, he sayde. And for that gentle Knight, thou shalt be certified that thou defende the truth: Here I doe sweare vnto thée by the high &amp; mightie <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that the Prince of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> did neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which with great falsehood he is accused. Then <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoran</hi> dyd replye, and sayde. All that euer thou doest saye, I will suffer, for that I doe thinke before the Sunne hath made an ende of his accustomed course, to haue satisfaction. And likewise to punishe the pryde of this foole, who by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce or rather foolish hardienesse, commeth to seeke his owne death.</p>
               <p>This valiaunt and couragious Gréeke coulde no longer suffer his proude and slaunderous speaches, but sayde vnto him: <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath power to giue the death vnto whome he pleaseth, and I doe thinke that which thou doest pretende vnto me, will fall vpon thy selfe, for to punish thée for this thy false and surmised treason which thou most dispightfully hast raysed, against this noble Princes, who is guiltlesse of this crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:255"/>And for that this muste be concluded by armes, and not by words, se that thou dost make no tarying, but arme thy selfe and come forth vnto the battaile, &amp; then thou shalt see how I will make thee to vnderstand in the field, that I am none of them of whome thou hast hetherto gotten honour. I will not make thee any aunswere sayde <hi>Brandemoran,</hi> for that I think very quickly to reuenge my selfe of thée, and to pluck out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tongue which hath bene so bolde to speake these words vnto me. And therwith he went straight out of the pallace, and went vnto his lodging for to arme himself vnto the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. The Gréeke at his answere was somewhat yrefull, but retourning vnto the king he sayde, mightie king and Lorde, I doe desyre your highnesse that you would commaund, that your daughter may be set in a place, where as she may well sée the restoring of hir honour. The King sayde this shalbe done with a very good wil, without any tarying. The Greke dyd take his leaue of the King and of the Ladyes that were in the great hall. And went downe the stayres where as he left his page and his horse, and without the helpe of his stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, he leapt into the saddle, &amp; hauing his healme on, and his speare in his hand, he commaunded his page to tary, and not to go with him.

And one of the two knights which entred the barke, leapt into the Sea for feare, and the other remained, and yeelded himselfe vnto the mercie of the Knight, which afterward did serue him for Squire, and very faithfully vsed his office, who was called <hi>Argolio. Rosicleer</hi> went trauailing to sea-wards, in his Barcke, very heauy and sorowfull, for that he was departed from his cosin so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In this sort they trauailed syxe dayes, &amp; the seuenth they discouered lande very far of, but the swiftnesse of the Barcke was such, that in a short time it brought them to the waters side. And being a land, he saw that it was an Iland, and very fragrant, for that towards the Occident, there appeared but little playne ground, and towards the Orient, a verye high &amp; sharpe Mountaine. So when the Barcke had fyxed it selfe a shore, he vnderstode, that there he must go a land, and taking his horse, with great lightnesse, he leapt into the saddle, and <hi>Argolio</hi> folowed him. And they trauailed into a narrow way which led them vp vnto that croked Mountaine, &amp; followed that way till they came to the height thereof, whereas they alighted for to refresh themselues, with that which the squire brought.

This furious serpent with the great fiercenesse she had she brake the speare, so that there remained in her head more then two spans thereof, and therewith she stroke at the knight with her nailes so terrible a blow, that she ouerthrew him, in such sort, that he tumbled on the ground.

who was not without great care of his defence, did abide her comming, and stood stil, and the wounded Serpent séeing her selfe nigh vnto the Knight, with great beating of her wings arose vp in the aire, thinking thereby to gripe fast hold with her sharpe nayles, and to carry him into the aire, and from thence to let him fall downe to the ground to destroye him. The courage of this Knight was very much, and likewise his iudgement, for that this Serpent had not so soone began to beate with his wings when that he suspected in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der she would assault him, but he lifted vp the poynt of his sword on high, and likewise his strong shield, that she might thereof make her praye. This furious serpent assaulted him to take her holde in such sort, that the sharpe sword ran into her belly and guts, and so the heart: but if that wound had not chaunced in the same place, at that time the Knight had bene meruailous ill intreated, for that the serpent tooke her hold with her long clawes in the midst of his body in such sort, that by her great strength she made his bones to crack: but by reason of the sharpnesse of the sworde which opened the wound wide, and cloue her heart asunder, the Serpent fell downe dead to the ground, leauing the Gréeke verye sore troubled and amazed. When the Knight sawe that she was dead, he gaue great thankes vnto God, for his aide and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour heerein.

the more it wounde about with such wreathings from one place vnto another, that it was very straunge, that if it had not bene by the great strength he vsed in quéesing of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he could neuer haue cléered himselfe thereof, but in the ende it fell downe dead to the ground.

This Greeke did procure to couer his naked bodie with certaine leaues which he cut from the trees, lamentablie beholding his leane face, which didde well shew the great sorrowe &amp; paine that he had receiued. At this time the Gréeke Princes Squire came whereas they were, forasmuch as the inchauntment was ended by the death of the last serpent, and pulling from his backe the cloake which he ware, he put it on the Pagan, therewith the better to couer himselfe. Also the valiaunt <hi>Troyan</hi> was come againe vnto himselfe, and cast his eies towardes the place whereas the Prince was hanged, to sée if he were stil in the same torment, who when he sawe him not, hée looked whether he was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len downe to the ground, supposing that he had ended his life with that torment, but when he saw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furious monster dead, and how the Gréeke was contemplating himselfe vppon the Pagan, then with great ioy he went towards them, but much more pleasure he receiued when he knew him to be the sonne of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> neuerthelesse all his mirth was mittigated whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sawe the deadly force of this Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> and seeing him in that plight, he could not but lament his heauie &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell fortune.

So straight way they put the Pagan vpon the Squires Horse, &amp; couered him with the same cloake, that first he had, and toke the Squyre behind him for to holde him vp, for that he was so leane, that he could not kéepe himselfe vp-right in the saddle.

I would haue bene very glad, sayd <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> to haue founde the king thy Father, for that I doe vnderstand, that it should be he, who dyd assalt and take the Prince of the <hi>Scitas,</hi> &amp; the worthy <hi>Troyan.</hi> And I am come to giue him to vnderstand, how he should entertaine and intreate, such knights as they are, and not with so great pryde to put them vnto such sorow and paine, &amp; kepe the princes in prison, vsing them as though they were his vassailes, who had done some cruel &amp; haynous offence against his owne person, or as rebells against theyr naturall Lorde and Prince, but he hath bene the bolder, for that he doth knowe they are a great waye from their owne countries. And I doe much maruaile, that such a person as thou art, wilt consent to the doing of such crueltie, for that it doth apeare, thou art sufficiently furnished with stature and strength. And thou semest vnto me, to be a very good knight, which doth bynde thée to acknowledge great modestie, &amp; not to minister or consent vnto such crueltie. But I doe sée that thou art voide of all, and that thou hast no knowledge of the goodnesse whereunto thou art bound. Therefore if thou doest maintaine that which thy Father doth vpholde and sustaine in this Castell and Iland, is not euill: I will make thée to say the contrary, both of vs being to gether, therefore chuse whether thou wilt graunt me frée entry into the Castell, or whether thou wilt come forth where as I am. The Gyant dyd not show anye kinde of alteration in his countenance, neither did he aunswere with any proude wordes, but rather mittigating his yre, he sayde. Doe not beleue knight, that I am so blynde and so voyd of knowledge, that I doe not know what is good and what is euill. Neither will I consent that thou shalt speake euill of that which my father hath done, but rather I tell thée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I will venter my person in his defence: therefore I bid thée to abyde, &amp; thou shalt sée how I am not afrayde of the perill, for it shalbe more death vnto me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne aliue, with my honour blemished, then to dye in his quarell and defence. And I will commaund that the gates of the Castel shalbe open, and I do warrant that so long as our battaile shall indure, thou shalt not receue any harme. And if
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13973:261"/>
it be so that fortune doth runne on thy side, then can I not assure the any farther, for that I haue a brother, who is not so great a friend vnto courtesie as I am. Cause the gates to be open, sayde <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> help of God I wil make my part good w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all. But yet certes Giant beleue me, it doth greatly greue me to see thée maintaine such euill, as it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in these thy wordes. And therewith he withdrew him selfe from the window, &amp; called for his apparaile, &amp; lykewise for his armour. His brother when he heard him speake with so great alterasion, he looked out at the same wyndow, for to sée who he was that gaue the occasion. This Gyant looked out with a diuelish semblaunce, an séeing the knight he sayd.

I am he, sayde <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> who doe pretend to reuenge the wrong and force done vnto the Prince <hi>Meridian.</hi> O vile coward, sayde the Gyant, what diuel hath made thée so hardy to make an enterprise, that <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe durst not giue the like attempt. Oh ye Gods, how doe you consent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one poore knight should haue so much boldnesse, to put himselfe before me, with such a demaund. It grieued <hi>Rosicleer</hi> very much, to see himself to intreated, of a proude Giant, &amp; aunswering him he sayde. In truth I haue defyed thy brother, who semeth to haue more discresion then thou hast. And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same demaund I doe defie thée to mortall battaile. In the which I think to make thée know, the vylenesse of thy reasons, &amp; the basenesse vsed in thy wordes. And take from that huge membred body, thy head, with the force of this my stronge arme. At which wordes the Gyant who first apeared, and was putting on his armour, sayde vnto his brother: This knight of his owne vertue and bountie doth come to be slayne, or els procure ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the Princes, and he semeth to haue souerayne har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse and strength, and there is no reason, to shew thy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in speaking so proudly &amp; vnsemely words, but with the fury of thy vntamed arme. And if the Gods doe graunt vnto him to haue the victory ouer me, there shal remayne time for thée to showe thy valoure. And there with he made him to

withdrawe himselfe from the windowe, leauing <hi>Rosicleer</hi> verie well satisfied with his courtesie. So within a lyttle while after he heard them opening the gates of the Castle, &amp; letting downe the draw bridge. Then the couragious Gréeke tooke the bridge and put himself within the castel into a very faire &amp; large court, all adorned round about with rich win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and on the one side a verie faire Orchard, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with verie sweete &amp; odoriferous flowers, &amp; all manner of sweete hearbs, in the which were many that were drossing those trées and hearbes, &amp; putting them in order, some were occupyed in making of fine hedges and arbours, &amp; others in husbanding the trees and cutting of them, others in digging of the ground, &amp; others in setting of hearbes, who when they sawe <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> they all stayed from their worke, &amp; imputed that knight to be verie vnwise to giue that enterprise, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them was the Gyant who last of all spake vnto <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi>
at the window, with a mightie great club in his hand, and for the defence of his bodie a simple harnesse, who sayde vnto <hi>Rosicleer</hi>: Come in, come in, thou hardie foole, for that thou shalt receiue the paiment of thy vndiscréet &amp; foolish bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The Prince without making anie aunswere went on forwards, &amp; entering in at the other gate, he came into a very faire and paued Court, the which was compassed about with three faire galleries one aboue another, the Prince receiued great delight to sée the excellent worke of them. So not long after there descended downe a paire of staires the first giant, armed with strong armour, his shéelde on his arme, and a great broad cutting sword in his hand, who without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anie word assaulted him with mortall battaile. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Gréeke was in a readinesse for to make his defence with his sword in his hand. The Gyant stroke at him a terrible blow right down, but the Gréeke with a light leap made him to misse his blow, and his swoord fell downe vpon the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in such sort, that it made a great number of sparkes of fire to flie out, as soone as the blowe was passed, the Greeke stroke him vpon the arme, which blow was not verie great, for that he could not verie well reach him vnto his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:13973:262"/>
yet for all that it did not let to cut his armour, flesh and all vnto the hard bone, and although the Gyant did feele the wound somewhat greeuous, yet did he procure to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the feeling of the paine and griefe, and with the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he had to feele himselfe hurt, he threwe his sheelde from him to the ground, and tooke his greate sworde fast in both his handes, and returned thinking to haue stroke the Gréeke with double force more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, but he did procure to cléere himselfe as he did at the first, striking a blow at the Gyant, thinking to haue stroke him againe on his armes, but hee could not reach him, but it lighted vpon the Gyants sword, and the blowe was such, that the force of the steelie blade was not sufficient to make resistaunce, but that the swoorde of the Gréeke did enter in and made a great gappe, but the Gyauntes third blowe was such, that without resistaunce it chaunced vppon the Greekes shéelde, and all that euer it hit it carryed to the grounde, and parte of it lyghted on his healme, in such sort that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was constrained to stoope with his knées to the grounde, but with greate lyghtnesse he arose vp againe, and béeing verie wrathfull that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued such a blowe, hée let loose his shéelde, and stepped to the Gyaunt with his sworde in both his handes, and stroke him vpon his left shoulder, and the blowe glaunced, but if it had chaunced to haue stroke him full, at that blowe hee had made an ende of the battaile, but for all that hée remayned verie sore hurt, and his swoorde fell to the grounde, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manye sparkes of fire. The Gyaunt was verye much amazed at the power and strength of his enimie, but not in such sorte, that it shoulde cause in him anie weaknesse, but rather with a newe courage hée retourned vnto his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne battaile, with so greate courage as though he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued no hurt at all, at that time both of them stroke the one at the other with great strength &amp; power, although the Gyaunt was verie much disturbed by reason of his wounds, but yet for all that he shewed greate prowesse. This battayle and contencion betwéene them continued more then two long houres, in which time there went from his
<pb facs="tcp:13973:263"/>
wounds great aboundance of bloud, so in the ende, whether with werinesse of the long contempt, or with the losse of so much bloud, the Gyaunt could not kéepe himself on foote, but fell downe vnto the ground, as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were dead. The prince who had thought he had bene dead, did not receue much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, for that he was a reasonable Gyant, and of much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and courtesie. But yet in great hast he went to pul of his helme, and then he hard that out of the Castel they began to crye out and sayde, holde thy hande euill knight, and doe not make an ende to kill our naturall Lord, for in doing it thou shalt dye the death. And loking about him to sée who it was that spake vnto him those threatning wordes, he saw desen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe at a broade payre of stayres to the number of fiftene knights, who with a great rushing and noyse, being all very well armed, and semed to be very good knights, for that they were of a good disposition. And as he saw them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, with a furious courage, he encountred them and sayde. The name which you haue giuen me, I will make that hereafter you shall vse it no more, or els I will lose my lyfe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he put himselfe amongst them, with so great furye, as the cruell and hongery Wolfe doeth amongst a company of simple sheepe, and stroke the first with so great strength, that with the fury of his arme, he cloue his head a sunder in the middest, but yet he could not let but receue great hurt of his person, for that he was assalted by them, who desired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the death of theyr Lorde. The other Gyant cryed out against them, reuiling them with maruailous foule words, for that one alone knight should so long endure aliue in their handes. But this miserable people did not know with whom they made this contension, for if they had knowne &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode who was before them, they would not haue hilde this battaile, for they did not know how they had to do with the sonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> against whome the Diamant Rockes doe seme weake, as it apeared by the great strength he had in wounding of them. For some he slew out right, and some were very sore hurt, but notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of those which did remaine, he was assalted very desperately, but this Greke
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13973:263"/>
séeing still their contention, his courage the more increased, and tooke his sword in both his hands, &amp; stroke one of them so terrible a blow vpon the shoulder, that his sworde passed downe vnto his wast: so there remained but fiue of them, who altogether did strike at him such fiue blowes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it made him to stoope with both his knées to the ground, the which the Prince did feele verye much, neuerthelesse with greate strength he arose vp againe, in spite of all them that stroke him, and it was vnto their harme, for that he was not so soone vp, when he stroke him that was next hand so terrible a blow vpon his helme, that he cut him downe vnto the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke in two péeces, and casting about his sword ouer his head, he stroke another on the necke, that he made his heade flye from his shoulders, to the ground, the other thrée which remained, séeing the great slaughter that was made on their companions, and likewise themselues to be hurt and werye, they procured to runne away vp the staires, and they think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to flye from their death, fell into the like daunger, and rather worse, for that at the head of the staires, they met with the other Giant who was descending downe, giuing terrible shrikes, and meeting them with his mightie cutting sworde, he cut them all to péeces saying. Take the payment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such cowardes doo deserue. So leauing them dead, he descended downe the staires, and found this strong <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> leaning with his breast vpon the pomell of his sword, easing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe somwhat of the great trauaile passed, but it indured with him but a small time, for that the Gyant lift vp his broade and mightie sword, and went toward him to strike him, but the Prince stoode still tarrying his comming, and was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaile more by pollicie then by strength, fearing that the wearinesse which he had receiued should bée the occasion that his force should faile him and his courage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, if that peraduenture he should haue to doe with more then he had at that present before him. So when the Gyant came whereas the Prince was, he discharged his mightie stroke for to wound the Gréeke, but he with a light leap clée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe from the furie of that blowe, and closing with
<pb facs="tcp:13973:264"/>
him in great hast, he stroke him vpon one of his legs, that his harnesse deceiued him, and he wounded him vnto the bone, but for all that the giant did not leaue to lay vpon him very thicke blowes, as one that was very expert in that exercise. It was great delight to sée how the Gréeke did cléere himself with great lightnesse from his blowes without féeling anie wearinesse. The Gyaunt with the greate furie that he had, made great hast in striking at the Prince, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that he waxed wearie, and was verie sore vexed and troubled, and when the Gréeke perceiued his faint and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled stomacke, he entred in &amp; out with him with great light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, procuring for to hurt the Gyant, and did it with greate ease, although the Gyant did not let likewise with great has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to strike mightie and terrible blowes at him. This Prince procured still to sée if he could finde time, that alonely with one blow he might make an end of the battaile without any perill to himselfe, notwithstanding he did not let to wounde him where he might, in many places the Gyant was all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with bloud which issued out of the woundes hée had, and although they were not greate, yet they were trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. This battaile indured a long time, for which cause, and the greate losse of bloud, this Gyaunt beganne to waxe feeble and weake. When the Gréeke perceiued this, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he did not make his assault with so great hast as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and although he was wearie with striking so manye blowes, which brought him almost to an ende, yet nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with great hast he stroke the Gyant many and terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes, then the Gyant séeing himselfe so ill intreated, and knowing his end to be at hand, he cryed out making a great noise, which range through the aire, blaspheming against his Gods, and called all his Pages and household seruaunts, and sayd: O you lost creatures why doe you not come and helpe me? At whose noise and calling there came together aboue thirtie seruaunts, some with clubbes and staues, and some with stones, and compassed him rounde about, throwing stones at him so thicke, that hée coulde not approch vnto them, for they durst not come nigh vnto him, the stones ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:13973:264"/>
more thicker vpon the Gréeke; then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> froson haile stones doth in the moneth of March, throwne downe by force out of obscure and tempestuous clouds, and although his armour were verie strong, yet for all that he did not let to receiue greate trouble by reason of those thicke blowes. The Greeke went towards them for to hurt them, but they ran in at the doores to saue themselues, as commonly they who doth baite a Bull with dartes in a trenched place, after they haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, they hide themselues in corners to saue them from the furie of his hornes, and tourning himselfe they straight waye torment him behinde: in this sorte did his seruaunts intreate this Gréeke, till such time that hée was constrained by his ire to goe agaynst them, shaking off his sworde, then as before they ranne awaie. So the Gréeke returned where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Gyaunt was, who was so wearie, that hée could not remoue out of the place where hée had lefte him, who clée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himselfe from one terrible blowe which the furyous Gyant stroke at him, presently retourned the lyke blowe, which lighted vpon his left shoulder, that hée opened the hard harnesse and the flesh vnto the bone. This blowe was not so soone giuen him, when that with great hast he stroke him with both his handes on his breast, and by reason that hée was weake and wearie, hée néeded not much strength to ouerthrowe him to the ground, who receiued on his backe a terrible fall. The Gréeke lykewise with the great strength that hée put to ouerthrowe him, fell to the grounde, but it fell out better with him then hée thought, for that falling, he rowled a good waye from the place whereas the Gyant fell, and straight waie with a trice hée arose vp againe, and found himselfe all to be compassed againe with the seruants, who battered at him with staues and stones, as many times a wall is battered with Artillerie. Some of them woulde haue runne and embrased themselues with him, thinking that he had not beene so nimble as he was, but when they sawe him on foote, they retyred backe againe with greate feare. At this time the Gyaunt beganne to arise, although it was
<pb facs="tcp:13973:265"/>
with great trouble, but the Gréeke who was verie angrie to see himselfe so intreated with boies and seruants, with a trice he was with the Gyant, and before that he could put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on foote, he stroke him so terrible a blow with both his hands vpon the head, that he cut it in two péeces, and he fell dead to the ground. These seruantes when they sawe that their Lord was slaine, they all ranne awaie making a great noise. This worthie Greeke when he saw that the fierce gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was dead, and that he was cleere from that conflict, hee went towards that place whereas he left the first Gyant, &amp; when he came vnto him he pulled off his healme, at which time he heard one which from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

At that time the Gyant was somewhat come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for by reason that the aire had catched him, he had some remembraunce, of the which the Prince was verie gladde, and turning vnto the Ladie he sayd.

So they entred into a faire large hal, which led them into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, whereas was an old giantesse of a maruailous good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, who made great lamentation, for that it was tolde her of all that had passed in the Castle, who had in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany more then thirtie Ladyes and Gentlewomen, which did comfort her: to whom the sister of the Giant sayd, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this Knight, to whom the Gods hath giuen so much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, doth demaund the Princesse of the <hi>Scitas</hi> our prisoner, for whose cause, all this harme and euill happened vnto vs. This Lady with a grieuous sigh beholding the Prince said. O cruell murderer of my welbeloued sonnes, and faithfull seruaunts: make an ende to execute thy crueltie, showing
<pb facs="tcp:13973:266"/>
the same and like vpon this vnfortunate Quéene; whose po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer hath profited her very little. This good Gréeke béeing tender harted, when he heard so great lamentation he sayde: Quéene, doe not meruaile, for those which doo offend God, doo hope of no other thing, but punishment for their sinnes, &amp; so those that liue with pride, cannot let but to be payed with the like. I doo desire thée to commaund the Princesse to bée giuen vnto me, whom thou hast in prison, for that she doth not deserue to be intreated amongest you as a prisoner, but as a Lady. The Quéene without giuing him any aunswer, threw vnto him two keyes which she had tied at her girdle, and afterward sayd vnto him: Under these thou shalt finde that which thou seekest, and enioye the glory which thou hast got by this occasion, til such time as he doth come, who with his mightie arme, will reuenge the great wrong, which thy good fortune hath brought to passe. The Gréek tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keies, and being led by that Gentlewoman (who wold neuer leaue him) they went out of that parler, and went vp a payre of staires, which brought them vnto another hall of no lesse bignesse then the first, and with the keye she opened a doore, and sayd: Enter O Knight, which hast as much crueltie as prowesse and strength, and there thou shalt finde her whome thou séekest. Faire Gentlewoman sayd <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> I doo not determine to enter, but that your highnesse shall goe before. This Princesse giuing a grieuous sigh entered in first, and brought him into a faire chamber, and then opened another doore, wherin they entred into another hall, very well garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with many and faire windowes, which was towardes the Sea: at one of the which, there sate the Princesse, who was combing of her faire haire, and with her there was a Damsell, the which helde the glasse in her hands before her. When <hi>Rosicleer</hi> saw her, he receiued great pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght, and for that the Princesse shoulde knowe him, he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off his healme, and straight waye she knewe him, and with great alteration she arose vp against him, and sayde. Oh Gréeke Prince, the flower of all Knighthoode in the

So <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and the Princesses went out of that chamber, &amp; the faire Giantesse folowed them, the Princesse had great desire to sée <hi>Meridian,</hi> but it was not long after, that in the case as before was told you he came.

               <p>The Gréeke Prince with amorous words and swéete perswasions, caused the Quéene and her Daughter to sit downe at the Table to eate, béeing somewhat comforted, for that they knewe howe that <hi>Brandafidel</hi> was without daunger of death, for that of them and of all the rest that were in the Castle, he was verye well beloued for his great vertue.</p>

The Gréeke Prince looked out at one of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes which was ouer the gate of the Castle, to see howe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And the King was mounted vpon a mightie Elephant, who seeing that the bridge was not let downe, neither the gates open, he began to tell out aloud, making a meruailous noise, and commaunded his people to knocke verye harde at the ring of the gate.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke Prince, although his monstrous great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse did seeme to him terrible, yet he estéemed no more his furie, then as though he had bene very humble and milde, neither forced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

reuenge thy anger vpon the ring of the gate, thou must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that thou canst not enter in heere, but thou must make thy conquest of the entrie with the force of thy strong arme. The Gyant being greatly amazed of that he heard, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou wert (sayd <hi>Rosicleer</hi>) but now for thy great pride and foolish hardinesse thou hast lost it, and it is now in my power: Where be my sonnes that kept it, sayd the Gyant, what is become of them? The Grake sayd, one of them is slaine by the strength of my arme, &amp; the other yeelded, fulfilling that which he doth owe vnto the order of knighthoode, as it becommeth a good knight. Oh immortall Gods, sayd the king, is it possible to be true that I doe beare, that so vile a wretch as thou art should be the occasion of so much harme? O thou traitor and false knight, command the gates to be opened, for that thy great strength shall little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile thee, if they be opened vnto mee. And if thou doest not command them to be open, I will so vse the matter, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the deapth of the meate, nor towers of the castell, shal be able to make anie resistance against me for thy defence. And with the great madnesse which he had, he drew out his great and broad cutting sword, and with both his hands be stroke at the gate, as though he woulde cut it in peeces, but all his labour was in vaine, for that the gates were verie strong, and therewith the Prince <hi>Rosicleer</hi> determined to descende downe into the Court, and commaunded the <hi>Troyan</hi> that in the meane time that the battaile endured, that he should haue great care of the keeping of the gate, and tooke his healme of <hi>Argolio</hi> and laced it on, and also a strong and well stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sheeld, and when he came vnto the gate, he saw that the king was a foote, &amp; beating at the gate with all his strength, to whom the Prince sayd.</p>
               <p>Tarrie a while and I will open the gate vnto thée, make not so much hast. And in saying these words he opened a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,

the Gyaunt when he sawe it, with an earnest furye hée thrust himselfe in thereat. The worthy Prince séeing him so hastie, with both his hands he thrust at him, and made him to recoyle backe a good way, and sayd. Kéepe thée backe thou furious beast, for heere thou hast no entring without my ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense. To whom the Gyant sayd: What dost thou thinke or pretend to doo? To make battaile with thée sayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, therfore if thou wilt enter into the battaile, thou must come in alone. I am verye well content sayd the King, the which he spake with a great deale more meekenesse, than his greate pride did giue him license, or could suffer, and all to see him within the castle: for that he was perswaded with himselfe, that if he were once within, there were not in all the world one Knight that could ouercome him, neither make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistaunce against his power. So <hi>Rosicleer</hi> commaunded that the gate might be open, whereat the Giaunt entred, and also his great Elephant. When the King was entred, the <hi>Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> had great care and diligence to shut the gate again, whom when the King knew, the more was his griefe: but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great anger that he had, he made no stay, till such time as he came into the great Court, and there he mounted vppon his furious and great beast, and <hi>Argolio</hi> brought vnto his Lord his horse, and without profiting himselfe of the stirrop, he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the saddle. So when he was on horse back, he layd hand on his sword, and the Gyant on his great cutting fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon, &amp; either of them assaulted the other, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mortal blowes.

Then the king said, what a diuell should this be that hath caused so great alteration in our horses, hath héere passed by anie fiend, or doth there any diuell remaine lodged amongest these bushes, well let it bée what it shall be, for with the fauour of God, if I dooe méete him I will giue him his paiment, for scarring of our horses,

for that I doe not feare him, and I thanke God I neuer fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red neither diuel nor man. These words he spake with great courage and maiestie. The Emperour in hearing him speake these words, he could not refraine himselfe but he must néeds laugh.

This valiant Greeke who was neuer dismaied at the sight of anie such monster, when he sawe so deformed a beast comming towards him, he chéered vp his horse, &amp; pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him with his spurres, and giuing a great shout he drewe out his mightie cutting sword and did abide the furie of the monster, who came roaring like a Bull, and discharged his great club vpon the Gréeke, who with a light leape caused by pricking of his horse, he cléered himselfe of that blow, that his club fell downe to the ground, and as wel as he could he chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his horse againe, and entered in with the monster on the one side, and gaue him so terrible an encounter, that he made him to fall flat to the ground, and by reason that the strength of the monster was terrible, it could not be but that the horse

The Emperour looked to sée where the king was, and he saw him beholding the terrible battaile, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so how <hi>Victorando</hi> was on foot throwne downe by his horse with the great feare he had, but this looking about of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was quickly forgotten, for that the monster arose and came against him againe with his great trée aloft, readie to discharge it vpon him, but he determined to let it slip by, as before, and therwith to enter in with him and to strike him, and so he did, for the blowe was not so soone past as he step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in, and stroke a full blowe at his thigh, but he made but a small wound, by reason of the hardnesse of haire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made great defence, which caused the Emperour to meruaile much thereat. This diuellish monster when he sawe his owne bloud, in a mad rage he laide about him with his great club, procuring with his terrible and thicke blowes to destroye the Emperour. The great hast which the monster made to strike the Emperour was such, that he was constrained to vse all his pollicie and lightnesse for to cléere himselfe from those terrible blowes, he stroke them so fast, and neuer lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie time of dauntage when that he might hurt him, but still continually stroke and cut him on those hairie legs, that hée made more then sixe wounds, in such sort, that the grounde whereas they were was couered with the bloud of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, the monster séeing himselfe so troubled, and onely with one knight, he began to double his blowes in so great hast, that the Emperour was not able to cleere himselfe from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that needs he must receiue one of them, and if it had not bene but that the Emperour did ward it with the edge of his sworde and with his st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Do you account that a little blow sayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, then doe not I know what is a greate and a mightye blowe. Then the Emperour sayd: where is that diuellish monster become, tell me if you can, or if you haue séene him goe awaie: he hath throwen himselfe into hell said the king, for hard by yonder houses he put himselfe into a caue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I could not follow him, and of truth I doe tell you, if I could enter in where he entered, I would not, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I thinke he is amongst and in companie with the diuells, &amp; therewith the Emperour was mounted a horse back, and was so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; so full of cholar, that rockes and mountaines were not sufficient to make resistaunce against his strength, and so with a trice he rode vnto the place whereas the monster en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in, and without anie foresight he alighted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horse, and procured to take awaie that great stone that was at the mouth of the caue, the which he did without anie diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultnesse, but yet for all that he coulde not finde which waye he might enter in thereat, but like vnto a Lyon with greate anger, fretting and chafing, he went round about that rocke

to sée if he could finde anie entrie, at the last he found a great clift in the rocke, and looking in thereat, he sawe that greate monster, wheras he lay all along on the floore, and séeing him he sayd: Oh traitor and a destroier by the high waies, oh thou infernall diuell, the strong and fast shutting in this rock shal little auaile thée, and thinke that thou shalt not lie long ther at thine ease. So he began with his hands to proue if he could teare that rocke to make waie where he might enter, and put so much strength vnto it, and againe with his rage, that hée tore a great part of it awaie, in such sort that the king was verie much amazed at the great force &amp; strength y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shewed, and when he had done this, he looked againe at the monster and sayd: Oh euill and diuellish creature, what doest thou thinke (although thou art in hell) to escape my hands, &amp; going from thence he went round about the rocke againe, to sée if he could finde where with lesse difficultnesse he might enter, but he could not finde anie, in the meane time by reason that ther was no noise, the monster had thought that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had bene gone, and came vnto the clift of the rocke to sée if he could heare or sée him. The Emperour who retourned vnto that same place againe, &amp; sawe the monster in such sort at the clift that he might strike him with his sword, with great hast &amp; good diligence he cast at him so terrible a thrust in at the cleft, which chaunced vpon his vnarmed head, that it passed through downe to his threat, in such sort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great monster fell downe dead to the ground. The Emperour did well knowe that he had wounded the monster, but he belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it was not with so great strength as to ouerthrow him, for that the cleft was verie narowe whereas he thrust the foine, and for to sée what succéeded of that blow, he knéeled downe and looked in, and sawe the monster lie all along on the floore starke dead, the Emperour séeing him in that sort, sayd: What did this diuell thinke that he should not paye me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> villanous blowe which he gaue mée. When the King heard him saie these wordes he alighted from his Elephant to sée what hadde happened, and he sawe him lye all along dead vpon the ground, &amp; of his straunge and great stature hée

So in this sort he trauailed a while till it chanced one morning at such time as the Sun began his accustomed iourney, that he must passe a great &amp; mightie riuer ouer a bridge, and at the end thereof there was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse wrought after the fashion of a Bulwarke, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at the beginning it was verie bigge, hauing in the midst of it a great tower, with a louer hole, and vpon the same was put a standard, which with the winde was mooued from the one side to the other. The Prince following his iourney o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the bridge, without anie impediment would haue passed forwards on his waie, but by anie meanes he could not, by reason of a great, broade, and déepe ditch, which was made on the other side, beginning from the Riuer, and making a compasse lyke a whoope, which inuironed all the whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, and came againe and ioyned vnto the sayde Riuer, on the one side, so that the fortresse remayned in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest, and there was no other waye to take, but that they must néedes passe through the fortresse. So when the Prince came vnto a verie strong gate of yron, hée tooke the King in his hande and gaue three greate blowes, at the noise wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was a windowe opened, whereat there appeared a Gentlewoman of a middle age, who séemed to haue her eyes swollen with wéepings, who said.</p>

And in saying those words she shut the windowe in greate hast and went in. The Prince cast about his horse towards the right hand whereas he sawe a piller of the height of a man, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at hanged a rich horne, and by it a péech of parchment rowled vp, and laying hand vpon the horne he could not moue it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did striue mightely to doe it, and vnderstanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first he must vndoe the Parchment and read that which was written in it, he tooke it and vnrowled it, and saw that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained that which followeth.</p>

Then loue which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually seeketh occasions, did on a time set before this duke a Gentlewoman, which thing seemed to be wrought by the order of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goddesse <hi>Venus.</hi> Oh what great feare this knight

had for to discouer vnto her all his heart: but in the end, by the great industrie of this Gentlewoman, there was order giuen that these two louers should meete together. Heere I will not detaine them that shall read this, in telling of the great delight which both of them receiued to sée themselues together, but such it was that she was made a Ladye. This faire <hi>Damelis,</hi> for that she coulde not at her ease enioye her <hi>Velegrato,</hi> she did determine to leaue her own natural coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey &amp; father, and with this intention, one night being with her louer, she cast her armes about his necke and sayde. Oh my sweete and welbeloued friend, séeing that the soueraigne Gods haue bene to me so grateful, that I doo deserue to haue a louer, let me not finde in thée ingratitude, for that I cannot passe my time, except continually I enioye thy fight, and doo not muse my Lord at this that I doo say, for that the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much loue that I haue to you, doth constrayne me to make it manifest, and this beléeue of a certaintie, that if thy sight be absent from me, if will be the occasion, that my hart shal lacke his vitall recreation. And you doo well know how that the King my father doth beare you no good will, which will be the occasion, that we cannot enioye the one the other, as my heart desireth: for the which, I haue determined (if you doo thinke well thereof) to leaue both my father and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to goe and liue with you alone in a straunge Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

The Duke delighted in no other thing, but to goe a hunting with his Squires and Pages, leauing his sweete <hi>Damelis,</hi> accompanied with her damosells in that strong house, aduising them alwayes not to open the gates, except they should aunswere vnto a watch word, and many times for her contentment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Damelis</hi> would goe and méete with the Duke at the gates. So in this order they liued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether foure yeares: but in the ende, Time who neuer rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in one degrée, did take from them their rest, giuing them double trauaile and sorrow. For that when the King her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found her missing, the sorrow and griefe was so much that he receiued, that he kept his chamber a long time, and would not come foorth of it, and if it had not bene for speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all businesse, necessarie for his kingdome, he wold (as I say) neuer haue come forth: and although he was occupied very much therein, yet could he not forget his great griefe, calling many times vpon his welbeloued daughter. All this foure yeares he passed the time in great heauinesse, which euerie day increased more his sorrow and griefe. Of all which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, a great Magitian whose name was <hi>Demofronte,</hi> by his learning came to the knowledge off, and strayght waye by his science he made a chariot to be brought, that was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by two flying Dragons, and put himselfe therein, who in a very short space, was carryed whereas this sorrowfull King dwelt, and he chaunced to come at such time as he was alone in his chamber with his accustomed sorrowe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the losse of his Daughter: and without béeing séene of any person, he entred whereas this afflicted King was, and sayd.</q>

This Magitian called at the gate, and gaue the watch word that the Duke was accustomed to giue, and when <hi>Damelis</hi> heard it, she her selfe went vnto the gate and did open it: and when she went to imbrace him, thinking it to be her louer, she sawe that it was her father, &amp; with a sodayne alteration she gaue a great shrike and retourned and put her selfe within the house. The King her father somewhat angry did folow her saying, It doth little auaile thée <hi>Damelis</hi> to run away, for that thou shalt dye in my power, paying me with thy death, the greate dishonour which my royall crowne hath receiued. So he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>followed her till he came vnto the chamber whereas her da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosells were, amongst whome this fearefull Lady did hide her selfe, who séeing her to enter in that sort, they arose to sée what was the occasion of so great chaunge and trouble. <hi>Floria,</hi> straight way did know the King, who had a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenaunce, &amp; she fearing the harme which shuld hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto her Lady put her selfe ouer her &amp; gaue terrible and loud shrikes.

The king who sawe them in this sort make her defence, with his left hand he pulled them off from her, some by the haire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, and some by the shoulders, for to make waie that hee might execute his determined purpose, and none to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie resistaunce against him. <hi>Floria</hi> when she sawe the King determined to kil his daughter, like vnto a Lionesse she hung about his necke and sayd: Oh mad dogge, what determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this that thou doest bring for to do euill vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most chast and loyall Ladie in all the world, is it a new thing for loue to vse such like déedes: vnto thy selfe may be attributed the occasion of all this euill, and thou art in the fault thereof, for that thou wert so malitious and so full of mischiefe, that she durst not giue thee to vnderstand of her sodaine loue. The words and teares of <hi>Floria</hi> did little profit with the king, but rather like a wilde Boare in the wildernesse, béeing compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a companie of dogges doth shake himselfe: euen so the king did shake his members, and threw <hi>Floria</hi> from him, and with double wrath he did procure to execute his furie, out the damsells with terrible shrikes, sometimes one and

sometimes another did disturbe him, till such time as with his cruell hande betwéene the Damosells, he thrust in the poynt of his sharpe sword, and with the force of his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arme he thrust it, till it passed through her breast, &amp; came forth at her backe. (The wise <hi>Democrites</hi> when that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the greatest contentment in his heart, would weepe to thinke vpon the great vnquietnesse and discontentment that should followe: euen so this vnhappie <hi>Damelis,</hi> when shée was most at quiet and delight with her prosperous life, then fortune did turne it vnto her sodaine death.) At this time the Magitian came into the chamber, and when he saw the king contrary vnto that which he promised him, had done y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full act, he began to blaspheme against himselfe, for that hée had bene the occasion of all that euill, and with an yrefull voyce he sayd.

And in saying these words he drew a booke out of his bosome, and reading on it, hee made a great cloud to appeare in the skyes very black, which was brought by terrible and hastie windes, the which came with a very great tempest and storme: and when the skies waxed cléere, then was there séene héere this fortresse, where in this cruell King of <hi>Arabia</hi> is inchanted, and this sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Velegrato</hi> and his Damsells: and he that is desirous to sée how and in what sort, let him blowe this horne, and straight waye the gates shall be open, but heere I doo aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise him, that the going out will be doubtfull.</q>

<pb facs="tcp:13973:281"/>
procéeded two mightie great and huge hornes verye sharpe. Her spéech was very perfect and cleere, and made aunswere in any language that was spoken vnto her. She would make battaile with none, but it should procéede of questions and aunsweres, and as <hi>Galtenor</hi> doth affirme and say, that the inchaunted <hi>Merlin</hi> was shut vp in that beast. This furious beast when she saw that the Prince went towards that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dore she put her selfe before him, and disturbed his going: this couragious Knight shrowded vnder his shield, did abide her comming. Then the beast sayd. Stay thy selfe and stand still <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and doo not trouble thy selfe so much, for a thing, that for all the dominions and Empires of thy father thou woldest not haue begun, neither haue giuen the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. Let mée first knowe what did mooue thée to enter into this infernall house, whether thou wert mooued by thy great courage and strength, or pretence to set at libertie those that are heere detained, or for to knowe somewhat of thy linage. The Gréeke meruailed verie much when he hearde himselfe named, and of the greate reasons which the beast spake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. To whome he sayde: All that thou hast sayde and spoken of I woulde be verie gladde to atchieue and goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes with, for that thereof I shoulde gette vnto my selfe great honour, notwithstanding if thou doest know anie thing of my linage, I doe desire thée to tell me.

               <p>Giue me heerein my desire sayde this couragious knight, and for the rest, let each one as it behooueth him procure to defend himselfe. Then the beast with a smiling laughter, and as one that did make a iest of all that which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, sayde: Although it will profite thee verye lyttle

               <p>Thou art sonne and nephew to the two mightiest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours in all the world, and the most adorned with all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Thy mother is the most worthiest Matrone that euer hath bene, and none like, but she which was kept for thee, if thou hadst not entred into this Fortresse. Thus in fewe words, I haue told thee of thy descent, and from whence thou dost proceede if thou wilt vnderstand it: and more I doo say vnto thee, that thou art not worthie to accompt thy selfe of such a linage, for that they be Christians, and thou art a Pagan, therefore aske me no more, for I haue tolde thée i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And now séeing I haue accomplished thy will and desire, haue a respect what thou wilt doo with thine own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for if thou wilt retourne without making any battaile with me, thou must of two things choose to doo one of them, which is to returne backe againe that waye which thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest, or els to declare vnto me the resolution of a question, which I will demaund of thée. The couragious Gréek said, For the one, which is to returne backe againe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way which I came, thou shalt vnderstand that I will not graunt vnto, and touching the second, say on whatsoeuer it be thy plesure that I shall declare, and I will make thée aunswere thereof if I can and when I cannot with my tongue, héere is my sword that doth know how to make relation of questions, be they neuer so obscure and hard.</p>
               <p>Thy sword <hi>Claridiano,</hi> sayd the beast, will do as all other haue done héertofore, that haue taken vpon them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, their masters remaining dead, in recompence of their bolde hardinesse. Leaue off these reasons sayd <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and demaund what thy plesure is, or els suffer me to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on my iourney, and if of necessitie for to make an end héereof, I must haue battaile with thée, come on let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin without any more tarrying. Hast thou so much hast said the beast, I doo promise thée that quickly thou shalt sée thy selfe in that perplexitie, that thou shalt repent thy speede.

This question did put this valiant warrior in great thought in himselfe, his eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in saying these words hee imbraced his shéeld, and firming his sword in his hande, hee began his terrible and timerous battaile. The furious beast hissing like vnto a Snake, did withdrawe himselfe somwhat backwards, and with great violence did stretch out her long necke, and bearing her head somewhat lowe, she pretended with her hornes to make her encounter, the Prince stood still till that the beast drew somewhat nigher him, and wold not at that time abide the furiousnesse of the blowe, but rather cléering himselfe from it by stepping on the one side, with a light leape towards the left hand, and passing this furious beast by missing her blowe, he stroke an ouerthwart blow at her with so great furie and force, which lighted vpon the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of her taile (that although she carried it verie low for her most aduauntage, for that therewith she did most offend and defend) yet for all that the Princes fortune was such, that the blow chanced betwéene two scales, &amp; with a trice it was cut a sunder in the middest: Oh how furious and outragy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was this deformed beast when she felt her selfe so sore wounded, and turning her selfe as the wind against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince before he could make his defence, that needs he must receiue vpon his strong armour a blowe with those long and sharpe hornes, the blowe was giuen him with so great force, that it ouerthrew him to the ground, and seeing him in this sorte, with a diuellish rage and ire she ranne towards him procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to claspe him betwixt her sharpe clawes, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her great furie and rage, she had not so much time, but passed by and could not fasten anie hold on him. The Greeke
<pb facs="tcp:13973:283"/>
was meruailously troubled at that mightie blowe which hée receiued, the beast with double furie returned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight to strike him as shee did before, the Gréeke did abide his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, with his swoord verie firme in his hande, and at such time as the beast would strike her blowe, bearing her head verie lowe. The Prince at that present was not idle, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his mightie blow with great strength, and stroke the beast betwixt both the horns, but by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse his sworde could not enter, yet he made her to decline her head to the ground spite of her teeth. This furious beast seeing that she had missed her blowe, iourned that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of her taile and stroke him in the middest of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a terrible blow, in such sorte that if she had had the rest, she had parted him a sunder with the furiousnesse thereof, but for all that it made him fall to the grounde, he was not so soone fallen downe, when that the monster stroke him with her sharpe hornes verie strongly, yet for all that there was no signe made on his armour by reason of the greate hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but all the harme was by the strength of the blow, his bodie was somewhat brused. Oh holie God, &amp; with what ire was this Greek brought in subiection, at that time if a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and hard mountaine had béene before him, he would haue torne it in péeces. Now was there no resistaunce to be made against his mightie cutting swoord, he threw his shéeld from him to the grounde, and tooke his swoorde fast in both his handes, and abode the comming of this beast, who retourned to strike him agayne, verie much meruailing to sée how lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hir blowes did profit her. The knight stoode still verye firmely in his place, and when the beast put downe her head, hee discharged his blowe on her, and chaunced vpon the one side of her head, that her harde skull and strong skinne was insufficient to withstand the sharpnesse of his swoorde, but that it cut the flesh and carried awaie one of her hornes, wherewith this beast remained verie sore hurt and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who féeling her self in that perplexitie, she withdrew her self backe and sayd.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Claridiano</hi> and Pagan dogge, doe not trust too much

much in thy great strength, neither in that thou hast done me so much harme, for I will doe so much that thou shalt not returne vnto <hi>Grecia,</hi> thy naturall Countrie, and lesse shalt thou inioye the <hi>Pastora,</hi> for that as yet thou hast not proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of my sharpe clawes and nailes, nor of their furie. The Prince answered and sayd: Diuell make thy defence by all the meanes thou canst, and all shall bee lyttle inough. And in saying these wordes he firmed his sworde in his hand, then this furious monster began to make a new noise in hissing, and approched towardes the Prince, making as though shée woulde strike him with her horne that remayned, and when she came nigh him, vppon a sodaine shée tourned her tayle with so great lightnesse, that the Prince could not make his defence, and stroke him vpon the helme in such sort that shée ouerthrew him to the ground almost without anie remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, the Prince was not so soone fallen but this monster leapt vnto him with hir hard and sharpe nailes, and griped his hard harnes, thinking with them to teare him all to pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but she did him no more harme but onely wearied him, in tumbling him vp and downe, yet this inuincible Knight was not without great care to prouide for himselfe and did not loose one iot of his strength and courage, but rather with a double stomack and furious courage procured to cléere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of the beasts nailes, and with the great strength and pollicie that he vsed, in spite of the monster he cléered himself, and béeing at libertie, with great lightnesse he arose on his féete, he was not so soone vp when the beast stroke him with his one horne which remained, in such sort that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to fall downe againe to the grounde, the beast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to catch him againe in her clawes, but she coulde not, for that the Prince with great lightnesse rose vp againe, and hauing his sword in his hand he tarried her comming, the beast made a shew as though he would strike at the Prince with his horne, but when she sawe him with his sworde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, she raised her selfe vp on her hinder feete, and fell vppon the Prince, imbracing him with her nailes about his backe scratching and pinching his armour, but it didde lyttle

The furious monster when shée felt her selfe so sore wounded, queased the Prince so harde betwéene hir clawes, that hée thought verily shee would haue broken all his bones in his bodie, and if it should haue indured long in this order, it had not beene possible to haue escaped the death, but that mortall wounde did so trouble the beast, &amp; was so gréeuous vnto her, that she was constrained to let him loose, and to withdrawe her selfe backe, for to put some remedie therein, and sayde vnto the Prince: Oh thou Infidell without all faith, thou hast slaine mee, but tarrie yet there doeth remaine in me courage for to make thee that thou shalt not goe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing of thy selfe, and bearing hir head verie lowe she pressed vnto the Prince, thinking to take him with hir horne and to ouerthrowe him, with pretence to get him againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt hir clawes and nailes, and although she was dying yet not to leaue him till she had torne him all too péeces. This couragious knight did abide her comming, and perceyuing her deceit, when hee thought that shee would strike him hee stepped on the one side, and in the passing the Prince stroke her so mightie a blowe vppon the necke, that it cut the lame a sunder, so that that horrible and wonderfull monster fell downe dead to the grounde.

This false inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did still stand in this contention to get the ring from him, and contended in such sort that he forgot the respect that hee

should haue vnto Ladyes and Gentlewomen, and stroke her with his right hand that was armed such a buffet vpon the chéeke, that her fantasticall bodie gaue a great fall vnto the ground, shée was not so soone fallen, when that with a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous noise she threw her selfe into that dolefull Sepulcher, making a terrible and wonderfull howling within, and this vnhappie king bare her companie with his gréeuous lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, of the which the Prince had great compassion, and it séemed vnto him that he heard a voice which came forth of the tombe, which did offer to talke vnto him, &amp; that he might vnderstand his reasons he drew nigh vnto the tombe, &amp; heard that he sayd these words: Oh knight borne in <hi>Grecia,</hi> &amp; nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and brought vp in <hi>Trapobana,</hi> if thou wilt go out of this place and make an end of my continual torments, procure to giue thrée blowes vpon this my Sepulchar, with the which thou shalt deliuer thy selfe and me likewise, and all those that are héere put in this infernal lodging. This inuincible young man sayd: There is so little truth in this house, that I stand in doubt whether I may beléeue thy words or not, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing tell me who thou art, then shall I know whether I may giue credit vnto thy wordes.

To whom <hi>Merlin</hi> said: <hi>Trebatio</hi> is thy grandfather, and thy father is the great <hi>Alfebo,</hi> &amp; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Claridiano</hi> is thy mother, from whome <hi>Galtenor</hi> did steale thée, in companie with thy sister, the most fairest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all the world. And in saying these words he helde his peace, and with dolorous grones he began to curse himselfe, and it was so gréeuous that the Prince withdrewe himselfe because he would not heare it, &amp; without anie more tarrying he embraced his shéeld and laide hand vpon his good sword,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:286"/>
and with great violence he went vnto the Sepulcher, and as he would haue stroke therat, there appeared before him a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, the which the Prince tooke to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant that he slew in the mountaine <hi>Nabateos,</hi> who stroke the Prince vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brest with both his hands y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him to recoile backe a great way, whether he would or not: notwithstanding with great discreation he kept himselfe vpright, &amp; with wonderful light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, accompanied with no lesse anger, he threw his shéeld at his back, &amp; tooke his sword in both his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; went to strike the gyant a mortall blow, at which time there appered before him a whole legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diuells, with flesh hooks in their hands, with the which they did torment him. The valiant Gréeke with great wrath and double force put himselfe amongest them, striking on euery side such terrible blowes, that in spite of them he came vnto the tombe, and with great lightnesse he stroke on it two blowes, but he had no time to strike the third, for that this diuellish companie did put him from it w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> their terrible assaults and striking of him. Oh in what great trauaile and perplexitie this knight found himselfe amongst this wicked and diuellish generation, for to defend himselfe, that they might not driue him from the Tombe, and tooke great courage, and stretching forth his mightie and strong arme, hée so flour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:13973:286"/>
that there was in the Chariot certaine Knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen depriued of their vnderstanding. Likewise he saw a man with a whip in his hand, who did gouern the Dragons and that furious monster, who with a loud voyce said. Nephew vnto <hi>Trebatio,</hi> doo not thou thinke that thy strength is sufficient, for to set at libertie, and to cleere out of paine this vnnaturall and cruell King, and in saying these words, he whipped forwards those terrible Dragons, and with a trice they vanished out of the Princes sight, leauing him somewhat troubled, and not without great reason.</p>

His squire did not looke for his retourne so quickly, but layde him downe vpon the grasse and fel a sleepe. The Prince with his foote awaked him, who so soone as he had opened his eyes, he looked as one that had bene scarred. The warlike Gréeke demaunded his horse, and mounting on him, he tooke his way towards <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> and continuallye had in his imagination the names of his grandfather, father and mother, with intent to go towards <hi>Greece,</hi> with all hast possible. So hée trauailed in a great confusion whether it should be true or not, whith they tolde him, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours should be his grandfather and father. Likewise hée had griefe to sée himselfe subiect vnto <hi>Cupide.</hi> So with these and such like thoughts, he came vnto <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> whereas he was meruailously well receiued of the King and Quéene, likewise of the Princesse the Kings daughter, who did him great honour. The Princesse straight way vnderstood wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:13973:287"/>
he came thether, and who was the occasion thereof: and when she knew that he was in his chamber in quiet, in the company of two of her Gentlewomen she went to visite him. The Gréek receiued great contentment at her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, and the Princesse with amorous and swéete words procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to knowe of him, if that were true which she had in her thought, in such sort that <hi>Claridiano</hi> did discouer vnto her, all his whole heart and pretence, saying: that he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in shepheards apparaile, to goe and sée that <hi>Pastora,</hi> the causer of all his griefe. The Princesse when she sawe that all was true she had conceiued, she had not so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion as to declare vnto him the griefe of her hart, but with a dissembling sigh she sayd. Oh loue, what great falshood is in thée: and without saying any more she remained verye pensiue, with her eyes looking downwards to the ground, &amp; dissembling her griefe, she did offer vnto him, all fauour and diligence, such as her royall estate was able to giue, which was not a little, for that she was Lady of all that riuer and landes thereabouts, the Gréeke did giue her greate thankes for her gentle offer, and with this determination, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse retourned vnto her chamber, whereas with many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and grieuous thoughts, she passed away the night. So when the morning was come, she was not vnmindfull of that which she had promised, but commanded to be made shepheards apparaile very rich, and commaunded to call vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her the head gouernour of all the cattle of her father the King, whom she commaunded that the shepheard which shée would giue vnto him, should be well looked vnto, and serued in such sorte, as though it were her Fathers owne royall person.</p>
               <p>The shepheardes apparaile was quicklye made, and the Princesse one night turning into the chamber of the Gréek, asked of him, if he had determined anye other thing then that which he had tolde her, to whom he sayde, that he was still in that determination. Then the Princesse sayd, that all which he had commaunded was in a readinesse, and in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:13973:287" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that order as his pleasure was. The Gréeke gaue her great thankes, with such amorous words as her loue did deserue, and the Gréeke did straight waye apparaile himselfe in that shepheards apparaile.</p>
               <p>The Princesse when she saw him in that order, with a sorrowfull countenaunce she sayd: Knight, I cannot iudge what will come of this: but yet I am sure, that thou goest captiue onely to one, and thou dost leaue captiue more than a thousand, who are in no fault of all this thy gréefe. Oh happie <hi>Pastora,</hi> whose beautie hath so much force, to subiect and bring downe him, whom the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Giaunts coulde not conquere. Oh Gods, why doo not I leaue to be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, for to be a <hi>Pastora</hi> by the Riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> seeing that my highnesse hath not so much power to atchieue that, which the basenesse of this <hi>Pastora</hi> hath brought into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. The great desire which this newe shepheard had to see his: <hi>Pastora,</hi> was the occasion that he would not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aunswere vnto the Princesse, but rather dissembled and made as though he had heard nothing. And straight way he put in vre his departure, and taking a man with him to bée his guide, he tooke his leaue of the Princesse, &amp; did commend <hi>Fidelio</hi> vnto her kéeping.</p>
               <p>So he departed out of the Citie without any tarrieng, till he came vnto the principall house of the Kings cattell, whereas he was receiued of all the shepheardes that were there present, who showed him great courtesie, and the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the apparayle wherewith he was clad, was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to take away the iealousie that they had in him to be of some noble bloud, as appeared by his person, stature and graue countenaunce: and although they had not bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Princesse to respect him, yet they coulde not but doo all reuerence and curtesie vnto him. This new shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, after that he had giuen them thankes for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment which they gaue him, he went foorth all alone ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the fields, and in his hand a shepheards crooke. Also hée carried with him a little lute, which he vsed at times for to ease and recreate himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:288"/>This new shepheard neuer tooke anye rest till such time as he came vnto the cléere running riuer. Where vnder a great and mightie Myrtle trée, he laid himselfe downe, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his welbeloued <hi>Pastora,</hi> he lifted vp his eyes towards the heauens, and giuing a great sigh, he sayd. Oh <hi>Venus,</hi> sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is thy pleasure, that this thy new vassaile should take his first sitting place vnder a Myrtle trée, so much of thée estéemed and made of, let thy sweete voyce so occupy the eares of thy sonne <hi>Cupid,</hi> that he may vnderstand how that in his blindnesse he had litle respect vnto the highnes of my person in causing me to place my affection so baselye. Oh Gods, is it possible that any base attempt should come vnto light, but with the authoritie that belongeth vnto your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: vpon you I doo call, and vnto you I doo offer this my wounded breast, that you make sacrifice thereof, for this my boldnesse, if therein I haue offended, and therwith he leaned his backe vnto the Myrtle trée, and tooke his Lute, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play as swéetely as euer did <hi>Orpheus,</hi> when with his lute he made the infernall furyes to sleepe. <hi>Claridiano</hi> with his lute did not onely bring the furies, but also the Queene <hi>Proserpina,</hi> and the auncient <hi>Pluto,</hi> he brought into a greate perplexitie. So likewise at times he vttered his swéete voice that they which did heare it, did iudge it to be some celestiall thing, and not terrenal, and by reason that his songs did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede from his heart, it did in double wise séeme the better.

This gentle shepheard when he heard it, arose vp vpon his féete, and went out from vnder the shadowe of the Tree farther into the Sunne, and sawe that it was a shephearde and a <hi>Pastora,</hi> which were comming into the place whereas hée was, and when they came vnto him, they did salute him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteously.

We doo not know, whether that the faire beautie of <hi>Cayserlinga</hi> a <hi>Pastora,</hi> brought vp by this delightfull riuer, hath bene the occasion thereof, or any other griefe, which doth raigne in thy heart: but if it be so gentle shepheard, that your eyes haue not behelde nor séene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our <hi>Pastora,</hi> doo you procure not to sée her, that your hart be not taken captiue with the sight of her: for you shal vnderstand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is nothing to be hoped for at her hands but death, her disdaine is such This sorrowfull brother of mine, one day did sing before her with his Rebecke, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained so imprisoned with her, as euer was shepheard with

                  <hi>Pastora.</hi> And if it be thy Fortune to abide long time in these partes, thou shalt knowe the greate power that her face and countenaunce hath, and the greate crueltye that she vseth. Thou shalt see no other thing alongst all this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but shepheardes who haue forgot to gouerne and feede theyr shéepe, sitting vnder trées wounded with her greate beautie and fayrenesse, and hauing more care to make their Rebeckes fayre and trimme, then to call together their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and to delyuer them from the rauening Wolues. And by reason that shée doth knowe that her beautie is so great, shée is so proude, that shee doth make them all equall in her estimation, although not all equall in suffering. I doo promise thée of a truth (gallant shephearde) that this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dooth seeme to be no other thing, but the habitation of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupide.

               <p>Ah sister <hi>Galismena,</hi> the little accompt that thou doest make of loue, doth cause thée to speake of that, which thy sorrowfull brother doth féele. What doost thou thinke <hi>Galis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> that of this my contentious passion, I shall reape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye other benefitte, but that I haue put my loue vppon the most excellentest <hi>Pastora,</hi> that euer Nature did forme.

               <p>Then said <hi>Coridon</hi> with great anger: I would it were not thy selfe, but some other that should speake such words, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I promise thée with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of my arme, I wold make

him to know, that his words were not true, but very false. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> did interrupt their communication, and sayd. Gentle shepheards, let these your contentions cease, for that there commeth nothing of them but anger and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out: but I doo desire you that you would shew vnto me this <hi>Pastora,</hi> for that her fame doeth giue me a desire to sée her.

And in the meane tune before that thou dost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, we doo desire thée to tell vs thy name, and what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman thou art. This new shepheard aunswered and said, My name is <hi>Filipensio,</hi> and am naturally of <hi>Siria,</hi> and of the plaines of <hi>Caniphia,</hi> a kingdome of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and the great desire of these greene fieldes and fresh feeding which is héere growing about this cleere riuer, hath brought me hether, for to feede a little Cattle, the which the Gods hath made mée Lord and gouernour of. Ah shepheard sayd <hi>Coridon,</hi> (with a dolorous sigh) doest thou come to féede thy shéepe in fresh &amp; gréene medowes, and dost not know that in séeing that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stora,</hi> thou shalt féede loue within thy delicate and tender breast.</p>
               <p>So with this, and other such like pleasaunt communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they passed all that night till the next morning, and when it was time for to departe, they tooke their waye to the accustomed abiding of the beautifull <hi>Pastora,</hi> and they met in the waye manye shepheardes, who complained very much against the fury of loue. So vnder a greate Sallowe Trée, they sawe two shepheards, the one did complaine of loue very grieuously, and laye all alongst vppon the ground, and the other was playing vppon a Rebecke, and sung ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye swéetelye, wherewith <hi>Filipensio</hi> did staye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and heard that he sung as followeth.</p>

At this time, <hi>Alphesiueo</hi> did awake, and tooke an instrument in his hand which he had, and began to play on it very swéetely, singing these verses following.</p>

But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> absence of <hi>Poliphebo</hi> was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen in <hi>Tinacria,</hi> all feasts &amp; sports ceased, for that you shall vnderstand, of all his vassailes he was very well beloued. The Quéene did procure to dissemble all her griefe, for the great sorrow which her vassailes had, shewing her self more ioyful in her face, more then anie contentment she had in her heart, giuing them to vnderstand, that he had done it, for that which he did owe vnto his high linage, and the great ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he had to procure his honour and fame: and that hée had done that, which she and all them should haue desired, &amp; that they should not be sorrowfull for that, which héereafter would be the occasion of great ioye and plesure. With these and such lyke resons, she did quiet all her vassailes and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and caused them to returne vnto their accustomed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime and sports. So <hi>Poliphebo</hi> sayled forwardes on his iourney, through the déepe sea, with great delight to sée howe he had fulfilled his desire. And he sayled thrée dayes with a

very faire and prosperous winde, and the fourth daye in the euening it was very calme, and no winde at all, so that the Marriners went to take their rest, some on the poope, &amp; some in the foreships, for to ease their wearied bodyes. The prince who sate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poope of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ship, asked for his lute of his page, the which straight way was giuen him, and when he had it in his hands, he played and sung so swéetly, that it séemed to be a heauenly melodie. And being in this swéete musicke, hée heard a very lamentable crye as it were of a woman, and leauing his musicke, he gaue attentiue eare to hearken what she sayd, and he heard the voyce saye: It will little profitte thée thou cruell tyrant, this thy bolde hardinesse, for thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est well know, that I am of a lignage, that will reuenge it of thée to thy cost. Then he heard another voyce which said: Now I haue thée in my power, there is no humane power able to deliuer thée from me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Poliphebo</hi> could heare no more by reason that the barke wherein they were, passed by in so great hast. This heroycall Prince by the words he hearde, vnderstood that she was carryed by force awaye, and putting the lute away, he began to fall into a great thought, and was very heauie and sorrowfull, for that he had not receiued the order of Knighthoode, for to giue the enterprise of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture: but yet his stout stomacke could not suffer, that such compulsion and vyolence should passe without being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. And returning vnto his Page <hi>Masedonio,</hi> which was a sléepe, he strake him with his foote and awaked him, saying: What, didst not thou heare the great lamentation, and sorrowfull complaint, which a Ladye made (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) in a small bark that is passed by, and is gone forwards along the sea, (to the which <hi>Masedonio</hi> aunswered nothing, for that he was still a sléepe,) what counsayle dost thou giue me, that I may doe in so great outrage which is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes, that I may receiue no shame thereof.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:295"/>Then <hi>Poliphebo</hi> sayde, He is not a Knight which doth set his force against a woman, and doth breake the law &amp; oath made vnto Knighthoode.

would haue replyed vnto him, but the furious countenaunce of the Prince would not giue him leaue, no not once to looke vpon him. So he brought foorth his armour, and armed him selfe therewith. In the meane time the marriners had lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the boate into the sea, wherein he leaped with a hastie fury, and carried with him foure marriners for to rowe the bark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and he commaunded for to take the way towards the other that passed by. All that remained in the ship greatlye meruailed at his hardinesse. This Prince of <hi>Tinacria</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the marriners to make great hast with their oares, for that they would not loose the way which they had. So they trauailed all that night, till such time as the cleare <hi>Phoebus</hi> with his glittering beames gaue vnto them such lyght, that they might discouer and sée the other barke, although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a farre off. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> had great contentment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, hoping that very quickly they should ouertake them, but it did little profit them: for if that he did make hast to ouer take them, they were not idle, but did make as much hast to goe from them. So in this contention they trauailed til two partes of the daye was spent, at which time they sawe come after them a galley which was gouerned with eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene oares on a side, and it made so great waye, that with a trice they were with them, and he saw that ther was in hir a Knight all armed with blacke armour, and was of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle disposition and well proportioned body, who made greate hast vnto the mariners to rowe forwards.

The blacke Knight being full of anger, as he which was one of the best in all the worlde, drew out his sword, and went towards that bolde Knight. This furious <hi>Tinacrian</hi> séeing himselfe without the order of knighthood, would not lay hands on his sword, but laid hold of one of those long and heauie oares, and went and stroake at the black Knight, who did defend it and sayd: What do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou pretend to doo, thou foole and without wit, what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou thinke with staues as a countrey clowne or villain to make battaile with me?

This new Knight was very attentiue vnto the words which the countriman told him, and although he spake in the <hi>Tuscan</hi> tongue, yet he did vnderstand him, for that he was broughte vp to vnderstand and speake all languages, and thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, that he with whom he had battaile in the galley, was the King of <hi>Mruritania,</hi> and thinking thereon, it caused him to be more furious in his heart, for that as you haue hearde, he had the experience of his force and strength, and thought by him he was ouercome, and without saying anye word, he followed on his way, and did determine, that if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did so fauour him to rescue and set at libertie this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not for to let her passe, till such time, as the King did come in her demaund, (and if it were he with whom he had the battaile) he would not deliuer her but with mortall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. So trauailing with this thought, the night came on, &amp; it was so darke, that he was constrained to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Artemidoro</hi> declaring the acts and déeds of this Knight, saith, that he was the most furious in all the world, and a very friend to aide and succour all those, that could doo little for themselues: and if he chaunced at any time to begin an enterprise that he could not wel compasse, with double force

he would prosecute it. In such sort, that many times he made resistaunce against inchantments, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had more strength and force, than euer Knight or Giant had, at any time before, and did surmount very much his bretheren and Cousins. He made no reckoning of loue in his youth, by which he was iudged to be the Emperours sonne, as in the third parte of this booke shall be tolde you. So when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning was come, this young <hi>Mars</hi> was not slothfull, but arose vp and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his iourney, and his Page followed him with his helme: he had not trauailed scarce halfe a mile, when that he heard a pitifull lamentation of a woman, who by reason of her great wéeping, her voyce was very hoarce. So he stayed to heare from whence that lamentable noyse should come, and went towards that place whereas it was, and saw a far off a high piller of stone, out of the which, there came foorthe a spoute of very faire and cléere water, and thereat was bound a woman all naked, her backe fastened to the piller, and her armes backward imbracing the piller, and there her handes fast bound. Her skin was so faire and white, that if it had not bene that he heard her lamentation, he would haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to haue bene an image made artificially of Alabaster ioyned vnto the piller. This warlike young Knight laced on his helme, and came vnto the place whereas she was: and when he saw her, he thought verely that it was the Quéene of <hi>Mauritania</hi> of whom the countrey man told him, and by reason of the coldnesse of the darke night, and with her great lamentation and wéepings, she was so full of sorow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that she could scarce speake. Likewise the Knightes heart so yerned at the sight of that vnhappie Lady, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most he could not looke on her for wéeping: but with a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull sigh he sayd. O cruell hands, is it possible, that there should remaine in you so much mischiefe, that whereas there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Knight did very much, and with great sorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her white skin and backe, all to be spotted with her red

bloud. And taking a cloke from one of the mariners, he threw it vpon her, for to couer her body, and tooke her in his arms and commaunded <hi>Macedonio</hi> for to vnlose her. This vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Lady neuer felt nor knew what was done vnto her, till such time as she was vnbound out of those bands, and in the Knights armes: and giuing a terrible sigh, she thought that she had bene in the armes of that furious Giaunt, saying. Oh <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> my Lord and husband. The Knight hearing those wordes, was fully certified, that it was he with whom he had had battaile: and so it was true as hath bene tolde you. This new Knight would haue aunswered her, but hée was disturbed by hearing of a great noyse of a horse, which séemed to be in the wood amongst the trées, and for to sée what it should be, he left the Ladie lieng along vpon the grounde, in the kéeping of his Page and the marriners, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that place, whereas he heard that rushing noyse, and sawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a mightie great &amp; monstrous Giant mounted vpon a great beast, the which was <hi>Marmoraton,</hi> who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to see if the Lady were aliue, for to torment her a new. And when he came vnto the piller, and saw not the Ladye, with an irefull looke he cast his eyes, looking about on euerye side, and at last he saw the Knight, who was comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him with a reasonable and quiet pace, and how that the Lady was vntyed, making her sorrowfull complaint. And séeing them in this order, with great fury vpon his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible beast he came towardes them, and when he was nigh them, he staid and did behold the great proportion and gentle disposition of the Knight, hnd asked him saying. Art thou by fortune the King of <hi>Mauritania</hi> that traiterously hath slaine in the field my brother and his children.

In the meane time whiles the Knight was saying these words, the Gyant was beholding him very preciselye, and knit his browes with the great anger he receiued to heare these words, and with great fury he spurred his monstrous beast, that he made him giue so mightie a leape, that he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto the place whereas the knight was, and it lacked little, that he had not fallen vpon this new knight, who with great lightnesse did apart himselfe from him, and drewe out his sword, and would haue stroke him: but the beast passed by with so great fury that he could not reach him. The Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant straight way returned his great beast, &amp; with his broade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This inuincible <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did abide his comming, and at the discharging of the Giaunts blowe, he stepped on the one side towards his left hand, and stroke an ouerthwart blow with so great strength vpon his knée, that by reason his armour was not very good, he cut it a sunder, so that leg and all fell downe to the grounde, and the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Giant fell on the other side likewise to the earth, and with great roaring began to blaspheme against the heauens for this his sodaine mishap. There was a man that came with the Gyant, who when he saw all that had passed, with great feare returned the way from whence he came. The Prince when he saw that with so great ease he was cleare of the Giant, with a loude voyce he said. Oh God whom the Christians doo worship, I doo giue thée thankes, and I doo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that all this my good successe doth procéede from thee, and héere I doo promise and vowe, that once comming vnto my father, to accomplysh and performe all that I am bounde to doo, for to be a true Christian. The great beast whereon the Gyaunt latelye rode, did very well please and gaue great contentment vnto the Knight, for that he was of a bigge stature, and of a very good haire, because the halfe parte forwardes was was of the colour of a Wolfe, and the other halfe was all blacke, sauing that héere and there it was spotted with little white spots.

that he néeded not at anie time to be shooed, his necke was somewhat long, and a little head, with great cares hanging down like a hound, his pace was with great maiestie, and he doubled his necke that his mouth touched his breast, there came foorth of his mouth two great tusks, and he did exceed all beasts in the world in lightnesse, and did runne with a verie good grace. The young knight receiued so great delight in him, that he did determine to take and kéepe him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; not to vse anie other horse so long as this beast would indure, and without the helpe of stirop or anie other thing he leapt into the saddle, and commaunded his Page and the Marriners, that in the thickest of the forrest they shoulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his comming, and to haue great care of that Ladie, and not to remoue from thence till such time as they dyd heare the sound of his horne, and when he had aduertised the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what they should doe, he tooke the narrow path by which the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant came, in the which he had not trauailed long, when that vpon a sodaine (not knowing what it should be) there came a damsell and put her selfe before him, who brought vnto him a shéeld verie rich, in the which was painted a trée, the one halfe was of siluer and had a braunch broken which hung downe, out of the which ranne streames of red bloud, and the other ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:13973:302"/>
the deuise which the shield had, he did imagine to what ende it shuld apply, and likewise of the words which the damosel had sayd. And béeing troubled with these thoughts and such lyke, he prosecuted his waye: and when he came foorthe of that narrow and straight way, he came into a great plaine, in the which he saw a Castle, scituated vppon a rocke, and a mile from that place there was another Castle, which séemed to be very strong. And in the Castle that was in the plaine, there was a great noyse, and strayght way there issued out a company of Knights, and amongst them a valyant Giaunt, who with great pride came towards the Knight, and when they came nigh, and saw that he was mounted vpon the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunts beast, with great anger and fury they assaulted him, &amp; they were to the number of twentie Knights. This coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious young Knight was nothing troubled to sée them, but rather did abide their comming with his sword in his hand, and with as much courage, as though he had had as manye more in his company to help him. And when they had made their encounter vpon him, yet he remained as firme in the saddle, as a strong and hard Rocke: but yet at their passing by, he stroke one of them such a blow vpon the shoulder, that cutting it in two péeces, he ouerthrew him to the grounde. At that time approched the Gyant, who by reason of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie in bignesse, his horse could not trauaile so fast as the others did. He brought in his hand a strong speare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he made his encounter against the young Knight, that he made him to leane on the one side in the saddle: but with a trice he setled himselfe againe, and throwing his shielde at his backe, he tooke his sword strongly in both his handes, &amp; stroke his beast with the spurres, who with a light leap was with his enimie, and discharged his blow vpon the Gyants shield with so great furie, that he cut it in two péeces, and it descended from thence vpon his hard and stéelie healme with so great strength, that he made him to fall vppon his Horse necke without anye remembraunce, and retourned with his sword, thinking to giue him the seconde blowe, which by no meanes he could, for that the Knights did so assault him on

euery side: but it did little profite them all that euer they did or could doo, for returning against them with his light beast, he intreated them in such sort, that when the astonished Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant came vnto himselfe, there were fiftéene of his Knightes ouerthrowen to the ground. Oh how angrie and wrathfull was this Giant when he saw so great slaughter, who with a furious rage drew out his fawchon, &amp; with both his hands he stroke him such a blow vpon his fine and hard helme, that he did depriue him of his vnderstanding. His furious beast being scarred with that terrible blowe, began to run about the field, in such sort, that if the knight had not quickly come to himselfe, he had carried him into the Castle: but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himselfe, he rayned the bridle of the beast, and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his enimie with such fury, and with his sword all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, he stroke him such a blow vpon his helme, that cleauing it in péeces with the head downe to the shoulders, hée fell downe dead to the ground. The rest of the Knights which remained, when they saw that terrible blow wold haue run away: but sodainly they sawe come forth out of the other Castle, as many moe knights, as came at the first, and with the like pride and fury as the others did, they assauted <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo,</hi> who séeing that new assault, and that there came an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Giant in their company, he made himselfe readye for his defence, and procured to doo his best to deliuer himselfe from them, and taking a speare which was one of the dead knights, and being shrowded vnder his shield, he went foorth to mtéee the Gyant, who when he saw him come, addressed himselfe. They made their incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter very strongly vpon their shéelds, and the Giant did no more but breake his speare in small péeces, but he neuer moued the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> in his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, who made his encounter so stronglye, and stroke him with so great fury vppon his shéelde, that by reason of the great sharpnesse of his speare it rested not there, but pearce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it thorough and also his armour, it appeared behinde him at his backe, in such sort, that he ouerthrew him dead to the grounde.</p>

In suche sort he behaued himselfe amongst them, ouerthrowing and wounding on euery side, that in short time they left him at his libertie, &amp; the like he would haue done, if there had bene as many more before him, his anger and fury was such, the rest which remained, being about the number of six knights, put themselues vnto flight. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, neither made he any reckoning of them, but ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Castle, and did alight from his great beast, and went into a broade Courte, whereas were all the Giauntes household seruaunts, and when they saw him, they began to runne away, and to hide themselues, as from theyr sodayne death. The knight did call them againe, and bad them be in quiet, and not to feare, for that he would not hurt them, if they would shewe him where the prisoners were in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Then one of them said: Prisoners there are, but what shall it profite to showe thée the place, when thou canst not deliuer them, for that ther be such kéepers to kéepe them. Let it be what it will be said the Knight, for once thou shalte showe me where they are. As for their kéepers they haue but smal defence, neither haue you any occasion to feare, for that this daye they haue made accompt and payd all the euills &amp; harmes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue done. The man when he heard this, without any replying tooke a bundle of keyes, and came out of the kitchin into the Court, whereas he opened a doore, and entred therein, they descended downe a paire of staires into a déepe dungeon, whereas they heard a very sorrowfull and lamentable noyse.

To whom was aunswered with a verye dolorous voyce: Héere lyeth the most grieuous and afflicted knight that may be found in all the worlde, &amp; in his company other Knights, brought vnto this place by forcible vyolence, why I doo not know, for that we haue not seene one another, by reason of the great and terrible darknesse that is heere. Wel sayd the Prince, come forth, if heereafter you can defend and kéepe your selues from other prisons, so it is, for of this, from this day forwards you are cleere: and in saying these words, he ascended vp the staires, and after him the man which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doore. Then the prisoners in great hast came vp the staires, and comming foorth whereas the Knight was, they all fell downe on their knées, giuing thankes vnto God for that he had giuen them libertie: and afterward they kissed the Knights hands, desiring God to increase his powers and honour, who with a very good grace gaue them such answer, that they were all very well content. Amongst them there was one prisoner of a very goodly disposition and faire face, and of a double stature, more then the others, who with a seuere countenaunce and well placed wordes, did surrender vnto the Knight great thankes for that good tourne which he receiued at his hands: he spake to him in the <hi>Tuscane</hi> tongue. It séemed vnto the Prince that he should be a person of estimation, and asked of him his name, and what countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was? To whom the prisoner sayde: My name (sir knight) is <hi>Florisarte,</hi> sonne vnto the Duke of <hi>Bauiera,</hi> brother vnto the good Emperour <hi>Ladislao</hi> of <hi>Almania,</hi> who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner villainously by these euill Giants.

This heauie Gentlewoman though she did see her selfe frée from the villaines &amp; at libertie, yet did she not let to perseuer in her sorrowfull lamentation, &amp; said: Ah knight, the defender of my corporall death, wherby liuing I do passe a thousand deaths, I say that my sorrow and euill was such, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with more reason I may bewaile the life which thou hast giuen me, then the death which I am deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

This sorrowfull ladie said: If thou wert such a knight, that with they great valour and strength couldest set at libertie my hart from sorrow, as thou hast deliuered my bodie from death, I woulde declare vnto thée the greatest mishap that euer happened vnto woman, &amp; thereby thou shuldest vnderstand whether I haue reason ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to desire the death, then to liue, therefore gentle knight, I doe desire thée to sit downe and to hearken vnto me with attentiue eare, for that my iustice will moue and constraine thee to take my defence as thine owne, &amp; so they sat down vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great Pine trée which was harde by whereas she was bound, and with great abundance of teares she sayd.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:13973:305" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a meruailous and extreame beautie, who was at her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie accompanied with many worthy Knightes, for that all did respect the Earle verye much, because he was a very no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble man. At the great fame and reporte of this daughter of the Earle of <hi>Tirol,</hi> for that she was of so excellent beautie, came many young Knights out of diuers countreyes to sée her, amongst whom came two bretheren, iolly young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and sonnes vnto the Earle of <hi>Olanda,</hi> and a cousin of theirs, a valiant Knight, sonne vnto the Duke of <hi>Brabant.</hi> There was no great friendship betwixt these two brethren as it appeared, because they were of different condition the one from the other, &amp; likewise great difference in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: for that the eldest had a very fierce countenaunce, and ill fauoured, and of great pride: and the youngest of a seuere and gentle countenaunce, and very humble of person, and was well beloued of all them in the Court. Both of them set their eyes vpon <hi>Clarentina,</hi> daughter vnto the Earle of <hi>Tirol,</hi> and for a farther euill, that false <hi>Cupide</hi> would not, but that she shuld likewise set her eyes on one of them, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her heart into captiuitie with the loue of <hi>Pinorante,</hi> the youngest of the two bretheren. <hi>Firidefonte</hi> who was the eldest hauing vnderstanding thereof, (being gouerned by his great pride) and seeing the small accompt that <hi>Clarentina</hi> made of him, the diuell straight wayes put into his heade, (with the great ieelousie that he had) for to kill his brother: but many dayes after, he went meruailously troubled, with great alterations in his thought, about the dooing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked déede, sometimes ouercome by brotherly loue to leaue that enterprise, and at other times counsailed by his owne cholar to the contrarie. And in this sort he continued a long time, till in the end, <hi>Clarentina</hi> did vtter more at large her good wil vnto his brother, and vpon a time he saw them tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together, which was the occasion to confirm in him that damnable intent. Wherfore vpon a night as <hi>Pinorante</hi> was walking on the backe side of the Court, his euill brother did kill him with great crueltie, &amp; leauing him vpon the ground, he returned vnto his lodging, and it was neuer knowen,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:306"/>
who was the murtherer of him, and for that the fraternall bloud could not let but to wound verie much his heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the euill fact which he had done, he straight way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented himselfe thereof, which was afterward a farther euill, and forsomuch as the diuell was lodged in his heart, this his euill pretence did not rest with the death of his brother, but gathered in his thought to do a fact farre worser, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion was, for that <hi>Clarentina</hi> made so great lamentation for the death of that vnhappie <hi>Pinaronte,</hi> and this was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption that he would vse, ordeined by the diuell, and it so fell out, that I was wounded by that false <hi>Cupide</hi> with the loue of <hi>Firidefonte,</hi> not hauing anie respect vnto the ill fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse of his face, and being constrained by the gréeuousnes of my wound, I gaue him cléerly to vnderstand therof, which was the occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was the bolder to doe that which hée did, &amp; seeing me so captiue in loue of him, he was in no doubt to discouer vnto me his whole heart, all the which he tolde me, being in place where boldly he might speake. And he said: Ah <hi>Clarentina</hi> my verie friend, I haue had greate desire to haue had this opportunitie for to talke with thée, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer my whole heart. Thou hast well séene this vnhappie and cruell death of my vnfortunate brother, thou shalt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that <hi>Clarentina</hi> was the occasion of his death, but and if thou wilt doe that which now I will desire thée, I do héere sweare vnto thée by the high and mightie God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there shall none be Ladie of my heart but alonely thy beautie, then I (vnhappie and without all good fortune) being wholy yéelded and so ouercome with his loue, did offer my selfe to doe all that which his pleasure was to commaunde mée. Then this traitour with dissembling wordes sayde: I alwayes had this good opinion in you my loue, that you woulde accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish my request. Well, thou shalt nowe vnderstande that I doe pretende to accuse <hi>Clarentina</hi> for the murther of my brother, and the better to bring to passe my desire, I will saye that thou art witnesse therevnto, and doest knowe the certaintie thereof. Then I thinking to obtaine that which
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:13973:306"/>
so long time I had desired, did promise him to doe it, as by the proofe it shoulde plainely appeare. And with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion he departed from me, and went and gaue his cousin <hi>Rodelando</hi> to vnderstand of it, who is one of the strongest and valyauntest knightes in all this Countrie, and <hi>Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando</hi> beléeuing that it should bée true, did offer himselfe to be the seconde in the defence in helping of his cousin, and so both of them went and made their accusation before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the Emperour commaunded mée to bée called before him, for to declare what I did knowe therein, and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish and performe all that I had promised. Then this faultlesse Ladie séeing her selfe so falsely accused, did wéepe verie gréeuously, desiring the Emperour to appoint a time that shée might seeke one for to make aunswere in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and for to prooue that it was all false that was layde against her. So it was agréed, that in the space of two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths shée should bring a knight that shoulde defend her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and if so be that shée coulde not, that then shée shoulde be condempned according vnto the lawe, that is, to burne her quicke, and in the meane time that shée should be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a tower, and there well and strongly kept, not forbidding anie, whosoeuer hée were, naturall or straunger, but that hée might lawfully make battaile in her defence. So likewise they commaunded that I should be put in another tower, that if it were so that I should be found a liar, that I shoulde bée punished with her prouided death. So I when I vnderstood it was in a great feare, and went priuelye vnto the lodging of <hi>Firidefonte,</hi> of whome I was verie well receiued, and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he would send me into his Countrie, he put all thinges in order for my iourney, and gaue me these two vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines whom thou hast slain to be my keepers, who brought me hether, and brought me vnto the point as you found me. And as I do beleeue it came determined from thence, for that his euill pretence should not be discouered. Heere you maye vnderstand sir knight, wherefore I sayd that it had ben bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to haue let me ben slaine then to liue with so great griefe.</q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:307"/>
And now that I haue told you all the matter, and the truth, heere I doo desire you, that if there be in you any bountie, (as it doth appeare and shewe by your presence) that thou wilt take vppon thy owne charge this battaile and defence, for that I would (séeing that I haue bene the occasion of all this euill and trouble happened vnto this guiltlesse Lady, in giuing false euidence) be the meanes whereby she might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue remedie for the same. This <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was very much amazed to heare of such an intangled and false forged mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and for that he was one that did procure to aide and helpe the afflicted, he did very fréely offer himselfe, to procure to make her defence. At this instant the dawning of the day appeared, and the Prince tooke the Gentlewoman, and went whereas the Knight of <hi>Bauier</hi> was, and did awake him, and gaue him to vnderstand, of all that the Gentlewoman hadde tolde him, who incontinent did offer himself to be the second in the battaile for her defence. When the Quéene was all in a readinesse to trauaile on their iourney and all the rest, they made great hast, and tooke the way which led them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Espira,</hi> and carried the Gentlewoman with her face coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that she might not be knowen. So when they came with in a mile of the Citie of <hi>Espira,</hi> they must néedes passe a great and mightie broad riuer, whereas they lefte <hi>Candisea</hi> in a dayrie house, giuing great charge that she shuld be well looked vnto, and the Quéene and all the rest passed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in a barke, and neuer staid till they entered into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and had their helmes on, and their shields at their backs. This strong and stout <hi>Tinacrian</hi> rode mounted vppon his temerous beast, with so great and goodly a demeanour, that all which did behold him, greatly meruailed what knight it shuld be, of so great and comely stature, and when they saw the deuise of the trée and broken braunch on his shielde, they straight wayes know that he was the Knight that had slaine the Gyaunts, for that they had heard the newes there of in the Court, which was the occasion that much people, did folow him to behold his face, if he did put off his helm, to see if they could know him. So these two knightes and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13973:307"/>
the Quéene (with all the people that followed him) came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperours pallaice, whereas the Prince did alight, &amp; taking the Quéene in his armes, he tooke her from her Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraie and lead her by the right hand, so with a verie gentle &amp; comely grace they went vp into a royall hall, and <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> remained belowe and kept their horses. When they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered they found the Emperour accompanied with all his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, &amp; the knight was knowen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al by the deuice of his shéeld, &amp; therfore al people did approch to know wherfore his comming was, &amp; greatly meruailed at his bigge stature &amp; gentle disposition, and they all kept silence to heare what the knight of the Braunch woulde saie, who when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour made a shewe of his high lignage from whence he did descend, in making of his dutifull reuerence. The Emperour hauing knowledge of his person by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> report which he had heard, did returne his salutation in equall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; when the Emperour would haue spoken, the valiaunt knight of the branch did disturbe him and sayd.</p>

               </p>
               <p>These two cosins were there present and heard very wel his words, and <hi>Rodelando</hi> without anie respect vnto the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, taking his cosin <hi>Firidefonte</hi> by the hand, stepped forth with a furious countenance and said:
<q>Héere thou hast before thée they whom thou dost demaund for, beholde vs well, and let not thy youthfull courage deceiue thée, giuing enterprise vpon that, of which the sonnes of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> would make doubtfull, therefore looke what thou doest deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and giue vs our aunswere, and that quicklye. The Knight of the Braunch in the meane time that <hi>Rodelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> was saying these wordes, did verie much beholde and viewe him, and it séemed vnto him that hée was a Knight of greate valour, but yet for all that his strong members did not dismaie him, but with a graue spéech and seuere countenaunce he aunswered: If thou hast so much haste to knowe my determination, héere I doe saye that in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation that thou hast put against <hi>Clarentina,</hi> thou doest lye lyke a false Knight, and that thy cosin lyke a cruell murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer doth deserue the death for killing of his owne Brother, committed by his owne handes, who was more worthie in all respects then he is.</q> Then <hi>Firidefonte</hi> with great fury an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and sayd.</p>

I cannot declare the great anger which the knight of the Braunch receiued, for that he tourned vp the white of his eyes, and all his face waxed wanne and blacke, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with very anger moouing his pace he sayd. I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise thée thou traitour, that I will make thée with thy owne mouth confesse this great treason which thou hast commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if it were not but that I am before so high an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, héere in this place without going anie farther, with my fists like a vile traitour I would make thée to confesse it. Héere <hi>Firidefonte</hi> had no patience to heare these things spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his face, but like a tyger he leapt vnto him and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his cloake about his arme and drew out his sword, and went against the knight of the Braunch. This worthy war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour thereat made no kinde of mouing, but did abide his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, making an outward shewe of the greate valour of his heart, <hi>Firidefonte</hi> did strike at him with his sworde, but the knight of the Braunch stepped on the one side, and made him to loose his blow, so that his sword stroke on the ground, and like vnto the winde he closed with him, and stroke him with his hands on the breast with so great furie and strength, that without hauing anie power to saue himselfe, he gaue a great fall backwards to the ground, <hi>Rodelando</hi> séeing that on the best side entered to him, and did imbrace him, and held him verie strongly betwéene his armes. Then this gentle knight drew out his swoorde, and hauing his arme aloft he stroke a blowe, the which chaunced vpon a young man called <hi>Polio,</hi> of <hi>Velduque,</hi> sonne vnto the Duke of <hi>Velduque,</hi> and that cruell sword did light vppon his head, and cutting it in two parts, the young man fell downe dead to the ground. Nowe was it not requisite that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> should remaine in the armes of <hi>Rodelando,</hi> but with great strength he did ruste him selfe, &amp; threw him from him. At y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time the whole Court was in a tumult for the death of <hi>Polio,</hi> and euerie one drewe out his sworde and did verie sore assalt the knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Branch,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:309"/>
but he with his sworde made such a slaughter amongest them, that they did verie well feele and vnderstand the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnesse of his heart, &amp; the great noise &amp; crieng out of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, neither his emperiall presence was sufficient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease them. At this time the Emperours gard came into the hall, who were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that with their halberts they shuld indeuour to part them, then the Emperour went to lay hand on <hi>Firidefonte,</hi> the beginner of all this tumult, but he putting himselfe in defence went forth of the hall, so likewise did <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delando,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour séeing that, laide hand on the <hi>Bauiero,</hi> who with great humilitie did obey his Lord, he would haue done y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like vnto <hi>Poliphebo,</hi> but he put the point of his sword before him &amp; said: Kéepe your highnesse backe, for that I am none of them that so lightly wil be taken prisoner, take &amp; put in prison thy owne vassalles, such as hath had little respect vnto thy presence, &amp; let not them which are not of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome pay for this thy anger. The emperour very angry said: If my vassalls are in the fault, they shall haue theyr punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; thou also if thou dost deserue it, therfore yéeld thy self to prison, if not, vnderstand that it wil be to thy cost. I know not what will fall out héerein, said the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my good will neither you nor all yours shall triumph of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, &amp; before that this doth come to passe, I wil make more then one thousand of them that do pretend to take me prisoner loose their liues. Then the Emperour with a loude voice commaunded to fake him, at which wordes all the whole gard together pressed at him, but this valiaunt knight did determine that in spite of them all he woulde cléere and set himselfe at libertie, there did he begin to doe wonderfull feates of armes, breaking and cutting a sunder those sharpe Halberts, and killing and wounding that it was terrible to beholde. All the people feeling and séeing the effect of his rigorous arme, did giue him waye and let him goe tyll hée came to the stayres, there they beganne to assault him a newe with verye much people, and amongest them some armed knightes. The Knight when he sawe that he coulde not passe in quiet, he was cleane without anye patience,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13973:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not fearing death but forgetting pollicie, he firmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and throwing his shield at his backe, he tooke his sword in both his hands, and layd about him on euerye side, &amp; lyke vnto a furious Lion he pressed amongst the people, cutting, killing and wounding, for to haue way to descend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> staires. At that time was the Knight in great perill, for that those which were before him, did persecute him with the sharpe poynts of their halberds, and likewise those which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him did the like: in such sorte, that the Knight béeing on the staires, could not tourne himselfe at his pleasure: but yet all that euer they did, did little auaile or profite them, for that with the great furie which he had, he pressed vpon them that were before him, and what with killing and wounding, he forced them to giue him way to descend downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> staires, where hée founde many people fallen downe with the great hast they had to flye from him. And when he saw that hée could not passe by reason of the people, he gaue a great leap, &amp; with wonderfull lightnesse he passed ouer the people that were fallen, and went vnto the place whereas <hi>Macedonio</hi> did abide his comming, with his great beast, &amp; with strange lightnes he lept vpon his back, and rode into the great court, whereas he was assaulted of very much people, for that the Emperour at the windowes cryed out vppon them to take him. The knight of the branch, when he found himself mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The people of the Emperour, which followed the Knight of the Branch, when they sawe him passe with his great beast so swiftly, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned backe againe whereas the Emperour was, whome
<pb facs="tcp:13973:310"/>
they found verie much amazed at the great prowesse of this knight. The Earle of <hi>Maguntia</hi> who likewise followed the knight, at his returning againe he found <hi>Macedonio,</hi> &amp; tooke him and carryed him before the Emperour and said: This is Page vnto that diuell, who to our cost and spite of our téeth is gone awaye. The Emperour did beholde him and sawe that he was of a good disposition &amp; had a faire face, he asked of him and said: Tell me my friend, howe doest thou call thy Lord, is he by fortune some diuell, for that according as hée hath shewed himselfe vnto vs, it cannot be but that he is some infernall creature. This young Gentleman with great deliberation sayd: My Lord is a humane creature and sonne vnto a humane man, and more mightier then your highnesse, for you shall vnderstand that he is sonne vnto the Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and his mother is the quéene <hi>Garrofilea</hi> Quéene of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> and your highnesse shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that he is a knight that will reward (and that verye well) all the harme and griefe which is done vnto him, with whatsoeuer knight he be in all the world, the Ladie which he brought with him is of high estate, for you shall vnderstand that she is a great Ladie and a quéene. The Emperour whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard this, he looked about for her, and sawe her in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the hall verie sore afflicted, and commaunded that shée should be carried with great honour and reuerence whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empres was, &amp; with great anger he returned vnto <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donio</hi> and said: I will sée how farre the power will, extend of this diuell, for that he shall not haue thée, neither his Ladie, till such time as I haue him in my power. All that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour sayd was heard by a brother of <hi>Clarentinas,</hi> who was called <hi>Laurentino,</hi> that came vnto the court that present day, &amp; being verie much moued, he said: Your highnesse doth very ill in intreating my sister so euill, is this the rewarde for the great seruice which I &amp; my father haue done for you, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for to destroy &amp; kill him, who respecting our honour, doth put his person in aduenture to deliuer my sister from that false accusation laide against her, and the other which came in his companie thou hast put in prison, and not content

héerewith, but dost kéepe in thy power from him a Ladie and his Page, it shoulde suffice thée to knowe who they are, and the highnesse of their linage, and not in such sort to doe them wrong, my Lord, moderate your selfe and doe iustice, for that hetherto you haue bene a friend in dooing iustice and right, &amp; doe not blemish this daie with thy great pride the high fame which in so manie yeares thou hast gotten. The Emperour who was blind &amp; ouercome with anger, &amp; verie wrathfull he sayd: Get thée hence in an euill houre vnto thy lodging, for that thy sister shall neither winne nor loose for thy speach. This valiant young man did answere: For that you are my Emperour &amp; Lord you may intreat me in this order, but if that reason did now gouerne your breast, you would do more iustice then by your outward shewe you doe meane to doe, therefore now I doe saie, let them take héede who is in the fault, for that with my person and goods I doe determine to make my defence, and to aide and succour him, who for my sister doth put his life in adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture. And in saying these words he departed out of the great hall, leauing the Emperour full of cholar and wrath, who commaunded to burie the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and <hi>Polio</hi> with great honour. His death was verie sore lamented of many, for that he was wel beloued of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court. Then they gaue the Emperour to vnderstand how that the knight whom he had in prison was sonne vnto the Duke of <hi>Bauiera,</hi> for the which he receiued great griefe, for that he was sonne vnto one of the mightyest Lordes that was in all <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> his power was so greate, that hée and the power of <hi>Laurentino</hi> were able to maintaine warres agaynst the Emperour. So considering all things, the Emperour in his owne person went and tooke the Knight out of prison, of whome he vnderstoode all that happened in the Castell of the Rocke, and likewise the truth of the treason of <hi>Firide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonte,</hi> and béeing in this communication, they hearde in the Court a greate rumour, and going to sée what was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thereof, they sawe that there was brought two dead Knightes vppon two horses, and hadde on eyther of them a meruailous greate and cruell wound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lady, how dost thou liue without thy welbeloued? How dost thou sustaine thy self, without thy life? That day in the which thou didst lose him, that daye it had happened well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, if thou hadst lost thine owne life: but in the end wil come an end, that thou shalt goe to séeke him, in giuing thy selfe cruell death.</p>
               <p>And with this she made an ende of her lamentation, for that lifting vp her eyes, she saw how the two knights were very attentiue vnto that which she said. And giuing a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and grieuous sigh, she arose vp in great hast, and entered into the chamber whereas she came foorth, and with greate wrath she shut the doore, making within the chamber, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous lamentations. The Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> went the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to see if he coulde open the doore, but he found it verye fast shut, as one who had the Fortresse made by the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> and so likewise did he bring that monster for to keepe her, that she might be troubled of no body. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Alphebo</hi> séeing that his calling was in vaine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted and went out w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his company, and mounting vppon theyr Beastes they did prosecute theyr iourney. So all the rest of the daye almost they trauayled in the same Forrest,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:315"/>
And when it was towards night, they founde themselues in the broad and beaten way of <hi>Pyreo,</hi> which went vnto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> of the which they were very ioyfull: and he did determine to goe vnto the Emperour his father for to kisse his hands, and so they directed their waye vnto <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> They had not ridden long, when that they hearde a great noyse of hunters which followed their game, and they came towards the place where as they wer, for that the night drew on: and they vnderstood by some of the huntsmen, that the Emperour was in that hunt, who for his recreation at that time came forth, and had in his company the Empresse, and the faire <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who was very sorrowful for the absence of <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> When the Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> knew that they were there, he went vnto their tents, and there did not lack them which did aduertise the Emperour and the Empresse, who with much ioye went out to receiue him, as he would haue entred. And when <hi>Alphebo</hi> was before her, he fel down vpon his knées: then the Empresse with teares of great ioy did imbrace him, and spake words of maternall loue. Then was he receiued of the faire <hi>Oliuia,</hi> and of all the Princes &amp; Ladyes that were there. Likewise they receiued and gaue great intertainment vnto the King of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> for that hée was welbeloued of them al, from the time that he made bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile with the Giant in the Emperiall Pallaice. And being in this pleasure the Emperour came with as much spéede as he could, and there beganne a newe the welcomming of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo</hi> and the king, with so much ioye and pleasure vnto al, that I cannot expresse it. So there they passed that night till the morning, and when all things was put in order, they heard diuine seruice, and went to breakfast, with pretence to retourne againe vnto their hunting. So when they were a taking vp of the tables, they heard a great rumour of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, and of the running and coursing of horses. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Alphebo</hi> arose from the Table, and putting on his helme, he went out of the Tent, whereas he found in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse his horse, and with great lightnesse he mounted on him, and rode towards the place from whence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noyse came,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:13973:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and vpon a sodaine he sawe come riding two knightes, and after them followed one knight of a meruailous disposition, with Purple armour all to be spotted with starres of golde, likewise his shéeld was purple, vpon the which was put for the deuice a knight who séemed to haue the same deuice, his eyes shut by reason that certaine Sunne beames did strike on them, the which séemed to procéede out of the face of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knight. This Purple knight brought his sword in his hand all naked, in manner as though he would strike y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other two which ranne awaie. The Emperour <hi>Alfebo</hi> did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the two knights for their running awaie, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before them. At this instant we must leaue the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and his knights, for to returne vnto the Pastor <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano,</hi> whom we left with his swéete musicke, and his Lute in his hand, compassed round about with a companie of shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, hauing her before him, whose beautie did make him to disguise himselfe in that base apparell, and she was set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the gréene grasse, whereas she might with good attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heare the delicate swéetnesse of this new shepheards mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke. Also all the rest of the shepheards had no small admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as well therat, as at the sweet melodie he vsed in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at sundrie-times he sent forth déepe sighs, so that it made all the shepheards hearts to melt, and the verie birdes which did flie in the forrest did staye &amp; were astonied at his swéete musicke. So when he was wearie of playing &amp; sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the amorous sight of the <hi>Pastora</hi> did graunt him no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lisence, but that with a fewe teares he cast downe his humbled eies, and began to wring his hands. The <hi>Pastora</hi> did very much behold him, &amp; it séemed vnto her that in all her life she had not séene so much fairenesse in a man imagining with her selfe that he was some worthie knight.

This is the <hi>Pastora</hi> that hath all these valleyes full of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous fire of loue, and looke in how so much Nature hath indued her with beautie and fairenesse: euen so great a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie hath she accompanied with her crueltie, that there is no shepheard that can suffer it.

               <p>Ah <hi>Filepensio,</hi> I sée nowe that thou art a new louer, and yet by beholding thée thou séemest to bée an olde louer. This new shepheard would haue made him answere, but he was cut off by a heauie noise which he heard amongest the trées, which seemed to be of the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and crying out with more vehemencie, he heard that it were shrikes of the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and <hi>Galismena,</hi> which being heard by the shepheards, with great alteration they ranne that waie whereas the noise was, &amp; by reason that in lightnesse and loue this new shepheard did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede all the rest, he was the first that came vnto the place, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13973:316"/>
sawe that there was a Gyant, and with him a well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned knight, who had fast hold of the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and with the point of his sword pricked the hands of <hi>Galismena</hi> to make her let goe her holde, for that she imbraced the <hi>Pastora</hi> in her armes with great strength. At that time came <hi>Filepensio,</hi> and with a greate noise he said.</p>
               <p>Thou vile knight and false traitour, I charge thée stand still, and not laie hands vpon the delicate <hi>Pastora,</hi> and taking his shepheardes crooke in his hande, which was both knottie and hard, with the same hardinesse as though he had bene armed with complet armour, he pressed towards them. The knight with great anger for that which the shephearde had sayde, drew out his sword, pretending with one blow to returne those words of the shepheard, but he that knewe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well how to vse himselfe, stepped on the one side &amp; made him to strike his blow in vaine, at which time the shepheard entered in to him by the one side, and stroke him so terrible a blowe with his crooke vpon the left shoulder, that he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him to the ground without anie remembraunce. The Gyant being greatly amazed at the power of the shepheard, beléeuing that the knight had ben slaine, with a great shrike let goe the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and set spurres vnto his horse, thinking to ouerrun him, but it chaunced not with him as he thought, for that the shepheard was not idle, but hadde recouered the sword of the ouerthrowen knight, and hauing it in his hand with great discreation he did a part himselfe from the furye of the horse, and in passing by stroke him on the hinder legs with so great strength that he cut them both a sunder, and he fell downe with his master to the ground, but in such sorte, that the Gyaunt might well cléere himselfe from his horse without receiuing anie harme at all, and béeing on foote he presentlye layde hande vppon his greate and broade Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon, and beeing voyde of all patience, with a diuellish fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie he discharged his blowe at the vnarmed head of <hi>File<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensio,</hi> but the Shephearde did not determine with himselfe for to abide the comming of that vnmeasurable blowe, but
<pb facs="tcp:13973:317"/>
with great lightnesse he put himselfe on the one side, so that he stroke his blowe in vaine, and because his <hi>Pastora</hi> should sée the great strength and force of his armes, hée tooke the sworde fast in his hande and firmed himselfe on the ground and stroke the Gyaunt on the wast on his left side, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his armour had béene made of harde and fine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, it had not béene able to haue made resistance against the furie of that great and mightie blowe, which was in such sorte, that the Gyaunt was cut a sunder in the middest, so that the one halfe fell on the one side and the other on the other side. All the Shepheards that were there present were verie much amazed, and lykewise the <hi>Pastoras,</hi> to sée howe the newe shephearde at two blowes had ouerthrowen two such knightes as they were.

seruice which this shepheard doth desire to doe vnto me. At this time the knight that was without remembraunce was come vnto himselfe againe, &amp; put himselfe on foote, the which when <hi>Filepensio</hi> sawe, he ceased his communication, &amp; ranne vnto him with a wrathfull furie, and before that he coulde well settle himselfe, he laide holde vppon his healme with so great strength, that he pulled it from his head, breaking all the buckles and lacings, and when they saw the knight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his healme, he was knowen of all the shepheards to bée the shepheard called <hi>Tarsides.</hi> Then <hi>Alphesiuio</hi> went vnto <hi>Filepensio,</hi> and requested that he would mittigate his ire, the which this new shepheard did at his request, leauing to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a terrible blow which he had all aloft for to strike him. What shall I saye vnto you of this Knight, when hée sawe himselfe ouercome of one alone shepheard, beléeuing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Knightes had not bene able to haue done it, but looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to see where his companion was, and sawe him deade with so terrible a blow, he could not but with great sorrowe saie: Oh ye Gods come downe all together and doe obedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto this <hi>Pastora,</hi> for that she doth better deserue it then all you, whose beautie hath so much force, that it incouraged one shepheard to doe that which a thousand knightes durst not haue giuen the enterprise off. Oh God <hi>Pan</hi> howe hath thy power extended this daie farre beyond the power of all other Gods, that thou diddest permit thus to be slaine so mightie a king. Ah <hi>Cayserlinga,</hi> no <hi>Pastora,</hi> but a Goddesse, that onely doest not bring in subiection the shepheardes, but also the high and mightie kings. Thou shalt vnderstande <hi>Pastora,</hi> that amongest them which doth beare thee companie is the Prince of <hi>Britania</hi> in disguised apparayle, and I am that vnhappie prince of <hi>Polismago,</hi> and he most vnfortunate whome this shepheard hath slaine, was the King of <hi>Sily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> agaynst whome the Gods hath shewed themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. All this he sayde with great teares which came from his heart, accompanied with terrible sighes. The <hi>Pastora</hi> without anie shewe of pittie she hadde of that Knight, arose from the place whereas she was, and with a gracious

The valiant knight with more humilitie then his passionate heart would abide, desired him to giue him to vnderstand if he knew anie thing of her. The man said: Sir knight, I knowe not wherefore you will know of that thing, that by séeking of remedie for her deliuerie, will procure thy selfe death. Notwithstanding séeing that with so great courtesie you doe request me, I will tell you, although it were better for you not to knowe it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse you shall vnderstande that yesternight a knight brought her vnto yonder Castell which you sée before you, &amp; put her vnder so strong kéeping, that there is no power able to deliuer her, except the power of the high Gods.

of a payre of winding staires, at which dore the knight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and went vp the staires. And when he came aloft, hée entred into very great and broad chambers all furnished w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beds, and it séemed to be a place for the houshold seruaunts, and going from thence he entred into a very faire hall, in the which was a well wrought windowe, and looking out ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he sawe that it was ouer the gate of that ill kept Castle, by which he entered, and looking for <hi>Coridon</hi> and <hi>Fidelio,</hi> he could not sée them, but beléeued that they had put themselues apart in some place because they would not be séene. Then this valiant knight looking downe againe to the gate, sawe a mightie great Gyant of a huge stature, who called with a great loude voice and sayde: Runne quickly and séeke out that bolde knight, who without anie lisence entered into the Castell, and put him into the most cruellest prison in all the house. These wordes caused little feare in the knight, but rather going from the windowe he went out of the hall, where was a payre of stayres, and as he beganne to descend downe by them, he sawe comming vp thereat in great hast fiue armed knightes, and after them eight clownes, who sé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be the knight they sought, with theyr swordes drawne verie rigorously they did assault him. This valyant warriour drew out his sword, and stroke two of them two such terrible blowes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made their heads to tumble downe the stayres, and in the fall of them they chaunced to hit two of the clownes, that they made them to fall backwards vpon the stayres, but his furie stayed not in this, but he stroke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knight such a blowe, that he ouerthrewe him deade the same waye, the other two knightes which remained séeing that slaughter so quickly done, they put themselues the one on the one side of the stayres, and the other on the other, and hauing theyr shéeldes before them they layde on the Knight with great and thicke blowes, but by reason of the desire which the knight had to sée his <hi>Pastora,</hi> and being very much troubled therewith, hée determined with spéede to cléere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of those two knightes, and therewith he stroke at each
<pb facs="tcp:13973:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them a mightie blow and sent them with the rest downe the stayres, the like did he vnto foure of the clownes that were so hardie as to assault him, the other with a great noise ranne downe the stayres, this valyant knight hasted downe the stayres after them till he came into a great court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he found the Gyant vnarmed, with a shéelde on his arme, and a great broade fauchen in his hande. The knight made shew vnto him that he woulde not fight nor strike him, but put his sworde vp into his sheath, and said: Holde thy hand Gyaunt and strike not, but put on thy armour for to make thy defence, for this vnderstande of a truth, that I will not drawe out my sword so long as thou art vnarmed. The Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt when he sawe howe lyttle hée did estéeme him, stoode still and did beholde him, and noted the greate riches of his armour, and by the deuice of his shéelde he knewe him to be the knight that wonne the prise and honour in the iustes at <hi>Nabatea,</hi> for you shall vnderstande that all these Gyauntes were of the kingdome of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and the king thereof if you remember was the first with whome the knight did iust, which in that triumph was ouerthrowen, when that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge that quarrell came forth a brother of his, who by the strength of the arme of this knight was slaine, and the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt which he slewe by the riuer of <hi>Euphrates</hi> was the king of <hi>Cilicia</hi> himselfe (the occasion of his comming and who all the rest were shall more at large appeare in the processe of the historie.) When the Gyaunt knewe him, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish countenaunce he sayde: Tell me knight, by fortune art thou that famous warriour, who in the iustes of <hi>Naba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea</hi> (as hath béene tolde me) carried awaye all the honour and praise, and ouerthrewe the king of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to whome the Gods did shew themselues enimies, and the same which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise slew his brother, if there be anie curtesie in thée I desire thée to tell me.</p>
               <p>This valiant Prince aunswered and said: I do not know to what end thou doest aske it of me, but let it be for what it shall be, thou shalt vnderstand that I am the same that thou
<pb facs="tcp:13973:321"/>
didst speake off. And for that thou shalt be the better certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of this, thou shalt vnderstand that I am he, who in shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards apparaile, onely with my shepheardes crooke, at one blow brought that traitor the Prince of <hi>Polismago</hi> to the ground without remembraunce, and likewise with another blow with the sword of the said Prince, I slew the King of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> and am the same who will doo the like with thée, if thou dost not deliuer vnto me that faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> who was brought hether by force, by that naughtie Prince of <hi>Polis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mago.</hi> The Giant was very sorrowfull for that which hée heard, and showed by his countenaunce to be very wrathful. At that time there descended downe the staires another Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who with a furious voyce sayd vnto the first Gyaunt: Brother put thy selfe apart on the one side, and let mée take reuengement of this vile Knight, that is before thée: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out speaking any more words, he lift vp his great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie fawchon, and stroke a mightie blow at the Knight, but this pollitike Knight stepped with great lightnesse on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side, which was the occasion that his blow fell downe vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pauement in vain: this terrible blow was no sooner down, when the Knight closed with him, and stroke him with his sword so mightie a blow vpon the right arme, that he cut it cleane a sunder, and it fell downe to the ground, sword and al. The Giant when he saw himselfe so wounded, gaue a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible shrike, and threw his shield from him, and would haue taken the sword in his other hand: but the Prince woulde not suffer it, but stroke him another blow on the same arme, and euen as he did by the other, he cut it a sunder by the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow: so that he was lame of both his armes. Yet for all this, the giant did not loose his furie, but roaring like a Lion, he opened the stumpes of his armes which did remain, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with them to imbrace the Knight, and by his greate force to ouerthrowe him. As he he laboured to enter in, the Knight put the poynt of his sword before him, in such sorte, that what with the strength and furie of the Giant, and the force that he put therevnto, the sword passed through his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that he fell downe dead to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>At this time, there descended downe the staires in great hast a Knight of a mightie proportion, whom <hi>Claridiano</hi> knew to be the Prince of <hi>Polismago.</hi> This Gréek Knight receiued great delyght at the sight of him. Then the Prince of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismago</hi> said: Thou peruerse dogge, come and take reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, for the griefe and wrong which thou doost publish héere to haue receiued: for I am the Prince whom thou dost seeke for: and in saying these words, he did assault him with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blowes. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> did returne vnto him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like, but not in so terrible a sort as he might, for the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion that he had of him, considering that the pangs of loue cause a man to doe that sometimes, which afterward he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth repent himselfe off. So héere betwixt them began a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and well foughten battaile, the one striking the other, on all parts, great and terrible blowes. In this sort they indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a while without knowing any aduauauntage betwixte them, the occasion was, for that the Gréeke woulde not vse the rigor of all his strength. And béeing in this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, the Gréeke lifte vp his eyes, and sawe at a windowe the faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> who was beholding them in their battaile: at which sight he receiued so great plesure and delyght, that the strength of his armes did faile him, and he had no more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to lifte them vp. When the Pagan saw that, he did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault him with more courage: the Gréeke had no power, but onely to beare off the blowes, and recoyled till such time as he came right vnder the window: which made the Pagan to thinke that he was ouercome, and that he had got the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. At that time the other Giant was very well armed, &amp; went vnto the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and tooke her by the haire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, and pulled her from the window, and sayd: Apart thy selfe from that place, thou which art the cause of all this euill, for that thou shalt not content thy selfe in séeing him, who do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth procure thy libertie, although it be impossible: and I do sweare vnto thée by my Gods, that the great damage which thy nicenesse hath caused, thy head shall paye for. Oh howe wrathfull this Gréeke was, when he saw the Giant intreat her so euill, for a giuing a terrible shrike he lift vp his right
<pb facs="tcp:13973:322"/>
arme with his sworde, and stroke at the Pagan so mightie a blowe vpon his healme (so that if it had not bene inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) he had cut it in two péeces, and put the head in great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, but yet he escaped not but he sell downe to the grounde without anie remembraunce, and there ranne out of his mouth great abundance of bloud. When <hi>Claridiano</hi> sawe him in this plight, he made no more reckoning of him, but with a furyous hast he went to goe vp the stayres, at such time as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant came downe with great violence, but when the sonne of <hi>Gran Alfebo</hi> sawe him he returned and did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his comming in the court, and sayd: Make an end thou great beast, and descend downe that I may giue thée thy pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thy boldnesse which thou hast vsed against the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of <hi>Pastoras.</hi> The Gyant with the great furie which he had vnderstood not what the knight had sayde, and therefore he made him no aunswere, and if that he woulde haue done it, yet his great wrath woulde not consent vnto it, but with his Fauchon all aloft he went towards the Gréeke, assalting him with mortall battaile. The like did this strong knight, making betwixt them a terrible battaile, and striking the one the other where they thought to do most hurt. Who had then seene the great lightnesse of the Gréeke in besturring himselfe, would haue well iudged that the worst part should not be his, for that he so handled his enimie in breaking of his harnesse in many places, and wounding him, in such sort, that he was all to be bathed in bloud, yet for all that the great anger which he had, neither the rigorous battaile could cause him to withdrawe the casting vp of his eyes vnto the place whereas he saw his welbeloued <hi>Pastora,</hi> and he beheld her making her greate lamentation for that which the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant had done vnto her, which was the occasion that he had a greater desire to giue him (who was the occasion of her teares) his payment. At this time the Prince <hi>Polismago</hi> was come againe vnto himselfe, and arose vppon his feete, and sawe the cruell battaile which was betwéene the Gyant and the Knight, and howe that the knight almost ouercome the Gyant, he did determine to forget that which he was bound
<pb facs="tcp:13973:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto béeing a Prince, and recouering his sword which hung by the wrist band, he went and ioyned with the Gyaunt, so that both of them together did assalt him, which did nothing grieue the Gyaunt for that he was somewhat wearie. The villanie which he sawe them vse did increase his wrath, and double his strength in such sorte, that it fell out worse for them being both together then before, for that the vilenesse of their assaulting made him to double his blowes, striking now mightely at the one, and then as terribly on the other, with very great power &amp; strength, procuring to indamage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> And for that he dealt with two such valiant knights, it stood him in hand to vse all kinde of pollicie: but yet he could not so at libertie defend himselfe, but that the giant watched his time, and stroke him so furious a blow vpon his steely helm, that he made him to boow with both his knées to the ground The Prince of <hi>Polismago</hi> seeing him at that poynt, doubled his blowes vpon him very terribly: but in spite of them, he arose vp againe with more fury then a baighted bull, &amp; with his sword fast in his hand, he pressed to the Giant, &amp; stroke him so mortall a blow vpon his shoulder, that he cloue him downe to the waste, cutting harnesse and bones, and with great facilitie ouerthrewe him dead to the ground. He had not so soone giuen that wonderfull blowe, but he retourned another at the Pagan, vppon his inchaunted healme, that he made it sounde lyke vnto a Bell. The which blowe was so mightie that it ouerthrew him downe to the ground, throwing out at his Beauer verye great aboundaunce of bloud</p>
               <p>Who coulde héere declare the greate ioye which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stora</hi> receiued when she sawe her enimies in that plight, I I cannot iudge which had the greater ioye, the knight in that he had set her at libertie, or the <hi>Pastora</hi> so sée her selfe at libertie. So when the knight sawe the Pagan on the ground without remembraunce, he made no more tarrying, but went vp the staires, and stayed not till he came where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Pastora</hi> was. And when he sawe her, he fell
<pb facs="tcp:13973:323"/>
downe vpon his knées, and lift vp his beuer, which was the occasion that the <hi>Pastora</hi> did know him, and not suffering him to speake, with an excellent grace she sayd. Ah <hi>Filipensio</hi> how much am I bound vnto the Gods, that haue deliuered me from two so great daungers, and set me at libertie from the troubles thereof. Where hast thou lefte thy shepheards apparaile? Who hath chaunged them, for this faire &amp; strong armour, where hast thou lefte thy shepheards crooke. Ah <hi>Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensio,</hi> giue me to vnderstand of thy high estate, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my small vnderstanding be not the occasion that I fall in some errour. The valyant Knight being subiect to her beautie, saide vnto her: I am yours faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> whether I be a shepheard or a Knight, your beautie hath brought me in subection, and it is great glory vnto me to be yéelded vnto you.</p>
               <p>Then the faire <hi>Pastora</hi> at these wordes tooke him faste by both the hands, and not giuing him place to any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, she sayd. I will now sée, whether you are as valyant in déeds as in words, séeing that fortune hath brought vs he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and héere I doo aske of thée two things to be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto me, and it is the first that euer I asked of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in all the world. The amorous Prince aunswered. Ah my swéete Mistresse, is it possible that I haue deserued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue at your hands so much fauour, in that you doo aske of me any thing, wherin I may or can doo you seruice, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I am yours, you néede not to aske but commaunde me as your owne, for that I am bound to whatsoeuer you will. The faire <hi>Pastora</hi> sayd. Wel gentle knight, séeing that thou dost shew thy selfe to be so subiect and bound to do me pleasure, the first thing that I doo request thée to graunt me, is, that thou cary me vnto <hi>Grecia</hi> vnto the Emperors court, and there for the space of one moneth to make my defence, &amp; affirme, that my beautie doeth surmount all others in the world. Now maist thou goe and set at libertie <hi>Coridon</hi> and thy seruaunt, who are both in prison. The Gréeke had great contentment of that which the <hi>Pastora</hi> did aske of him: and for to performe that which she had commaunded, he went &amp; sought throughout all the Castle, to sée if he could finde anye
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:13973:323"/>
that could giue anie knowledge where his companie was, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto a doore he heard a great noise of much people, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince knocked at the doore and bad them open it, &amp; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doe them no harme if they would open the doore. So straight way it was open, whereas he demaunded for <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and his Squire, they were straight waye brought vnto him by one of them which opened the doore, and in the meane time it was tolde him who the Gyants were, you shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that they were nephewes vnto the king of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and vnto the Prince of <hi>Polismago,</hi> who being in loue with the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and being of her cast off, he went and told it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> then they consented together to doe all that you haue heard, and had gone through with their intent if it had not bene for the valour of the Prince <hi>Claridiano.</hi> So when <hi>Coridon</hi> came before the <hi>Pastora</hi> he could not refrain from wéeping, with the great ioy which he receiued at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight of her, and the <hi>Pastora</hi> was no lesse ioyfull. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> remembred the Prince <hi>Polismago,</hi> &amp; commaunded <hi>Fidelio</hi> to sée whether he were aliue or dead, who went, and when hée came vnto him, he pulled off his helme and saw that he was dead, for the which it greatly gréeued the knight, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare was so great of <hi>Cayserlinga</hi> for remaining in the castle, that she made great hast to the Prince to depart from thence. The which he was constrained to do for to giue her contentment, and commaunded to make readie their horses and likewise a palfray which they found in the castell. So the next day in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning they tooke their way towards <hi>Grecia,</hi> passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all the kingdome of <hi>Media,</hi> and the kingdome of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopoli,</hi> and all the way that he trauailed he left behinde great fame of wonderful aduentures which happened.

So the second day that they trauailed by that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by reason that it was so fragrant, they lost their waie, in such sort, that when they remembred themselues, they wer entered into the thickest of the wildernesse, and procured to finde the waie againe, which by no meanes they coulde, for that they were so farre entered into the thicket. So with great trouble they trauailed till mid daie, at which time they heard a noise of the running of water, the which they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; it was the occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they brought themselues out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thick wood, and came into a mightie great plaine, through the midst of the which there passed a déepe riuer.

man, they saluted him, the olde man returned their salutation with a faint and wearie voice. The Prince asked him what aduenture had brought him into that solitarie place. This olde man for to make him answere, was constrained to sit downe vpon the ground and sayd: Gentle knight, I knowe not what to saie, nor what I shall tell you, but onely my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie hath brought me into this misfortune, being mocked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great falsehood by a Page y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I brought with me, who left me all alone and on foote in this solitarie wildernesse.

And héere I doe desire thée gentle knight, if thou hast anie pittie of this my wearie age, for to succour me, in carrying me vpon thy horse, or vpon the horse of anie of thy seruants. The Prince taking great pittie on the olde man, sayd: Feare not good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this thy misfortune, for séeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fortune hath brought vs hether, I will not leaue thée alone in this solitarye place. The Prince leaped from his horse and tooke the olde man in his armes, and put him in the saddle, and helped to settle him well, that by reason of his weaknesse he might not fal, &amp; that he being well set he himselfe might y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better without all feare leap vp behind him. This false olde man séeing himselfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the horse, stroke him with his héeles, in so great hast, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made the horse to flie: Oh how the knight was amazed at this act, although he beleeued that he did it to make him go a little on foote, but when he sawe that his mocking proceeded forwards on, he returned that waie which his Squire came, calling out vnto him to bring his horse on the which he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, who in great hast accomplished his demaund. When the knight was on horsebacke, he began to call vnto the olde man for to tarrie. The which the olde man did till such time as he came nigh him, and with a great laughter he sayd. Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful knight, what dost thou thinke to recouer thy horse, and to giue me my payment for that I haue mocked thée? Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou so quickly loose the name to be pittifull. I doe not meane to loose it sayde the Knight, neither did I giue thée
<pb facs="tcp:13973:325"/>
my horse for to carrie thée alone, but both of vs, for it is a horse which can doe it verie well. I shall be counted for a more foole then thou said the olde man, hauing now oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to goe whether I list all alone, and being in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie I shall be constrained to goe whether thy pleasure is. The Prince hearing these wordes went by little and little towards the olde man, but he with a quicke course did apart himselfe from him, making with his mouth and eyes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing astonied said: Thou false olde villaine, more worse then the stinking Foxe, tarrie thou mocker of knights, and do not thinke that the lightnesse of thy horse shall deliuer thée out of my hands. The olde man shewed as though he esteemed lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his words and threatnings, but ran with the horse from one place vnto another, making a thousand gestures and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his mouth and eyes, which was euen death vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, who said: Oh Gods is it possible that you do permit that this naughtie olde man should thus scorne me with his iestures. <hi>Coridon</hi> and the <hi>Pastora</hi> came behinde, &amp; had great pastime to see how the knight was mocked and beguiled of an olde man, who séemed as though he could not moue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with age.

What is this my sonne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is all this furie, for thou doest well knowe that I came not for to cause in you anie anger. The Prince hearing this stayed his horse and did beholde him, and knewe him verye perfectly to be the king of <hi>Arginaria,</hi> and with greate haste hée alyghted from his horse, and the olde man dyd the like, and with great contentment they louingly imbraced one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then the knight sayd.</p>

that before I let you goe out of mine armes, to make you promise me to bring me out of this solitarie place, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of this trouble and anger which you haue caused mée to haue. I came for no other thing said <hi>Galtenor,</hi> for knowing the great trauaile which may happen in this place, &amp; againe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> griefe which thou hast for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouble of a faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> which thou bringest in thy companie, and knowing the great loue which bearest vnto her I did ordaine my comming hether, &amp; determined first to giue thée this intertainment, for that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I might of thée with more ioy be receiued. At this time drewe néere the <hi>Pastora</hi> and <hi>Coridon,</hi> and <hi>Fidelio,</hi> and séeing them imbracing one an other they made the more hast on their waie, verie much meruailing to sée a crooke back and leane olde man to be turned vnto a great and faire Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, with a goodly long white beard, apparailed with rich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. The Prince turning vnto the <hi>Pastora,</hi> said: Faire <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stora,</hi> this noble king who is héere present is king of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>Arginaria,</hi> my Lord and father, who vnderstanding by his art the great necessitie in the which we are, is come to put remedie therein. The king of <hi>Arginaria</hi> with an amorous heart and stedfast eyes without mouing them, he did behold the <hi>Pastora,</hi> remembring himselfe at that time of the young childe that he lost by the riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> &amp; straight waie he knew her to be the same, of the which he did not a little reioyce, but séeing that it was conuenient at that time to hold his peace, he did dissemble it, and kept the great ioy which he receiued for the finding of her in his heart, and retourning vnto the Prince, he said: I doe not now much meruaile faire knight, that thy heart is subiect to so fayre a creature, and I doe thinke my labour verie well bestowed, because that by my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming hether shall be taken awaie a great part of your trouble, which without all doubt you should haue had, &amp; bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this maner talking, there appeared before them a horse loden with victualls, and straight waye they tooke order that they might eate, for that they had great néede thereof. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there was raised a verie faire &amp; rich tent for to ease the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and they knew not which way nor how it was made,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:326"/>
and there they rested all that night, for that the king would not that they shoulde so soone departe from him, because hée would for a time recreate himself in their conuersation, &amp; told them of some things that shuld happen vnto them. So when the morning was come the Tent was taken awaie, &amp; they began to trauaile by a verie straight and narrow path. The King of <hi>Arginaria</hi> did leade them the waie, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to followe him, who woulde set them out of that wildernesse, and bring them vnto the sea of <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they shall finde all things necessarie for their new begun voyage, and bad them that they shoulde haue verie greate care, for béeing once in <hi>Grecia,</hi> there shall be ioyned together the nailes and pawes of two of the most furious Lyons that be in all the world, the one bringing the other in so great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that the better of them both cannot be iudged, neither acknowledge anie vauntage till such time as with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious furie be taken awaie the lockes which be vpon their crowned heads, and shall at that instant in a moment be set at libertie by the robber of his first ioy, making restitution of that which a long time hath bene vsurped, remaining one of them without griefe of the young Hinde, that he bringeth with him. When all this shall come to passe I will returne my sonne and see you. And in saying these wordes he vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed awaie, not séeing anie other thing but the horse which was laden with their victualls, which caused them to remain amazed at his sodaine departure, and yet verie much comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that he had séene him: So they trauailed all that daie by a narow path. When night was come, without knowing by whom, the Tent was armed againe that they might rest themselues therein, when they were within and had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their horses to be put in, the doore of the tent did shut of it selfe with so great strength, that they could not open it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did make a proofe, for that <hi>Galtenor</hi> had so made it, because of a greate number of wilde beastes which were in those partes, and in the night time raungeth abroade for to séeke theyr prayes. So they passed that night with greate rest and ease, till the morning that the Tent doore did open,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:13973:326"/>
the Tent was taken vp and put vppon the horse, and all the rest, tooke their iourney presentlye following still that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe path till it was noone, at which time they came vnto the sea side, and harde by the place whereas they ariued, they sawe at an Anker a Barke meruailously well cauked and trimmed, made after the manner of a Serpent, with mightie wings and a long taile. The Prince when he saw the Barke made after that sorte, straight waie he vnderstoode that that was the Barke which the king of <hi>Arginaria</hi> had spoken of, and without anie more tarrying he commaunded his horse to be put in and all the rest, and he tooke the <hi>Pastora</hi> in his armes and put her into the Barke, they were no sooner within, but that with great swiftnesse she beganne to mooue her selfe, in such sorte that in a small time they were farre from the shoare. Thus they trauailed with great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the space of sixe dayes, and the seauenth daie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie earlye in the morning they were at the shoare verye nigh <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereas with great ioye and pleasure they went a lande, and mounting vppon their horses they entered into a verie geéene and delightfull Forrest, which stoode in their waie, and within a while they heard a greate noise of hunters, and towardes that way the Prince and his companie went, and in the way they trauailed, they rode by a fountaine, in the which there was to the number of eight knights verie well armed, and they were refreshing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The Prince for that they passed by somewhat out of the waie did not salute them, but passing on his waie with the faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> who followed him, vsing betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues verie swéete and amorous conuersation. The eight knightes when they sawe them so passe by, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues agréeued for the small reckoning he made of them, but in especiall one of them who was more proud and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous then the rest, without speaking anie worde at all, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on his healme, and cast his shéelde at his necke, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readie hée mounted vpon his horse, and tooke his Speare in his hande, which stoode hard by leaning against a frée, and with a verye reasonable pace hée followed after him, and
<pb facs="tcp:13973:327"/>
when he was nigh vnto the Prince, he sayd: Knight, with more pride and better adorned with rich armour, then with good manners or courtesie, you must iuste with me, for that making thée to kisse the ground, constrained by my terrible incounter, thou shalt learne in another place to vse curtesie. The heroycall Prince with his accustomed méekenesse, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. If my salutation gentle knight, was not as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a traueling knight, the distaunce of the waye was the occasion thereof: and this being true which I haue said, then haue you no reason to blame me. Thou hast lesse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sayd the Knight of the fountaine, for to excuse thy selfe from the iuste, which I doo aske of thée, therefore take thy choyce of the field, and procure to settle and firme thy selfe well in the saddle. The Gréeke seing his pride, asked of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridon</hi> his shéeld, and a speare which they brought with them: and hauing it in his hand, he saw that the field was all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very smooth, and a knight made in it, armed with purple armour, striking another Knight, armed likewise in purple armour ouerthwart the eyes, and it was all full of starres of golde. The Prince was meruailously amazed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the great cléerenesse thereof, so that he was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hide his eyes with his owne hands: but the calling out of the Knight of the fountaine did cause him to chaunge his purpose, and called for his speare, and with a furious course, he went foorth vnto the incounter. The Knight of the fountaine did breake his speare, not making the Prince to mooue any more then he had stroke vpon a hard Rocke: but the Princes incounter was such, that he ouerthrew him to the ground, &amp; with the fall he brake his arme in two parts, who hauing no power to mooue himself, and with the great paine &amp; griefe he felt, made a pitifull complaint. The Gréeke séeing him in that case sayd: Knight, it had bene better thou hadst remained without any salutation quietlye, then nowe quarrelling thervpon, thou hast thy arme broken, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest vnable to helpe thy selfe, and without saying any other thing, he did departe, determining to prosecute his former iourney. So within a while after, he heard a great noyse of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:13973:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calling, and looking about to sée who called him, he saw that it was the rest of the Knights, which followed with greate spéede. There he determined to staye their comming, and made himselfe ready vnto the battaile, if they would demand it of him. These seauen knights came with great yre, to sée the other knight in that perplexitie, (and forgetting the custome of <hi>Grecia,</hi> of long time obserued and kept amongst the Knights) they all seauen together with their speares on their rests, they made their incounter vpon him, and stroke the Gréeke with their firmed blowes, some on the sides, and some on the breast with great furie: yet the Prince remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more firme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Anfield of yron. They all brake their speares on him, but at their passing by, he stroke one of them such a blow vpon the healme, that he ouerthrew him deade to the ground. The rest which remained, returned vnto him with their swords in their hand, laying vpon him very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly like knights that were both valiant and couragious: but the Prince moued his horse amongst them, with so great lightnesse and strength, that quicklie his power and force was knowen vnto them, he did so torment them with his mightie blowes. And the more they did grieue him, the worse it was for them: for hauing lost all patience, he threw his shield at his backe, and did assault them with such fury, that in a short time he remained with onely two of them in the field, who séeing the other of their companions dead, procured to saue their liues, tourning their backes vnto the Gréeke, &amp; pricking their horse with the spurs, they put themselues into a broad waye.</p>
               <p>This furious Knight followed after them, procuring to ouertake them, and to make that not one of them shall beare newes of the successe of the battaile: but by reason they had some vauntage of the waye, and againe their horses were very good, for all the hast that he coulde make, he could not ouertake them, till such time as they came whereas were many tents armed in the field, and at that place ther was a knight y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stept before him to defend the other two which ran away, who were armed with verie strong and straunge ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
<pb facs="tcp:13973:328"/>
Who, if you doo remember was the Emperour <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo,</hi> and our Knight was his sonne, who with his sword in his hand all bloudie, followed the other two knights. The Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> seeing them come running from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one alone Knight, called vnto them and sayd: Tell me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe you runne away you cowards and dishonourers of the Gréekish genealogie, of whom are you afraide, of one alone Knight? Soueraigne Lord sayd one of the Knightes, he that doeth follow vs, is no Knight, but a diuell, and thy surmounted strength is néedfull to make resistaunce against his. So at that time the Prince approched as I haue tolde you, and likewise the Emperour <hi>Alphebo,</hi> who did verye much beholde his goodly stature and disposition: the Prince did likewise behold the Emperour, and the straungenesie of his armour. The Emperour was the first that beganne to speake and sayd: Tell me knight, what hath my Knightes, done vnto you, to cause you to vse &amp; intreat them so straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then the Prince who had lost all patience, sayde. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to make their reuengement, and doo not aske mée the cause of their cowardnesse. For that it is verye apparaunt, that they themselues are in fault of their ill intreating. This good Emperour, as one that made little reckoning of his words, very méekely sayd. If they are in the fault it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me very well, therefore I doo desire to know the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion if it be thy pleasure to tell me, that I may altogether lay the fault vpon them. The Prince with a high voyce sayde. By the Gods I doo sweare vnto thée, that it is true that I haue tolde thée. The Emperour when he hearde him name those false Gods, without any more tarrying drewe out his sword and sayd. Defende thy selfe Pagan, for it shall cost thée thy lyfe, for laying hands vpon Christians, who are more worth then thou art. Now doo I not desire to knowe the occasion, for that they are Christians and thou arte a Moore. And I saye, that they are in no faulte. So there they assaulted one another, with most terrible and mortall battayle.</p>

Héere I doo renounce all your deitie and potencie, for it is all as nothing, and agayne I doo call you vyle, and of small estimation and power. And in saying these words, he ran against the Emperour with so great furye, that hée made the ground to tremble vnder him, and when he came nigh vnto the Emperour, he stroke him an ouerthwart blow with so great strength and might, that he made him to fall forwards vpon his horse cares without any remembraunce, in such sort that it séemed he had bene dead, for that there procéeded out of his healme so much bloud. And by the great strength of that blow, his horse was constrained to stoope w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his forefeete. This mightie Prince with double fury turned with his sword to strike him the second blow, but it was in such sort, that the reynes of his horse bridle was fast in the buckle of his armour, and was constrained by the force hee put to strike his blow to pul the bridle, which made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horse to rise vp before, standing vpon his hinder féete, which was very perillous vnto the Knight: and being in that sorte, hée lost the strength of his blow for to succour himselfe, and to gouerne his horse.

The Emperour when he heard that wold not staie anie more reasonings, but went towardes her, who pulling off her healme likewise came towards him to kisse his handes, so there the one imbraced and receiued the other with great loue. The king <hi>Galtenor</hi> did cut of theyr talke and addressed his wordes vnto the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> and sayde: Soueraigne Ladie, do you remember when that you did contemplate your selfe vpon the beautie of your children which you wer deliuered off, begotten by the Emperour <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo,</hi> at which time a wall did open, whereat did enter a Serpent, who at two mouthfulls did burie them in his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells. You shall vnderstand, Empresse and Ladie, that I was the Serpent, being compelled and constrained by greate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the strong arme of your mightie sonne, to doe that which at that time I did, and I did bring them vp in the maiestie as vnto such persons was necessarie and dutifull. In the end of sixe yeares, when I determined to make an ende of my iourney, resting our selues by the riuers side of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> I lost the maiden childe, wher all the time past vnto this present, she hath bene publishing abroade her extreame beautie, till such time as the valour of her brother did bring her from thence, who is the same that is talking with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king <hi>Delfo</hi> of <hi>Trapobana,</hi> and knowe this of a certaintie Ladie, that it is thy sonne <hi>Claridiano</hi> of the Speare. Thou diddest giue him that name by reason of a Speare that he hath on his breast from his birth, and that faire <hi>Pastora</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you do sée there, is your proper daughter, and I am he that did rob and take them from you, and héere I doe make restitution of them againe, so that I do deserue pardon of all the sorrow and griefe which I haue béene the occasion of, onely with this present which I do present you withall.

<pb facs="tcp:13973:333"/>
and ioyntly therewith to forget the anger that you haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your owne sonne. Great was the ioy &amp; contentment of the Empresse, being almost beside her selfe, to sée that she had recouered her two children, which she thought had bene lost long agoe, and going to imbrace <hi>Claridiano,</hi> she found him vpon his knées, asking pardon of his Father of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had passed.

Then <hi>Galtenor</hi> tooke <hi>Claridiano</hi> by the hand and lead him a part on the one side of the hall, and sayd vnto him: I will carrie thée with me into a place, whereas thy heart a new shall be wounded, and shall forget the loue which before thou hast had, and therwith he commaunded him to arme himselfe in great secret, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the same shall be tolde you héereafter. The next daie in the morning, when they were all readie to go to heare ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice with the Emperour, there entered into the hall a knight of a great stature and proportion of his members, and was armed with verie rich armour, his face and his handes were vnarmed, and shewed by his demeanour a great maiestie and seuere countenance, he was of his face somewhat browne of coulour, but the proportion thereof was verie well fauoured, &amp; his beard began to bud, he brought after him thrée squires and Pages, the one of them brought his Speare which was bigge and short, and the other brought his healme, &amp; the third brought his shéeld with an Emperiall deuice, &amp; straight waie it was knowen wherefore his comming was, and although conformable to reason we haue not spoken anie thing of the faire matrone the quéene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> who with prosperous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and great pleasure did nauigate by the sea, holpen by the furie of <hi>Borias,</hi> which with a fresh winde did continually fill those stiffe sailes, and cutting the seas with that sharp steme, leauing behinde them the token of their great &amp; swift way, by the froth of the water, and in short time discouering land, they tooke port vpon the shore of <hi>Almaine,</hi> wheras this faire Ladie went a land, and with her two Nymphes tooke theyr iourney towardes the Court of <hi>Almaine.</hi> So she trauailed two daies, and nothing chaunced worth the telling.</p>

So with this sorrow and griefe she pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all that daie till night came vpon them, at such time as they had found a verie narow and not much vsed way, which lead them vp to a high and mightie stéepe mountaine, in which place they determined to rest themselues, til such time as <hi>Phoebus</hi> should make her returne, passing awaie the night in verie goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So when the breake of the daie was come, the Quéene dyd very well peruse her armour, and put her selfe on horsbacke, and for that the waie séemed to be somewhat daungerous, she put on her helme and carryed her Speare in her hande, and with great trauaile they followed that way, when they had well néere spent the third part of the daie, and had made an end of the going vp that mountaine, being vpon the toppe thereof, they looked about them on all partes, and towardes the right hand on the foote of that high mountaine they sawe a companie of armed men, and by reason that they were so far of, they could not discerne what it shuld be. So straight way they descended downe the mountaine, and whan they came at the foote therof, they looked round about to see if they could discouer that which they had seene from the top of the same, and sawe that there were to the number of twentie knights verie well armed, and amongest them a Gyant, who brought with them two knights prisoners, armed with verie rich ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, all sauing their heads, &amp; with them a Ladie who was as sad and sorrowfull, as faire and beautifull, and with her certaine Gentlewomen which did beare her companie.

moue them to doe that outrage, or else to procure to set them at libertie, &amp; hasting on her waie, larging her pace more then she did before, she in a short space came and ouertooke them, and by reason that the Queene made great hast, and the noise of her comming was great, the Gyaunt was constrained to looke backe, to see what it was that caused so great a noyse, and when he sawe that it was a knight that came after him, he determined to staie and abide his comming. And when she was come nigh him, this couragious Ladie with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voice sayd: Tell me Gyaunt what euill hath these priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners committed, that so without all reason thou doest carrye them so manakled and bounde. The Gyaunt did staie and beholde her with great frowning, and aunswered her with a wrathfull voice and sayd. What honour and prowesse is it to thée, for that thou art so desirous to know, and with so great pride doest aske the question? No other thing sayd this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen Gentlewoman, but to make friendship where none is, and againe if of thee they doe receiue anie griefe or wrong, to amend the same, for that I doe knowe that the condition of all Gyaunts, is nothing, but procuring to doe all wrong, therefore determine to tell me, or make thy selfe readie to thy defence. The furie of the Gyant was verie great when that he heard these words, in such sort, that it séemed fire flew out of his eyes, and with that furie he spurred forwardes his horse. The like did that worthie matrone, at that time they set spurs to their horses, and with a swift course they made their incounter, and stroke their Speares vppon their stéelie sheelds, the Speare of the Gyant made his stay vpon the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the inchaunted sheelde, but this Ladie did not onely pearce through his armour, but also through his breast and bodie, ouerthrowing him dead with great furie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, whereas he gaue a terrible fall that he made the earth to tremble, and the Quéene passed a long so quietlye as though she had done nothing, and with great lightnesse she turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her horse, with her naked sword in her hand, and saw that the Gyaunt laye a long on the grounde dead. When the Knightes of the Gyaunt sawe that furious incounter,

and that their principal refuge was dead, without any more tarrying, they altogether did assault her, and this worthy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron put her selfe against them, who was with them incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on all sides round about, but yet they did not moue her from her saddle little nor much: but she retourned against them in such sorte, that she with her mightie blowes, made their harnesse and redde bloud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

These Knights were all chosen Knights, and did trouble her very much, making her sundry times to loose the sight of her eyes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which did bring her very much in cholar, in such sort that she threw her shield at her backe, and taking her sword in both her hands, she bestarred her selfe on the one side and on the other, about their heads, and wounding of knights, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing of them to the ground dead, in such sorte, that when she remembred her selfe, there was no more but fiue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knights left aliue, who when they saw so great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in so short time, they determined the seperation of the controuersie, and to put more confidence in their horse féete, than in their owne defence and putting it in vre, they ranne away. This Lady made no reckoning to follow them, but went straight waye and did vnloose the Prisoners. Unto whom <hi>Don Florisarte</hi> of <hi>Bauiera</hi> did giue thankes for all the rest, desiring him that he wold declare vnto them his name for that they might knowe vnto whom they were bound, for that great benefit done vnto them.

The Quéene when she sawe him all in a readinesse to the battaile, with a gracious laughter sayd. I would neuer haue thought that there had bene so great an ouersight in a knight and especiallye of such fame, that so without all feare of a great number that cannot abide them, but procure all euill possible against them, that without all care in the high way doth put himselfe to sléep. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> answered, and said: There was not in me so great ouersight, as in you care, to venture your selfe, whereas you shall receiue little profite of the same. And doth it séeme vnto thée, that I was ouerséene therein? Possibly thou wilt iudge the contrary, if thou wilte proue the strength of my arme.

called for his horse, which was straight waye brought vnto him by <hi>Macedonio,</hi> and without putting foote into the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roppe, he leaped into the saddle, and tooke his speare in his hand, &amp; without replying any other thing, that valiant <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crian</hi> presently withdrew himselfe backe, and tooke of the field that part which was néedfull for him. The lyke did the Quéene, and at one time returned their light horses, and in great hast they stroke their horses with the spurs, without all pitie, and with extreame furie, they made the incounter vpon their shéelds, that their speares shiuered all to péeces, and passed along with their course without any stay of their bodies, or mouing in their saddles, and turned aboute their horse with great lightnes with their swords in their hands. The Quéene stroke the first blowe at the Prince, that shée made the sparkes to flye out of his helme, and the Prince to decline his head to the saddle bow, who with great lightnes did settle himselfe againe in the saddle, and did cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the second blow, which was readie to be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon him: &amp; putting himselfe on the one side, he stroke her such a blow vpon the helme, that it made a great sounds throughout all the fields and craggie mountaines, and shée fell backwards vpon the horse crouper with her heade: but very quickly she arose vp againe, and settled her selfe, and with great yre she layd fast holde vpon her sword, to strike her enimie, whom she did not finde idle, but rather began to assault her with blowes of mortall battaile. Such blowes was stroke betwixt them, that with the least they thought either of them to make an ende of that controuersie. At this time, there came that way a Knight, who was armed with very rich armour. This was that strong and mightie <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldoro,</hi> who if you doo remember, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mightie &amp; strong blow giuen by the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> remained all alongst the floore in his galley without remembrance. And when he came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe, with his accustomed brauery, he would followe that way which the barke went: but calling to remembrance the great trauaile and sorrow in the which his Lady was, loue did there constraine him to follow his owne iourney.

And when he came thether, he vnderstood that <hi>Poliphebo</hi> had set her at lybertie, and caried her with him, towards the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Court: &amp; by the way that he trauailed, he met with people which did tell him of all that had happened, and all signes and tokens of the Knight that carried away his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and by them he did vnderstand that he was his enemye: then he left his owne armour, and armed himselfe with that which was <hi>Bramarants,</hi> and followed that way which was tolde him he went. The fame was such, that this <hi>Tinacrian</hi> left behinde him, that wheresoeuer he came, or wheresoeuer he went, he alwayes had newes which way he trauailed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that time, that he came &amp; found him in battel with that worthy Quéene, where he staid to behold a battaile so well fought. At length he knew him very well to be the Knight that brought him into so great extremitie: and looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him on them that were beholding the battaile, amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the rest he knewe his louing wife: and although his ioye was very great in séeing of her, yet the wrath and ire that he had against the Knight was so much, that without saying any word vnto the Quéene his wife, he went toward them that were in battaile, and with his sword drawen in his hand, he put himselfe before the Quéene and sayde. I doo desire thée gentle Knight that thou wouldest rest and take thine ease, and let me alone with my strong arme take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement of this knight, vsurper of my louing wife, and a robber of my fame and honour, and without any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, he went against him for to strike at him mortall blowes. But then that worthy Gentlewoman with great anger said.</p>
               <p>Stand away Knight, and let me make an ende of that I haue begun, and offer no wrong vnto them that doo knowe how to make their their demaund vnto thy cost: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she put her selfe before him.

neither at the one nor at the other, but assaulted the Pagan with a meruailous mightie blow. The Queene at that time did put her selfe before him againe, and vpon her was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted that blow vpon the left shoulder, which did grieue her very much, as it appeared by her outward countenaunce. At this time the Pagan put himselfe againe formost: then this furious Lady with her sword all aloft, said. Keepe thy selfe backe, thou vile Knight, and of base linage, and let me make an ende of this that I haue begun, before that the potencye of my arme, doo ouerthrow thy great pride. Stand thou back sayde the Pagan, for it is my right to take vengeaunce on this euill Knight, for that he doth carry my Lady robbed from me. In these words which was spoken, the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did know the other to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who brought him in so great extremitie at the beginning of his Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for the which he was very full of yre and wrath, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that a thicke smoke came forth at his beauer. At this time came vnto that place <hi>Don Claridiano</hi> of the speare, the light of all Knighthood, who was armed with his purple ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and as I haue told you, he departed out of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors pallaice in great secret.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that was betwixt those knights, being very desirous to know the occasion, he put himselfe betwéene them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them to leaue off that battell. The furious Pagan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: thou knight, put not thy self to vnderstand any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before thou art called: for if thou dost, possibly thou shalt beare part of that, which this vnfortunate knight dooth owe me. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> said: I know not wherein he should be indebted vnto thée, but rather I doo vnderstand that thou art he that hath least reason, for that the other knight of the branch, was the first that begun this battaile. First he did to me the griefe, sayd the Pagan, before the other. For that I gaue vnto him the order of knighthood, and after that I had giuen it him, he did defie me in mortall battaile: &amp; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent héerwith, he hath robbed me of my Ladye which thou dost sée yonder. To these words the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> answered and said. Thou liest like an euill knight, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue not robbed

her, but I haue deliuered her from that place, from whence thou with all thy power wert not sufficient to deliuer her: &amp; for thy falshood, thou shalt not carrie her away without mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall battell. This furious pagan when he heard himself so ill spoken off, like a Lion he went against him: but that stoute Dame did put her selfe before him, and said. Stand back then Pagan &amp; importunate diuell, for first thou shalt haue to doo with me, or els thou shalt let me make an ende of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. This braue <hi>Tinacrian</hi> like a furious Lion, said vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke Prince: Curteous knight, I pray you to stand backe somewhat and let me alone with them both, for that I doe estéeme both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but a little. And with loude voice he said: Come, come against me thou Pagan king, &amp; of little valour, &amp; take in companie with thée that other arrogant foole as thou art, for that of both you together I do meane to set an agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength and force of my indomable arme. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> sayd, it shall not be so, but first procure to cléere thy selfe of him with the branch, and I will set thée at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the pagan. And therewith he drew out his sword, and stroke him such a blow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him to tremble &amp; remain as one amazed: and séeing him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> case, he stroke him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blow vpon the beuer, that he made the pagan to grype fast about his horse neck to kéepe himselfe from falling. But this Moore came quickly again to himselfe, and with a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courage he stroke him vpon the left sholder such a blow that it made the Gréeke to shrinke in his body, and to stoope downe to his saddle bow, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great griefe that he felle, &amp; giuing a terrible grone, he lift vp his sword, &amp; stroke the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a blow vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helme, that the sparks of fire flewe into the aire, and almost without remembrance, he fell down vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his horse crupper. The pagan comming again vnto him selfe, puffed out at his beuer a thick smoke, &amp; threw his shéeld at his back, and stroke the Gréeke so terrible a blowe, that without all remembrance, he fell forwards vpon his horses eares, who carried him a while vp &amp; down y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field: but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently he came againe vnto himselfe, &amp; séeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was so ill intreated, he tooke his sword in both his hands, &amp; set spurs to
<pb facs="tcp:13973:340"/>
his horse side, that he made him to run lyke vnto the winde, so that he was straight with the Pagan, and stroke him such a blow, that it semed a whole tower had falne vpon him, and hauing no power to the contrary, he fell vpon his horse neck without anye feeling: who being scarred with that terrible blow, with a swift course carried his master from his enimy. In all this time was not the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> nor that faire dame idle: but when they saw the battaile begun betwixt the two Knights, with great furie they returned vnto their battaile, and for that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was full of anger, he threwe his shéeld at his backe, and stroke at the Quéene so mightie a blow &amp; with so great fury y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made her to fall downe vpon the buttock of her horse without any remembrance, who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her a while round about the field. The Quéene came quickly againe vnto her selfe, so wrathfull, that she had no other thought, but to take reuengement on her enimie, and throwing her shield to the grounde, she tooke her sworde in both her hands, &amp; stroke her horse with the spurres, that she made him run like vnto the winde, &amp; with a trice shée was with the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> and stroke him so vppon the healme that with the fire which slew out thereat, he lost his sight, &amp; this valiant young Knight fell backwardes vppon his horse crupper without any féelyng, who carried him vp and down the field, which when the Lady saw, she would haue finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the battaile, with another rigorous blow. At this time it so fell out that the horse of that valiaunt <hi>African</hi> with his master, did likewise runne about the field, the which was the occasion, that the Gréeke might behold all that passed, and with a trice he was with them &amp; sayd. Withdraw thy selfe for that it is not the part of heroycall Knights to pursue and follow them that are without remembrance. The Lady who was very angry, gaue the Gréeke for aunswere, a furious blow, but straight way she was paid again with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like: wher betwixt them began a new battaile. In the meane time the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> &amp; the Pagan were come againe vnto themselues, &amp; setled in their saddles, &amp; either of them looked about for his aduersary, whom they beheld in mortall battaile. And they
<pb facs="tcp:13973:340"/>
two being together, which did hate each other deadly, made no reckoning of their late enimies, but assalted one another very furiously and strongly. All this was great profit vnto the Quéene of <hi>Lira,</hi> for that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was so mightie &amp; furious, that she should haue bene in great perill. I cannot tell you who was more furious of these two warriors, but I can say this, that <hi>Claridiano</hi> was verye sore wounded and ouercome, as héereafter shall be tolde you, in such sort, that no medicine might auaile to helpe him. Thus they indured foure houres without taking any rest, fighting more fiercely then at the beginning. And being in this controuersie, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the parts next the sea side, they saw comming <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer,</hi> and that stout <hi>Troyan,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> who séeing the battaile, did stay to behold them. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> knew straight wayes the armour of <hi>Bramarant,</hi> who seeing them in the power of another, was very full of wrath, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more tarrying, he put himselfe in the midst among them, and with a furious voyce he sayd. Tell me knight, who made thée so bold to take this armour, from the place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I put them for a <hi>Tropheo</hi> and remembraunce. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan aunswered him and said: Superbious and proud knight, art thou by fortune one of those Gréeke Princes, who with great threatenings dost defende this armour. I am one of them said <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and he that will take away thy life for thy boldnesse, and therewith he drew out his sword for to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault him: but the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did put himselfe before him &amp; said with great curtesie as vnto his elder brother. Knight &amp; prince of <hi>Grecia,</hi> let not your highnes do me so much wrong, to hinder me from being reuenged on this Knight, let mee alone with him, for that I haue so much hope in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength of my arme, to giue a good accompt of him. Therefore I doo desire thée to stand a little a side. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> woulde haue aunswered him, but vpon a sodaine he saw comming from the parte of <hi>Pireo,</hi> a Knight; armed with russet armour, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with stripes and barres of golde, his shield was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Russet and there was painted on it, the God <hi>Cupide</hi> with two faces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:341"/>This was that valiant <hi>Eleno</hi> prince of <hi>Dacia,</hi> who séeing the controuersie betwixt those three knights, passed forwards on his way, saying vnto <hi>Rosicleer</hi> without looking vpon his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and deuice: Knight thou doost wrong to disturbe them them that first began the battell. But <hi>Rosicleer</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great anger and wrath he had to sée that armor in a strangers po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, did not beholde the deuice of his Cousin, and so being both blinde, without anie consideration, they assaulted one another in mortall battaile. This <hi>Dacian</hi> was not slothfull in drawing out of his sword, and to returne his salutation. At such time as from that part of <hi>Grecia,</hi> there appeared a great number of Knightes. But now my pen waxeth we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, and my afflicted spirits doth constraine me to make an end of the second part of this historie: for that with a new courage, I may haue time to translate the third part, which is full of prowesse and valiant déedes.
