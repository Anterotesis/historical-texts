            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After thrÃ©e daies were passed, they were desirous to returne to the Citie againe, and taking vp their tents, they layde all thinges in order, and in readinesse to procÃ©ede on theyr iourney. But as they began to martch on theyr waie, they might perceiue comming a long by the Forrest side a Coach, all couered ouer with blacke Searge, which foure horses did drawe, trapped with such like blacke furniture.

In the end, he cast vp his wretched eyes to the heauens, saieng:<q> O ye trecherous Gods, ioyn in league to defend your selues from mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate hand, stay not, but muster your forces together, for if mine owne hand in the meane while be no impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the cause, by pulling out my heart, I will change the colour of these christalline waters with the Sacrifices of your bloud: for no doubt there resteth more valour in this one knigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hauing thus said, he cast it in the dÃ©epest part of the riuer, not hauing any more weapons but a poore poynado, which vsually he did weare about him: &amp; taking it in his hand, deliuered these speaches vnto it.<q> Thou silly bodkin shalt finish y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pÃ©ece of worke, which all Christendome was neuer able at anie time to beginne, I meane in bereauing me of my wearie &amp; lingering lyfe, for I aboue all men onely deserue to lÃ©ese it, sÃ©eing that I bÃ©eing the sonne of so valiant a Father, haue not shewed anie sparke of that valour which by right ought to descend to mÃ©e from mine auncestour, sith then I haue digressed, I repute my selfe vnworthie to be registred for his sonne.

O cruell homicide of my faithfull and valiant champion: thou thirstie bloudsucker of the royall bloud of <hi>Mesapotamia,</hi> dispatch nowe, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch I saie, to execute thy furie with thy imbrued Swoorde vpon my sorrowfull heart, and speaking these words she fell againe into an extasie as before, which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> marking, and gessing at her inward paine by her extearne countenance, he turned himselfe to one of her Damoysells, which as hÃ©e thought among the rest of hir traine sÃ©emed the chiefest, in knowing most hir Ladies secrets, and sayd vnto hir:
<q>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, I sÃ©e (God knoweth, not without great sorrowe be it spoken) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> griefe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your Lady indureth in viewing my face, therefore I praye you tell hir from me, that I intreate her to goe to the Emperours court of <hi>Greece,</hi> and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent her personage to his maiestie, and certifie him of all these accidents, and there to stay my comming, for I meane short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to returne thether, and then I promise her, that there I will vse such meanes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she shall inioye to her great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that thing, the want wherof doth so greatly grieue her, and because my wordes may carrie more credite with her,

And hÃ©erevpon not tarieng for anye replye, he mounted vpon his horse, coursing through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.

After she had seene the great ouerthrowe of hyr Knights, with an angry countenaunce she turned hir to the Knight and sayd:
<q>The Gods send thÃ©e a perpetuall plague, sith that in such sort thou hast intreated the best Knights in all my Prouince, and sith that our misfortune hath bene so great that thou hast had the power to vanquish my kÃ©epers, I besÃ©ech the Gods, that thy forces hÃ©ereafter may prooue as weake, as my troupe is now poore and slender.

Going forward in his iourney more carefull then hÃ©e was, he heard the third time a voice cryeng vnto him. <hi>O son of Trebatio, couragious Rosicleer, what is become of that pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which was wont to dwel within thy valiant heart, towards the succouring of the oppressed Ladies, why dost thou now begin to faile me.</hi> When he heard himselfe called by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name, it did strike him into a greater dumpe then hÃ©e was in before, hÃ©erewith imagining that the voyce came foorth of the ship which he sawe at the shore side, hÃ©e lighted from his horse, and nimblie leapte into the Boate, and his horse as if he had vnderstanding followed him.

This great kindnesse was friendly receiued by the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince, and after many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations he thought it most conuenient to returne to his Countrie, and also it seemed him best for his most safetie to cut the seas, for beeing vnprouided of a horse, he might fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some daunger, beeing strongly encountered. Wherevppon without more tarriaunce the Prince armed himselfe with his guilt armour, and girded his swoord close vnto him, and mounted behinde the Prince, and so going where Fortune would guide them, and where the horse made choice of the waie, in the end after a little space they came to the shoare of the sea, where they found a straight and narrowe path, hard by the same, which seemed to them the direct passage to finde some hauen, where they might trauailing imbarke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and in this manner as I haue told you, they saw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards them in the sea a faire barke well rigged and trimmed, wherin they saw no pilot to gouerne it, but it made directly toward the place, which when the two Princes sawe it came so nÃ©ere the lande, they alighted, and drawing more nÃ©ere, there lanched forth a Gentlewoman all alone, in a mild kinde of spÃ©ech she spake and sayde vnto them.
<q>Noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> which at this present is resident in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> commendeth himselfe vnto you both, and by me hath sent you this faire barke, which with his art shall bring you where he hath extreame nÃ©ede of your valour, and farther he praieth you not to stand in suspition of that which I saie vnto you, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth is, he hath great occasion to put in proofe your soueraign knighthood. </q>The knight of the Sun his heart throbbed with ioye to heare the newes which the Gentlewoman tolde him, and especially for that it shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:13973:28"/>
be his good Fortune to doo him pleasure, which loued him so tenderly, and had done so much for him in his childhood, and hÃ©erewithall the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince leapt into the bark, and after him his noble cousin, leading <hi>Cornerino</hi> by the bridle, and tourning vnto the Gentlewoman, he saide vnto her on this wise.</p>
               <p>I am assured that mine olde and approued friende the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> doth fauour me so greatlye, that he will not sÃ©e me staide for lacke of a shippe, either to pleasure my selfe or to doe him a good turne.
The Gentlewoman hauing done great reuerence, tourned her spÃ©ech to <hi>Don Eleno</hi> and sayd to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Ualiaunt and amorous Knight, <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth your royall hands, and willed me to tell you that your captiued heart somewhat lately amended shall in the end bÃ©e throughly helped, to your no lesse comfort then great ioy, and because your present estate is sorrowful and fraughted with griefe, he sendeth you this armour which is aunswerable to your mourning minde, wrought with a Metaphore, which declareth your passions alreadie passed,</q> and saying this, shÃ©e tooke the trunke wherein the armour was laide, &amp; albeit the Prince made hast to giue the Gentlewoman thankes, shÃ©e was so nimble in vanishing awaie, that his thankes came too short, whereat he was more abashed then before.
The Knight of the Sunne tying his horse in one part of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, sawe standing by him another more beautifull, the which he knew presently the Gentlewoman had brought for his cousin, and making toward him to sÃ©e what armour the wise man had sent him, bÃ©eing laide abroad, sawe them wrought all with one worke, <hi>LL,</hi> and the shÃ©eld was of strong and fine stÃ©ele, the field blacke, and therin was set a groue, so liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as there appeared to be nothing but trÃ©es, and lykewise there was wrought in it many fine inuentions, which did te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie to be the artificiall worke of the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo.</hi> And in the middest amongest those trÃ©es there was a fayre Lady shaddowed, apparelled in a straunge attire, in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce

               <p>The sight of these strange deuises made the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince verie pensiue, and caused him to meruaile much at the great art that was vsed in the framing hÃ©ereof, it was so dainetely handeled. But in the meane time that these two Princes were thus musing and beholding these straunge things, the shippe slyst the Seas, with a braue gale of winde, and carried them so swiftly that when they called to minde the straungenesse hÃ©ereof they were greatly astonished. In this wise they sayled sixe dayes, not knowing whether they went, nor whether the shippe would carrie them: neyther could they see anie lande, but they were assured of this, that they were directed by the will of the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo.</hi> And sayled not towarde <hi>Dacia,</hi> whereat the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> was greatly discomforted, but this griefe was somewhat stayed by the gentle perswasions which the knight of the Sunne vsed.</p>
               <p>After the long and wearisome trauaile which these two noble Princes sustained, one morning by the pÃ©epe of the daie, they did discouer not farre from the place where they were, the lande, towardes which coast the Shippe say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amaine, the Knightes verye ioyfull hÃ©ereof beganne to arme themselues, with set purpose to land there. Not long after the shippe came to the shoare with such a bottome rush, sticking fast in the sandes, that they thought shÃ©e had bene slit in sunder. Which sodaine chaunce made them with all spÃ©ede to leape to the lande, assuring themselues that the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> had ordeined the staie to be made there, wherefore without tarrying anie longer, they tooke theyr horses and mounted vppon them, and presently after the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> made proofe of the goodnesse of his horse, which was sent him by the wise man, and broching his sides with the Spurres, hÃ©e founde him verye readye, strong, and light.

               <p>These valiant knights not meaning to slÃ©epe out the daie, they vndertooke theyr iourny, and in trauailing they came to a narrowe and straight lane which lead them by the foote of a huge and stÃ©epe mountaine, they had not long rid, but they entered into a broade and rough path, alwayes hoping that the countrey would prooue very pleasaunt and well shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ride in: but after they had tolde all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Trauailing onwardes they found that this croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked waie was diuided into two broade lanes: And then bÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a doubt which waie they might take, stood still, and in the end they did determine betwÃ©ene them to make a diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the one to take the right hand, and the other the left. And thus these two valiaunt knightes parted the waie betweene them both, bÃ©eing right sorrowfull that theyr late acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was so vntimely separated by a crooked lane. The one hauing lost the sight of the other, they rode very sadly, and the Knight of the Sunne trauailed all that daye, and could not happen vpon any path that might guide him to some towne or Uillage. The night wrapping hir selfe in her browne Mantell, made the Grecian alight from his <hi>Cornerino,</hi> nigh vnto a faire Forrest and grÃ©ene meddowe, adorned with all sweete and smelling flowers, and pulling of his bridle he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to fÃ©ed in the grÃ©ene medow. This valiant knight beeing somewhat wearie of the trauaile he had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day before, layde himselfe downe vppon the greene and pleasant grasse, to ease his wearie limmes and to passe away the night, wher
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13973:29"/>
he slept vntil such time as the graie morning with the notes of the swÃ©et singing birds awaked him. This valiant Prince bÃ©eing start vp, returned vnto his new begun iourney, &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed so long, that at the last he came to a verie faire and cleare riuer, and going along by the brinke of the same hÃ©e beheld, howe by reason of the calme winde that did blowe, there did arise manye small bubbles in the water, the sight whereof did greatly delight him, vntil such time as he discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the same certaine little streames and droppes of bloud, at the view wherof he was striken into a meruaiolus admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the farther he went, the streames did more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew forth the skarlet coulour thereof, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the clÃ©ere and christalline water had lost his naturall coulour, &amp; was changed into a crimosin, which strange and vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted case procured the noble knight of the Sunne to bÃ©e halfe amazed, and meruailed greatly whereof should procÃ©ede such abundance of this bloudie water. And hauing an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to knowe the head spring of the riuer, and the occasion thereof, he caused his horse to hast his pase somewhat more fast, alwaies hauing an eie to the waie from whence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die streames descended, but in the end he lost the sight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by reason of a little hill which was betwÃ©ene him and the riuer, and there he was constrained to take another path, which did leade him vnto the toppe of the saide hill, which in truth was not farre distaunt from the brooke or Riuer, And when he came to the toppe of this hill, he beheld there a piller of Marble stone artificiallye wrought and firmelye fixed in the ground. Upon the highest part of the piller, there was fastened a chaine, whereat hanged a very faire table of Cipers woode, and therein was written certayne wordes, which this noble Knight began to read, the contents were as followeth.</p>

This lamentable spectacle, this noble <hi>Greek</hi> beheld, with such surpassing sorrow, as almost no heart can comprehend: but bÃ©eing rauished as it were with desire, to be resolued of the effect of this so monstrous inhumanitie, he procÃ©eded farther, till at length he approched the Temple, where he discouered a posterne dore to be open, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent alighting from his horse with a heroycall courage, being incensed with anger, he rushed in, hoping there to haue found the homicide, which was the chiefe auctor of this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall crueltie.

                  <q>This countrey wherein thou now art, is that auncient and famous kingdome of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> which not long since, was gouerned by one of the most puissaunt Kings that euer raigned therein, or in any Prouince hÃ©ereabout: but death, by his accustomed furie, depriued him of his life, and all his loyall subiects, of a vertuous and louing Lord, leauing the guiding of the Kingdome, in the power of two very fayre and Angelicall damosels, his daughters, who represented the former vertues of their noble &amp; late deceased father.

And in such sort they mainteined the wars, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in small time they put the citie in great perill to be lost, and likewise the whole kingdome.

sooner had he deliuered these speaches, incensed with furie, he set his hand to his sword, &amp; ouerthrew the image of <hi>Diana,</hi> that was there, &amp; parted it in two parts: and yet not content with this sacriligious fact, he descended from the scaffolde, exclaiming against the sorrowfull <hi>Tinacrian</hi> people, and sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: O villaines and traitors, it is not possible but that all you were consenting vnto this cruell fact, and determined euil. And vttering these and such like reasons, in his diuelish furie, he began to flourish with his sword cutting, killing, and wounding on euery side, with such vnmercifull crueltie, that in a small time there did not remaine one of all them, that were there present, but I alone: and by reason that I was one of the Priests of <hi>Diana,</hi> he saued my life, although he little esteemed it. Then when this fierce and bloudie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell did sÃ©e that all were slaine, and that we two onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, he tooke the dead QuÃ©ene in his armes, &amp; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to follow him with my praiers and orisons accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto <hi>Diana,</hi> and bringing hir to this place, he strayght wayes commaunded this Chappell to be buylded, in this order as you now sÃ©e, and promised by vowe vnto all the Gods, to sacrifice euery wÃ©eke sixe persons, naturally borne in the lande of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> thrÃ©e men, and thrÃ©e women, in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the bloudie sacrifice that they consented to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by their deceased QuÃ©ene.

And you shall vnderstand moreouer (gentle Knight) that the Citie is so strong, that it is not possible to win the same, neither by force of armes, neither by hunger or any other ingen, for that it is so well furnished with munition and vittailes: yet in the citie there are but a small number of Knights, which for their great fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie

Now hÃ©ere (gentle Knight) I haue declared vnto thÃ©e that which thou so greatly didst desire to knowe, requesting thÃ©e to returne backe againe, he way that thou didst come, &amp; to kÃ©epe thy self from fÃ©eling the euent of this expressed euil.</q>
The noble Prince which with strange attension gaue care vnto this sorowfull Priest, bÃ©eing fullye determined to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture his lyfe for to violate this cruell and wicked cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, answered, (not according to the counsell the which he gaue him, but according vnto his couragious determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) saying. Friend, where is (I besÃ©ech thÃ©e) the abiding of this vnmercifull giant, &amp; which is the way y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leadeth thether. The old Priest replied, His Castle is two leagues distaunt from this temple: but what shall it auaile thÃ©e to know the same? &amp; what profit wilt thou get by going thether, but only death: but if thou wilt nÃ©edes aduenture thy selfe, the same which brought thÃ©e hether, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> direct way thether, for other there is none. Moreouer, the valiant prince demanded of him if he could aduertise him how many knights &amp; what store of people the Gyant had about him, and he aunswered that the most part of them that wer about him were seruants, &amp; that all the rest of his knightes and men of warre, were placed in other castles and fortes of the Iland. And while they were occupied in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>munication, they heard without the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell horsemen, as it appeared by the treading and noyse of their horses. Wherefore to vnderstand what they were, they staid their talk, &amp; the prince issued out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chappell, where he found sixe knights, armed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> verie good &amp; strong armor, who were alighting from their horses to enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chappel, but
<pb facs="tcp:13973:35"/>
when these knightes espyed the Prince so well proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and of so good disposition, &amp; with his armour of strange deuice contrarie vnto theirs, then one of those sixe knightes which sÃ©emed to haue more authoritie then the rest, sayd. Oh Knight, what infernall furie hath hardned thÃ©e to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hether, knowing the custome which is vsed hÃ©ere. But it sÃ©emeth vnto me that rather ignorance is the occasion hÃ©ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, more then anie other thing, wherefore I am content to let thÃ©e depart againe vpon condition, that thou leauest with me thy armour and thy horse (if it be thine to giue) for that they doo greatly delight me. This valiant Prince dissembling his anger, with a very merrie and smiling countenance made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</p>
               <p>You haue sayd true, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignorance hath brought me hether, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am a straunger in this countrie, and neuer vnderstood that anie such crueltie hath ben vsed hÃ©ere till now, that this good olde man hath tolde mÃ©e. But to giue thÃ©e my armour<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> I am not determined at this time, for that I am not accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to trauaile without it. And as for my horse, I doo insure thÃ©e that he will let none take his backe but my selfe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were best thou aske some other thing, for that in this I pretend not to accomplish thy request. They vnderstanding the wordes which the Prince aunswered vnto them, one of the sixe knights pretending more hardinesse then all the rest, replyed. I will sÃ©e how thou canst defend thy horse, and with that he went to laie hande on the horse bridle, which he had not so soone proffered, when the fierce horse opened his mouth and with great furie he caught him by the shoulder, and lift him vp from the ground, and in his fall he all to trampled &amp; troade him in pÃ©eces, and so slew him.

               <p>In this sorte doth my horse rewarde them that bÃ©e so bolde and hardie of enterprise. Then the Knight which did first speake vnto the Prince, sayde vnto him with excÃ©eding great anger.

I am afraide that if in this sort you battayle with my horse, he will in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> all danger of the losse of my armour. Then this other knight hearing these wordes, which he tooke to be a greate reproch vnto him, bÃ©eing almost ouercom with anger, in a great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and rage he drew out his sword, and flourishing it about his head, he saide. The greate outrage which thy horse hath hÃ©ere done, (as I before said) thou shalt spÃ©edely repay with the losse of thy lyfe, and vttering these words, he smote the Prince vppon the helme so vehemently and with such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that the very sparkes of fire sprong out, &amp; fell burning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. This noble prince fÃ©eling y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> blowe not looked for, determined that that miserable knight should not go vnpaied for his good deede, least he should praise himselfe for dooing it, but with great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tourning to another, at one blowe he parted his shÃ©eld in pÃ©eces, &amp; cut off his arme fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his shulder. Then the other knight which remained aliue, sÃ©eing his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>panions to be so ill intreated by one only knight, thought it best to saue his life by trusting to his legs, rather then to repose any confidence in his prowesse, for that hÃ©e
<pb facs="tcp:13973:36"/>
thought it would little preuaile him, and betaking him to his feete, he fledde awaie: Of whome this noble Prince made small account, but let him go, the olde priest of whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoke, was present and beheld all that had happened, and meruailed verie much at the great prowesse of the vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Knight. And this noble Prince seeing himselfe clÃ©ere of them that would haue done him wrong, retourned vnto the Priest and asked him if he hadde anie thing that he might eate, and requested him to let him haue it, for that he hunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and had great nÃ©ede thereof. Then this Priest gaue him such meate as he hadde for himselfe, still perswading the Prince for to returne againe the same way hee came, and not to put himselfe, into that so daungerous and terrible an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, but this heroycal prince made little reckoning of his requests, but giuing him great thanks for the good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he gaue him, he tooke his leaue of him, &amp; went the same which lead way towards the castle where the giaunt dwelt, &amp; trauailing by little &amp; little with an easie foote pace, he anone had a sight thereof, and perceiued that it was verie fayre to behold, and walled about verie strongly, which he beheld not long, but that he harde a Trumpet sound with meruailous sweete melodie, and at the sound thereof there looked out of a window a gyant, being a yong man of great &amp; large bignes, &amp; comely in all parts accordingly, his face was verie ire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And placing his words with great discreation he answered

and sayd. I come to demand battaile of thÃ©e O King, not for that thou hast at anie time grÃ©eued mÃ©e, or giuen mee cause, but onelye to take awaye and frustrate (if it bÃ©e possible) this euill and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when he felte this course intertainment, his cholar double increasing, hÃ©e lyghtlye recouered, and lifting his clubbe aboue his head, he determined to repaye the Prince with such vnresonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, that at that one blowe hÃ©e woulde ende the battayle: (which in dÃ©ede if in the descending, it hadde lighted on the GrÃ©eke, it hadde not a little indaungered him).

hÃ©e was perswaded, that hÃ©e was descended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to make that combat with him, whereby to worke his destruction. And therewith his furie double increasing, with an infernall anger, he multiplied his blowes with so great hast and strength, that he caused the GrÃ©eke, to bestur him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from one place to another to make his defence: but he as one which was not idle, but by these means the more inflamed, letting slip the bridle of all patience, his valiant &amp; heroycall courage double increased, and his strength &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse did surmount in such sort, that vnder his harnesse in more then ten places he hurt the Giaunt, and although the wounds were not great, yet the bloud that issued out, was very much. Then the Giant sÃ©eing himselfe in such a pickle, threw his shielde from him to the ground, and with both his handes tooke his great cutting sword, &amp; heauing it aloft, he let it fall with such wonderfull furie, that it was verye straunge to beholde. But this politike Prince sÃ©eing on which part this terrible blowe would fall, determined not to receiue it, but with a light leape did clÃ©ere himselfe from the fall thereof, the which fell to the grounde with so greate and terrible hast, that the halfe of it entred into the earth, and by reason that the stroke was giuen more of anger then of cunning, by the great strength that he put to it, he could not keepe himselfe, but was forced with the stroke to fall with his breast vpon the pommell of his sword. He was no sooner downe, but the Sonne of <hi>Trebatio</hi> gaue him another vpon his helme, that it sounded as though he had stroke vpon a bell, wherewith the Giant fell flat to the ground, greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished, and almost beside himselfe. This valiant <hi>Greeke</hi> when he sawe him in this traunce, laide fast holde vpon his helme, and with the excÃ©eding strength that he set to it, hÃ©e pulled it from his head. The Giant which was then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what recouered, caught holde vpon the skirt of his harnesse, and pulled the Knight towards him with such strength, that he was not able to make resistaunce, but nÃ©edes he must go whether his strong arme carried him.

               <p>
                  <q>O king, if thou wouldest acknowledge this greate cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which thou committest, and the small reason which thou hast to execute it, and howe greatly thou doest erre and art ouersÃ©ene, in thinking that thou seruest thy Gods in maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and defending such extreame tyrannie, thou shouldest do much better, &amp; so returne vnto the knowledge of my God, who is the true creator of heauen &amp; earth and all that therin is<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Then the Gyant replied vnto him &amp; sayd: Of truth (gentle Knight) thou knowest well how to extoll thy God in whome thou dooest belÃ©eue, but howe shall I knowe that this thy God is of more goodnesse and vertue then my Gods.

easie and apparant to be sÃ©ene and perceiued. Tell me I praie thÃ©e that if at anie time thy Gods haue in their owne causes had anie power or defence? no surely, for if they had, then would not they haue suffered themselues to bÃ©e so ill intreated of them who should worship and serue them, for if at anie time your Gods doe not graunt vnto your requests, and performe that which you would haue them doo, then you beginne to curse and to banne them, and speake the worst that may be spoken of them, and some of them you throwe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire and burne, and other some you pull out of their Tabernacles, and tread them vnder your fÃ©ete and polute them, and presently you leaue them and chaunge them for other new Gods, and vnto them you doe your worshippe till such time as they likewise fulfill not what you aske of them, and yet these poore and infortunate Gods are in no fault, for that at anie time they cannot helpe themselues, but doeth burne in the pit of hell. So that it commeth of a great sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wilt belÃ©eue in the diuell, who is the authour of all euill, and forget the creator of all thinges, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thÃ©e this thy strength and prowesse, and will deliuer thÃ©e in all thy necessities. Oh king thou shouldest not nÃ©ede any other proofe, but onely that which thou thy selfe diddest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the image of <hi>Diana.</hi> For in thy anger thou diddest throw it downe and cut it with thy swoord, and diddest vnto it all the euill that thou couldest, so that if they had had anie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thinkest thou then they woulde haue suffered that thou shouldest haue offered this outrage vnto them, no I tell thÃ©e thou mightst not haue bene once so hardie as to haue moued against them. </q>The Gyant who then was somwhat touched with the truth, sayd.</p>
               <p>Worthie Prince, I henceforth promise thÃ©e, that I wil serue this thy God &amp; wil desire thy frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dship &amp; remaine thy friend, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast opened my eies &amp; giuen me the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true life.

And moreouer to giue order vnto all his knights and Gentlemen, that they followe no more this wicked race, but commaund them to returne vnto theyr owne Countries, and to remaine there in the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning thereof, with his brother <hi>Tramarando.</hi> And the like words he spake vnto his owne knights that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that time, and when the valiant knight of the Sunne heard these words, which procÃ©eded from the Gyauntes heart without anye dissimulation, he receiued so great pleasure therein, that incontinent he threw his swoord to the ground, and pulled off his helme from his head, and ranne and caught the Gyant in his armes, and with great loue imbraced him, giuing him to vnderstand the great contentment that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to heare that he would forsake his false Gods, &amp; turne to the true and liuing God, the author of all goodnesse. The Gyaunt when he sawe his face discouered, he much meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to sÃ©e the great beautie of that Prince, and tooke him fast by the hande, and departed towardes the Castell, reasoning with him of diuerse matters by the waie, And when hÃ©e came to the Castell, he straight wayes commaunded that a shippe shoulde bÃ©e made in a readinesse with all kinde of furniture belonging to it, for that without anie delaie he would prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his voyage, and so curing himselfe of the small wounds which he hadde, which did a little trouble him, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded straight that they should bring him somwhat to eate, for that it was nÃ©edfull, as well for the great trauaile he had in the former battaile, as also for the losse of so much bloud which ranne out of his woundes. And when he hadde ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and dined according to his desire, without anye more delaie or further resting himselfe he stayed not so much as to pull off his harnesse, but departed out of the Castell, and entered presently into the Shippe, and without taking

anie farther leaue he commaunded to hoise vp the sayles, and caused the Marriners to direct theyr course towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> leauing greate charge with the knight of the Sunne for to burie the bodie of <hi>Arcalanda,</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to perfourme with all his heart.

So this gyant bÃ©eing departed his iourney, the knight of the Sunne without anie more tarryeng asked where he might finde this <hi>Tefereo,</hi> and when he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the place he tooke his iourney thetherwards, and left order with the people that there remained, that they shoulde not remoue nor departe till such time as he retourned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. So long he trauailed that daie that the night drew on, and towards his left hande he heard a greate rumor and noise of harnesse, whereat he tourned about that waie with <hi>Cornerino</hi> his horse, where we will leaue them, to tell you of all that which happened vnto the knight <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi>

               <p>This dolorous Knight could not procÃ©ede forwards with this musicke begunne, by reason of a Damzell, which was in that place vnknowen vnto him, and therefore vnlooked for, who with a softe and milde voyce saluted him, and this Knight retourned hir againe the courtesie she offered. Then this Damosell right sorrowfully said. It doth well appeare sir Knight that thou doest not knowe howe nÃ©ere thou art vnto the perill of death, considering that so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all care thou art publishing these thy passions of loue. Unto whom he aunswered and said.</p>

                  <q>I doo knowe verye well faire Ladie, that alwayes I

beare about me a deadly perill. But alas, how can I helpe that, although this occasion hath brought me into such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, considering that it is so ordained. But to what end faire Damosell, you haue vttered these wordes, I am as yet altogether ignoraunt, wherefore I would be very glad to knowe somewhat, whereby I might haue occasion to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get these thoughts, &amp; to bring my selfe in care of some new defence. Then this Damosell drewe nigh to him and said, Thou shalt vnderstand sir Knight, that this Countrie in which thou art, is the olde and auncient Kingdome of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacria,</hi> whose happie dayes, which in times past it had, are now abated, and the great felicitie thereof is turned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. Then this Damosell did relate vnto him, all the whole storie that you haue heard, which the olde Priest told vnto the Knight of the Sunne his Cousin: but the great sorrow that he receiued in the hearing of so great crueltie, constrained a fewe salt teares to fall from his eyes, from the which he could not refraine. And procÃ©eding<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> forwardes in hir talke, she said, You shall vnderstand sir Knight, that I am a Damosell belonging to the Countesse of <hi>Modica,</hi> who is nowe in companie with the vertuous QuÃ©ene <hi>Garofilea,</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Sarragosa,</hi> hÃ©ere in the lande of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> by whom I was sent about certaine businesse, and came nowe from thence.</q>
Uerely, the hearing of this terrible and heauie historie, did verie much cause this noble Knight to lament, &amp; compelled his hart to earne, although on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trarie he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce very much, for that now in the beginning of his knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, he might imploie himselfe and his valiant courage in such terrible conflictes, whereby he might winne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a renowmed name and reporte, if so it please God that he may goe forward with this enterprise. So he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with himselfe, to loose his lyfe in this quarrell, or else to set the same Citie at libertie, although hÃ©e gaue not the Damosell to vnderstand anie thing concerning this his intent, who in the end of many good reasons and pittifull perswasions that shÃ©e vsed in coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He had not ridden farre when he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Citie, which was meruailously adorned with To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers and fortresses, but yet round about it was to be sÃ©ene a meruailous and dolorous spectacle of dead men and women torne in pÃ©eces, and others hanged by the necke vppon Iyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets hard by the walls, and some vpon trÃ©es which were in the field nigh at hand, which caused the Prince to stay, and to sigh with great sorrow and teares in the beholding of so inhumane crueltie, and in bitternesse of heart he said,
<q>O Lord how wonderfull be thy secrets, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou sufferest this Knight to vse so great crueltie without punishing of him, it cannot be without some great mysterie which thy diuine Maiestie doth pretend. I beseech thÃ©e (O Lorde) to giue me so much grace and strength, that I may cause this great crueltye to be taken away, and vtterly to cease. O noble Citie, I cannot iudge what anger fortune should receiue of thÃ©e, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth thou shouldest be subiect vnto such vnmercifull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so much without pitie and compassion. Well, I maye say, that as <hi>Grecia</hi> may brag hir selfe of most excellent, wise &amp; learned men which it hath brought vp, euen so maist thou complaine, that against thÃ©e hath bene fostered two terrible and abhominable tyrants. And in saieng these wordes: hee drew nigh the gates of the Citie, which for feare of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of the Giant, they kept shut, &amp; taking hold at the ring
<pb facs="tcp:13973:44"/>
therof he began to knock<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> which he had not so soone done, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lifting vp his eyes, he beheld to descend from aboue out of a bulwarke a great frÃ©e stone which was cast downe by the hands of a Gentlewoman, which came so sodainly, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most had no time to deliuer himselfe from receiuing the fall the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But when this Gentlewoman sawe that the stone fell downe without doing anie harme, with a grÃ©euous and terrible sigh that procÃ©eded from her heart, she sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Art thou that cursed <hi>Tefereo,</hi> through whose cause the most part of the mournfull matrones of this distressed Citie are made widowes, and with great affliction are inforced to bewaile the losse of their louing husbandes and welbeloued sonnes? Art thou he that doth not onely content thy selfe to kill them and teare them in pÃ©eces, but also hangest them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, and garnishest the walls of this our vnhappie Citie with the bodies of them? Art thou that sonne of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, which without all feare of the Gods hath put our Citie in this extreame necessitie? Oh cruell tyrant, open the eyes of thy vnderstanding, and let some sparke of pittie reigne in thy heart, and suffer not that for thy cause onely so worthie a Countrie as this is should be destroied? Let it suffice thÃ©e y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast alreadie bene the occasion that all these noble ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of this Citie, haue lost their rest &amp; forgot their estate, and are nowe become as scowtes in the warres, and frame themselues to weare armour.</q>
This gentle knight of <hi>Dacia</hi> would not suffer her to procÃ©ede anie farther, but cut off her tale, and with greate sobernesse he sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Gentlewoman, I am not he that you take me for, but I come hether rather (if so bÃ©e I maie) by some meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your rest, &amp; deliuer you from this outrage that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you. Then this gentlewoman with much more anger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. O traitour, doest thou thinke that by thy treasons and subtiltyes to increase our care more then hetherto thou hast done?

The good will which hath brought mÃ©e hether, gentle mistresse, aunswered <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> doeth not deserue to be thus ill intreated of you, who for to procure your libertie will put his life in aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I suppose I doe deserue better enterteinement at your handes. Well, let it be what it will bÃ©e, sayd this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but touching thy comming into the Citie, it is laboure lost to speake, neuerthelesse if thou art not that cruell knight whom I did take thÃ©e for, turne thÃ©e about and looke towards the corner of yonder towre, which standeth amongest the grÃ©ene trees, and there thou shalt finde him, whom I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue without sÃ©eking for thou bringest with thÃ©e, &amp; </q>so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie more speaking this Gentlewoman went from the wall, and left this knight alone. Then the Prince <hi>Don Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> sÃ©eing himselfe alone, tooke the waie which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman shewed him, wherein he had not trauailed farre, but in the middest of a groaue amongest a companie of grÃ©ene trÃ©es, he sawe a verie faire house and well wrought, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto when he approched he found that the gates were shut and closed verie fast.
And drawing nigh the gate, he tooke the ring in his hand and gaue a greate stroke, at the sounde whereof there looked a man out of a windowe of the same house, and by the riches of the armour that the Knight ware, he knew that he was none of their companie, but said vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Who art thou that art so hardie bÃ©eing a straunger, which without feare doest call at the gate, whereas thou canst not escape, but must of necessitie suffer death. Friend aunswered this <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight, goe thy wayes and tell thy Lorde <hi>Tefereo,</hi> that hÃ©ere is a knight of a straunge Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie that hath a great desire to speake with him. </q>This man without anie aunswering went awaie from the windowe,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:45"/>
And not long after, there was another window opened more lower then the first, from whence there looked out a knight who seemed to be of a gentle disposition, his face somewhat swart of coulour, who with great curtesie said.
Knight what is it that thou wouldest haue, for I am he whom thou doest sÃ©eke for: that which I would haue aunswered <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> is, that thou doest leaue this diuellish custome which thou doest hÃ©ere maintaine, for that a knight of thy disposition and manner shuld rather occupie himselfe in breaking these euill customes, then in maintaining them, for these be not works of a knight the which thou doest, but of an infernall diuell, I therfore much maruell how thou vsing so much crueltie, thou doest liue with so great ease and without care. Come therefore thou tyrant and arme thy selfe, and I hope thou shalt hÃ©ere paie the tribute of all these euills which thou hast done, for it is not reason that so diuellish and cruell a man as thou art shouldest liue. These reasons did little trouble this Gyant, neyther made hÃ©e anie reckoning of them, but with his accustomed sobrietie, he answered.</p>
               <p>Miserable knight, thou doest not knowe how hÃ©ere thou doest seeke thy owne death in demaunding battaile of mÃ©e, therefore returne againe the waie thou camest, for thy te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>der age and smooth face without a bearde doth moue me to vse this my vertue and curtesie with thÃ©e, and considering that thou art a straunger and not of this Countrie. Then this <hi>Dacian</hi> knight aunswered. It is not this that I doe sÃ©eke, but to accomplish this which I haue tolde thÃ©e, and if my wordes are not sufficient to cause thÃ©e to leaue this which thou doest exercise, I do belÃ©eue that my swoord will ere long compell thÃ©e thereto, for either I will die the death or else I will depriue thy bodie of that dampnable and accursed soule, and send it whether as thou hast sent manie a better then thine is. To these wordes this <hi>Tefereo</hi> aunswered nothing at all, but withdrewe himselfe in great hast from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, and called for his armour, the which was all blacke, and of a verie faire and straunge making, he was with a trice armed, and being on horse backe, the great and princely Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13973:45"/>
gate was opened, whereat issued out this <hi>Sardenian</hi> with a gentle and demure countenaunce, and after him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a page with two speares in his hand, of the which <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereo</hi> tooke the one, and sent vnto the Prince the other, who standing in nÃ©ede accepted it, and without farther reasoning they turned their horses about with such courage and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that the lyke hath bÃ©ene seldome sÃ©ene betwÃ©ene two knights. And when each of them wer come into their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place, they set spurres to their horses with as great force as the thunder in the aire, and mÃ©eting together in the midde way with their speares, their shockes were so terrible that it was wonder to sÃ©e, so that not one of them failed of his blow, but ioyned in such sort, that the staues (although they were verie strong) brake, and the shÃ©euers of them separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the aire with great violence, and yet the valyaunt knights both remained in their saddles, no more mooued then a rocke by the sea side. But when either of them behelde the little harme they had done in this their iust, they both with their swordes in their handes returned their horses, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to strike so extreamly the one vppon the other, that their bodies felt the force of their armes, and although their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was not cut, yet it could not be but their flesh shuld re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue damage. In this sort trauailed these two knights more then an houre, without knowledge of anie aduauntage, but either of them were inflamed with anger to sÃ©e his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to indure so long, and the knightly courage of each of them did more and more increase, and their excÃ©eding cholar was such, that the battaile began to be more terrible then at the first. But this furious <hi>Tefereo</hi> somewhat fÃ©eling, and therefore by experience knowing the surpassing strength and valiant courage of his enimie, although he did not greatlye meruaile at it, yet it did cause him to be more furious, and bÃ©eing incensed in such sorte, that with both his handes hÃ©e tooke his swoord, and strake at him such a stroke vppon the helme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the blowe sounded through all the fields, &amp; made an ecko in the mountaines, that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waight thereof the <hi>Dacian</hi> knight was constrained somwhat to incline his head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb facs="tcp:13973:46"/>
and remained a while without his remembrance, but his horse being scarred with that terrible stroke, gaue a great leape towards the one side, by the which he deliuered his master from the seconde blowe, which <hi>Tefereo</hi> thought to haue bestowed on him. The <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight being againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and not a little abashed at this blowe, setteled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his saddle, and throwing his shield from him to the ground, he tooke his sword fast in his hand, and stroke <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereo</hi> so terribly vpon his helme, with his sword some what flatling, (by reason whereof, the force of the blow somwhat abated, it slid downe vpon his lefte shoulder,) that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained him to stoupe forwards with all his bodie, and if he had not clasped his armes about his horse necke, hÃ©e had fallen downe to the ground, and with the force of this great blowe, the horse was constrained also to boow his fore fÃ©ete, who with a sodaine and furious force rose vp again: wherat this noble <hi>Dacian</hi> warriour, with great hast pricked his horse with the spurres, pretending to make an ende of this cruell battaile with his second blowe: but it fell out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, for that <hi>Tefereo</hi> comming againe to himselfe, as fierce as a Lion, thrust forwards against his aduersarie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing (if it passed not his power) to repay againe with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, that which he had receiued. Now hÃ©ere began a newe their battaile, and their forces multiplied in such furious sort, that all the mountaines and valleyes, were occupyed with the noyse of their terrible strokes. The courage was so great of these two Knights, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many times they lost theyr wits, with the weight of the terrible raps which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued one of another. Then this Prince <hi>Don Eleno</hi> sayde to himselfe, that if all the rest of the Knights with whome hÃ©e shoulde haue battaile, were of no lesse prowesse then this present Knight, that he feared quickly to be disgraced: and on the other side, <hi>Tefereo</hi> found himselfe very sore troubled, and saw that he was in so great distresse, began to inuocate vpon his Gods for aid. The prowes, strength, &amp; pollicie was such betwÃ©ene these two Princes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whosoeuer had ben pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to haue beheld y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, wold haue said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©en

them expressed, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knighthood in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: for it was wonderfull to sÃ©e, how somtimes they pressed forwards, and presently retired backwards, as wel to bestow as to auoyde their terrible strokes. It was ful thrÃ©e houres, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these noble knights thus contended together, &amp; yet there appeared not in them any kind of faintnes, but by their behauior, ther stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gth sÃ©emed stil more and more to encrease. Then this heroycall <hi>Dacian</hi> not accustomed to find such resistance, began to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get al patience, &amp; as one ouercome w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> anger clasped his sword fast in his hand, &amp; being setled in his sadle, he stroke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giant so hard in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midst of the helme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heuines of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow, he was forced to fall backwards vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crupper of his horse without any reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>brance, &amp; with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great strengh the Prince put to this blow, his sword flew out of his hand, &amp; hanged by the wrist band, which while he recouered, <hi>Tefereo</hi> returned to himselfe, and with outragious anger (prouoked by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great paine he felt) with both his hands he strake such a blow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for at <hi>Don Eleno</hi> with the halfe swoord vpon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, in such furious sort, that it bereaued him of his sight, &amp; glauncing wise it descended downe vpon the head pÃ©ece of the horse, but by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first blow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last had small strength, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it did but little harme, notwithstanding it amazed the horse in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with his staggering the Prince was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to vse pollicie to kÃ©ep himselfe from falling from his backe, but when his horse was recouered, he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, so inflamed with anger as though sparks of fire had is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out of his mouth, &amp; crushing his tÃ©eth together, he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these words.

in his stirrops, and stroke the Giant so terrible and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a blowe, that the bloud gushed out of his nose &amp; mouth, and therewith he fell to the ground as though he had bene dead.
He was no sooner downe, but with great lightnesse the <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight leapt from his horse, and stept to the Giant to vnlace his healme, which while hÃ©e was a dooing, hÃ©e heard a voyce which sayd, Doo not kill him knight, doo not kill him, and tourning his head about to sÃ©e who it was that so disturbed him, he perceiued it to be his cousin the Knight of the Sunne. (This was the great noyse of harnesse, that the Knight of the Sunne heard towards his left hand, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue tolde you.) So when <hi>Don Eleno</hi> had pulled of the Gyaunts helme, he withdrew himselfe apart, and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin alighted from his horse, and presently came and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him with excÃ©eding ioye, and no little loue, which the more increased, when he considered that the Knight which should vanquish so great a Giant, could not be but of great valour, as it appeared by that furious blowe, by which the Giaunt was meruailously martyred: for the astonishment was such, that in a great while after <hi>Tefereo</hi> could not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himselfe, till such time as they brought water from the house which was hard by, and threw it in his face, by which meanes, he came to his remembraunce, and sÃ©eing himselfe in such a pickle, and the sworde of his conquerour prepared for his death, I doo referre vnto your iudgemens, what such a valiant Knight should thereof conceiue, and with a verye great and sad sigh he said.</p>

Therefore knowe worthy Knight, that the royall bloud of <hi>Dacia</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the death of <hi>Tefereo,</hi> neither was it my request to haue thee ouercome, but onely to haue thÃ©e conuerted from thy cruell conditions, to the ende that I might enioye thy friendship. </q>Then the valiant Knight of the Sunne did cut off their talke, to the ende he might declare vnto them, all that happened with the other Giaunt.

And after salutations ended, they entered altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Pallaice, whereas they remained all y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> night,

for to repose themselues, considering the greate trauaile and paine which they had passed. The next day in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, although they hadde more nÃ©ede to haue taken greater rest, yet there altogether they mounted on their horse backs, and tooke the way that lead them to <hi>Saragosa</hi> pretending to enter within the Citie, and there with all humilite to craue pardon for all the iniurie that was past: but their trauayle was all in vaine, for that before time they of the towne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had sufficient triall of <hi>Tefereos</hi> crueltie, would not by any meanes open the gates, alwayes beleeuing the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spectacle before their eyes, and therefore fearing that they would deceiue them. So that when these noble knights per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it was labour lost to stand long in contention, these people (though then causelesse) being so incredible, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe againe towards the Castle: and all the way they went, being almost by the sea side, these two Cousins sawe their ship comming towardes them in great hast, and staieng their horses, they saw, that she was fast at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waters side.</p>
               <p>The knight of the Sunne perceiuing well, that hir com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thether was for no other cause but to inuite them to come aboord hir, which <hi>Eleno</hi> and <hi>Tefereo</hi> condescending vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they presently did: and sent word by a page of <hi>Tefereos</hi> to commaund all those of <hi>Sardenna</hi> that they should set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie all the Countrie, and without farther delaye retourne vnto their owne houses. These worthie Knights were no sooner entred into their Shippe, but she beganne presentlye to spread her Sayles, and shoouing from shoare, in great hast shÃ©e launched in to the maine Sea, wherein with prosperous windes they sailed two dayes, but the thirde daye verie earlye in the morning, they discouered a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, gouerned with sixe Oares on a side, which came ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing towardes them, and bÃ©eing ioyned together, they behelde that ther was in the same a verie faire Ladie, whose haire of hir head was dispersed abroad, and hir selfe very ill intreated by an vncourteous Knight.

Wherefore with great hast they got themselues to the Sea.

<pb facs="tcp:13973:49"/>
it was presently couered with the thicke and terrible lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, in such sort, that it depriued all them that were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of their sight, and with the great feare that they receiued, they fell flat downe vppon the floore in the Gallie. And when they came againe to themselues they looked about to sÃ©e if they coulde perceiue what it should be. And then they coulde not finde the infant <hi>Floramonte,</hi> for whose losse they lamented greatly. You shall vnderstand that the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> by his learning had deliuered the infant from them to kÃ©epe him close and in secret, for that he vnderstood by his art of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great warres that was pretended and made redie for in <hi>Grecia,</hi> in the which warres shoulde be slaine the flower of all knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and that it should be in greate daunger to be lost and vtterly destroied. Also he did comprehend by his learning to knowe how this infant and one other that was then begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (but not yet borne) should be the greatest help &amp; chiefe of this victorie, comming by chaunce to the end of the conquest, likewise he did knowe that if this childe should at anie time before this aduenture vse armour, that he should be put in great perill of death. This was the onely occasion that hÃ©e set him at libertie as you haue heard, and did inchaunt him in such sorte, that none other could clÃ©ere him of it, but onely he which should be his companion and aide in the greate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of these warres: which was the sonne of the heroicall knight of the Sunne, and of the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> of whome thou shalt heare hÃ©ereafter. Thus this wise <hi>Lyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeo</hi> hauing deliuered this childe that none in all the Court knewe of it, retourned thether againe, and from that daye forwardes kept it secrete to himselfe, not suffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to vnderstande thereof, nor of anie other thing that hÃ©e foreknew in his heart by learning. All those of the Court were verye sadde, for that the Emperour was so sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, forasmuch as hÃ©e coulde heare no newes of his sonnes, as I haue before tolde you, determined after hÃ©e hadde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the hunting, to retourne backe againe to the Citie. And in the way as they shuld go, they discouered comming towardes them a Wagon, which did represent much do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13973:49"/>
(and this was that which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did finde,) and there they remained to sÃ©e what it shoulde bÃ©e, and when the Wagon drewe nÃ©ere where the Emperour was, they lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp a cloth wherewith the wagon was couered, and out of the wagon there issued a Ladie, who lead a maiden childe by the hande, all couered with mourning apparell, which did represent great sorrowe, and of so meruailous beautie, as it was to bÃ©e wondered at. This Ladie when shÃ©e vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode which was the Emperour, shÃ©e knÃ©eled downe at his feete, and with sundrie sorrowfull sighes, shÃ©e lamentably sayd.</p>

Among which number this which doth present her selfe before thÃ©e, is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the least in birth, though nowe one in most miserie, for redresse whereof she craueth thy aide and defence. Thou shalt vnderstand O souereigne Emperour, that this childe is right heire apparant vnto all the kingdome of <hi>Lyra,</hi> of which she hath bÃ©en dispossessed by meruailous great violence.</q> The Emperour when he heard that this was the QuÃ©ene of <hi>Lira,</hi> he did reuerence her, and tooke her by the hande, and caused her to stand vp, and embraced her with excÃ©eding shewe of loue, &amp; offred vnto her his person and all his power at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement for her helpe &amp; succour.
Then the Lady would haue kissed his hands, but the Emperour would not consent therevnto by anie meanes, but tooke his horse to procÃ©ede for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on his iourney, &amp; for curtesies sake tooke vp the young quÃ©ene behinde him on horse backe, and the Emperour <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candro</hi> tooke also the other Ladie.

And thus bÃ©eing wholy determined, he sent messengers vnto the king to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund his daughter in marriage for his sonne, but the king made them answere verie rigorously, (and although the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are greatly feared; yet the power of this king was such that he didde estÃ©eme them but little.)

From which place we sent to demaunde of the Gyaunt to surrender vnto vs, that which with great violence he hadde vsurped, and aunswere was retourned, that they woulde not dooe it, except this young QuÃ©ene shoulde first marrie with <hi>Mandroco,</hi> to the which we woulde not consent for that he was so deformed. So sÃ©eing his determined purpose, wÃ©e sent once agayne, demaunding whether he woulde giue vs the bodie of the dead king, to the which they did straight wayes graunt. And <hi>Mandroco</hi> sent vs worde, that forsomuch as wÃ©e woulde not consent vnto that which he did require vs, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our owne quietnesse, to the ende we shoulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how little it was that hÃ©e did estÃ©eme of vs, hee swore
<pb facs="tcp:13973:51"/>
with a solempne oath neuer to depart out of the Kingdome, for the space of two yeares, with condition, that in this time we should seeke two Knights, who by their great force and chiualrie, should ouercome his father and him in the fielde, and then they would depart the lande, and retourne to their owne Countrie. And contrariwise if we did not procure, to bring these two knightes to the battaile, or els to delyuer vnto them this Ladie within that prefixed time, that <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droco,</hi> might mary with hir, that then they would fully pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse themselues of all the kingdome, and fortifie themselues in such sort, that all agrÃ©ement notwithstanding, we should neuer retourne to <hi>Lyra</hi> againe. And so vnderstanding their imbassage, I determined to come to this Court, whereas I doo vnderstand is all the prowesse, and flower of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode in the world. So hÃ©ere I present my selfe (noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) before you and all your Knights, in asking fauour and requesting helpe to reuenge vs of so great wrong, as we haue receiued:</q> and thus she finished hir talke, and with great wÃ©eping, she held her peace.</p>
               <p>This noble Emperor receiued very great sorow &amp; griefe to heare this lamentable tale that the Ladie tolde, and to see that faire young Damzel so dispossessed of her right by such extreame tyrannie, and with a milde countenaunce he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.<q> Noble Dutchesse, since that thy good fortune (though the efficient cause thereof be to too badde) hath brought thÃ©e there<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> where with all good will ye shall receiue succour and comfort, I request you to take your rest, and be quyet, and leaue of this your mourning. And although ther be knights in this my court, that are able to comprehend such enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, by their great prowesse and strength: yet I do looke euery day for them, to whom I may commend greater affayres to be done then these, wherfore rest you a while till two doo come, of whom I haue more dominion ouer, &amp; to them will I commit this charge.</q>
There were many knightes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that would very faine haue offered themselues to this enterprise, but hearing the pretence of the Emperour, they durst not in anie wise attempt it, but kept silence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:13973:51"/>Then this dutchesse began to tell them of all the successe that happened vnto her knightes by the knight of <hi>Cupide.</hi> Unto whome the Emperour sayde: that knight is one of them to whome I will commit the charge of your combat, and I am right gladde that the seruice he shall doe you in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise shall bÃ©e the occasion that you shall forget this anger that you haue against him. So with these and like reasons they drew nÃ©ere the Citie, whereas straight waie they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prepare all things in a readinesse for the departing of the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> and in a short time all things bÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prouided, this Emperour bÃ©eing also readie with a verie good will entered the ship, and carrying with him the Prince <hi>Meridiano,</hi> and his welbeloued spouse, and the <hi>Troyan Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedes,</hi> he taking leaue of the Emperour with a better counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce then his heart would consent vnto, committed the sailes vnto the winde, and with a prosperous voyage they went a land at <hi>Tenedon,</hi> whereas we will leaue them, for to tell you what chaunced vnto the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who was verie sadde for the absence of her spouse, and likewise to sÃ©e her selfe so great with childe, (although in the great hall she continually shewed a merrie countenaunce.) So it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one daie being in conuersation with the Empresse, and the quÃ©ene <hi>Lira,</hi> there entered into the great hall the worthie Prince <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> all armed with his accustomed harnesse, and leading by the hande a verie faire Damosell, all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in blacke veluet, and after her there came other nine faire Damosells, all apparelled after the same manner. This Damosell if you doo remember is shÃ©e, whose kÃ©eper <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did kill, which was the Prince of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight which came to her at her complaint &amp; sorrow, was <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> who in greate secret followed the knight of the Sunne, and because of the great confidence that he had in the friendship of <hi>Zoylo,</hi> he promised her fauour &amp; succour: for the which this faire Ladie who was daughter vnto the king of <hi>Tiglia,</hi> came in this order as you shall heare. In the meane time that all this happened, there chaunced a thing of verie greate admiration, which was, that the <hi>Tartarian</hi> bÃ©eing
<pb facs="tcp:13973:52"/>
at that time in the hall as the Damzell entered, hÃ©e made a great noise without anie more tarrieng, neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that could stay him, were he neuer so strong, but running forwardes as a man distraught, hÃ©e went out of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice. The sorrowfull Ladie sÃ©eing this, fell downe to the grounde as though shÃ©e had bÃ©ene dead. And <hi>Clauerindo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the ingratitude of this <hi>Tartarian,</hi> woulde haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, but the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> stayed him and woulde not suffer him to goe, saying: They should let him alone, for that all they shoulde procure to followe him should bÃ©e in vaine. And so retourning vnto the Ladie he practised such remedyes, that verie quickly shee retourned to her selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and then promised her such remedies, as shoulde in the ende restore her to rest. And when the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Ladie did knowe who he was, she did meruailouslie reioyce. So this <hi>Tartarian</hi> went to the sea side, and with great diligence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked himselfe in a shippe that was there readie fraughted for <hi>Spaine,</hi> which he did in such great hast and diligence, that before <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> could tourne themselues, the shippe had hoised saile, and yÃ©elded her selfe vnto the winde, the which was the occasion that these two did the like in taking another ship, who sailed after the first, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined purpose, with all their powers to procure that this <hi>Tartarian</hi> should returne againe, whome we will leaue now sayling on their voyage, for it is necessarie for our hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie to relate other matters in this Chapter. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne therefore to the Emperours court. The Empresse <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiana</hi> sÃ©eing her time at hand to be deliuered with childe, was verie sadde, and knew not what to doe, but in the ende of many thoughts she determined to decypher all her secret vnto a maide she had who was called <hi>Arcana,</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> she did disclose all the secrets of her heart. This <hi>Arcana</hi> sÃ©eing the great friendship and curtesie that the princesse shewed her, in opening her secrets more to her then to anie other, and had a more trust in her then in the rest, kissed her roiall hands, and promised her to be no lesse secret then dilligent in all her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13973:52"/>
So they determined betwÃ©ene themselues and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide as it was best for their purpose, to bÃ©e continuallye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and without anie companie, but that which did most trouble and gaue greatest care vnto the Empresse <hi>Claridia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was, for that shÃ©e did not knowe to whome to giue the charge of nursing that, which shoulde be borne of her, yet the maiden who was verie wise, subtil, and discrÃ©et, had ordained all things in good order, for she had in great secret disclosed it vnto a verie honest matrone of the citie, saieng, that she was the partie that should be deliuered, and gaue vnto her verye largely of gifts and iewells, with promises of a farther bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite for to keepe her counsell therein. It was not long after when that with great paine and griefe this noble Princesse was deliuered of a verie faire sonne &amp; daughter, bÃ©eing of so great beautie that it was wonderfull to bÃ©e sÃ©ene. The sonne had vnder his left side a meruailous &amp; verie strange marke, which was a speare of such a firie prospect that it made them afraid to touch it. The Empresse tooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> both in her armes and with many bitter teares she blessed them, and returned them againe vnto <hi>Arcana,</hi> willing her that she should dresse them, and put all things in order to send them to the nurse, the which she did with great diligence, wrapping and swadde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them vp in very faire and rich clothes, according to the best guise that she could, although she wer but little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in such like matters. She had not scantly made an end of swaddeling them, when that vppon a sodaine with a greate rumour, as it sÃ©emed vnto the Empresse and <hi>Arcana,</hi> one of the walles of the chamber where they were did open, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at did enter a Serpent, verie horrible and fearefull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, from whome there procÃ©eded greate flames and sparkes of fire, who stayed not, but went straight vnto the place whereas the two little Infantes were, and at two mouthfulles hÃ©e swallowed them cleane vp, and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dooing anie more harme or making anie longer tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retourned out of the Chamber the selfe same waye that it came in, leauing the Empresse in so greate feare, as in such cases is required.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:53"/>And being in this great traunce she looked towards y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> place, where the Serpent went out, and she sawe enter in thereat an olde man, which came with a staffe in his hande, whom straight waie she knew very well to be the wise <hi>Artemido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> who with great courtesie saluted the Empresse saieng:
<q>Madame, take you neither care, paine, nor griefe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is done, neither trouble your selfe for your children, for that there coulde be no more done, then that which is done: for all is conuenient and necessarie for the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both of yours and their good fortune. And more I doo certefie you, that the time should come, wherein you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more ioye and comfort, then nowe it dooth cause anguish and sorrowe.</q>
And thus without anie more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he returned and went out againe at the place whereat he entered, and he was not so soone out, but that the wall clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed againe as euen as it was before, and no signe of opening could be sÃ©ene. After that he was departed the empresse &amp; her mayde remained reasoning and meruailing at this sodaine and strange case, &amp; after they had considered of many things, they determined betwÃ©ene themselues to kÃ©epe all verye se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, till that by opportunitie were offered them, what they should doo.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Brandimardo</hi> of whom I told you of, was so inflamed with the fire of <hi>Cupide,</hi> whch kindled in him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of the young quÃ©ene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> whose name was <hi>Ardisilora,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could finde in himselfe neither rest nor ioy, &amp; his passions were not so secret, but that this young quÃ©ene did perceiue them, &amp; spared not to repaye him againe with a kind of honest and single loue.

So the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in great hast with a knightly courage called for his armour.

So then there began a cruell and mortall battell, one of the most terriblest in the world, for the strength of their blowes were so outragious, that with the least blowe they gaue, it was thought that the great hall would haue fallen downe. The Empresse and her Ladies what with the great griefe they had, and againe, with the excÃ©eding heate that began in the hall, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into their Closettes and Chambers, and likewise the knights that were present, departed and left them alone in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hall, sauing the Emperour onelye remained at the doore, to keepe the entrie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Brandimardo</hi> and <hi>Claueryndo</hi> were with the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> beholding this cruell battell, not knowing who this great Gyaunt was that trauailed so much for the honour of the Emperour and his sonnes. In all this time these Gyaunts had no other care, but in brusing &amp; mangling one anothers flesh, with so greate strength, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer beheld them meruailed at their fiercenesse, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, all the furious rage of Gyaunts consisted in those two, as it did appeare by the terrible and outragious strokes that they bestowed betwÃ©ene them, for w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great strength and the sound thereof, the whole pallace did not onely shake, but also the whole Citie: in this sort they continued a greate while without taking anie breath, and all the floore of the hall was full of hoales, with the heauie blowes that had scaped by. Thus they long continued without knowledge of anie masterie betwÃ©en them, but still they procured the one to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage the other, and to be reuenged one of another, with so greate rage and in such sort, that they sÃ©emed rather to bÃ©e rash and vnreasonable Gyauntes, then expert and valiaunt knightes: and in this their great furie they both lifted vp theyr great and heauie clubs, in such sort that their blowes met and discharged together, with such surpassing strength,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13973:55"/>
that the club of the King of <hi>Sardenna,</hi> was parted in twain, but the mace of <hi>Bustrafo</hi> discharged vpon the other, although almost in vaine, for that it had lost the former furie by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the first encounter, neuerthelesse it made his healme to sound as an anfielde when it is stroken on with a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Then this king sÃ©eing he had such an aduersary, thought it not good to vse delay, but with great hast he drewe his sword, and at such time as <hi>Bustrafo</hi> turned the second blow he could by no meanes shun or apart himselfe from it, but bare it off with his sword, and the fall of the blowe was such, that the mace was cut cleane a sunder, and the great end rolled on the flower in the hall. <hi>Bustrafo</hi> seeing himselfe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest of his heauie mace, threw the tronchon which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his hand, at the King of <hi>Sardenna,</hi> who receiued it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his shielde: but the strength of it was so vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it glaunced on his shield, and flewe vpright to the top of the hall, and the king retired back thrÃ©e or foure steps, so that it was a wonder he fell not to the ground. In this time, <hi>Bustrafo</hi> had space to draw his sword, and to shrowde himselfe vnder his shield. Nowe there began a new, a more cruell and rigorous combat betwÃ©ene them, then at the first: for <hi>Bustrafo</hi> at his first blow, stroke the King vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shield, and parted it in two pÃ©eces, and with an infernall furie, it descended on his helme, and hurt his head, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wound was not very great, yet the blow rested not, but glauncing on the harnesse, fell to the ground, whereas it made a great hoale: but in the meane time this newe conuerted King, was not idle, neither did his aduersarie escape his paiment for the blowe past, but hauing his sharpe cutting sword raysed on high, he discharged it with such excÃ©eding force vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> 
                  <hi>Bustrafo,</hi> (who receiued it vpon his shield) that with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great strength thereof, it parted it in pÃ©eces, and descended vpon his helme, taking away with it all that it touched both of the harnesse &amp; flesh, which fell together to the ground, so that <hi>Bustrafo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained very sore hurt. And when he sawe his owne bloud, the battaile beganne a newe to kindle, in such sort, that in a very small time, each of them were sore hurt in sundrie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:56"/>
wherout issued so much bloud, that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hall was sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled therewith. This fierce <hi>Bustrafo</hi> sÃ©eing himselfe so ill intreated, his anger still more increased, and gaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>The dÃ©eds which in all this time chaunced vnto that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyant <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> we will hÃ©ere declare, and leaue these two Giaunts, with their perillous, and well sought battaile, till such time as occasion doo serue to to goe forwarde with the same.

In the sixt day of their nauigation, they beheld comming towardes them another great Foyst, who came with no lesse furie, then their boate sayled, and the course thereof was directed right with them. So when they drewe nigh together, the Foyst passed by so close, that they might well sÃ©e and discouer who was therein, and they perceiued within the same a damosell who sÃ©emed to be dead, and by hir stoode a monstrous Giant, and by the maste of the Foyst there was tyed a terrible Griffin, which caused great feare in them that beheld it.</p>
               <p>The Foyst made such great waye, that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> hadde no time to leape into hir, which caused him to be verye sorry

and he was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sed, for that he could not be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certified what this aduenture was and what the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof did signifie, and with the anger that he hadde, he began to curse all inchauntments, and all them that vsed it: but all this did profit him but little, for that in a shorte time it sailed out of sight. And looking about him, he sawe two shippes, which were in a great fight, and very fiercely the one assaulted the other, to whome the boate wherein the Prince was, directed his waye with so swifte course, that he almost had no time to put on his helme. And with these two shippes was another boate, which by the force of armes was brought in subiection and ouercome by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other two shippes, and all the people were slaine that was in her, sauing a fewe which had withdrawen themselues into the poope of the barke for their defence, amongst whome, there was one of a verye great and excellent stature, who with strong and mightie blowes, caused all those that approached vnto the place where he was, to withdraw themselues, but by reason that they had bene very long in this battaile, and that they had troubled him very much, he could not choose but be very weake and wearie, in such sort, that if it had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured long, he must nÃ©edes haue finished the sight with his death.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had well behelde and noted the great strength and fierce courage of the Knight, it sÃ©emed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to haue knowen him, and viewing the deuice that hÃ©e hadde on his armour, hÃ©e knewe that it was <hi>Zoylo</hi> the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> and straight waie without anie more tarrying he leaped into the shippe, and beganne to let them knowe the strength of his strong arme, for in such sorte he bestur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that at the first blowe he cut off helme and head, of one of his enimies, and not being content with this, he began againe to strike first on the one side and then on the other, so that there was not one that was so hardie to abide his terrible blowes, but when his aduersaryes sawe his furie, there ioyned more then thirtie of them together, pretending to assault him, but amongst them there
<pb facs="tcp:13973:57"/>
was one who sÃ©emed to bÃ©e the principall of them all, sayde. Returne you all backe againe and make an ende of that, which weake and simple women would long since haue finished, and let me alone with this knight that so rigorously doth behaue himselfe, and with great furie he pressed forward and stroke the Prince such a blowe that hee made him asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but this miserable man little knewe that hÃ©e had to doo with the best Knight in the worlde, for if he had, he would neuer haue made resistaunce against him face to face. And tourning to strike him once againe, hÃ©e discouered the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that he had in his shÃ©elde, whereby he knew him, and was verie much afraide of that which should succÃ©ede. The Prince vnderstood by them that were in the shippe, that this was he which did gouerne them, he stroke such a blow at his right arme, that he cut it cleane off, so that arme and swoorde fell downe vpon the hatches of the shippe, who sÃ©eing himselfe so ill intreated, with a greate noise and pittifull shrike he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in amongst his people, and cryed for helpe and succour, but all was in vaine, for that the Nephew of <hi>Tiberio</hi> stroke him such another blow vpon the helme, that he parted helme and head in two pÃ©eces, so that he fell downe dead: but when his companie sawe this, they altogether fell vpon him with terrible furie, thinking to make an ende of him, but he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them in such order, that quickly he made them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the strength of his victorious arme, for he neuer stroke blowe but either he slewe one, or felled him to the grounde, which was the occasion that their heartes fainted, that not one of them which remained durst approch, neuerthelesse they had so compassed him about, that he could not neither on the one side nor on the other make anie waie, for when he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to put himselfe forwards one waie, then the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laie on him behinde, so that of necessitye hÃ©e was constrained in the end to set vpon them all at once, for that they did so trouble him. In this time <hi>Zoilo</hi> had somewhat recouered his strength, and was well eased of his weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sÃ©eing the valiauntnesse of his defender, he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where he was skirmishing, &amp; with his sword
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13973:57"/>
in both his handes, he beganne to make greate destruction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his enimies, that the slaughter was so great, and their enimies not able to make anie resistaunce, but like misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people determined rather to submit themselues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of that newe come knight, then to the force of theyr owne armes, and falling all downe at the feete of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> they craued pardon of him for theyr offence, and mercie for their liues, the which he straight waye graunted, and sayde: It is great curtesie, yea, and no little charitie shewed toward the euill man in punishing him, if that he pretende to goe forwardes and perseuer in his naughtie lyfe.

This bÃ©eing finished, the Prince and the <hi>Tartarian</hi> embraced one another, with great loue and friendshippe, and <hi>Rosicleer</hi> asked of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> what was the occasion that brought him into so great perill and daunger of death. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> sayde, that by force of an aduenture he departed the Emperours Court, (but he did not declare the effect) and how comming in that small shippe hÃ©e was taken with those rouers, who brought him into that greate distresse that he had found him in. Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi> againe threw his armes about his necke, and with great loue he sayd.</p>
               <p>Fortune dealt but frowardly to bring thÃ©e out of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> in such a time, for to leade thÃ©e vnto this perill, and so beganne to tell him of all that he had passed in the Countrie of <hi>Greece.</hi> And when he heard him name the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Tetigliasa,</hi> he shaked like the leaues of a trÃ©e, and sayde<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Oh for Gods sake my Lorde, let not my cares heare the name of that thing which my heart dooth so much abhorre and detest.

The Prince hearing all this which they of the ship told him, began to make himselfe readie to the battaile, and laced on his helme, and put all thinges in verie good order, and when that all was readie he sayde vnto them that were with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O you people of little courage &amp; small strength, I sÃ©e well you are all base minded, and that there is no hardinesse in you, but onely for vile matters, get you downe and hide you in the pumpe of the shippe, for I will not consent that anie of you shall runne awaie, neither shal your cries excuse me of this battaile,</q> and so with a lowde voice he commaunded to beare vp the helme, that the ship might runne right vpon the Gallie. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> sÃ©eing that they pretended to giue the enterprise, commaunded those that were with him straight waies to put his vessell in verie good order, of the which it had greate nÃ©ede, so with as great hast and swiftnesse of saile as was possible, they procured that the Shippe and Gallie might ioyne both together, and in verie short time they were come so nigh each to other, that anie man might well discouer and perceiue all that was in the Gallie of their aduersarie.
This valiaunt and worthie <hi>Rosicleer</hi> sawe the greate Gyaunt where hÃ©e sate in the middest of the poope of the Gallie in a Chaire, where they verie plainely sawe his countenaunce was so terrible, and his bodie so greate, that all those which were present with <hi>Rosicleer</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide to beholde him. And when the Gyaunt vnderstoode that those which were in the ship would not alonely defend themselues, but also offend their enimies, his rage was such, that in great hast he arose and with a mightie voice he called

for his armour, vttering these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O you people most vnfortunate, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> whence hath come this hardinesse vnto you, to offend the King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and knowing, that I am not onely feared of men, but also the Gods in the high heauens doo tremble at my name, and desire to haue my friendship. Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi> aunswered and sayd, Make thy reckoning, that thou hast sayd euen as much as nothing, for of my selfe I speake, that I am none of the Gods thou namest, neither know I thÃ©e by the name thou tellest, nor yet doo I desire thy friendship, nor any others that practiseth the like workes, as thou dost, neither, doo I estÃ©eme thy threatnings, nor yet thy furious cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tenance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can thy great body put me in any feare.</q>
And with this, he commaunded the marriners to grapple the shippe &amp; Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley together very strongly. Which, when this fierce King sawe, with great anger he arose out of his chaire, and not tarrying to lace on his helme, would haue entered into the shippe: but <hi>Rosicleer</hi> perceiuing his pretence, thruste him with so great force, with both his hands vpon the brest, that he made him to fall backwardes into his owne galley, and sayd.

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:13973:59"/>This noble GrÃ©eke was nothing at all idle, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his rare and precious Sworde, which Queene <hi>Iulia</hi> had sent him, in his hande, hÃ©e stroke a terrible and fierce blow at the Gyauntes face, but by reason he was so farre off, he coulde not reach it, but that the point of his sharpe Swoorde onelye passed through his chÃ©ekes, but if he coulde haue comprehended more of his head with that blowe, he had made an end of the battayle. This furious Gyaunt when hÃ©e sawe his bloud before him, he gaue a terrible groane, and therewith tooke his broade swoorde in both his handes, and with blaspheming and cursing his Gods, hÃ©e lyft it vp for to strike this valiaunt GrÃ©eke, who sÃ©eing it to descende, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to receiue so doubtfull a blow, but with great and singular wisedome deliuered himselfe from it. The blowe was such that if it had not doubled in the maine sayle which somewhat disturbed it, it had bÃ©ene sufficient to haue diuided the Shippe in pÃ©eces. This valyaunt and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Prince, which with greate discreation and aduise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sustayned this battaile, had alwayes a verye good eye to the Gyaunt, who for to vnloose his Swoorde where it was fast in the Shippe, was inforced to put his lefte hande to holde fast by the shippe side, whereat <hi>Rosicleer</hi> stroke with such furie that the Gyants hand remained fast to the Shippes side, diuided from the arme. But when this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fierce Gyaunt sawe himselfe lame, and that he had cleane lost his lefte hand, hÃ©e began a newe to curse and blaspheme his Gods, and procured to hurt this GrÃ©eke by all meanes possible that hÃ©e coulde inuent, but he prouided so to the contrarie, that not one blowe which the Gyaunt stroke should eyther touch or hurt him, in such sort, that at last when this furious &amp; outragious diuel striuing to strike this GrÃ©eke Knight, was driuen to ballaunce his bodie, thereby to reache at him, this Knight let passe the same blowe euen as hÃ©e did all the rest of his blowes, and in passing by hee gaue him such a cruell blowe vppon the right arme, that he cut it off almost by the elbowe.</p>
               <p>And when this miserable king sawe himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Then those which were of his Gallie sÃ©eing this his wretched ende, and fearing theyr owne misfortune, in a meruailous greate hast vngrappeled the Shippe, which was done with such spÃ©ede, that when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> remembred himselfe, he had no time to offende them, nor to doo them anie more harme. Then those which were in his Shippe and had behelde this short and victorious bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, beganne a new to fall downe at his fÃ©et and most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie craued pardon for their former feare. Then the Prince turned towards the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> who all the time of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, was beholding his excellent and mightie strength, and much meruailed at that which he had sÃ©ene, and asked of him what he hadde determined to dooe. And the <hi>Tartarian</hi> aunswered, that he would in no wise depart from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and bÃ©eing in talke, they, vpon a sodaine sawe two shippes, which sÃ©emed vnto them, that they were in a great fight. These Princes were meruailous desirous to be with them, to vnderstand what they were. So this valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt <hi>Greeke,</hi> tourning to the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> he said, Prince of <hi>Tartaria</hi> followe mÃ©e, and in greate hast he leaped into his Boate, and he was no sooner entered therein, but that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to make waie lyke a Thunder-bolt in the ayre, so that it sÃ©emed sparkes of fire flew out of the water, in such sort that the <hi>Tartarian</hi> hadde no time to followe him, but by reason of the swiftnesse, he had quicklye lost the sight of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:13973:60"/>So for that it is requisite, let vs leaue this <hi>Tartarian,</hi> who was very sorowfull bÃ©eing lefte alone, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the marrineers to make waye with his ship, towardes the other two that were a fighting. So this valiaunt <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> sayled on in his inchaunted boate, not without greate sorrowe, for that vpon a sodaine he had lost his perfect friend: neuerthelesse for that he did vnderstand that he was carried to conclude the things that were more for his contentment, he was driuen to comfort himselfe, with that which most he loued. So with these great thoughtes, he sailed two dayes without any aduenture worthy the telling. But the thirde daye very early in the morning, at such time as <hi>Appollo</hi> shewed abroad his glistering beames, they discouered lande, whether the barke with terrible furie made waye: and it sÃ©emed vnto him to be a very small Iland, where they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, neuerthelesse by the prospect of the riuers, it appeared to be a place of great delyght, and full of meddowes and other grÃ©ene fieldes. So by the resting of this barke a grounde, <hi>Rosicleer</hi> vnderstood that there he should goe aland, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he descended out of the barke, and after him came his good horse, and to the ende he would trauell in more safetie, he mounted on his backe, and looked round about him, if hÃ©e coulde discouer any waye or path. But not farre from the place whereas he was, he beheld very faire and sumptuous buildings, wherewith he tooke the way that led him thether, and being nigh thervnto, he saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was old &amp; ancient buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And as he went round about it a while for to beholde the same, he saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ouer the principall gate, was this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription written. <hi>This is the famous and auncient Temple of the goddes Venus, from whence the noble Paris of Troy, stole the faire Queene Helena: this is the Iland of the mother of that cruell Cupide<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the greatest sower of discord in all the world.</hi> This valiant Knight did very much content himselfe in beholding that olde and sumptuous Temple, the name whereof was spred through all the world, and lefte not any thing, neither without nor within, but behelde it fully to his contentment. After that he had spent a little time in peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:13973:61"/>
this, he put himselfe in a straight waye, which was not farre from a foote path thereby, whereas he sawe a man that was cutting of woode, of whome he asked what countrie it was, and who was Lord of it. This man perceiuing that hÃ©e demaunded somwhat of him, was not able to answere him, but made signes vnto him that he was dumbe, &amp; moreouer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should returne backe againe, giuing him to vnderstande that if he did procÃ©ede forwards, he should finde great peril. This noble <hi>Rosicleer</hi> sayd then to himselfe, I doo not know what shall chaunce or happen me: notwithstanding, if a thousand that had their tongues should tell me, (yet would I not doo it, nor leaue off to follow this my pretended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) much more thou, whom I cannot vnderstand. And so without any more tarrying, he retourned vnto his new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun iourney, and at the going vp of a hill, he beheld a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of a mightie and straunge bignesse, which was edified vpon another hills side. He was a good myle from it, when he discouered it, and so iournying thetherward; he hadde not trauailed farre, when he found himselfe in a faire, broad, &amp; smooth way, whereinto when he entred, he sawe certaine foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of horses, which appeared not to be made long before, but that lately they had passed that way: the which footings he followed, although he found other fayre wayes, and as much occupied as that wherein he was, yet for all that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would sÃ©e what footings they wer, he would follow that way and none other, so not very farre from that place where he was, he heard (although it was somwhat distaunt from him, to his sÃ©eming) a great rushing of harnesse, and the more he trauailed forwards, the more plainer his eares wer occupied with this martiall musicke. Till in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, drawing nÃ©erer, he perceiued, it was a notable &amp; well fought battaile, for which cause he pricked his horse onwardes the faster, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> going down from a mountain, into a faire &amp; broad plaine, he behelde at the foot of the castle very much people and amongst them Giaunts, all which were in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile against one onely Knight, of a maruailous great &amp; wel proportioned stature all armed in russet harnes without any

You haue heard how we lefte these two Gyaunts <hi>Bustrafo</hi> and <hi>Bramidoro</hi> in great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the battell, each one of them indeuouring themselues to winne the victory, although of each parte they denyed to either other the same. He that sÃ©emed to be most troubled in this battaile, was the <hi>Sardenian</hi> King, and with the thicke breath that proceeded from his vnpacient heart, his face was inflamed with the heate thereof. The which his aduersarie perceiued, and like a terrible and outragious Tiger, he lifte vp his mightie sword, letting it fall w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such furie, as though fire hadde fallen from heauen. The King sÃ©eing that by no meanes he could escape it, lifte vp likewise his sworde, to ward that terrible blow: but by reason that that of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt <hi>Bustrafos,</hi> was of better stÃ©ele, and of more strength, hÃ©e cut the sword of the Kings in two pÃ©eces, and the blowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended vpon his shoulder, and did a little hurt him. When this King sawe that his sword was in two pÃ©eces, hÃ©e was
<pb facs="tcp:13973:62"/>
somewhat amazed, yet for all that, he lost not his knightlye courage, but with a valiant heart pressed to his enimie, and with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This Gyant <hi>Bustrafo</hi> fÃ©eling himselfe so sore hurt with this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowe, pretended to repaye him with double interest (the which if it had chaunced to take effect) it had made an ende of his dayes: but this newe conuerted Knight, ranne in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the blowe of <hi>Bustrafo,</hi> saieng: O Iesus, kÃ©epe and defend this thy newe conuerted seruaunt. And so ioyning together, they imbraced one another, whereas began a maruailous &amp; strong wrastling, wherein they continued a good while pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their strengths, and procuring the victorie, the one ouer the other, till at the last, both being not a little wearie, they fell downe to the ground, tumbling hÃ©ere and there from one place to another, without loosing their holde, &amp; in this stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they sÃ©eing that this wrastling did little profit them, vnloosed themselues: but the King was the first that rose vp, as one that shewed himselfe to haue the best stomacke, and sÃ©eing that all <hi>Bustrafo</hi> his head was bare, in that he wanted his helme, he bent his armed fist, and stroke him such a blowe vpon the forehead, that his braines flewe out, and his eyes started out of his head, and there this vnfortunate Gyaunt fell dead to the ground.
The King sÃ©eing then so good a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in his battaile, fell downe vpon his knÃ©es to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, and lifting vp his eyes vnto heauen, he saide.<q> I giue thÃ©e thankes most mightie Iesus, that thou gauest me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thy power, &amp; lightenest my vnderstanding for to leaue this error in the which I was led, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy true light.

The dead Giant was drawen out of the pallaice, and carried without the Citie, where, in stÃ©ed of a graue to bury him, they made a great fire and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him to ashes.

To the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable words which the Emperour had spoken, this faire and distressed Lady aunswered.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Surmounted Emperour, this my great sorrow is so roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in me, that I haue no ioye to receiue any comfort, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, if it be true which I haue heard, both of thÃ©e and thy royall Court, the fame whereof, all the world doth resound: then I am sure that thou wilt not denie me of my request, for that hetherto thou hast not at any time denied any Lady or Damosell, which hath requested the same, hauing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie and nÃ©ede thereof: much more now, bÃ©eing demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thÃ©e by so afflicted a Damosell as I am, being marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the sonne of that adultresse <hi>Venus,</hi> whom I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble vnto the Uulture, which alwaies taketh for hir repast and fÃ©eding, the bowells of that infortunate <hi>Ixion,</hi> and the more paine he suffereth, the more hir hunger increaseth, so that euermore by hir grÃ©edines, he sustaineth a lasting grief, Euen so (soueraigne Lord) loue doth torment me, &amp; alwayes is gnawing of these my afflicted bowels, yet neuer doo I feele them without loue, but rather alwaies, both in the Winter &amp; Summer, in presence and in absence it doth still increase: so that I am at no time without loue, and continuallye my faith increaseth: and by no meanes can I receiue remedie for this griefe, but by the force and strength of some straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whom I doo sÃ©eke for continually, with great sorrowe. Therefore I doo desire thÃ©e (O soueraigne Emperour) if at any time thou hast passed the paines of loue, that thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest pitie them that are so sore afflicted and vnfortunate, and doo not denie me thy aide &amp; helpe: for if I were the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of base parents, yet in respect I am a woman, thou arte bound to succour and aide me.

The Emperour who was meruailous attentiue vnto all that this faire Ladie had sayd, &amp; very much beholding hir great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he aunswered and sayd. <q>Of my faith faire Lady, I will not let to remedye this thy sorrowe much more then I am bound to doo by my high estate, and will procure by all meanes to ease this thy afflicted euill. Therefore now aske what thou sÃ©emest best for thy purpose, for I am hÃ©ere ready to performe all, that by thÃ©e shall be demaunded of me.

The Emperour although hÃ©e sawe that it was a haynous thing at that time to leaue his whole Court and estate, yet did he not showe any such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but with a valiant courage he called for his armor, the which was straight way brought vnto him, being all of russet colour, and the shield of the same colour, and ther was portrayed in it the picture of leane Death, with a sharp flesh hooke in his hand. All the Kings and Lords that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that time, would haue disswaded him from this his enterprise, but specially and aboue all the rest, the auncient Prince of <hi>Clarencia</hi> sayde.

thou (O souereigne Emperour) art more bounde to looke and haue a care vnto your owne subiects, more then to your owne person. And a good Prince ought rather to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect his will to the fauouring of his people, then to please his owne appetite. For which cause, honourable Lord, you must pardon vs, for that we will not willingly consent, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for desire of this pompous same, that you doo pretende, we should loose your person.

So this honourable Emperour without shewing any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aunswered and sayd.
<q>Noble Kings and Princes, and my very friends. I giue you great thankes for the good will you doo showe mÃ©e, in that you would not that I shuld be absent from you: likewise you shall vnderstande, that it dooth as much grieue me, to seperate my selfe from your companyes, and I doo thinke my selfe blessed to haue such noble Knights as you bÃ©e vnto my subiects: notwithstanding you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that as you doo loue the bodie and person of your Prince, so likewise you should desire and procure his fame and honour, for you knowe you haue many meates that are verye sauourie to the taste of anie man, and yet to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye verye hurtfull to the stomacke. It is a verye good thing to liue vnder compasse, and that gouerning is good, by the which fame and honour is not diminished, as this, for that he that is bounde, must procure, perfourme, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne his promise. For if I of my owne frÃ©e will, and to fÃ©ede myne owne appetite, hadde procured and mooued this iourney, you had had great reason for to haue disswaded mÃ©e, but bÃ©eing sought for, and procured hÃ©ereto, by this noble and distressed Damosell for hir defence, then what reason is it that I shoulde abandon my faith? Tell mÃ©e
<pb facs="tcp:13973:65"/>
I praie you if now I should falsifie my promise, what hope of confidence heereafter shoulde remaine in you of my ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Of truth I saie vnto you, that Prince which doth not keepe and maintaine his faith which hee hath promised in giuing his word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, hÃ©e is vnworthie of lyfe. And sÃ©eing that I haue graunted this iourney, although you be displeased therewith, I besÃ©ech you comfort your selues, for that by iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice I am constrained to goe, trusting in almightie God to retourne againe vnto you with greate honour and renowne. What woulde the worlde saie, when that for feare of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane thinges I leaue to mainetaine iustice and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the obseruation and kÃ©eping of my worde? Surely they woulde report me for a Prince of small vertue, &amp; dÃ©eme you (so perswading mÃ©e) not worthie of a good Prince, for y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> many times God doth shew his power, whereas the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of humane thinges be without all hope. Therefore I doo desire you all (my friendes) that you will not withdrawe mÃ©e from this my pretended purpose, for if I were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therevnto, you were all bound to complaine of mÃ©e. </q>And making an ende of these his reasons he began to arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
The Empresse that of all this thing was ignoraunt, when shÃ©e vnderstood therof by some of them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the Emperour, shÃ©e came with shedding of manye teares for to hinder and withdrawe him from his iourney: the Emperours heart was somewhat grÃ©eued to heare hir sorrowfull words, but with an heroycall courage he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded her to returne vnto her closet, and willed all those that were present to goe and beare her companie, and would that none should remaine with him but <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> vnto whom the Emperour in greate secret sayd: That when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> or the knight of the Sun should<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> returne to the court, that hee shoulde tell them that he was gone to <hi>Lidia</hi> at the instaunt of the Ladye, for to restore her againe to her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. With this he did charge him verie much, and that they shoulde straight wayes and without anie delaye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte for that place: <hi>Brandimardo</hi> thought greate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe in this which the Emperour commaunded, and gaue

This faire Damosell was verie gladde, and did exercise her selfe in no other thing but in seruing the Emperour. In this sort they sayled all that daie and all the night till the next morning: this noble Emperour saie in the poope of the Galley, and by him sate this faire Ladie, on the one side, of whome hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the cause why shÃ©e brought him out of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Unto whome with manie teares distilling from her chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staline eyes, and with greate sighes that proceeded from her dolorous heart, she said.</p>

                  <q>I haue tolde you noble Emperour that the force of loue hath brought mÃ©e to this extremitie wherein you nowe sÃ©e me.

The great fame of this my surmounted beautie was so spred abroade, that it was the occasion that manye knightes of straunge Countryes resorted vnto the Court of the King my Father, and amongest them all there was one that came from a farre, whose name was called <hi>Brenio,</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>Lusitania,</hi> beeing of a meruailous beautie and no lesse valiauncie, which did so surmount, that in all the Countrie hath neuer bene sÃ©ene the like, and cruell <hi>Cupide,</hi> I knowe not whether it was to vse his accustomed pollicies, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was enuious of his beautie, hÃ©e stroke mÃ©e with his poisoned arrowe, in such sort, that I was constrained by that force to loue this vnhappie knight, and therwith constrained to forget the roiall estate from whence I descended, I did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise my selfe in no other thing, but thinking on his loue, and determined to giue him vnderstanding thereof in as secrete wise as I could, so long it lasted that I waxed blinde in loue, &amp; feared that he would not vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I loued him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

The Emperour who was mooued with much compassion of the great trauaile of this Ladie, and somewhat to refresh hir in the aire, he caused hir to goe a lande, and taking hir by the hande, he did helpe hir out of the Gallie, and they rested themselues vpon a little mountaine, from which place they might discouer a great parte of the Ilande, and more they discouered a great way from thence, another smal mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, vpon the which there sÃ©emed to be a fire, or light, and making little account thereof, they asked somewhat to eate, which straight way was brought them by the marriners, &amp; so they refreshed themselues. They had scarce made an end of eating, when that they heard a terrible shrike, which was such, that the faire Lady lost hir colour: but the Emperour rose vp on his feete, and looked round about him to sÃ©e if he could perceiue what it shuld be, but he could sÃ©e no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, than he sawe at the first, and so retourned and sate down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but he was not scant setled, when he heard the lyke shrike again. The Emperour turned and rose vp the second time, and said: Who art thou, that dost thinke to make me afraide with these thy shrikes, I tell thÃ©e that thou art verie much deceiued: thou wilt rather giue me occasion thus in offending me, to sÃ©eke what thou art that makest this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble noyse. And with these words he sayd vnto the Lady, that she should returne vnto the galley, for that he would goe sÃ©e what thing it should be, the which she would not consent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but would nÃ©edes goe in the company of the Emperour. And when the Emperour saw the determination of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Damosell, he threwe his shield vpon his arme, and laced and made fast his healme, and so a foote they tooke their waye towards the place whereas the light was, for that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes that parte they heard the noyse. And trauailing in the middest of the waye, at the foote of a hill, they found an Image of fine Christall, which sÃ©emed to be wrought by the handes of some excellent workeman, all to be spotted with bloud. And it appeared by the woundes that were formed in the same figure, that it was the Image of one that had suffered great torments, as well with terrible cuttings,

of yrons, as with cruell whippings. The legs and the armes did seeme as though they had bene martired and wrong with cordes, and about the necke, as though it had bene strangled with a towell hard wrong, and there was written vpon the breast, with letters of liuely bloud, this Epitath. <hi>I am Herea the Kings daughter of Cimarra, violated and slaine by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldino King of Numidia. And thou knight that this present spectacle shalt viewe, I doo desire thee, that if thou dost goe forward this way, let it be with great courage, for to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce on this crueltie, for that I am not of my selfe able to seeke reuengement.</hi> This Emperour, who had wel considered y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> great crueltie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had bene vsed against that infortunate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, being moued with great compassion he sayd, I doo vow that if there be any meanes whereby to be reuenged of this thy death, to procure it with all my power: and with this determined purpose, they proceeded on their waye, and went so farre, that they perceiued, that the light which they hadde sÃ©ene, did procÃ©ede of two gates of fine Christall: and there they sawe in the high way, a great pillar, whereon was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a written table, with these contents: <hi>Knight, looke wel vnto the oath which thou hast taken, for that this is a perilous enterprise: and from this place thou hast license to retourne backe a gaine, and not to fulfill thy promise, for that the King of Cimarra, will not constraine nor force any manner of Knight.</hi> The Emperour said, As well they maye raise from death to life all the famous <hi>Romanes,</hi> which haue ben from the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> vnto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and all the rest vnto this time, as to perswade me to retourne from my promise, which I haue made: and if they were all present liuing, they were not sufficient to cause me to leaue my oath.

When the Emperour sawe himselfe without his shÃ©elde, which that infernall Bird had carryed with him into the aire, and let it fall downe againe a great wayes distant from the same place where he was, it made him to haue alwayes a verie good and diligent eie, to y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> griffon to marke when he would descend, who straight way began to descende, vnto his thinking with much more furie then at the first.

And as by force of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Mill carryeth the stone about with greate furie, euen so this worthie warriour bestowed himselfe for to defende him from this furious beast, yet he coulde not doo so much, but that he must nÃ©edes receiue some of his terrible blowes, and his swiftnesse was such in rising into the ayre, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, that hÃ©e coulde not fasten one blow on him with his swoorde, but he did hurt the Emperour with his clawes sometimes on the armes and sometimes on the healme, but yet coulde he neuer haue anie fast holde on him to doo him harme, for that he neuer stoode still, but moouing hÃ©ere and there, shunning his blowes, &amp; euen as a furious Lyon, who in the time of slÃ©epe is molested and troubled with small beasts, crÃ©eping on him in all places, which he fÃ©eling with his mouth, snappeth hÃ©ere and there on euerie parte rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, so long, til in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end being throughly ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sed, at once they paie for all the iniuries that they did him: euen so this vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt Emperour vsed himselfe with this terrible Griffon, flourishing with his swoorde round about on euerie side, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waiting opportunitie at one time to requite him for all the sorrowe that hÃ©e did him, but in the ende sÃ©eing that it did little profit him in dooing this, he sodeinly bethought him of another remedie, which was to kneele downe with one of his knees on the grounde, that when the Griffin shoulde descend more lower to hurt the Emperour, that then with as great lightnesse as he coulde, he woulde rise vp, and with more ease strike him, which he presently did put in practise, So this terrible Griffon descended downe, and with one of his sharpe clawes he clasped fast holde on the Emperours healme. Then the Emperour seeing this fierce Griffon now to descend down more lower then he did before at other times, he thought it not good to be idle at anie time, but with exceeding greate lightnesse he arose vp and carryed

And when the Griffin felt himselfe so sore hurt, he pulled with so great strength, that if the helme had not left his head, he had pulled the Emperour vp into the aire with him, which wold not haue fallen out well with him, but God was so pleased, that in that time the lases with the which it was made fast brake. This Griffin fÃ©eling himselfe pearced with this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wound, cut through the aire, as a whirlwind, with great and terrible shrikes, but straight hÃ©e fell downe dead to the earth, for that the wounde reached vnto his heart.</p>
               <p>The Giaunt when he behelde his Griffin to be dead, made no more a doo, but entred into the castle to arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, the which the Emperour well perceiued, which made him to make spÃ©ede to fetch his shÃ©eld, whereas this infernal birde had let it fall. So not long after this gyant came forth al armed with armour of a boyled skinne, with a great club full of knots in his hande, saying with a hoarse and terrible voice. Doe not thinke thou knight of the Diuell, for all that thou hast slaine the kÃ©eper of my Castell, that the entering is anie whit the more at thy commaundement, and hÃ©ereof thou maist be sure, whereat the Emperour answered neuer a word, but rather inuited him to battel, &amp; they ioyned together like two furious tygers, hauing their defence in their hands, burning with great fury the one against the other. Then they thrust themselues forwardes with meruailous force and spÃ©ede one against another, discharging their great and mightie blowes that it was wonderfull to beholde. But the Emperour did not determine to receiue the blowes of his enimie fullie and whole, but rather procured that he shoulde discharge them in vaine, and so hÃ©e did, for the Gyaunt lift vp his greate and huge clubbe to strike him therewith a maruailous and mightie blowe, which when the Emperour perceiued it to descend, he stepped a side w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so great lightnesse, that it sÃ©emed to be wonderfull, in such sort that his clubb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then this valiaunt warriour before the Gyaunt had time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer and lift vp his heauie club againe, stroke him on both his armes such a terrible and furious blow, that he cut them both off, and they fell to the ground. When the Gyant sawe himselfe so sore arayed, like a rauening. Woulfe he ranne to him and would haue imbraced him, but the Emperour with his accustomed knighthoode gaue a thrust at his breast, that by the great strength thereof he thrust his swoorde cleane through his bodie, so that the point came out at his backe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the halfe swoord, wherewith this Gyant gaue so great a fall to the earth, that it sÃ©emed a whole Towre had tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled downe.

for the loue of them, by force whereof he sent vnto mÃ©e his Embassadours, desiring me that I would thinke wel of him, and to giue him one of my daughters in marriage, so (not respecting his accustomed treason, but rather considering the great honour that might redound thereof for that hÃ©e was a mightie Prince) I thought it good to conclude with his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, and to fulfil his desire, and graunted him in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage my eldest daughter. Then I ordeining all things that were necessarie and needfull for the same, in all respects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for her estate and my honour, I sent her with all the pompe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was possible to the kingdome of <hi>Numidia,</hi> &amp; I retained and kept in my companie the youngest, who was named <hi>Herea,</hi> bÃ©eing of farre more beautie then her sister, of which this traiterous and vnnaturall king was informed by them which he sent to companie with my daughter, they did so much exalt her for her surpassing beautie, that there was not in him power to make anie resistaunce against that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and mortall wound of <hi>Cupide,</hi> but it constrained him to forget his new married wife &amp; swÃ©ete companion, surrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himselfe wholy vnto the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> absent Ladie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that she was sister vnto her, that he had alreadie taken for wife.

In the ende he thought by pollicie and deceit to get her home to his kingdome, and sent vnto me, requesting that I would let her to come vnto her sister <hi>Melinda</hi> to beare her companye, for that therein shÃ©e shoulde receiue great ioye and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to passe awaie the troublesome time of her Sisters bÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with childe, for that shÃ©e sayde, with her companye shÃ©e shoulde thinke the time farre more shorter, and shoulde passe it ouer with much more ease, especially for that the loue she bare her sister was so much as to her owne selfe, and although I was not aduertised of the euill euent which might happen in sending her, yet did I make excuse, that

Then this trayterous King sÃ©eing that by no meanes he could get hir from me, straight way ordayned a mightie and strong armie, and came himselfe to fetche her. And when I vnderstood of his comming, I went to receiue him with great pompe, as was nÃ©edefull for our Estates: and at our meeting, he requested me with very faire and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wordes, that I would let my daughter goe vnto her sister, to giue her that contentment which she desired, for that she did loue hir more than hir selfe. Thus his craftie and subtill perswasions so much preuayled, by reason of the humilitie and loue he shewed in his wordes, that I coulde not frame any excuse to the contrary, (he was so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,) but must nÃ©eds consent vnto his demaund.

great ioy &amp; contentment. But what sorrow did I then fÃ©ele, (nothing thinking of that which shoulde happen, for that my heart was ignoraunt of the knowledge thereof) but to see hir depart from me, for whose absence my heart remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in so great sorrowe and heauinesse: giuing to vnderstand by the outward showes, &amp; by the teares that procÃ©eded from my eyes, the great paine and passion that the lacke thereof wold shortly procure: &amp; in this sorrowfull sort, I was forced almost without any remembraunce, to retourne vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice. And they were not so soone entred into his ships, but as one very gelous to keepe close his treason, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded straight to hoyse vp sayles, and commit them vnto the winde, and hauing too good and prosperous a weather, in a very short time he arriued in his owne Countrie, whereas two leagues from the Citie, he was receiued of his subiects with great maiestie, who brought with them both horse and Palfrayes nÃ©edfull for the companie. So beeing all in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, he commaunded that they should beginne to martch forward towards the Citie.

And when he sawe his company so farre before, and they two alone together, he stepped on the one side, and ledde the waye into a little groue which was hard at hande, fast by a Riuers side.

This vncleane King when he heard, that so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and contrary to his expectation she aunswered, and would haue rose vp from the place whereas she sate, helde hir fast by hir apparayle, and would not suffer hir to arise, but began with softe and milde wordes to perswade hir to be quiet, and sayde. O my best beloued Ladie, wherefore wilt thou consent, that for thy cause I shoulde dye, &amp; mayst now very well without being discouered of any, giue mee remedie for the same? Be not then obstinate to denye mÃ©e that, which with so great loue I doo desire of thee. Who is heere that can beare witnesse of this my priuie desire, and bolde enterprise, neither discouer thy gentle liberalitie shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me? not one surely, but onely the immortall Gods.

Thinke not false traitour, that the feare of death shall cause mee to yÃ©eld to thy filthie desire. The which bÃ©eing well vnderstoode by the king, he sayde. Understande then and bÃ©e well perswaded, that either liuing or dead I will performe my will and pretended purpose, which so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure and with vnquenchable fire doth burne in my heart. Thus with great strength she did defend her selfe, and with a manly courage she kepte her honour, but this cruell and lasciuious king sÃ©eing that he coulde not fulfill his euill desire, in a greate madnesse he cut off a greate parte of the traine of her gowne, and bound it verie fast to the haire of her head, in such sort, that with the great strength he put thereto, and the tendernesse of the same, together with his euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, all the greene grasse was sprinkeled with the bloud that issued out, whereat he belÃ©eued that she would haue ben quiet, and haue consented vnto him, but she respected not the euill intreating, but the more he procured to torment her, the more angrie she shewed her selfe against him with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deniall.

Then this tormented Ladie sÃ©eing him, and bÃ©eing verie desirous of the death, with a furious voyce she sayde: What dooest thou thinke thou traitour, the greatest traitour that euer was in the world, wherein dost thou contemplate thy selfe, thou fleshly Butcher, thou vnmercifull Tyger, thou lecherous hogge and dishonourer of the royall crowne, make an ende of these thy tormentes, for it is nowe too late to repent thÃ©e, giue mÃ©e the death, and sende mÃ©e into the bosome of <hi>Diana.</hi> This vnpittifull king, seeing the stedfastnesse that shee hadde in the defence of her honour, with a cruell and infernall

This Knight remained a good while before he could speake, so when he was come againe to himselfe, hÃ©e beganne with a dolorous complaint, crying out against the Gods and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, because they had suffered so greate crueltie to bÃ©e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto this damosell, and making this sorrowfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, hÃ©e vnloosed her from the trÃ©e, and layde her vppon parte of her apparell, and couered her with the rest, and sayde on this wise: O cruell handes, what an infernall heart was that, which did beare thÃ©e companie to doe this vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable sacrifice? Was it not sufficient that this surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beautie should haue mooued thÃ©e to more pittie.

The great sorrowe that this false and and vnhappie King receiued was straunge, in such sort, that he knewe not what counsell to take, but thinking vpon the great punishment that might succÃ©ede these cruell actes, hÃ©e straight waies procured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bodie of the quÃ©ene shoulde be buried in great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So heerewith entered in the great soothsayer and wise man, called <hi>Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi> who came to comfort me, and certefied me, that all this crueltie should be reuenged by a mightie and strong arme, although before that should come to passe, there shoulde bÃ©e fought manie fierce battailes, and perswaded me to belÃ©eue it, for that he tolde me the truth.

But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had no care to knowe who it was, but with greate hast they went forwards on their waie, and when they drew nigh vnto the Castell, it sÃ©emed vnto them to bee the fairest that euer they had seene, and as the Emperour proceeded to goe vp the hill towarde the Castell, hÃ©e hearde one which with a greate voice sayde.

But hÃ©e tarried not long, when that out of a narrowe waie comming downe the hill he sawe a great Gyaunt, shaking in his hande a heauie Speare, and when he came to the place whereas the Emperour abode, he sayde. Knight, tell me, art thou the Emperour of <hi>Grecia</hi> or any of his sonnes. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour aunswered and sayde, I am he (who by the helpe of God) may frustrate thy force which thou hast done vnto this Damosell. Then the Gyant sayd, O miserable wretch, how thou art deceiued, what doest thou thinke thy selfe so strong and to haue so much strength to doe that alone, which all the worlde is not able to vndoe, and with greate anger for the wordes which he heard the Emperour speake, he tooke his Speare and did leuell it in his hande, and threwe it at the Emperour with such furie, that the aire did sounde therwith, the Emperour made his defence and receiued it vppon his shÃ©elde, and the point slidde in such sort, that it glaunced and broke in two pÃ©eces. When the Emperour sawe that hee threw it at him dart wise, he tooke his Speare fast in his hande, and firming himselfe in his stiroppes he raised vp his bodie and threw his Speare against his enimie with greate strength, who would haue receiued it vppon his sheelde, but the furie was such wherewith it was throwen, that it pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced both through his shÃ©elde and likewise the bodie, that the head was seene come out at the Gyauntes backe, the which terrible blowe bÃ©eing sÃ©ene by them which were in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell, was the occasion that there arose a greate vproare therein. The Emperour gaue thankes to God for this short victorie, and tourned himselfe vnto the Page which came with <hi>Lidia,</hi> and bad him take the Speare out of the Gyants bodie and bring it vnto him, for that it was whole, which presently the Page accomplished.

He came mounted on a a very strong and mightie horse, (for he had neede to be of a great strength, in that he did sustaine the carriage of so mightie a monster as the Giaunt was) and when hÃ©e was come whereas the Emperour abode, he looked whether the other Giaunt were altogether dead or not, but when he saw there was no life in him, and that by that onelye blowe hee was slaine, he said: <q>Is it possible mightie brother, that a thing so vile as this is, hath had power so quickly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tourning vnto this noble warriour, he said: Tell me Knight of so wonderfull a courage, what diuell hath brought thee hether, to doo vs so much harme, as the Gods themselues were not sufficient to haue done. The Emperor replied, The Ladie which thou sÃ©est hÃ©ere, brought me hether, to deliuer and set at libertie a knight, which without all reason thou doost kÃ©epe in thy Castle, and which with great treason thou broughtest hether. Of truth I tell thÃ©e Giant, that it seemeth very euill in such Knights as thou arte, to commit such outrages, for that nature hath not bestowed on thÃ©e these well proportioned members, nor giuen thee a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of so mightie a greatnesse, for to exercise it in dooing of so great wrongs, as you doo daily practise.

The Gyaunt with the greate paine that he had of the hurt which he receiued, felt himselfe verie ill, so that his anger did the more increase, and trauesing his horse from the one part vnto the other, procured by all meanes to hurt the Emperour, who was not at that instaunt idle, but according vnto his accustomed valiauntnesse auoyded his blowes, and smote at him such furious and heauie strokes, that hÃ©e made the bloud to followe in what place so euer he chaunced with his sworde to hit, and with the great paine that the Gyaunt felte, there procÃ©eded from his helme a verie thicke and hot smoake, his furie and anger was so much to see himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe so manie blowes, and not one of them coulde hurt his enimie, he threw his sheelde from him to the earth, and tooke his swoorde in both his handes, and verie fiercely stroke his horse with his Spurres, which made him to leape the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where as this worthie warriour was, and without

The terrible and fierce Gyaunt would haue giuen him the second blowe, but he could not, for that the Emperour was come againe to himselfe, and being setteled in the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, he firmed his swoorde fast with both his handes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incensed with greate anger and furie, insomuch that fire flashed out at both his eyes, he strake his horse with his spurres, and thrust himselfe forward, saying: Tarrie, tarrie thou furious beast, for that I meane to reuenge my selfe of the blowe past that thou gauest mÃ©e, and without delay send thy dampned soule deseruedly to the diuell of hell, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he stroke the diuellish Gyaunt such a blowe vpon the helme, that he made it sound like a bell, and he without anie remembraunce fell downe backwards vppon his horse crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the blowe was so terrible and deliuered with so greate strength, that the bloud started out both at his eies and at his nose. And as the Emperour would haue turned to haue stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him againe, he heard one with a great noise that called aloude and sayd: Stand still vile knight and hold thy hands, except thou wilt die the death. The Emperour lifting vp his head to see who it was that with so great arrogancie threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, beheld another Giant which descended downe from the Castell, of a greater stature, and sÃ©eming to be of more strength and furie then the other two, which by reason of his greatnesse was faine to goe on foote, for that there was no horse able to beare him. When the Emperour sawe a thing so monstrous comming towards him, he said with an angry voice: Cursed he that euill and diuellish generation from whence such monsters doth procÃ©ede, if it please God I will doe my best to abate this thy courage, and in this time the Gyaunt was come to himselfe and rose vp againe, and was prepared against the Emperour, who seeing him so nigh, with purpose to strike him, tooke the aduauntage, and stroke first, with such an ouerthwart blowe, that by the force ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

it cut his throate, necke and all, so that the head fell downe to the earth, and the bodie also like the corner of a great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell. This other Gyant seeing his brother dead in such sort, cryed out reuiling his Gods, and with blaspheming of all creatures<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> hee descended downe the hill, and drew out his huge and mightie sworde, pressing towards the Emperour, with such furie, as commonly the fierce Lyon doth after his praie, which bÃ©eing wel perceiued by the Emperour, he auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a little on the one side with his horse, &amp; lighted in greate hast, and with his accustomed courage hee went to mÃ©ete the Gyant, who was readie with his sword in his hand, &amp; came &amp; stroke at the Emperour a mightie blow, which he receiued vpon his shÃ©eld, that did then deceiue him, and by reason ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it fell downe vpon his healme, and made him s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Emperour seeing that it was not then time to slÃ©epe, and that the Gyaunt had his swoord ouer him to strike him againe, he bÃ©eing somewhat troubled, stepped aside and clÃ©ered himselfe from the fall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therwith preased to the Gyant before he could againe recouer his terrible swoorde, to bestow on him a blow core<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to his rage, and stroke him vpon the arme, but by reason that the Emperour was not wholy come to himselfe of the former blow he receiued, he could not repaie him with his whole strength as his heart desired, or as he would if hee had ben come to himselfe, notwithstanding it was not so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but that his sword cut his arme to the bone, wherwith he was so sore hurt that he could not lift his sworde from the ground, with the paine whereof the Gyant did feele himselfe verie ill, and was constrained to chaunge his sword into his left hand, with the which he stroke blowes verie much out of order. In this time the Emperour stroke at him so terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thicke, that it did almost amaze him, &amp; when the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant sawe himselfe so ill intreated, he began with a terryble voice to call for helpe of his people from the Castell. The which bÃ©eing vnderstoode by the valyaunt and heroycall Emperour, he sayd: no thou traitour, for neither thy strength
<pb facs="tcp:13973:79"/>
nor thy Gods, nor thy people shall deliuer thÃ©e, but thou shalt die by my handes, and therewith hÃ©e stroke at him the faster and with more courage, but within a small time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he sawe descending from the Castell another mightie gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and in his company more then fortie knights, who with greate showting descended downe the hill, the which beeing sÃ©ene by the worthie <hi>Trebatio,</hi> he was perswaded certainly that there hee shoulde dye. And although he was somewhat wearie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great trauaile which had passed, yet hÃ©e purposed to sell his lyfe verie dÃ©ere, determining that they should paie well for it before he lost it. Then all they which descended from the Castell did compasse the Emperour rounde about, and stroke him on euerie side without mercie or pittie, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer had bene there to haue sÃ©ene this worthie warriour, should haue had iust occasion to saie that there was the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> the flower of all knighthoode, for that he alone defended himselfe against his enimies, in that great extremitie, and if those gyants had not so pressed vpon him, he had estÃ©emed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other knights verie little, but it were the gyants that did most trouble and molest him, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he that did come in the daunger of his blowes, might thinke himselfe bewitched or to haue euill fortune, for either he was slaine or else maimed, or beaten downe to the grounde, but yet all this valour that he vsed little profited him, except hÃ©e did first procure to destroie these two diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Gyauntes, who through their might brought him into great perplexitie, making him sometimes to decline with his handes to the earth, and at other times also to stagger heere and there. And these shamelesse people by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate noise of their Lordes, procured on euerie side to hurt and molest the Emperour, and with the same noyse there descended from the Castell more then thrÃ©e score persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides them that were there before. But when the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> sawe himselfe so euill intreated and beset on euery side round about, he called vppon the name of God, and desired him of pardon for all his sinnes, and that he would haue mercie on his soule, for that he thought verily there to

end his life, and therwith he encouraged himselfe a new, and gathered such strength to his heart, that what with the iust quarrell he had, and the great anger he conceiued, hee gaue vnto that Gyant (who had called for succour) such a terrible blowe vpon the wast, that for all the greate force of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, it had almost parted him in two pÃ©eces, wherewith hÃ©e fell dead at his fÃ©et. And at the verie same instaunt hÃ©e stroke one of the knightes such another blowe vpon the helme, that he diuided both it and his head downe to the shoulders. The other Gyant when he sawe such meruailous blowes, began to exclaime out against <hi>Mars,</hi> reuiling him, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed so much strength and force on one knight, to declare such prowesse as there the Emperour shewed. The rest of the knightes were somwhat afraide of that which they had sÃ©ene done, and durst not prease so nigh as before they did, yet by reason of the great feare they had of the Gyant, they did not let greatly to molest and trouble him, and they preased vpon him in such wise that he waxed wearie, so that his good heart and noble courage wold little preuaile him, but that he must nÃ©edes be ouercome and slaine. The sad and sorrowfull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Lidia</hi> when she sawe the Emperour in such great perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie, with crossing and wringing her hands, and with bitter wÃ©epings she sayd.</p>

O famous knight of the Sun, oh renowmed <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> what may you saie when you shall heare that for my cause your father that worthie Emperour should be slaine, it had ben better for me (miserable as I am) to haue bene transported into a plant as <hi>Daphne</hi> was, &amp; not to haue caused that for my comfort so much harme should be done, vnlesse it had pleased y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goddesse <hi>Iuno</hi> to make an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting memory of this my true and perfect loue, as she did by <hi>Celos</hi> in so many Nymphs, of whom vnto this daie their

If you do remember, this is the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell I tolde you of, whereas I lefte <hi>Rosicleer</hi> beholding the great wrong and outrage that so many did against one onely knight. And likewise he did consider the surmounted prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse which that one knight vsed, and because he was armed with contrarie armour, he could not know who it was, and much meruailing at that he sawe, without anie more tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he lighted from his horse and laide hand on his swoord, &amp; with great furie and anger he pressed in amongst these false knights, and the first that he did encounter with, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Gyant, to whom he lent such a blow vpon the legge that he cut it a sunder, and with the force thereof he hurt the other legge by the knÃ©e, in such sort that he must nÃ©edes fall to the ground, not being able by any strength to sustaine or helpe himselfe. The Gyant sÃ©eing, &amp; to his paine fÃ©eling so furious a blow, cryed with a loude voice, saying: Upon them valiant warriours, for they are of no force nor abilitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, at which noyse the Emperour tourned his head aside, and sawe whereas the Gyaunt laye all along on the earth, by force of that most terrible and cruell blowe. Also hÃ©e sawe howe this noble knight besturred himselfe amongest the rest of the Gyauntes knightes, which was a valyaunt sight to bÃ©e sÃ©ene, wherfore he remained a good while in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and viewing him, till at the last he knewe him to bÃ©e his worthie sonne, euen that renowmed and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> I nÃ©ede not hÃ©ere to declare the excÃ©eding great
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13973:80"/>
ioye and comfort which this worthie Emperour receiued in seeing him, and especially at such a time beeing in great neede and necessitie, for of long time before that hÃ©e had not seene him, neither had he thought euer to haue sÃ©ene him after that time anie more, if at that instant hee had not come vnlooked for, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he coulde not choose but to haue bene slaine by those barbarous and vnciuile people. Then gathering vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe newe strength and courage, he pressed in amongst those false and wicked knightes, in such sorte that they beganne to runne awaie, as well because they sawe their Lordes and Captaines slaine, as also for that they coulde not in anie wise abide the terrible blowes of the Prince. So these two valiaunt warriours besturred themselues, that they were constrained in hope to saue theyr liues to tourne their backes, and tooke the waie vp the hill towardes the Castell, but this valiaunt <hi>Rosicleer</hi> followed them with so greate lightnesse, that before they came halfe waie vp the hill, hÃ©e had slaine the greater parte of them. Then the rest which sawe themselues so euill intreated, tourned altogether and pressed on him in such sorte, that by theyr force they hadde almost constrained him to tumble backwarde downe the hill, at which hÃ©e was meruailously wroth, and therewith like a couragious Knight hÃ©e pressed amongest them with so much furie, that with cutting off armes and heads, hÃ©e made them lesse then they were by the one halfe.
The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour by reason of his great wearinesse and trauaile which he sustained, remained at the foote of the hill whereas the first incounter was, but when he heard the moouing and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the people, hÃ©e tooke the waye vp the hill with so great lightnesse, as though the battaile had but then begun, and after him followed the fayre and beautifull <hi>Lidia,</hi> but when the Emperour came in sight, he beheld how the Prince with great courage followed after those wretched people eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to the gate of the Castle, for they thought to saue themselues if they might by anie meanes get in at the gates, pretending to make it fast vnto them, but this valiant <hi>Greeke</hi> pursued them with so great swiftnesse that they had no time to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
<pb facs="tcp:13973:81"/>
that, which they hadde determined, for at such time as they would haue shut the gates, he approched them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed their desire with cutting and hewing them, in such sort, that he entered into the Castell in spite of their heartes, and those that were within would haue made resistaunce at such time as he was in the great Court, but this valiaunt Prince did threaten them, saying.<q> O you wicked &amp; contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous villains yÃ©eld your selues prisoners, for be certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded you shall finde more in me by humilitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king resistaunce.</q>
There was one knight which remained, and hauing more ciuilitie then the rest, aunswered and sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Ualyaunt Knight, if we hadde thought euer to haue found in thÃ©e so much mercifull clemencie, as wÃ©e haue found mightie courage, verily long since we wold haue yÃ©el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our selues: now therefore we doe desire thÃ©e if there bÃ©e in thÃ©e anie iot of pittie, to manifest thy clemencie vnto vs, for considering wÃ©e were seruauntes vnto those Gyauntes, we were by duetie bound to defend them, and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to our powers, offend you. Then this noble prince promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them their liues, conditionally that they should yÃ©eld and surrender themselues.</q>
In this time the Emperour letted not to inlarge his pace for to come to the aide and defence of the Prince, but when he came thether, he found that he was in quiet, &amp; that all those that were left in the Castle requested peace, and when the Emperour sawe that it was then time to discouer himselfe, full of great ioy he fell vppon <hi>Rosicleer</hi> his necke, and sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Oh my sonne, I did well vnderstand that in the time of my greatest necessitie, that thou wouldest neuer deceiue me, with greate reason I may call thÃ©e my fortunate sonne, not for that thou wert borne in a good daie, but also that loue did cause so greate affection to thy mother, of whome hath procÃ©eded such finite as thou and thy brother.</q>
Nowe of this worthie Prince what shall I saye, that with verie ioye he was almost beside himselfe when he heard his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperour speake, for by the sounde of his voyce
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13973:81"/>
he did know him. So straight waye the Emperour pulled of his helme, wherewith this valiaunt <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued and without all doubt. When he sawe the maiestie of his regall countenaunce, and his bearde adorned with some royall white haires, his face somewhat high coloured, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great trauaile he receiued in his late battailes, in the which he showed his great power, and the prowesse of the progenie from whence he did procÃ©ede: his sonne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe his knÃ©es to the earth, and lifted vp the visour of his healme, and kissed the Emperours hands, bathing them with the teares, that fell from his eyes, which was forced by his heart, for the great ioye which he receiued. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour tooke him by the hand, &amp; raysed him from the ground with great loue. If I should hÃ©ere declare the rest of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, that passed in this their ioyfull mÃ©eting, it should be very tedious vnto the hearers, therfore I doo remit it vnto such a father, whose lot it is to haue good children, &amp; therwith their like helpe in necessitie. So without making any more delay, the Emperour would haue deliuered out of prison the Knight of this faire <hi>Lidia,</hi> the which being vnderstoode by them of the Castle, they straight waye brought him before the Emperour, with many other moe, which were pertakers with him in the succour of the Lady. These Knightes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether gaue great thankes vnto the Emperour, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship he had shewed them, in helping them out of this theyr terrible imprisonment. And thus they remained in great ioy and pleasure, as well the Emperour for the sight of his son, as also all those which were prisoners, for the good successe, that they had, but especially and aboue all the rest, was the ioye of <hi>Lidia,</hi> which with the contentment that she receiued to sÃ©e hir <hi>Brenio</hi> in hir companie, so that she was almost ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished of hir wits: but in the countenaunce of the Knight, it appeared by his outward showe, that he receiued no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: the which being vnderstoode by this faire <hi>Lidia,</hi> not knowing the cause whereof it should procÃ©ede to mooue him therevnto, all hir great ioye and delight, was tourned into despaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:82"/>Then the Emperour commaunded those of the Castle, that they should giue him somewhat to eate, and likewise to all the rest which were taken out of prison: vnto him for the great trauaile which he had passed in this battaile, and vnto the rest, for that they had great nÃ©ed thereof. So it was straight way made ready, and that in very good order, and they all sate downe together, at the Emperours table. So when they had almost dined, and that they were well refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, the Emperour tolde vnto <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> who that King was which he had sÃ©ene in the waggon, &amp; the occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for the which he desired him that no other aduenture should be the occasion to let him, but to goe straight vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to take in companie with him <hi>Brandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mardo,</hi> and procure that the Lady might be restored againe vnto her kingdome, vsing all your diligence to giue hir him to wife: for that the noble Prince is worthye of no small honour. And hÃ©ere my sonne I doo professe vnto thÃ©e, that a more beautifull Ladie in all my life I haue not sÃ©ene, but onely the Empresse <hi>Claridiana.</hi> Also if that fortune doo so serue, that thy brother the Knight of the Sunne, come to those parts, thou shalt will him, that he doo not mooue nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from those parts, for any kinde of aduenture that shall succÃ©ede, till such time as I doo retourne, for that nowe at this present I cannot retourne, for that I haue sworne and giuen my word. So there he tolde vnto them all the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of that infortunate <hi>Herea</hi>: at the which all they present receiued great sorrowe, sauing onely <hi>Brenio,</hi> which sÃ©emed that he receiued neither pleasure nor ioy. So when the boord was voyded, <hi>Rosicleer</hi> tooke his leaue of the Emperour his father, and leaped vp on his horse, and tooke the way which led him whereas he left his boate. He was no sooner entred into it, but it began to make way, and sailed with so great swiftnesse, that the third day he arriued at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereas at this present we will leaue him.</p>

With these and such like extremities, the night passed away, and when the lightnesse of the daye had entred in at the windowes of the chamber, he arose from his bed, and likewise this sorrowfull Ladie, which had passed all the night, with heauie wÃ©epings, and sorrowfull sighes, without putting of hir clothes, in such sort she went out and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
               <p>The Emperour was then risen and readie, and was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things in order that was necessarye to pacifie and make quiet the people of the countrie: the which was done with great ease, when it was knowen that their Lords wer dead, whom they did without all measure hate, for that they were so great tyrants: and foure great Cities, beside manye other faire townes and villages, did yÃ©elde and surrender themselues vnder his iurisdiction. The Emperour caused them to sweare to receiue <hi>Rosicleer</hi> as their true Lord, and they to be his faithfull subiects, and with them likewise all the whole dominion, the which they did with a verye good will: and the Emperour appoynted a gouernour amongest them, to gouerne all the land. All this bÃ©eing finished, and that the Ilande was in peace and quietnesse, he commanded to make readie two galleyes, the one for the faire <hi>Lidia</hi> and hir <hi>Brenio,</hi> and the other for his owne person, for that hÃ©e would depart for <hi>Africa.</hi> So all things was prouided pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently in good order, and being readie, the Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the faire <hi>Lidia</hi> to imbarke hir selfe, and to carrye with hir hir Knight, who straight waye went aboorde the galley, and commaunded the marriners to take their course towards <hi>Spaine.</hi> Likewise the Emperour did take his leaue of all them of the Castle: who for his noble customes and valiaunt Knighthoode, after that they knewe who he was, they both feared and loued him with all their hearts. And
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13973:83"/>
when he was imbarked in the galley, he commaunded the marriners to take the way towards <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is he that could signifie by any reason the small contentment and ioye, that the faire <hi>Lidia</hi> receiued, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the lad and melancholike countenaunce that hir <hi>Brenio</hi> continually shewed: who without speaking any word, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on till they found themselues in the Ponticke sea, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as continuallye it is accustomed with his furie, to terrifie those, which doo nauigate that way.

Thus they remained three dayes &amp; three nights in this great danger, &amp; the fourth day they wer driuen a land, at a small Ilande vninhabited, that was called <hi>Rees.</hi> This Ilande was hid in the sea very farre from anye lande, and was poynted with very great rockes. Ther they came to an anker with their galley, and for to refresh and ease themselues of their great trauaile which they had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they went a lande, and commaunded to raise vp a fayre Tent which they brought with them, and therein they made a bed, whereon <hi>Brenio</hi> laye downe to ease himselfe: and this faire <hi>Lidia</hi> leaned on the bed side by him, and was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in quiet, for that she sawe that the sadnesse of her Knight was a little abated. And by reason of the great paine and dolor that she had receiued, and the vnquietnesse in the tempest: and againe, for the contentment she had, to sÃ©e her Knight in better quiet, her wearied body required some rest, in such sort, that as she was leaning on the beddes side, she fell a slÃ©epe. This false <hi>Brenio</hi> when he sawe her at rest and in a sound sleepe, in great secret he arose from the bedde, and went vnto the waters side whereas he had lefte the galley, and entering therein, he commaunded all those that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande to imbarke themselues, and to hayse vp the sayles, and wold not by any meanes tarry, til that the seas were calme, but rather did put himselfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peril of these furious waues, then to inioye the swÃ©etnesse of this faire Damosell: and lefte her all alone, in this desolate and vnpeopled Ilande.

This dreaming la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die seeing this, determined to make her owne defence so well as she could, it sÃ©emed vnto her that there appeared before her a Centaure, which said, feare not faire damsell, for I am come hether to aide &amp; succour thÃ©e: yet for all that, this wilde man did not let to strike her vpon the breast, and as it sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to her, her breast was all open, and how that the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taure put his hand into the wound, and pulled out hir heart, and threw it at the wilde man, and sayd, Take vnto thÃ©e this heart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without all consideration loued a man, which with such ingratitude hath rewarded her. So straight at the same instant there appeared a Knight, which likewise layd holde on the heart with the wild man, and they two striued great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwÃ©ene themselues with much contention, who shoulde pull the heart out of the others handes: but in the end, each of them remained with his pÃ©ece in his hand, and the hearte parted in two. So the pÃ©ece which remained in the power of the wilde man, tourned into a harde stone, and that pÃ©ece which remained in the power of the knight, tourned into red bloud, and being in this great perplexitie, this sorrowfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die did awake, thinking to haue tolde this terrible dreame vnto her beloued <hi>Brenio,</hi> but she found him not in place, and tourning her face to the other part, to sÃ©e if she coulde sÃ©e him, but she could neither behold him, nor any other person, of whome she might enquire. Wherewith she leaped from the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13973:84"/>
bed, and with a loud voyce, she began to call for hir <hi>Brenio</hi>: but all was in vaine. So with a swift pace she went down to the waters side, thinking to haue found him there. But at her comming thether, she found neither him nor any other person, neither the galley which brought them thether. Then she looked to sea wards, to sÃ©e if she could disouer any thing, but she could see nothing but water, which was the occasion that she made great lamentation. And being verye hoarce with the terrible shrike which she gaue, shÃ©e went vp vpon a little rock which was nigh the waters side, from whence she did discouer the galley, in the which was her vnlouing <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> whereby she perceiued plainly how she was deceiued, &amp; how she bestowed her affection, whereas was nothing but falshoode: although before time she could not perswade w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her selfe, that so great treason remained in his heart. The great sorrowes and lamentations which this forsaken La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made, was sufficient to mooue the stones vnto compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus being wearie with lamenting, she sate her downe vpon the little rocke, and leaning her chÃ©eke vpon her white hande, she fell in a great sound, in such sorte, that in a longe space shÃ©e moued neither hande nor foote, but when she came againe vnto her selfe, she bagan a new to make great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and did publish her paine with terrible shrikes, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<q> Why was I not drowned in the Sea, that the fishes thereof might haue torne my bodie in pÃ©eces, or else to haue bene deliuered into the handes of tyrauntes, to haue vsed their tyrannie against me, that my heart might not haue felte this sorrowe, neither my eies haue sÃ©ene this crueltie? O vnhappie chaunce, oh cruell fortune, why diddest thou not make mÃ©e to passe this bitter and sorrowfull life in my childhoode, in such sorte, that it hadde consumed me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Gods permit and suffer mÃ©e to liue so long, it had bÃ©ene farre better that I had dyed in my Cradell, and not to liue to sÃ©e my selfe in this greate affliction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all helpe: O you mountaines, O you wilde beastes, O you dÃ©epe sea, there is not in you anie sence to hinder me, but that I maye publish heere the greate disloyaltie of that

O cruell and ingratefull fortune, I sÃ©e that hÃ©ere plainly without all pittie, thou doost driue me to the death, and although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault be others, yet thou doost apply the paine to be mine. And in this sort, with great griefe, the sorrowfull and vnfortunate Lady did torment hir selfe.</p>
               <p>So likewise, by reason of the great tempest and torment of the sea, (whereof we before spake) there arriued nigh the same place, a Knight, with no lesse daunger, then the others that landed there before. The Pilot sÃ©eing that <hi>Aeolus</hi> had shut vp his windes, and made fast the gates in such sorte, that the sayle beate against the maste of the galley, that they were constrained by the force of oares to retourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to sea. For that they did sÃ©e by all sea-faring tokens, that the weather would be troublesome: they did perceiue it also by the <hi>Cornesa,</hi> also by sÃ©eing the Dolphins, leaping and plunging in the sea, more then they were accustomed to doo. These and such like tokens the wise Pilot did consider off, who desired to take part where as hee might defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from that terrible weather looked for. So with this great desire they stroke the water with their Oares, &amp; with great furie they tormented their armes, to get to the lande: but the fatall QuÃ©ene <hi>Atrapos,</hi> would not consent therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for that at the houre when the troubled Moone, did extend hir beames vppon the face of the earth, and vppon the large and dÃ©epe Sea, then the winde <hi>Boreas</hi> began to blowe his blast, so that it constrained them of the galley to bring their saile to a bowe line, and to strike it very lowe, which made the vessell to tumble and roll from the one parte to the other, in such sort, that euerie time of hir tourning, all they that were in hir, thought to be drowned. Then the marriners thought good to strike and amaine their sayle, the which they did in great hast, and laboured to profite themselues with their oares and by the strength of their armes. But in the ende, when they sawe that neither sayle nor oares would profite them, they committed themselues vnto God, and lefte the Galley and all their goods vnto his gracious

knightes which rode abroade to solace themselues, and by chaunce they came to the place whereas the Emperour was, and when they sawe him of so faire a fauour and of so goodly a stature, and to their thinking he slept without all feare or care, one of them sayde: Out of all doubt this is a knight of a straunge Countrie, and by his countenaunce and proportion, it seemeth that he is of some high lignage, &amp; that peruerse fortune which alwayes is fickle vnto mankinde, hath caused him to come hether, &amp; brought him to be in this estate. To the which aunswere one that was in companie, who sÃ©emed to be of greater estate then all the rest, sayde: that he doth rather sÃ©eme to bÃ©e some robber and thÃ©efe, and one that doth lead an ill life, more then a knight of prowesse, and that the sword which he weareth, he hath stollen from some trauailing knight, let me come and I will awake him out of his sound slÃ©epe, and I will take this sword from him which doth not become him to weare, for it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him, and without anie more delay he alighted off from his horse to sÃ©eke his owne death (as it fell out) for when he came to the Emperour, he pulled him by the beard with so much strength, that spite of his heart he did awake him, but when the Emperour awaked and sawe the hands of that villanous knight fast vpon his beard (which was full of haires) he with his left hand stroke him such a blowe vppon the breast, that he made him to recoile backe, and whether he would or no, he fell to the ground with the force thereof, and with great anger he rose vp, (not making anie outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the great and incomperable trauaile that he had passed) he laide hand on his sword, and without tarrying till the other did arise, he stroke him such a blow vpon the head that he cut him downe to the breast, so that he fell downe dead to the ground, in this sort he gaue him his paiment for his great and vnseemely pride: these knights that came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were eight in number, but when the rest sawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the Emperour did, they prepared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>selues to fight, &amp; lighting from their horses they laid hands on their swords, &amp; wrapped their cloaks about their armes, &amp; then began a cruell battel,

but when this mightie <hi>Trebatio</hi> sawe himselfe so beset with the other seauen knights, he determined to sell his death ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deere, or else to kill them all, and as you doo see the greedie Lyon ranging the Countrie with his haire bristeled, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with great hunger to finde his praie: euen so the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Emperour began to strike with his strong arme, flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing with it in such sort, that on whom it chaunced to light, he had no nÃ©ede of a Surgion to heale him.

These wordes caused great alteration amongest all them in the pallace, and in great hast they called for theyr armour to arme themselues, but this faire quÃ©ene asked farther of the Lackie, what was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which these eight knightes offered, to cause that knight to attempt so hard an enterprise, who tolde and declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her all that you haue hearde, and when shÃ©e vnderstoode the whole circumstaunce, she commaunded straight that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare to cease, and that there should other eight knights goe and procure to take and bring him prisoner, without dooing him anie harme, for that she was desirous to know what hee should be that was of so valiaunt courage and so greate a strength. So straight waie at the commaundement of the quÃ©ene these eight knights were readie and armed, and went to the place whereas they were still in battaile, and at such time as they approched, there was but two left of the eyght,

                     <pb facs="tcp:13973:91"/>Knight, I neuer thought to giue you so louing entertainment as now I doo, by reason that you did intreate me very ill, &amp; all my people, and caused me to receiue great griefe: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, the amends which I hope to haue of so worthye a knight, doth cause me to craue of you pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for this my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer anger, for that the little knowledge and acquaintaunce I haue had of you, hath bene the principall occasion of my discourtesie.</q>
Then the Prince did call to remembraunce, that she should be the Lady which was in the Chariot, as well by her speaches, as by the apparell she wore, to whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and sayd:<q> Ladye, for your great griefe I am verye sorie, and surely I should receiue much more griefe, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should not fall out, wherein I might doo you seruice. Not for so much in that I owe by duetie vnto knighthoode, as it is to be at your commaundement: and more, it is the wil of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor my father, to labor to obtaine you all the ease and contentment, that possibly I could: and therefore onely for this cause and purpose, he commaunded me to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court: so that whensoeuer you thinke it necessarye to put your necessitie in vre. I am hÃ©ere ready at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, to doo all that in your seruice is conuenient. And for that all things in your seruice shall be fulfilled in more ample manner, I will that the noble <hi>Brandimardo</hi> go with me in my companie, for that your defence shall bÃ©e the more certain. And although the attainment be neuer so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> yet hauing him in my companye, I hope to make all things dead sure. </q>
                  <hi>Brandimardo</hi> re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dred vnto him great thanks and did accept his desire to haue him in his companie.
The QuÃ©ene of <hi>Lira</hi> was not a litle ioyfull of this she heard, and gaue great-thanks both vnto the one and vnto the other, for their great courtesie showed, and sayde.<q> Noble and valiant Princes, I doo conceiue very much ioye in this your great curtesies offered vnto me, touching the restoring me agayne vnto my kingdome: but in the meane time that you doo pretend to make me this restitution, and likewise in satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of this great curtesie which you haue offered, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sÃ©ech you to procure vnto me (hauing so good opportunitie, &amp;

<q>Oh fortunate Empire, that shall bee gouerned by so valyaunt a Princesse, the order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Lady, I know not how to giue it, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it dooth wholy and altogether consist in you.

<q>I do receiue it by the hands of the best Knight of the world, and heere I doo returne it vnto you againe, for with it, I hope to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored into the Kingdome of <hi>Lira.</hi> 
                  </q>And whiles she was sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng these words, he girte himselfe therewith againe.
Then the Prince sayd.
<q>Faire Lady, I haue this sword nowe in such estimation, that I doo belÃ©eue no Knight maye estÃ©eme more thereof, nor haue it in greater price, neither will I chaunge it for anie thing in all the worlde, and hÃ©ere I doo giue you great thankes for this your curtesie, and desire of God spÃ©edely to giue me occasion, that I may pay this great debt, in the which I am indebted. And for that I maye the better satisfie my desire, I doo request of you to graunt me a boone, which vppon my faith, I doo promise you, is the very first that euer I did demaund of Ladie<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and that I protest by the honour I owe vnto the order of Knighthoode: Ueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie sayde the QÃ©enne, and it shall be the first that euer I graunted vnto anie Knight. And belÃ©eue me it is vnto mee no small pleasure and contentment, that this my first grant should be giuen vnto a knight of so noble valour as you are, let it be therfore what it shall be, I will graunt it vnto you.</q>

And being resoning in this manner, they were cut off from their talke by the comming of the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who brought leading by the hand, the Lady <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who came from her closet, whereas being together, they heard of the newes of the arriuall of the Prince.

All the whole Court receiued great ioye and pleasure for the comming of the Prince, and all the Knights and Gentlemen came to visite him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dinner time they sate downe at the table, and at the end of the dinner, when that all was taken vp, they did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and thought it good, that out of hande they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to giue battaile to the Gyaunts, vsurpers of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lira,</hi> and that the QuÃ©ene and the Dutchesse should remaine in the Court: and with this conclusion they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that for the next daye, should be made readie, all that should be necessarie for their iourney.

His power and strength was such, that he was not onely feared of them of the Iland, but also of all other Kings and Knights, borderers and confines vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Iland. He was fifteene cubites in height, and his face very furious and wilde, and his strength surpassed the power of men. And aboue all he was very cruell, and had vsurped that land of another Giant, who by lineall descent should haue had the gouernment, whose name was called <hi>Galtenor.</hi> This was he, which in a Serpentine figure ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the chamber of the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> and stole away her two children, for that he did knowe by his arte Magicke (in the which he was very cunning and expert) that he could not recouer his Iland, but by meanes of the young sonne, whereof the Empresse shuld be deliuered.

This Gyant did determin not to depart from that place, til such time as they came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to age, for that the countrey did lyke them very well. So they were there sixe yeres without remoouing from thence to any other place, in the which time these Infantes were so great of body that they sÃ©emed to be of a dossen yeres of age. <hi>Claridiano</hi> was of a meruailous and faire beautie, but the infant <hi>Rosaluira</hi> was without comparison, more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie humane creature. Then <hi>Galtenor</hi> seeing that it was time to carrie them vnto <hi>Trapobana,</hi> he caused by his art to bÃ©e brought a Chariot, which was drawen by two great Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons, and therein he put the children, and also their nourse: for that the children did crie pitifully for their nourse, and the nourse likewise shed many teares, and began to torment her selfe, when they should be carried awaye, and so bÃ©eing in the Chariot they trauailed, and left behind them <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and the faire and white <hi>Albania,</hi> the great Sea of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pro,</hi> and likewise <hi>Marmantina,</hi> the <hi>Gran Tartaria,</hi> with his surmounted seas, which is seperated from the great sea, they passed likewise by <hi>Armenia</hi> the great, and came vnto the head spring of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which doth begin a hundred miles

And she receiued such contentment, in these swÃ©et delights, that before she was aware, she was very far from the place, whereas her brother and the rest were a slÃ©epe.</p>
               <p>There was nigh that place a shepheard, which kepte cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine shÃ©epe, &amp; with that exercise he passed his lyfe, (although with great miserie) and in a very poore and little cottage, who sÃ©eing that Infant all alone, and so gallantlye ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with rich apparell, he drew nÃ©ere the place whereas she was, and looked round about him towardes all parts, to sÃ©e if there were any that came after her to sÃ©eke her, or if shÃ©e had any kÃ©eper: but when he sawe that there was no body, he tooke her by the hand, and the childe followed him with a verye good will, alwaies looking him in the face. The Shepheard spake vnto her in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> tongue, and the childe spake vnto him in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> tongue, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of him somewhat to eate, with a smiling countenance: this shepheard did partly vnderstand her &amp; lead her vnto his house, and gaue her a dish of milke and sops of bread, and the
<pb facs="tcp:13973:94"/>
childe being a hungred did eate it with a very good will. The shepheards wife, who was somewhat discrÃ©ete, sÃ©eing the great riches, that this infant <hi>Rosaluira</hi> had about her, sayde, Husband, I do belÃ©eue that this child is of some high lignage as it doth appeare by her apparell, and surmounted beautie. It shall be verye well, that we doo kÃ©epe her hÃ©ere till such time as we doo know what she is. For in kÃ©eping and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much of such a faire creature, cannot choose but redound vnto vs great profite. And if it so fall out, that we cannot learne nor know what she is, with this ritches y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, we may bring our selues out of all trouble, and be more richer then any shepheard in all this Countrey. This shepheard receiued great ioye with the finding this childe, acknowledging all that which his wife had sayd vnto him, to be very good and well spoken: and so in great secret they kept her eight dayes, maintaining her in the best wise they could, with such meates as they were accustomed to eate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hauing a great care, at all times when he went to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roshlima,</hi> to demaund if there were any inquirie for such a childe, although he belÃ©eued for a certaintie, that she was of some straunge Countrey, by reason of her apparaile, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent language, which was an occasion that they put in practise their determined purpose: and laing all feare apart, they tooke from her, her rich apparrell, and put on shepheards apparell, as was accustomed amongest them, wherewith this childe was as well content, as with the other: and vnder that course raiment, she did discouer so great and surpassing fairenesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Diana</hi> was almost ashamed to extend her siluer beames, whereas this young feminine shepheard did walke, who alwayes carried in her hande a litle shepheards crooke, and following the shÃ©epe whereas they did fÃ©ed, many times with her golden haire about hir shoulders, being of so great beautie, that the glistering beames of <hi>Appollo</hi> passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, appeared to haue no vauntage of it. The olde sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes wife did verie well intrate her, and made as much of her as she could, for that those iewells was the occasion of their great wealth. And againe this sheapheard was wise,

for when he sawe himselfe rich of money, yet would he not begin to vse his wealth too spÃ©edely, because he woulde not giue anie to vnderstand of his sodaine riches, but by little and little he did imploie it in buying more sheepe, in such sorte, that he came to be the richest shepheard in all that Prouince, accounting and esteeming of that childe more then if she had ben their owne daughter.

His vnderstanding and pollycie was such in all manner of thinges, that not onely the king but all others were perswaded that hÃ©e was the sonne of some of the Gods, by reason whereof they did vse him with such reuerence as though hee hadde bÃ©ene a thing sent vnto them front heauen.

So their barkes were ioyned one with another, which the Prince see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he went and would haue leapt into the other boat: but he was disturbed by the comming forth of a verie well set Knight against him, being of a good proportion, who hadde heard the words which the Prince had sayd, and for to sÃ©e who it was which spake them, he came from vnder the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the barke. He was armed with grÃ©ene armour, the most richest that euer Knight did weare, &amp; was full of these two letters <hi>F.F.</hi> all gylte.

And when hÃ©e sawe that the Knight of the Sunne had his healme on his head, and that he was a Knight of so gentle disposition, and with so rich armour, he almost suspected who it should be, &amp; sayd with great grauitie, It is not sÃ©emelye (especiallye in a Knight of such disposition as you sÃ©eme to be) to speake such proude words as you haue vttered, and aboue all, vnto one that doth estÃ©eme them so little as I doo.

The Knight of the Sunne came straight waye to himselfe, and lifting vp his mightie arme, he chaunced such a blowe vppon the helme of his enimie (which was as harde and strong as a Dimond) that it gaue such sound, that all the sea was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with the noyse thereof.

a blowe vpon the helme, that it made the bloud start out at his eyes and at his nose, and he was so troubled therewith, that he thought a great tower had fallen downe vpon him. The Prince seeing him in this traunce, did procure to leape into his barke, but the grÃ©ene Knight by reason he was not fully astonished, with both his hands thrust at the Knight of the Sunne vpon his breast, for to hinder him from his entring, so that spite of his heart he made him to recoyle, and that in such sort, that he lacked but a little to fall downe backwards, which was the occasion, that his anger did the more increase. And either of them firming themselues on their feete, there began a new the battaile, with so great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and furie, that the marriners thought, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at euery blowe the battaile would haue bene ended. Neuerthelesse, the more they did fight, the more their anger did increase, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr fierce blowes wer inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>perable.

The Prince was meruailously amazed to sÃ©e that the courage of his enimie did so long indure, which caused his anger in very straunge manner to increase in such sort, that he strake at him such strong and incomperable blowes that they were not to be suffered, and almost no resistance to be made. So long they indured the battaile, that the Sunne had made an ende of his ordinary course, &amp; the heauie and mourning night began to throwe his mantle euer all the earth, in such sort that they could scarce see: but they were so kindled in their anger, &amp; so furious in their battaile, that the darknes was not sufficient to seperate them, but they called with a great noyse for lights, that they might make

an end of their battaile, but <hi>Tefereo</hi> sÃ©eing their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conceiued great griefe that such a valiaunt knight as hÃ©e with the greene armour should runne in any danger of peril, he did perswade with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marriners, &amp; made signes that they should vngrapple their barkes, and bÃ©eing moued with great compassion they procured to doe it, so priuely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the knights might not perceiue it, the which was easily accomplished, for that they were so blinded in fiercenesse of this their battell, that they could not intend to marke it. The grapples wer no sooner taken off, when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the barke of the knight of the Sun with great force did seperate himselfe from the other, which when the prince did sÃ©e, and that he could not finish his desire, he was purposed to throw himselfe into the sea, for to come vnto his aduersarie, but considering that it woulde little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him, he beganne to exclaime against <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> to be his enimie and a robber of his honour, and saying that he was a vile man and of base bloud and lignage: with this and such like reproch, and other irefull thoughtes, the Prince went onwarde his iourney, and vppon a sodaine his Galley stroke a lande, and in a trice hÃ©e leapt out of her, and after him went out <hi>Tefereo,</hi> and caused theyr horses to bÃ©e ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, and put them into a faire medowe full of verie faire and grÃ©ene grasse, where as they did fÃ©ede.

So verie earlye in the morning at the breake of the daie hee called for his horse, and when all that were with him were in a readinesse, hÃ©e beganne to iourney, and tooke his waie through a verye straight and narowe path, which brought them vnto a verie broad &amp; common beaten waie, so they had not trauailed long in it, when they sawe comming a Damsell with a verie sad and sorrowfull countenaunce, as appeared by the greate quantitie of teares which procÃ©eded from her eyes, and shÃ©e came in greate hast riding on her Palfraie, and when shÃ©e came nigh whereas the Prince was, hÃ©e and all that were

At length, the long desired houre drew on, of their appointment, and the Earle repayred vnto the place: he was scant there, when that the Damosell likewise appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, almost at the same instant, and the Earle receiued her with great contentment: but the damsell said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she had no time to haue any great talke with him, but onely my Lorde this I say vnto you, that this night at midnight she wil tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thy comming, wheras thou shalt fulfill all thy desire, and giue thÃ©e to vnderstand, how that she is not culpable of all these thy passed sorrowes and griefes, (naming a mÃ©eting place, which after shall be declared). And pardon me, I pray you, for that the time dooth not giue me any more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to talke with you, and so without any more tarrying she went away, and lefte the Earle in such great ioye, that he was almost in an extasie therewith. The Earle went vnto his lodging, where he remained, and tarried vntil the time appointed, the which he thought very long, imagining euery minute a whole houre. The houre being come, he went alone vnto the place appoynted, and couered himselfe with a mantle of cloath of golde. He tarried not long ther, when that this infortunate <hi>Tarfina,</hi> put her selfe vpon a wal, wher as she put downe a pÃ©ece of timber, whereby the Earle shuld laye holde on for to goe vp.</q>

The which when that the Earle sawe, and knewe that they wer her garments, he thought berely that she had bene his Lady so long desired, and without anye more thinking, he fell downe vpon his knÃ©es, and taking her by the handes, he kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them many times, and so both of them by great pollicie and deceite, and with excÃ©eding ioye, did fulfill their desires, and tooke their leaue each of other, with many pleasaunt and sweete wordes, fearing that the daye would appeare, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. The Earle retourned vnto his lodging, wheras hÃ©e passed the rest of the darke night with great contentment. This Damosell did the like, putting from her those vsurped roabes of the honestie and honour of her Lady the Princes. So the next morning when it was day, the Earle rose vp, and apparayled himselfe with the most richest apparrel that he had, and went vnto the Kings pallaice somwhat betimes, and so walking round about out of one chamber vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill such time as he came vnto the chamber whereas the Princesse was, he lifted vp a cloath which was before the dore, where he might well discouer the innocent Ladye, with a praier booke in her hande, vsing her accustomed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp; daily deuotion.

               <p>Traitour, thou shalt not clÃ©ere thy selfe as thou doest thinke to doe, hauing committed so greate treason as thou hast done, and his anger was such, that he stroke at the Earle a terrible blowe, which was more of ire then regarding how he deliuered it, the Earle let the blow slippe by and running in with the same, he stroke the Prince such a blowe vppon the head, that he parted it in two pÃ©eces, and hÃ©e fell downe dead on the floore. The tumult and vproare was such amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the Ladyes and Damosells, that at their greate shrikes the king went thether, and his comming was in such hast, that this vnfortunate <hi>Lidiarte</hi> coulde not by anie meanes get awaie.

And when the king sawe the Prince slaine, and the murtherer standing by, the king stepped vnto him and tooke the sworde out of his hande, and sayde vnto him. Oh knight without measure or mercie, what hath beene the occasion of this thy follye to kill this Prince.
There was by a Ladie of the Princesses, (who verie grÃ©euously lamented the death of the Prince) and told vnto the king all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of the matter as it ther passed, and when the king heard of all this enterprise, he receiued so much anger, that he himselfe in person did carrie him into a strong towre which was in the pallaice and put him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner therein and commaunded to put on him verie greate and strong chaines, and without any more tarrieng he called his counsell together, and opened the matter in publike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, whereas he was condemned for a traitour (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were some which did feare much his great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but the king made no reckoning of it) and so before that he would breake his fast, he commaunded him to be hanged

out of one of the windowes of the Towre, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded publikely to be proclaimed all the whole treason, where as to all men was seene his sodaine &amp; sorrowfull death. Then he commaunded the Prince to be buried with great honour, as vnto such a person did appertaine.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13973:103"/>
so that both of them fell to the grounde, whereas they were all broken to pÃ©eces, and there she dyed.
<hi rend="margQuotes">The greate altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was in the Court, when they vnderstoode of all this that had past, was straunge and without comparison. And although manie did heare her complaint, yet there was not one that coulde tell wherefore it was, till such time as a Lackie which was nigh her, declared all that you haue heard tolde, for that he had heard it worde for worde, but when the king did knowe the effect thereof, hÃ©e was verye much amased at it. And for that he woulde there shoulde be a perpetuall memorie thereof, presently hÃ©e commaunded that they should bÃ©e buryed both together, in a Sepulchre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> declaring in it the effect of this dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act, the which was forthwith published throughout all the whole kingdome. So when that this vnhappie death of the Earle came vnto the eares of his Father and all his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, they were verie sorrowfull, and receiued for it great griefe, and waxed verie wrathfull, and determined (if it were possible) to reuenge the death of the Earle, and deuised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in secrete what order might best bee taken to bring it to effect. So in the ende of manie inuentions, they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to accuse the Princesse, that shee should be the onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of all this euill. And the better for to compasse and bring this accusation to passe, they did commit it to the vsing of the brothers sonne of the olde Earle, and cousin vnto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diarte,</hi> who was sonne vnto the Earle of <hi>Prouince,</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and valiaunt Knight. The which accusation he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with a verie good will, and for to make their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more strength, they agrÃ©ed to sende vnto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> vnto a brother of the king <hi>Bramidoro,</hi> with whome they had at that time greate friendshippe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing him that hÃ©e woulde sende them some one of his lignage to fauour them hÃ©erein, the which he graunted with verie greate good will, and for that they shoulde the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstand the greate desire that hÃ©e hadde to pleasure them in this matter, he sent them two of his lignage, and by reason that they were Gyauntes and of a meruailous

huge bignesse (although all the world did knowe that the Princesse is without fault and not culpable) yet they dare not put their persons in aduenture, with those two horrible and disordinate monsters.</hi>
So after they hadde made this their traiterous and false accusation, after manye and great contentions they grew in the end to this conclusion, that the Princesse should within the tearme of fiftÃ©ene dayes bring three knightes that with these other thrÃ©e shoulde make and maintaine battaile in the fielde for the defence of this false accused Princesse, and if so be that she coulde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that time prefired finde but two knightes, then it shall be at their curtesie to take vppon them the enterprise, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor lesse then they thrÃ©e if shee did finde but one knight.

To loose our liues for to set at libertie this wronged Ladie, aunswered the Knight of the Sunne, therefore it is conuenient without anie more delaye that wee take our iourney thether-ward. Then the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell sayd, how is it that you will take the enterprise in hand and bee but two, and they bÃ©e thrÃ©e, and besides, almost inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. Then <hi>Tefereo</hi> aunswered, the iustice on the Princesse parte shall be the thirde person, take you no care fayre Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell for that, for although we are but two, we doe little esteeme them. When the Damosell sawe their liberall prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and determination, she was verie gladde and content, and straight wayes she leaped vpon her palfraie and they on their horses, and so rode towards the Citie without making anie farther delaie or tarrieng.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith great hast the Prince and all that were with him trauailed that daie and the next in the kingdome of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> vntill they came within two leagues of <hi>Paris,</hi> so the next daie verie early in the morning they arose &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed againe till they came within the sight of the Citie, and for that it was verie early to enter into the same, they alighted amongst a companie of trÃ©es, wheras by the great thicknesse they might not bÃ©e sÃ©ene of anie: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing themselues by a clÃ©ere fountaine of water that was there at hand, they sate downe and did eate of such as the Damosell had brought with her. So in this sort they passed the time, till they thought it to be the houre to goe vnto the defence pretended, so when the time drew nigh, they perused their armour in all pointes, and armed themselues and leapt on horse backe. <hi>Tefereo</hi> if it had not sÃ©emed vnto him to bÃ©e a point of cowardlinesse, wold haue procured to haue distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed this battaile, for they against whome he shoulde fight were his kinsefolkes, but yet he thought that he was more bound by the order of knighthoode to kÃ©epe companie with him with whom he came, and to resist such like wronges in the defence of truth and iustice, then to haue anie respect to his kindred, and especially in such like false accusations. Hee therefore determined to dissemble it and say nothing, so with these and such like thoughtes they went forwardes till they came into the citie, vnto the place appointed for this battell, whereas they found the Princesse set vpon a scaffolde, all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with mourning robes of great sadnesse, which did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and shew her great sorrowe and vndeserued trouble. So likewise all the whole scaffolde, and all the Ladyes and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosells that came with the Princesse were couered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled correspondent vnto her attire. The king was at a windowe of his Pallaice with no lesse sorrowe and sadnesse to sÃ©e his honour put vnto that blemish as it was. And that which grÃ©eued him most was, that not one knight in all his Court durst giue the enterprise, yet was there present
<pb facs="tcp:13973:105"/>
all the whole companie of the knightes of his Court. So these two Gyaunts and the other knightes came armed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place with verie fayre and strong armour, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon greate and mightie strong horses, sauing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of the Gyauntes, for that there was not any horse that coulde sustayne so mightie and huge a waight: wherefore he was mounted vpon an Elephant. So looking round about, the Prince sawe on the other side of the fielde the Knight with the grÃ©ene armour, which he had fought with all in the Barke bÃ©eing at the Sea, as I haue tolde you, who was in a readynesse to make the battaile in defence of the Princesse. This knight there by had hanged vpon a pÃ©ece of timber all the Images that he brought with him, in such sorte as they were hanged in his Barke, the which when the Prince saw that the Image of the Dutchesse was aboue that of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, his anger did so increase, that he had cleane forgotte wherefore he came thether, and spurred <hi>Cornerino</hi> his horse with so much furie, that by his force he made the grounde whereas he came to tremble and shake. And when he came vnto the place whereas the Images were hanging, he with his strong arme laide holde vppon the deuice and brake the chaines wherewith they were made fast, and swinged it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head with such greate strength, that hÃ©e made them flye to the highest partes of all the Pallaice, the which was done in such great hast, that when the knight with the greene armour was come to disturbe him, it was too late, for that his Ladye was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13973:105"/>
him againe, the Prince was come vnto himselfe, and setling himselfe vppon his horse backe, being firmed in his stirrops, with greate furie he threw his shÃ©elde to the grounde, and tooke his swoorde in both his handes, and pricked <hi>Corneri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> towardes the place whereas his aduersarie was, who was likewise in a readinesse to discharge his blowe, so both of them together discharged each vppon the others helme, with such furie and force, that the Prince of the Sunne was constrained to fall vpon his horse necke as though hÃ©e hadde bene dead, for that neuer blowe that euer he receiued before that time did bring him to the like perplexitie, but onely one, the which he receiued at the hands of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> when he had battaile with him. Lykewise the knight with the grÃ©ene ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour did nothing aduance himselfe of his dÃ©ede, for the blow which he receiued was so terrible, that he fell from his horse to the ground, and the bloud issued out at his month and nose with great abundaunce, and he stretched his armes and legs vpon the sandie ground as though he hadde bene altogether dead. The king and all that were with him were very much amased, to sÃ©e that so cruell and sodaine a battell should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, without knowing the occasion wherfore. And more they did meruaile, imagining a little by the tokens of the horse who that knight should bÃ©e, which hauing his enimie for so valiant a knight in so short time had brought him into such extremitie. Now when <hi>Tefereo</hi> did sÃ©e the Prince thus put to his shiftes and in such great necessitie, and howe that hÃ©e laie vpon his horse necke without anie remembrance, hÃ©e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to crie out vppon fortune, and with great furie he drew out his swoorde and went against the defenders of the euill accusation, and called them traytours, (although they were his brothers children.) HÃ©ere you may sÃ©e what great force and strength the truth hath, that although they were his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers childen, yet he did procure their deaths, for that they came out of their owne Countrie, into a straunge and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine lande to defende treason. The sonne of the Earle of <hi>Prouince</hi> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first that did offer to put himselfe forwards, to whome <hi>Tefereo</hi> gaue such terrible and strong blowes
<pb facs="tcp:13973:106"/>
vpon his helme, that without remembraunce hÃ©e made him fall to the ground as one that were dead. The Gyants when they sawe themselues so ill intreated, both of them set spurs vnto theyr beastes, and drawing out their great and sharpe cutting swoords, they did procure to hurt him with theyr heauie and terrible blowes. In this contention the valiaunt <hi>Sardenian</hi> did shewe his mightie and strong courage with greate pollicie and cunning, nowe striking at the one, and then at the other, and alwayes prouiding to let their blowes slippe aside without receiuing anie harme, and such was his pollicie and lightnesse, that in a great while they coulde not fasten one full blowe vppon him. Nowe was the knight of <hi>Prouince</hi> come to himselfe, and sÃ©eing himselfe on the grounde, and his enimie so couragious betwÃ©ene these two mightie Gyauntes, he approched vppon the one side where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Tefereo</hi> coulde not sÃ©e him, and cut off one of the hinder legges of his horse, the horse when hÃ©e felte himselfe hurte, woulde haue risen vpright before, but by anie meanes hÃ©e coulde not, but recoyled backwarde with his crouper to the grounde, which was yet in such sorte that <hi>Tefereo</hi> had time to goe out of the saddle, with so greate anger, that the bloud burst out at his nose, and without anie feare before him, he pressed at the knight of <hi>Prouince,</hi> and thrust such a foyne at his breast, that his armour coulde not denie the passage but that the swoorde came out at his backe, so that hÃ©e fell downe starke dead to the grounde: hÃ©e had scant drawen his swoorde out of the bodie of the knight, when that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie pollicie to defende himselfe, hÃ©e receyued such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blowe with the breast of the Gyantes horse, which came with such greate furie that (albeit agaynst his will) he was constrained to fall tumbling vnto the grounde, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fall was somewhat heauie and grÃ©euous vnto him, yet with a trice hÃ©e was a foote againe, and sÃ©eing both the Gyauntes readie prepared against him, for his better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he thought it good to put himselfe on the other side of the dead horse.</p>
               <p>At this instant the knight of the Sunne came agayne
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13973:106"/>
to himselfe, and looking towards the place whereas the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile was, he sawe that his friend like a furious Lyon made resistaunce against the two Giaunts. My pen is not heere sufficient to signifie vnto you the great furie, that on a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine came vnto this worthy knight of the Sonne: so that I suppose no Diamond rocke had bene at that time able to make resistaunce against him: for with a furious &amp; hoarce voyce he sayd, Away, away you vile Knights, not worthy of these your great members, and double forces which you doo possesse, seeing that with so much shame this daye you haue maintained such great treason. The prince carried his sword in his hand, hauing reared it on high, redy to strike him that first came in his way, and raising himselfe in his stirrops, he stroke the Giant with the Elephant so terrible a bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>we vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his shoulder, that his double armour was not able to make resistaunce against this great force, but that it passed thorough, and diuided it in such wise, that he cut off the one quarter thereof, together with the head, and the rest which remained, fell downe to the ground, with so great wayght, that it made the earth to tremble. The other Giaunt in the meane time had stroke the Prince such a terrible blowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the healme, that it made him to gnash his teeth together, with the paine he felt, which was the occasion that he was whollye incensed with anger, insomuch that he pressed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him with no lesse rage, then the Hawke which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth the Hearon, and stroke such a blowe at his head, that for the defence thereof, the Giant was constrained to lift vp both his armes, and the blow descended in such sort vppon them, that it cut them both in pÃ©eces, and his sworde being fast in his handes, they fell altogether to the ground. All the whole Court greatlye meruailed at these fierce and terrible blowes: and hauing thus concluded all that they had to doo the Prince returned vnto <hi>Tefereo,</hi> and sayd vnto him, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doo you remaine hÃ©ere, till such time that all be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that is hÃ©ere necessarie to be done, and in the wildernes of <hi>Ardenia</hi> you shall finde me, in the very same place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we did rest our selues this day, and I desire thee to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb facs="tcp:13973:107"/>
to know who is that Knight with the grÃ©ene armour, and whether he be dead or no. And without any more tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he spurred his horse, who made as swifte waye as the thunderbolt, and presently departed the Citie, and neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted till he came vnto the place, whereas he tolde his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion he would remaine. Then <hi>Tefereo</hi> went vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and asked them if there were anye more to be done, in the defence and fauour of the Princesse: and the Iudges an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it was sufficient which was done, and that ther was no other thing to be done in that matter. When <hi>Tefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reo</hi> sawe that all was done that was nÃ©edfull, he went vnto the place, whereas the Knight with the grÃ©ene armor was, and pulling off his helme, he saw that all his face was swol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len with the terrible blowe that he had receiued, and hÃ©e sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as though he had bene dead. At the same instaunt, the King was come downe from his windowe, into the place whereas the battaile was: onely for to honor these knights and to knowe who they were. And when he could not sÃ©e the Knight of the Sunne, he asked for him, and straight way it was tolde him in what great hast he went from that place and out of the Citie: for the which the King was very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and if they had not tolde him, that it had bene labor lost to seeke him, he would haue followed to see if he could haue sÃ©ene him, and haue made him to retourne to haue honoured him in his court. Then the King with amorous wordes requested of <hi>Tefereo</hi> to tell him who that Knight was, and he tolde him with a very good wil. And when the king knew that it was the <hi>Greeke</hi> Prince, he receiued great sorow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not doo him the honour, as vnto such a knight appertained. But considering that they could not impute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him anie fault for the lacke thereof, he commaunded that the Knight with the grÃ©ene armour, should be carried vnto the Pallaice, and asked his Knights what he was, &amp; it was tolde him, that he was the Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Torismundo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when the King vnderstoode, that he was a Knight
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13973:107"/>
of so high linage, he commanded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all his Phisitions shuld ioyne together, and prouide all remedies possible for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, and that they should apply no lesse core vnto him, then vnto his owne proper person, the which presently was done, and they did apply the best remedies that could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, till such time as they brought him somewhat to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, although it was with great labour. The prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> when he sawe himselfe in his naked bed, his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe was verye much: and calling to his minde all that which had passed, the very griefe he receiued, was almost the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Tefereo</hi> knew who that Knight was, and that there was no more to be done, without any tarrying he tooke his leaue of the King, and of the Princesse, who wept very sorrowfully at his departure. <hi>Tefereo</hi> tooke the horse of the lame Giaunt, (who with very anger to see himselfe in that pickle, woulde not consent to the receiuing of anye cure, neyther would he eate any thing, but there desperately dyed) and leaping vppon him he went to seeke the Knight of the Sunne. Where we will leaue them: for that I am nowe inforced by the swÃ©ete dartes of <hi>Cupide,</hi> to refresh the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eares of the hearers, and to declare some of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing woundes, and to leaue the furious sword of <hi>Mars</hi> for a while.</p>
               <p>Now to retourne to the storie that is past, whereas if you doo remember, that the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into that barke wherein the Knight was, which would haue forced a Ladye, and how that vpon a sodaine their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes did seperate themselues, so that he lost the sight of his Cousin the Knight of the Sunne, and of <hi>Tefereo,</hi> and bÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entered, he woulde haue made resistaunce against his aduersarie, for to disturbe him, that he should not commit the vyolence that he had offered. But vppon a sodaine they were all vanished, so that he sawe neyther Knight, nor Ladye, nor Marriners, nor yet anye other person, but onely himselfe in the Barke, with his inchaunted Horse,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:108"/>
neither could he sÃ©e who brought him thether: and thinking to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ourne again into the galley whereas his cousin was, he could not finde him: but looking about, he discerned no other thing, but the Element &amp; the water. When the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> sawe himselfe absent from his beloued cousin, his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was very great that he receiued, and began to curse all the wise inchaunters, and all those that doo permit &amp; suffer them, for that they were the occasion that in the world, ther was so much euill done. When this Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> sawe himselfe all alone, and not one with whom he might passe away the time, there came vnto his minde his <hi>Florisdama,</hi> which was the occasion that he tourned to his accustomed sadnesse, and imagining that he was in her presence, he said:
<q>Oh cruell Ladie which dost now reioyce thy selfe, and art at ease in the Kingdome of <hi>Dacia</hi>: art thou fully pleased with these my paines? Art thou now pacified, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast brought me into this extremitie and trouble? wherein, I am in the power of I know not whom, and doo nauigate I cannot tell vpon what. Thy cruell heart I am sure is now content, sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that without desert, for thÃ©e I doo suffer so many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: which as yet I am not certaine, whether thou hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or procured it shuld be so or no. Oh cursed inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how many euills haue you wrought by the help of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells, so that by reason of your inchauntments, many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye Knights are brought into such like troubles as I am. HÃ©ere you may sÃ©e into what extremitie this Magicall arte hath brought me, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I can by no meanes profite my selfe of the strength of these my young armes, but am hÃ©ere in the power of a diuel, who wil ouerthrow this barke: but that which doth most grÃ©eue me, is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am brought into a place to dye, where of my death shall be lefte no memorie, but must die disdained of that cruell Lady.</q>
So with great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and trouble, he passed thrÃ©e dayes, in the end of which, he discouered a very small Iland, which was in the middest of the sea. The barke made thether with great switnesse, so that in a small time he was fast a ground vpon the sande. It was not long after that the Prince leapt a shore, &amp; when
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13973:108"/>
he found himselfe out of the barke, he looked rounde aboute him on euery side. And towards his right hand amongst a company of greene trees, he sawe a small tent armed. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which the prince directed his way, with an easie pace, and entring into the Tent, he sawe no bodye, although hee remayned a while, and hearkened if he coulde heere any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but he could neither heare nor see any thing: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he found the print of a lyttle foote vpon the sand, and hÃ©e had a great desire to know whose footesteps they were, for that they seemed to be of some Lady or Damsell, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trace, he followed them, and the more he went, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto him that the more hast they made, whosoeuer it was that had lefte that signe, which made him more earnest in his desire to see the ende thereof. So long he followed that trace, that in the ende he came vnto a little mountaine, whereas he found scattered about yeolow haire, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be threds of golde: and stooping for to gather them vp, he perceiued that some of them were wet with spots of bloud, whereby he well vnderstoode, the great anger where with they were pulled of from the head. Likewise he saw in diuers places, how the earth was spotted with drops of liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bloud. Then with a more desire then he had before, hÃ©e went vp to the top of that little mountaine, and hauing lost the footsteps, he recouered it by gathering vp y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> golden haire, he had not trauailed farre vp the mountaine, when that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the water side he heard a great complaint, which sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the voice of a woman, and by the faint sound ther of he might well perceiue that they waxed wearie, for that a while they would rest and be still, and straight way wold returne vnto their accustomed sorrow and complaint. And the words (which the Prince did well vnderstande) were these.
<q>Oh loue, now shalt thou no more reioyce, neither haue any longer dominion ouer me, for that gentle death wil shew me so much fauour as to finish these my sorrowfull passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s, and therewith vnloose and frustrate this string of loue, with the which thou hast bounde me, hauing a desire to aske re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement of him, which hath bene the occasion of all this
<pb facs="tcp:13973:109"/>
euill.</q>
I haue asked the same reuengement, but it hath not pleased the Gods to heare my request: nay rather they haue stopped their eares agaynst these my continual complaynts: and with this she helde her peace, giuing a very sorrowfull and terrrible sigh. The Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> tourning his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that place, from whence he heard this comylaint, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered amongst certaine grÃ©ene trÃ©es, a Lady, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with maruailous great beautie. It was so excellent, that it depriued him of his heart, which he neuer thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to haue lost. She was with her haire all about her eares, and meruailously ill intreated by the violence that she vsed against her selfe, and leaning her chÃ©eke vpon her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and white hand, which was all to be spotted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bloud in many places, which was constrained by the scratching of her nayles. The spots was the occasion to dissolue the great passion which the Prince did fÃ©ele for his <hi>Florisdama,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting in his heart, the figure of this heauie and sorrowful Lady: who seeing her of so great beautie, and in such afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ouertaken and wounded with the demeanour of her faire face, and grÃ©eued to sÃ©e her so euill intreated, in such sort, that in a sound he leaned to a grÃ©ene trÃ©e (amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other which were vpon that mountaine) cleane without any remembraunce.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Cupide,</hi> thou bÃ©eing but a boye, why doost thou vse these cruell kinde of feates. Who hath taught thÃ©e to vse such deceits, which is the occasion of great and endlesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes.

How is it possible that thou doost make vs belÃ©eue, that without sÃ©eing thou canst hit so right with thy arrowes, and that with so good an aime thou dost wound wheras thou wilt.

There is not one of vs, that for the feare death will sweare vnto anie thing, but first we wil knowe if the cause be iust, because we will not fall vnto anie crime of that which shall be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto the order of knighthood. So then I doo perceiue said the Gyaunt, that you do not purpose to sweare in any thing except it be first declared vnto you what it is, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof. To the which aunswered <hi>Zoylo,</hi> no. Well hÃ©ere I sweare vnto you by the high Gods (sayd the Gyaunt) that I my selfe alone will bring you all to that staye, that you woulde willingly sweare, but then you shall haue no time. And therewith he drewe out a broade and glistering swoord and flourishing therewith he pressed forwardes, then the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> stepped foorth and requested the other that they would let him alone with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant, the which although it were against their wills, yet they consented to it, and the other putting themselues all on the one side, they beganne againe theyr mortall battaile. The Gyaunt with the greate

furie hÃ©e had, did discharge his blowe, but it was in vaine, for that the Prince did let it slippe by, in such sorte, that hee coulde not strike him, and in putting the blowe aside, hÃ©e cut the sayde Gyaunt vppon one of his legges, and made a wounde, which although it were not greate, yet there ranne out of it verie much bloud. When the Gyaunt did fÃ©ele him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hurt, and that he sawe his bloud runne downe, hee did so kindle in ire, that he let his shÃ©elde fall to the grounde, and laying holde on his greate and broade swoorde, with both his handes he lift it vp, and stroke at the <hi>Dacian,</hi> thinking with that one blowe to haue finished the battaile, but the Prince for that he was nimble and light, did procure straight waies to cleere himselfe from the force thereof, the which he did in such sort, that the swoorde fell downe to the ground, and by reason of the great force and furie wherewith it was discharged, the Gyant was constrained following his blowe to fall likewise downe vpon the earth. HÃ©ere the <hi>Dacian</hi> was not idle, but with both his hands stroke him vpon his strong helme with great courage, and although he could not cut it at that time by reason of the hardnesse, yet it astonished him &amp; brought him out of his remembraunce.

himselfe awaie vppon the sands, and in a trice he was on his feete againe, and went towards the place whereas the Gyant was, with full pretence to strike him such a blowe, that hÃ©e should not be able to make anie more resistance. The Gyant when he sawe him comming woulde haue stroken him, for to disturbe him of his blow, but he could not, for that this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> stroke him such an ouerthwart blowe, that lighting on his foote, he cut it cleane off, and the Gyant chaunced a blow on his helme, that it made the knight to tumble on the sand, the gyant seeing him downe, would haue turned to haue stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him againe, but he could not for the lacke of his foote, for when he thought to firme his foote on the grounde to prease forwards, he could not make a step, but gaue a terrible fall to the ground, and bÃ©eing sore troubled with the wound of his head and other wounds, he yÃ©elded vp the Ghost, and sent his soule to whom it did appertaine. The Pagan people when they sawe their stout Captaine dead, with great showts and shrikes they pressed altogether vpon those foure knightes, but they found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> neither dastards nor cowards, but they gaue them well to vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were of great val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then they ioyned themselues together backe to backe, and stroke such straunge blowes vpon their enimies, and with so great force and furie, that he which had receiued one blowe would not turne to them againe, with great feare they were so scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> being incensed with anger, at the fall that he receiued by the blow of the Gyant, it caused him to claspe his sword fast in his hand, and with double furie he pressed amongest his enimies, that vnhappie he might thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that came to the receit of the first stroke, for that with an ouerthwart blowe, he cutte his head cleane from his shoulders, and returned vnto another, and stroke him vppon the wast, so that it had neere hand parted him in two pÃ©eces, so with such like blowes and feates of knighthood they made them to retire. And at the same time they sawe comming forth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie a great number of knights &amp; gentlemen, which they iudged to be about sixe thousand in an armie, and all on hors backe.

The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie was so great, that by reason of the bolud that ran from them, the water on the sea side was made red, and lost his naturall colour, and being in this conflict, there approached all that great companie that came foorth of the Citie.

The King was very well content and pleased that he had such Knights in his company, &amp; told vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> a great circumstance of treason, cleane contrarie to that it was, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying all the iniurie to be offred vnto himself, mingling his tale with counterfet teares, which caused these Knightes to giue credit vnto his words, in such sort that they did sweare vnto the King all that he would demaund, of the which this traiterous King remained greatly contented, and ordayned for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> very faire &amp; rich chambers to ease the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>selues, with all seruice nÃ©edfull, &amp; likewise for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faire <hi>Lidia,</hi> for he lodged her in the Queenes chamber, &amp; caused many Ladyes and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells to come and beare her companie, and to serue her in all that was necessarie, for that he perceiued how the Prince <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno</hi> did receiue great pleasure therein. In the end of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayes that these Knights had soiourned with the King, there came one and aduertised the King, how that ther was arriued in the port of the Citie, a faire ship, and how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther descended out of her a Knight, and a well proportioned Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt: and by reason that they would not hearken vnto the accustomed oath, which they that didde arriue there shoulde sweare, that there was begun a meruailous and stout bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, with them that did keepe the Port, wherein the knight did meruailous &amp; worthy feates, and likewise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giant.

brought vnto them very faire and strong horses, which the King had commaunded to giue them, and mounting on their backs, in great hast they went out of the Citie to the hauen side, to the same place whereas they fought theyr owne bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, whereas they founde these two knights with no lesse rigor &amp; furie, then they themselues were before. So straight way, three of those Knights did knowe, who that Knight &amp; Gyant was, which were in battaile, &amp; sayd, that it was <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerindo</hi> and the King of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> whom I told you depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Greece</hi> in the quest of the Emperour, and by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune they were driuen into those parts, for that the King might haue more ayde for to execute his tyranny. Then the valyant <hi>Zoylo</hi> pulled off his helme and sayd. What is the matter valyaunt Prince, that you show your selfe so furious against him, which in all poynts is redy to be at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. At which words, the Prince lift vp his eyes, and when he behelde those thrÃ©e Princes and knewe them, he very much meruailed to see them, and lefte off his battel, and so likewise did <hi>Bramidoro,</hi> and all thrÃ©e w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their armes abroad, came to imbrace him. And <hi>Clauerindo</hi> saide, It had not gone very well with vs in this conflict, if these knights had not knowen vs, and in saying these wordes, he threwe his armes about their neckes with great ioye that he recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to sÃ©e them: and with no lesse ioye and pleasure all the rest did showe themselues &amp; sayd.

The blowe was not so soone past when that the Emperour rose bolt vpright, and cast such a thrust at the horse breast, that his sword entered in vp to the hiltes. The horse when he felt himselfe hurt, gaue a leape into the aire with so great swiftnes, as though it had bene a whirlewinde, and in the ende, he fell downe to the earth with great force, &amp; in his fall, he caught y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Earles leg vnder him, in such sort, that he could not by any meanes arise.

Then all the people that were there, both them a foote &amp; those on horsebacke, with great showts and shrikes they would haue set vpon him: but they could not come nigh him at their wil, for that the dead horse was betwÃ©ene them: &amp; againe, the Earle was a shield for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who was prisoner vnder his horse right before him.

O cruell <hi>Cupide,</hi> wilt thou nowe beginne to vse thy accustomed mallice. O false tyrant, I can neuer talke in these or suche lyke matters, but thou art alwayes at hande.

And when they came vnto the Pallaice, the QuÃ©ene commanded that there should be giuen him a meruailous faire and rich lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Thus bÃ©eing verie pensiue and sore troubled, for that she was constrained to commaund that which her heart would not consent vnto, she went her selfe close vnto the doore to sÃ©e if she might comfort her selfe with the sight of her prisoner and captiue, and she chanced to come the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The QuÃ©ene which was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening vnto all that which the Emperour sayde, was not so much kindeled with the loue of the Emperour before, but nowe it increased without measure, when shee heard and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode what hÃ©e was, and if it had not bÃ©ene for the respect of her estate, out of all doubt shÃ©e had entered in where as the Emperour was, but brideling her owne will, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what an euill reporte shÃ©e shoulde haue amongest her subiectes, if they should by anie meanes attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof.

to be some other thing, he arose vpon his fÃ©ete, and tooke his swoorde in his hande (for the QuÃ©ene woulde neuer consent that his swoorde should be taken from him,) and when hÃ©e sawe that it was the quÃ©ene, he did quiet himselfe, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling his anger in the best wise he coulde,
the QuÃ©ene drew neere vnto the Emperour, and dissembling what shÃ©e had heard, she saluted him and sayde.<q> Gentle knight, howe doo you fÃ©ele your selfe of your passed trauaile. To whom he answered, I can make no other answere, most mightie La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but the verie same which you your self may think, if you were prisoner, especially for such an occasion, as you ought rather to receiue fauour and camfort, and therefore I cannot but muse at your highnesse, knowing in howe little fault I am, that you set me not at libertie, but I doo well see that you are a Damosell and subiect vnto the will of your subiectes, for looke what they ordaine you dare not resist against them, therefore faire Ladie I dooe desire you if you pretend to set mÃ©e at libertie (as by promise and iustice you are bound) let it bÃ©e out of hand, and if anie of your subiects will say to the contrarie, I request the acceptation of the battaile for the defence of my right, with eight or tenne, or if they will, with twentie of the best in all your kingdome, and I doubt not but in mine owne person against them al, to deliuer my selfe from this enthralled perill: vnto whom the queene answered with a verie good grace. I dooe well vnderstande gentle Knight, that the highnesse of your heart cannot suffer such straight imprisonment, as well for that which I haue seene of thee, as also for that which I haue heard. So likewise thou maist well belÃ©eue, that which I haue done, hath bene partly to content my subiects and people, for that this euill hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out vpon the person of the most mightiest man amongest them, and of this be you assured, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thing which you would haue done, and so much desire, shal not be done, onely for that you are without faulte, although they charge you with it greatly, but also for that thou art Father vnto that excellent knight of the Sunne, whome in this my Ilande they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for one of the most high and souereigne Gods, as a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13973:120"/>
restorer of the same, and againe, that it is not decent that so high and mightie an Emperour shuld in this Iland be so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously intreated, as that his cause should be determined by the tearmes of iustice, vnto whome not onely they, but the whole world, willingly ought to serue, for that thou art an Emperour, and father vnto such a sonne. The Emperour was verie sore troubled when he perceiued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the which this faire Ladie marking, went forwardes in her talke, and sayd: Doe not vexe your selfe, neither bÃ©e anye whit troubled (most mightie Prince) for that you are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, considering that of such a one as thou art it is reason we doo estÃ©eme, according to thy desert, neither can my captiue heart consent vnto anie other thing but the exalting of thy honour. Alasse what shall I saie, who hath receiued most wrong for their imprisonment, it hath bene onely my christal breast and captiued heart, they haue wronged thy bodie but for a time, but me, loue hath bereaued of my former libertie, in wounding my hart, so that it is almost vncurable. In this (my good Lord) you may vnderstand that I a lone am shÃ©e which hath the greatest wrong. Thou valiaunt Emperour hast taken awaie from the Earle of <hi>Modique</hi> his sonne, but thou hast robbed me (most infortunate) of my heart. Oh how much better had it bene for me to haue bene pertaker with him of death, then now to liue, not knowing what cruel loue will doo. Oh immortall Gods, how is it that you haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that the tender hart of a poore damsell, bÃ©eing alwaies willing to offer vnto you sacrifices, and exercising of my self daily in your seruice, and now in payment of all this, you haue permitted it to be sacrificed vnto the cruell will of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide,</hi> who hath forcibly pearced my feeble heart with his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious darts. I beseech thÃ©e (O Emperour) doe not denie mÃ©e this my vnreasonable demaund, although thou sÃ©est it so far to exceed the meane. Oh virginitie, thou maist well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto a rose, which so long as the leaues are reserued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

This king did determine with himselfe to marrie with the QuÃ©ene, eyther by fayre meanes, or else by force, and for to put this his pretence in practise, hÃ©e sent vnto her his messengers, and for a more maiestie, hÃ©e made his owne brother Lord Embassodour.

Oh mightie <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> how well thou hast payed thy selfe for the great curtesie which thou hast showed vs, in giuing vs for our Ladyes and gouernours, the fairest damosels in the world.

And with this determination, they gaue him for aunswere, that the Queene was not intended to marrie as yet: so that if hÃ©e pleased to tarrie the time he might, if not, he might doo as he thought best, and that they would not let, but defende the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Lady and QuÃ©ene.</p>

Then this faire <hi>Garrofilea</hi> arose vp from her bed with a desperate determination, which the force of loue inforced her to practise, and couering her selfe with a very rich robe, she tooke a sword which had bene the King her Fathers,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:123"/>
and put it vnder her lefte arme, and in her right hande shÃ©e carried a light that she might the better finde the dore, the which she opened as softly as was possible, at such time as the Emperor, was very fast a slÃ©epe, and when she saw that he did not heare her entering in, she went vnto the beddes side, with the light in her hand, that she might contemplate her selfe in beholding the graue and faire face of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and vnto her it sÃ©emed that in all the world there was not such another, nor that there could be any greater thing to be desired, then that which her heart did require. In this sort she was beholding him a great while, vntill such time, as the sorrowfull sighes <hi>Garrofilea</hi> set, caused the Emperor to awake, and when he saw the QuÃ©ene, he was very much amazed, and would haue risen vp, whereto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> QuÃ©ene would not consent, but caused him to lye still, and setting the light vpon a table which was in the chamber, she came and sate her downe vpon the bed by the Emperour, and shedding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares of perfect and true loue, she sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My Lord, I wold very faine know what thou dost pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend towards me, most vnfortunate QuÃ©ene, wounded with the darte of <hi>Cupide,</hi> onely by the sight of thy excÃ©eding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage. For knowing it, with thy aunswere I woulde put in order, that which I haue to doo, concerning this my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable life. I doo well know my Lord and Emperour, that this my bolde discouering of my selfe, hath bene too much, and beyond all reason: but if at any time thou hast loued, and doost know the great griefe that loue doth cause, thou wilt not blame me, nor put me in any fault: &amp; I would y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I could show thÃ©e my wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded hart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in sÃ©eing it so sore afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thou mightst take some compassion of me, &amp; that which doth most torment me, is, that I haue yÃ©elded my selfe vnto one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath so little pitie on me. Who hath euer heard, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men shuld wooe &amp; require of men to loue them? But I most vnfortunate QuÃ©ene, haue broken that lawe and custome. O immortal Gods, what haue you conceiued against me? Is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apparant which you vsed against my sister, &amp; now wil you vse it also w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me. I shuld be requested of Emperours &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13973:124"/>
Kings: and now I come to request one, that maketh no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of me, neither dooth my present destruction mooue him to any pittie. Go too Emperour, make an ende and aunswere me, that therewith I may receiue either life or death.</q>
HÃ©ere may you, which haue knowen what loue is, iudge what the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> might conceiue in himselfe, in this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell case. One way he did consider the great loyaltie that he ought vnto the Empres his wife: and this constrained him to deny her. Another way, the great desire that hÃ©e had to see himselfe at libertie, and the great loue that he did know <hi>Garrofilea</hi> bare him, caused his hart somewhat to yÃ©eld.
Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, he did procure with faire and swÃ©ete wordes, to sÃ©e if he could cause her to chaunge her thought and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose saying,<q> Lady, I doo sÃ©e very well, that the force of loue is so cruell, that whosoeuer he doth wound, he leueth them in a manner without remedye, except it come from them, on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they haue fixed their heart. I doo not deny, but that your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous desire is such as he hath ordained it, who spareth no creature. But considering your highnesse and great estate, &amp; the honour that all such as you are, shoulde haue by your royall marriages, I doo more reioyce that you suffer payne, then you should take your ease with that, vnto which sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue doth constraine you. Most souereigne QuÃ©ene, hÃ©ere I doo desire you, to bridle your affection, and restrayne your appetite, that you fall not into that infamie, which will bÃ©e the onely blemish of your estate, sÃ©eing it appertaineth so much vnto your honour.</q>
The quÃ©ene sÃ©eing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his reasons did not incline vnto that which she desired, shortened his talk, &amp; said:<q> Emperour, all that which thou hast sayde, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that thou canst tell me, I doo already vnderstand, and there is nothing that may be spoken hÃ©erein, but I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time considered of it. Notwithstanding, loue hath more force, then any regard or consideration I should haue vnto my honour. Therefore I am hÃ©ere come, fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make a second sacrifice vnto my gods, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards shall be lamented by thÃ©e.</q>
And in saying those words, she tooke out the sworde which she brought in secret vnder
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13973:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her roabes, and with great hast she set the pommell thereof vnto the ground, and would haue throwen her self vpon the poynt thereof. The worthy <hi>Trebatio</hi> seeing her in this des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate minde, leapt quickly out of his bed, and with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie courage caught holde of her, and tooke the sword out of her hand, saying: Oh blinde quÃ©ene, what diuelish determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is this? The Lady answered, Unlouing Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not longer liue, as one dying. And saying these words, she fell in a sound in the armes of the Emperour. Heere coulde not the stoutnesse of the Greeke heart make such resistance, but that with great loue he tooke her, and cast her vppon the bed, shedding many teares with much compassion, and considering the firmnesse of the loue that the Queene hadde showed him, he was confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded in his owne thought, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to haue done that which hee neuer thought to haue done, and so purposed to giue her all her whole contentment: and so ioyning his mouth to hers, he remained kissing her till such time as this sorrowfull Lady came againe to her selfe. But when she perceiued she was of him so louinglye imbraced, being the thing she onely desired, she straight-way recouered all the strength that she had lost, and cast her armes about his necke with excÃ©eding loue, which grieued not the Emperour any thing at all: &amp; in such sort they vsed themselues, that the Queene was made Lady, with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment vnto them both. So with like sport they passed the rest of the night, in great ioye and pleasure. The QuÃ©ene <hi>Garrofilea</hi> when she saw that it was day, returned vnto her chamber very pleasant &amp; merrie, vntill such time as it was her accustomed houre of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> made very great hast that they might enter into the Citie, the which was straight waye done. And the QuÃ©ene brought with her the Emperour, and made him to sweare to be her true prisoner, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thence without her will and leaue. So the quÃ©ene tooke the Emperour by the hand, &amp; in this order they went out of the Pallaice: The Earle of <hi>Modique</hi> when he sawe
<pb facs="tcp:13973:125"/>
this, could not choose, but receiue great griefe, but he did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it, for that he considered, that in such extremitie, so valiant a Knight was nÃ©edfull, and so altogether they ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Citie. The QuÃ©ene was very gallant and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt, whereat all her subiects receiued great delight, and in the chiefe strÃ©ete of the Citie, there was erected the Images of two Knights, made all of stone, of a maruelous good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and they had ouer them a couer like a Tabernacle, very rich and well wrought, because the water shoulde not fall vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, nor any other thing to hurt them. As soone as the Emperour saw those figures, he knew that the one was the Image, of his sonne without reading of the supercrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but when he came nigh vnto it, he read the same, which sayd<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
                  <hi>This is the great Prince of Grecia, called the Knight of the Sunne, restorer of the auncient kingdome of Tinacria, &amp; the abater and breaker of the strength of the most strongest Giants in all the world.</hi> And going a little farther, he sawe vpon the other Knight this title: <hi>Prince Eleno of Dacia, cousin vnto the most valiant sonnes of Trebatio, the well-spring of all our quietnesse.</hi> Upon this he looked with great affection, and earnest desire to sÃ©e his perfect personage. The QuÃ©ene did well vnderstand the great ioye that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour receiued, in beholding the figure of his sonne, and of his brothers sonne: for which cause she commanded that to be told publikely, which was spoken in secret: &amp; then entred into the QuÃ©enes pallaice, and the Emperour was carryed into a verie faire and rich lodging, whereas by force hÃ©e must be shut in, to make as if he were prisoner, for that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Realme, would not consent that he shoulde goe abroade at his will. The third daie following, this braue <hi>Bramarando</hi> with all his Knights, came before the walls of the Citie, and spred abroad their Ancients: and he himselfe vpon a fierce horse, drew towards the walls of the Citie in great hast. He was armed with very strong armour, and had at his necke hanging a verie rich horne of Iuorie, and when he came to the gate of the Citie, he lifte vp the visour of his helme and set his horne vnto his mouth, &amp; began to sound it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13973:125"/>
very strongly, to the end that the knights of the Citie shuld come thether to heare what he would say. So when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> some of them, such as were nÃ©ere at hand, approched, he sayd.
<q>O you Knights of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> whom the souereigne Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, that according as I am informed, by your counsell, I cannot inioy as mine owne that faire <hi>Garrofilea.</hi> What doo you, that you come not forth with your armor agaynst me? and show your selues if you be as valiant to ouercome, as politike to giue counsel.</q>
Some of the nobles of the court, did well heare what this Pagan did say, and straight waye, they went vnto the QuÃ©ene, for to sÃ©e what was to be done in this case, to whome she aunswered.
<q>My friends, you dooe well sÃ©e and vnderstand, how little knowledge I haue in such matters, bÃ©eing but a weake and fraile woman: in such a case as this is, vnto you it belongeth to take counsell, for that you are knights, and together you may establish that, which is conuenient, for hÃ©erin I haue little knowledge and can say almost nothing: </q>and with this she held her peace. These Earles, sÃ©eing that with great reason the QuÃ©ene had answered them, they would argue no farther with her, but called a counsell.
At which time, the King the second time did sound his horne, to call them again to hearken vnto his speach: and being attendant vnto that which he would say, he vttered these wordes. O vile <hi>Tinacrians,</hi> what doo you, why come you not forth with your armour?
<q>How is it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you are not ashamed to hide your selues from one onely knight, which calleth you. HÃ©ere I doo promise you, that your high walls and dÃ©epe dithes which you haue about your Cittie, shall litle profit you, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you shal all dye in my hands lyke vile knights. And if amongst you ther be not one that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make his partie good in the field with mÃ©e alone. Then come forth two, or three, or foure, or ten, for that altogether I will driue you out of the field: and if these te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:126"/>
The Earles did heare all that was spoken, at which word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they were very much grieued, but because they knewe the strength of the <hi>African,</hi> they feared much his furie, but yet shame would not suffer them to beare the force of these wordes, but did determine to goe out and take the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which the Pagan did offer them. So amongst them al they chose ten of them that were most estÃ©emed: who wer, the Earle of <hi>Modique,</hi> and a sonne of the Earles, a valyant young man, being of fewer yeares, then he which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour slewe at the marble fountaine, and <hi>Fabiniano</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and <hi>Robio</hi> of <hi>Yscla,</hi> and other sixe chosen Knights. So when they were armed and vpon horsebacke, they opened the gate of the Citie, and they went out into the fielde, all very well horsed. So when this King of <hi>Mauritania</hi> sawe them, he let goe his horne, and putte downe the visour of his healme, &amp; called for a great speare, which strayght waye was giuen him by a Knight of his, and with great arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, he went towards the place, whereas this faire companie of the ten Knights abode, and with a loude voyce he sayde that they might heare him, Who gaue you counsel to make resistaunce against my furie, for that you can finde no other thing therein but death. Then <hi>Don Rubio</hi> aunswered, none other: but onely to abate thy pride, therefore take thy choyce of the fielde, for hÃ©ere I defie thÃ©e to the death. All this while <hi>Bramarando</hi> stood and beheld him with a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble looke, and sÃ©eing him vse so great nimblenesse, he thought him to be a good Knight, &amp; giuing a tourne vnto his horse, he put himselfe into his place, and bÃ©eing both readye, they spurred their horses together, &amp; ranne one against the other, &amp; in the midst of their course they met, &amp; neither of them mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their blow, in the which incounnter this gentle <hi>Rubio</hi> fell downe to the ground, and the Pagan somwhat stooped in his saddle, and his speare remained whole, and strayght waye he put himselfe in good order. But when he saw that all the rest which remained, did prepare themselues to make resistaunce, he could not refrayne but with a loude voyce, he sayde.</p>

The Emperour when he saw them he would straight of his owne good will haue armed himselfe and haue gone out into the field, but the queene would not consent vnto it, but they passed that night together with great ioy and pleasure, which was so much, that I dare not hÃ©ere with my pen declare it, but of this I am sure, that when the QuÃ©ene departed from the Emperour she remained with child, as hÃ©ereafter you shal heare.

This stout Pagan which at that time was at his rest, was sore troubled, and could not imagine who that knight might be, which was so arrogant, that he durst alone call him into the fielde, and desiring to knowe what he was that was so hardie, he caused to bÃ©e brought before him the Earle of <hi>Mondeli,</hi> &amp; the Earles sonne of <hi>Modique,</hi> and with an irefull voice said.

This <hi>Mauritanian</hi> was so inflamed with wrath, that he had no minde to shew anie agilitie with his Speare, but rather with a wrathfull voice hÃ©e sayde: I doo beleeue that with the flourishing of thy Speare &amp; braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy horse thou thinkest to scarre me, hauing spoken words that could not be vttered but by some foolish man, or by some knight of little estimation, or by some one that is enimie vnto <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The Emperour answered: so much thou maist saie, that thou maist happen vppon the truth, and hÃ©ere I giue thÃ©e to vnderstand, that I am a Christian and seruaunt vnto my Lorde Iesu Christ, and enimie vnto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> and much more vnto thÃ©e, therfore make thy selfe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the battaile, and take that part of the field which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth thÃ©e, &amp; I will make thÃ©e to knowe what my Speare can dooe. The furie of the Pagan was such, that he was almost without all fÃ©eling, yet he comforted himselfe in thinking to make reuengement of the wordes which he had sayde, and had a greate desire to knowe who that knight was which with so greate hardinesse and courage did speake vnto him, and hÃ©e asked it of him, saying: Knight, hÃ©ere I doo giue thÃ©e lisence to speake all that thou wilt, for that thou art now in place where none can deliuer thee from my hands but onely <hi>Mahomet,</hi> neuerthelesse I doo desire thÃ©e by that God in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> thou sayst thou dooest beleeue, and that so truely &amp; vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou dooest serue, that thou tell me who thou art, whereby I may know what he was that hath ben so arrogant against me.

His horse with great lightnesse lept on the one side, whereby this valiant. <hi>Trebatio</hi> was cleare of that

And when he saw himselfe so euill intreated by that Pagan, he recouered again his sword, and clasping it fast in his fist, he discharged vpon the Moore so strong and terrible a blowe, that he made him without all remembraunce to fall backwards vpon the horse crupper, and ther issued out of his helme very much bloud, which proceeded out of his mouth and nose, and sÃ©eing him in this traunce, he sayd, I sweare by God, King, that thou hast small remembraunce, but tarrye a little, and I will make thÃ©e remember thy selfe better, and giuing a turne vnto his horse, thinking to cut off the pagans head, his tourning was with such great hast, that his horse doubled in such sort, that he fell to the ground with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour on his backe, neuerthelesse with great lightnes, with out putting his foote into the stirrop, he lept into the saddle again.

The Moore had well thought at that time that he had finished his work, &amp; with great shouts &amp; shriks he followed him, but all his thought was in vaine. For y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> the Emperour recouered &amp; setled himselfe in his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, and when he saw himselfe so ill intreated, ther was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Tiger of <hi>Hircania,</hi> nor any other wilde beast so furious as he was at this time, with his great anger. Yea, he was so vexed with himselfe, that with the madnesse thereof, hÃ©e crushed his tÃ©eth together, and tourning his horse about a great deale lighter, then at any other time, he firmed well his swoorde in his hand, and lifting vp his mightie &amp; strong arme, went whereas this <hi>Morisco</hi> king was, who in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like sorte came towards him, at that time the Emperour neither remembred life nor death, nor anie other thing, but to take reuengment on his enimie, procuring to bring him to cruell death, and raising himselfe vp a good spanne in his saddle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmed in his stirrops, he strake such a blowe, that at the fall of his mightie cutting sworde, the sparkles of fire flew into the aire, and it lighted on the Pagans healme, so that all the strength thereof did little profite him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour sÃ©eing their vilianie, begun to reuile them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words, and retourning towards them, he made them to

runne awaie like vile cowards. Unhappie was he that hÃ©e stroke, although it were but with halfe a blowe, for it made him that he had smal minde to returne againe, but by reason that they were verie sorrowfull and angrie for the losse of their king, many of them did strike at him on euerie side, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to defend themselues, and not to come nigh his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes. The Emperour then remembring that if he did not procure to come whereas the prisoners were to set them at libertie, that it wer possible that they would intreat them euill. Wherfore he put himselfe among the thickest of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, wounding and killing all that he found in his waye, and all that he could ouertake, although his armour were as hard as Diamonds, yet he could not escape from the death, so in this sort in spite of all the Pagans he came vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings tent, and sÃ©eing that there ioyned together much people to make resistaunce at the entering, it gaue him the more desire to enter into the tent, not knowing that the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> were there prisoners. The <hi>Mauritanians</hi> with all their powers they had made resistaunce, but their strength did little auaile them, for in spite of them all the Emperour went into the Tent, whereas he met with the Earle of <hi>Modique,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Mondeli,</hi> who were put there in prison. At this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time <hi>Don Rubio</hi> of <hi>Tinacria</hi> when he sawe that the Moore of <hi>Africa</hi> was ouercome, and the great villanie of his knights, he made great hast to goe out of the Citie, and with eight hundred knights, all verie well armed, they pressed on their enimies with so great force, that they made them looke better about them, then before that time they did. When the Emperour sawe the diligence of this knight <hi>Rubio,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to set the prisoners at libertie, the which thing bÃ©eing done, he sayde vnto the Earles sonne of <hi>Modique.</hi> Gentle knight, this succour doo you receiue and your honourable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in recompence of the great griefe which I caused you to receiue, and without speaking anie more words he returned vnto the battaile which was verie much increased, but when he came amongst them it was quickly brought to an end, for by reason that they had no gouernour to gouerne them, and
<pb facs="tcp:13973:133"/>
that the furie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> GrÃ©eke was not to be suffered, they durst not abide, but with great shame they began to runne away, Then those of <hi>Tinacria</hi> did follow them till they came to the sea side, killing and wounding all that euer they coulde come by. So when the Emperour saw that all this conflict was brought to a good end, and that the valiant <hi>Rubio</hi> was by him, he called him vnto him and sayd. My friend, go and tell your Mistres the QuÃ©ene, that I request her to pardon me, for that I doo not retourne againe into her Citie, for I was so ill receiued the first time, that I haue no will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne the second. And more, I desire her of my part, that she doo intreate better, and giue better intertainment vnto such Knights as I am, then she gaue vnto me, least she get vnto her selfe the name of a wrathfull QuÃ©ene, and be accounted as one subiect vnto hir own opinion: &amp; of all other things, if any thing doo chaunce, let her thanke none but her selfe, for that she hath bene the onely cause therof. And moreouer, I doo desire her not to trouble her selfe in sending to sÃ©eke me, for that I say, not her power alone, but all the power in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> is not sufficient to retourne me againe into so great straights, as once she had me in. And so without any more speaking he spurred his horse, and rode a reasonable pace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sea side, which was not farre from that place, and when he came thether, he sought to sÃ©e if he could finde by chance any barke or galley, to carry him whether he wold, with his good will or els by force. He had not gone farre, when that he sawe a very faire and great barke at the sea side, hard aboord the shoare. The Emperour entered into it to sÃ©e if there were anye marriners: his horse which was hard by him, without being constrained by the Emperour, very lightly leapt into the Barke. He was not so soone with in, when that the Barke began to make waye, in such sorte, that in a small time they were very farre at sea. At y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> which the Emperour was greatly amazed: but there was a voice, which did satisfie him, that sayd: <hi>Mightie Trebatio, Lyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeo doth gouerne thee</hi>: at the which the Emperour was very ioyfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:13973:133"/>So he put his horse in a place by himselfe in the bark, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he found sufficient of all things nÃ©edefull. Likewise hÃ©e found all that was conuenient for his owne person, which was ready vpon a table in very good order, all kinde of dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed meates: and bÃ©eing set downe to eate, he was serued so bountifully, and with so great diligence and care, as though he had bene in <hi>Greece.</hi> In this sort the emperour went sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eight dayes, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of which he discouered land, which had belonging vnto it, a faire hauen or port, and nigh vnto it, a very faire and great Citie.

Then she made signes with her hands that they should depart and leaue her all alone, whose commandement they straight wayes obeyed, not without great sorrow of all them that did beholde her, for that the quÃ©ene was meruailouslye well beloued of her subiects.

When the queene sawe that her kingdome was so honourably nobled more then at other times, she commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that vpon the gates of her royall pallace should be placed a title, which was conteined in these words following.</p>

               <p>And when all this was finished, she straight way dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a messenger to <hi>Grecia,</hi> with a letter vnto the Emperour, the which she sent by a damsel that was verie trustie &amp; one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she loued well, whereas now I will leaue them till time doo serue for to tell you of the knight of the Sun. But first for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is necessarie to this our historie, we will declare what <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldoro</hi> said, when he knew of the death of <hi>Bramarando</hi> his brother, king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who bÃ©eing certified by them y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> escaped aliue out of the hands of the <hi>Tinacrians,</hi> and wer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sorrowful for the losse of their Lord and king, and landing in their owne countrie they went and carried the newes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> the which when he heard, he felt in himselfe so great paine &amp; sorrow, that in a sound he leaned himself vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a chaire because he would not fall, he was so farre beside himselfe, in which trance he did not long indure, but came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his remembraunce, and wish a terrible and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full voice he sayde: Is it of truth that my brother is dead, and the messengers aunswered and sayde, that it was too true. Oh traitours, aunswered this fierce young man, how durst you come before me, except first you had taken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13973:137"/>
of his death. Then they aunswered and sayd. He y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> did kill him, is not a man so soone to take reuengement of, for that after that we were clÃ©ere of his diuellish furie, it was tolde vs that he was a christian and the Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi> called <hi>Trebatio.</hi> Oh vile people, aunswered the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, yet will you replie against my words, get you out of my sight, if it were not but that I am letted for lacke of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of knighthood, I would with my owne handes teare you all to pÃ©eces. Oh false <hi>Mahomet,</hi> thou lyar, periured, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all faith, is this the honour that my brother should haue out of <hi>Tinacria</hi>: to be abated and slaine by one alone christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and in saying these wordes he entered into a chamber, where he had the Image of <hi>Mahomet</hi> all of golde, with twelue Angells on both sides, this youth tooke a heauie club and with both his handes he stroke this poore God such a blowe vpon the head, that he made him to fal to the ground, and not resting with this, he tourned against them that bare him companie, &amp; stroke on them so many blowes, that in a thousand pÃ©eces he made them fall to the ground, and sayde. O thou false traitour, heere wil I giue thÃ©e thy paiment and reward for that which thou hast done vnto my beloued bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. HÃ©ere I doo forsake and denie thÃ©e, and all them that do belÃ©eue in thÃ©e, for that I wil neither belÃ©eue in thÃ©e nor serue thee, but if I did knowe the waie vnto the place, where as the diuell hath thÃ©e, I woulde goe and sÃ©eke thÃ©e, to giue thÃ©e to vnderstand that my furie is more then thy power. And when he had concluded with this, he went foorth of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and with a terrible noise he called for his armour, the which was straight waie brought vnto him, and without tarrying to bÃ©e made knight, he commaunded to arme him, with armour that was all white, &amp; made by art Magick, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he commanded a ship to be made readie &amp; furnished, &amp; entred into it, with intent to go to <hi>Grecia,</hi> and there to aske the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of knighthoode of the Emperour, &amp; when he had receiued it, to defie him to mortall battaile, but it chaunced not vnto him as he thought it would, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the sea with some of his accustomed torments carried him vnto the coast of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13973:138"/>
by reason of his small patience, once bÃ©eing a land, he would not retourne to imbarke himselfe in his ship, but remained with onely two lackeyes, and commaunded the vessell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe againe, and so went traueling whether his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would carrie him two dayes. The third day very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning, he heard a great rushing of armour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst a company of trÃ©es, &amp; going towards the same noise, he saw a Knight of a very good proportion agaynst a great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So beeing in this cholar, the night drew on, which constrayned him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light from his horse, and sate him downe vnder a greene tree, hauing set his horse to feede in the grÃ©ene grasse, of the

And so he went fÃ©eling &amp; following that pittering sound of water, vntill such time as he found a little fountaine of very faire and clÃ©ere water, and by reason of the great drought that he had, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more tarrying, he knÃ©eled downe to drinke thereof, till such time as he had mitigated his great thirst, and remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there a while to refresh himselfe, for that the place was very pleasaunt: so after a while, he returned vnto the place whereas he was before, and layd himselfe downe to rest. He had not remained there long, but he felt the water to begin to worke in him: For you shall vnderstand, that this was one of the fountaines of <hi>Marlin,</hi> which he made in that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, and brought the water, from the high mountayne of <hi>Olympo.</hi> But this fountaine whereof the Knight of the Sunne did drinke, was that of <hi>Disamore,</hi> or without loue.

                  <q>Oh base and grose vnderstanding, in what didst thou set thy loue? What beautie didst thou see in her, that thou wouldst follow her, as one lost for her loue? What blindnesse hath constrained thÃ©e, considering the great valour of the royall Empresse, and with what liberalitie she hath surrendred all her Kingdomes, and her owne person into thy hands. </q>These and other like complaints he made against himselfe, without taking any sleepe or rest, but was sore troubled with this thought, till such time as the morning came, and that <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> with his golden beames couered all the earth, then hÃ©e tooke his horse with a more lighter heart, and clÃ©erer of all thoughts, then at the time he came thether: for that he had as cleane forgot <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> as though he had neuer sÃ©ene her.
So all that daye he trauelled in that wildernesse, not knowing which way to take: and had eaten nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he any thing to eate, the which did trouble him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much. So when night drewe on, he discouered a heard of cattell, which were there fÃ©eding in the wildernesse, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to goe towards that place whereas the heard men were, who receiued him very well. This Knight did aske of them, if they had any thing to giue him to eate, for that hÃ©e was very hungrie: the heard men bad him that he should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and that they would giue him of such as they had for themselues. So he alighted &amp; did eate with a very good will, and so good a stomacke, as one which had not his heart nor minde occupied with the cares of loue, and there with those heard men, he passed all that night, till it was morning. So when it was daye one of the heard men did bring him into a very great &amp; occupied way, to whom he gaue great thanks. Then the Knight tooke that waye forwards, which led him towards <hi>Prouince,</hi> intending to sÃ©e if he could mÃ©et with his friend, and did determine to trauaile thereabouts, to sÃ©e if Fortune would bring him that waye: he had not trauailed farre, when that he discouered another way, which did crosse ouerthwart the same way, in which he was. And studying with himselfe which waye to take, it was tolde him that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13973:140"/>
it was the waye which led strayght vnto <hi>Paris</hi>: of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> which he was very ioyfull, and remained a while, thinking which way he might take for to finde <hi>Tefereo.</hi> And beeing in this muse, he heard towards his right side a great rushing of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and armed Knights, and casting his head on the one side, he saw that there was about a ten knights which came running towards him with their speares very low, calling him traytor: as soone as the Knight of the Sunne saw them he put downe the visor of his helme, and layd hand on his sword: and at the same time, he beheld on the other side, as many moe Knights armed, which made towards him as the other did. In the ende he was compassed rounde about on euery side with fortie Knights, which all cried out saying, kill the traytor, let the traytor dye, of the which the Prince did greatly meruayle. So altogether they set vpon him, and ranne at him with their speares, and stroke him all at once, yet for all that, he mooued no more in his saddle, then if they had made their incounter against a strong Tower: but at the passing by, he stroke one of them vpon the visour of his helme, that he cut halfe his head a sunder, and he fell dead to the ground. All the rest retourned with their horses against the Prince, some with their swords in their hands, and other some, whose speares remayned whole, ranne at him againe, what on the one side and what on the other, they made a very fierce and strong incounter, as of those which were the whole choyce of them that were in the Citie, onelye to kill him. When the Prince sawe himselfe so inclosed on euerye side, his wrath and anger began to kindle in him, insomuch that he tooke his sword fast in his hand, &amp; stroke such blowes, that whosoeuer he chaunced to hitte, was either slayne or maymed.</p>
               <p>At this present time arriued in those partes at the Sea side, as I haue tolde you, <hi>Brufaldoro:</hi> and this was the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, wherein he sawe so many Knightes against one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Knight. This Moore did stande and beholde them, and was verye much amazed to see the power of one Knight, who brought so many as they were, into such great distres,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:141"/>
which made them to repent and were verie sorrie that euer they began that enterprise, but by reason that they were all chosen knightes, they would not but assault him verie fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was the occasion of their farther harme &amp; destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that the Princes<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> ire did so much increase, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to double his blowes, in such sorte, that some he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out right, and some he wounded, that in a small time he left not one vpon his horse, but all brought vnto the state that they could make no resistaunce, and when the Prince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>awe himselfe at more libertie, he demaunded what was the occasion of this so sodaine conflict, so one of those knightes which was verie sore hurt, tolde him how that they were knights belonging to the Earle of <hi>Prouince,</hi> which laye in waite for him to be reuenged of the death of his sonne, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole circumstance of the battaile came vnto his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So the Prince left them, and woulde not speake anye word more vnto them, but his intent was to get him out of the Countrie, for that he well vnderstood that neither he nor <hi>Tefereo</hi> should haue anie good intertainment at their hands, and when he would haue departed, there came vnto him <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> and did salute him verie curteously, the Prince did returne him his salutation, and had a great pleasure to beholde his good grace and gentilitie. So the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan first to speake and sayd. Gentle and valiant knight, the first boone or gift that euer I did demaund since the time that I was borne, is this that I will aske of thÃ©e, and the occasion which doeth driue me to aske it, is constrained by the great valour and prowesse which I haue seene in thÃ©e, &amp; sure it is an easie thing on thy part to be fulfilled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doo desire thÃ©e to graunt me my request. The heroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Grecian</hi> which had his eyes fixed vpon him, with great pleasure that he receiued at his gentle disposition, answered: As yet I neuer denyed anie thing that was demaunded of mÃ©e, being iustly demaunded and in a iust cause, neither had I anie respect whether it be easie to be done, or difficult, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tle knight aske whatsoeuer pleseth thÃ©e, for if it stand with iustice and reason, that I may graunt it thÃ©e, I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

                  </gap>rupulositie. For heere I doo sweare vnto thÃ©e by my mightie thoughts, that I am a crowned King. This noble Greeke did accept his demand, and asked of him, if that he had watched his armour. The Moore aunswered, I suppose I haue watched them inough, for that it is now eighteene dayes since I haue hadde them continually on my backe. And for me there needeth no ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes: for that I am no Christian, neither Pagan, nor Moore, nor Iewe, nor Gentile, neither doo I worship nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lÃ©eue in God: For that the God of the Christians, I take him for my enimie: and as for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> I knowe he is little worth, and can doo lesse: and the Gentiles haue for their Gods, stockes and stones: and as for the Iewes I hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as base and vile people. Therefore I doo neither worshippe the one, nor belÃ©eue in the other: but onely follow my own proper appetite. The Knight of the sunne could not refrain from laughter at his words, in sÃ©eing him to be a man of so much libertie, and aunswered him, saying. By God King, I doo sweare vnto thÃ©e, that I haue sÃ©ene fewe or none of thy Religion: but whatsoeuer thou art, I will hÃ©ere accomplish thy desire and request. Then the Prince asked him, Wilt thou be a Knight? The King aunswered, This I doo desire, and sÃ©eke no other thing, and putting on his right spurre, he kissed him on the chÃ©eke in token of honour, and taking a rich sword, which a page of his carried with him, hÃ©e stroke him a blowe with it vpon his shoulder, and putting of it vp againe into his sheath, he hung it about his necke &amp; sayd, Now King, thy desire is fulfilled, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou art a Knight. With great good reason may it be sayd, that in the fields of <hi>Prouince</hi> was giuen the order of Knighthood, vnto the most valiantest Moore in all the worlde, and by the hands of the

best Knight that euer was. The King was very glad to sÃ©e himselfe a Knight, and gaue great thankes vnto the Prince for the same, requesting him very earnestly that hee woulde tell him his name, for that he might know at whose hands he receiued the order of Knighthood: the which the Prince with a good will declared.
And when he knew that he was sonne vnto the Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> whom he accounted for his mortall enemie, altering his voyce, he sayd.<q> Oh <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> thou vile God, and full of all treasons, thou hast not lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

HÃ©ere I doo say vnto thÃ©e va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyant prince, that I would it had cost me my kingdome, that I had not receiued knighthood at thy hand, for that thou art sonne vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> the fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The prince somewhat angry aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him saying, King, it is not sÃ©emely in such as thou art, to speak words which be so false. It is very true, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is my father, and the mightiest Prince in the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall worlde. And not as thou doest account him a traytour. For the which cause I doo tell thÃ©e that thou doost falsly lye, like the most vilest Pagan in all thy kingdome: and in the defence thereof I will driue thÃ©e out of the field, and depriue thÃ©e of this order which I haue giuen thÃ©e, that thou shalte not excercise it, by taking from thÃ©e thy life.</q>

the prince, whose patience could not suffer such great pride, but as wrathfull as a Lyon replyed. <q>Thou proud Pagan, arme thy head, and prepare thÃ©e to the battaile, for by God I doo sweare that I will doo my best to cut of such an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

And the Prince likewise was readie to discharge his blowe, who raysing himselfe vp in his stirrops, stroke so strong a blowe vpon the pagans helme, that the sound was heard a great way in the fieldes, and it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him whether he would or not to make reuerence, &amp; to holde downe his head bÃ©eing so astonyed, that it sÃ©emed a great tower had fallen vpon him: and as he woulde haue setteled himselfe againe in his saddle, he stroke him such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other vpon his shield, that he droue it vnto his head, which made him to tourne vp the white of his eyes with the great griefe which he receiued: and to kÃ©epe himselfe vp from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, both he and his horse staggered on the one side, which made the Prince to loose many a blow, notwithstanding, he pressed on him so fast, that he had no time to tourne him to strike againe. This Moore was verye much amazed at his great force and strength, and strake at the prince so furious and strong a blow, that he made him to loose his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and almost to stoope with all his body vpon his horse necke. The prince came straight way to himselfe, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moore with so much furie, striking such a blow vpon his shield, which although it sÃ©emed to be as hard as a Diamond, yet for all that, he cut it in two pÃ©eces, and the blow descended vpon his sholder, with such a great waight, that the mountaines eckoed with the noyse: which made the pagan for feare of falling to hold himselfe fast by the Horse mane, very much marueling y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in one Knight there shuld be so much strength. Then he threw from him the rest of his shield which was left, and tooke his broad sword in both his hands, and droue such a blowe at the Prince, that lighting vpon his visor, it depriued him of his sight, &amp; forced him to fall vpon his horse necke without any remembrance. This stout Pagan would haue retourned to strike him again, but he could not: for that his horse bÃ©eing skarred with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow, lept on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side, which saued him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> it.

but that the Prince did settle himselfe in his saddle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered againe his sword, and committing himselfe to God, as he alwayes was accustomed to doo, he sayd: Oh holy Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su for thy names sake, ayde and helpe me. And therwith he spurred his <hi>Cornerino</hi> with great furie, that he made him runne like the winde, and in his course he sayd, Tarry, tarry, thou man without faith, and doo not thinke that thy blowes hath done any other thing on me, but onely caused my yre &amp; anger to increase the more, for to procure to bring thÃ©e to thy ende, and to sende that excommunicated soule of thine to the diuell: and in the running of his horse, when he drew nigh him, he threatened him with his sword, shaking of it in such sort, that he gaue him to vnderstand, that at the next blowe he would make an ende of the battaile: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he stroke him such a blow on his helme, that the bloud ranne out at the visor thereof, and he fell downe backwards vpon his horse crouper almost dead. The great force that the Prince gaue to strike him, was the cause that he brake the lether of his right stirrop, and therewith he fell to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground from his horse. But strayght way with great lightnesse he arose vp againe, and in the best manner he could he made it fast, and leaping into the saddle, he retourned towardes his enemie: who was with great trouble setling himselfe in his saddle, and looking vp to the heauen, he showed a pittifull countenaunce, as though he had bene very sore hurte, as in truth he was. And when he sawe himselfe so ill intreated, and all his head bathed in bloud, he beganne to crye out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst

And with this anger he lifte vp his sword alofte, going towards the Prince, who was tarrying for him in the same manner, and with like furie. And both together, they discharged their

The Knight of the Sunne was imagining with himselfe what knight that shoulde bÃ©e, that was of so gentle disposition and proportion, belÃ©euing certainely that it coulde bÃ©e none, but some of his lignage.

And seeing that there can be no other remedy but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement, hÃ©ere of my part I doo offer thÃ©e to doo all, that in my power is possible to be done, desiring thÃ©e that thou restraine these teares, and giue order that with great spÃ©ede there may be ioyned together all thy power, to the end that we maye goe and conclude that which in me lyeth. The King with a sad voyce aunswered. High and mightie Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, this hath bene prouided for before, for all my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and shires are at an houres warning, to goe to the ayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of so iust a cause, and we tarryed for nothing but onely your royall person, who must be the sword of my reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus with these and such like communications, they went vnto the Kings pallaice, which was hanged all with blacke clothes, for others he would not consent to haue han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, since the death of his daughter <hi>Herea.</hi> There was the Emperour vnarmed, and serued with as great highnesse and honour, as though he had bene in <hi>Grecia.</hi> Notwithstanding

the Emperour, would not soiourne nor rest there much, for the next daye in the morning he commaunded that all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> people should march forwards vnto a hauen which was at the vttermost parts of all the Kingdome, wheras they found ships and barkes of all sortes, verye well furnished of all things that was nÃ©edfull. There was thrÃ©e hundred ships one with another, in the which there was imbarked fiftie thousand Moores meruailously well appointed, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their sayles vnto the winde, all this Nauie tooke theyr voyage towards <hi>Numidia.</hi> So they nauigated, and founds the winde fauourable, which brought them vnto a porte or hauen, which was but two leagues from the Kings house. There, with great ioy and pleasure they went a shore, with out any resistaunce or gainsaying. So when they were all out of the shippes a lande, they displayed their ancients, and in very good order they marched forwards. And at such time as <hi>Apollo</hi> had made an ende of his iourney, and that the darke night came on, they came in sight of the Citie, and without taking any rest, towards the lande side they pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their tents, and fortified themselues in the best wise they could, in such sort, as their good Captaine which did gouerne them had commaunded, without dooing any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. So when all things was put in good order as they would haue it, he commaunded that all the armie, should go vnto the gate of the Citie that was most nÃ©erest, the which was straight waye done: and in thrÃ©e dayes after they did no other thing but ease and rest themselues: for that the people were somewhat out of quiet with their great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle.</p>
               <p>The fourth daye, the Emperour sÃ©eing that there was no sturring in the Citie, (the which was done by pollicie, tarying to sÃ©e what the enimies would doo) the Emperour called for his armour: and being armed, there was brought a verye fayre and mightie horse vnto him: and with his accustomed courage he issued out from amongst his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, and rode towards the wall of the Citie, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into a faire grÃ©ene playne nigh vnto the walls, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:13973:148"/>
vp the visour of his healme, he set his horne vnto his mouth, and did sound it very strongly, which was to warne them that were in the Citie, to come to the walls and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what he would saye:
and when he sawe that there was much people, attending to heare him, he began to saye.<q> O King <hi>Noraldino</hi> of <hi>Numidia,</hi> how carelesse thou art in this thy strong countrey, thinking that the strength thereof will defende thÃ©e, that thou payest not the price of thy naughtie treason, which thou didst vse with that vnfortunate <hi>Herea.</hi> Take vnto thÃ©e thy armour, and for that thou hadst a heart to commit this euill dÃ©ede, haue now likewise a courage to make thy defence: come foorth of these thy walls, thou trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and destroyer of the royall bloud.</q>
All they which were on the walls did heare the threatenings, and straight waye went and tolde it vnto the king of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who was at that time in communication of warres and of armyes, and of all things that belonged therevnto, and when he hearde these newes, giuing a great sigh he sayd. <q>Oh ye Gods, are not you content to sÃ©e me in this perplexitie, and so much wronged, but likewise with sound of trumpet suffer me to be outraged in calling me traytor.</q>
These fayned griefes and sorrowfull words had so much force, that it moued the harts of the Princes that were with him, for to goe out into the field for his defence: and in great hast they commaunded, that their harnesse shuld be brought vnto them, with deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to dye, or to defend his cause. And there was none that had any feare, but onely the Gyant, for that he would not giue any credit vnto the Kings words, although he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled neuer so muuch: but by reason that he had sworne therevnto, hÃ©e was constrayned by his oath to goe foorth with the rest.</p>
               <p>So in this order as I haue told you, they went foorth of the Citie all sixe together: and he which gaue the first onset was that valiant and amorous <hi>Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia</hi> brothers son vnto the Emperour, who with a gentle behauiour when hÃ©e came nigh the Emperour, sayd in the Saracen tongue:<q> It is not the part of good Knights to speake any villany, especially
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13973:148"/>
against Kings whom they are bound to haue in reuerence &amp; honour. To whom the Emperour aunswered in the same language. Art thou <hi>Noraldino</hi> King of <hi>Numidia? Don Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> replyed, No, but I am a Knight, and a very stranger in this countrey: but yet by firme oath, I determine to dye in the defence of his right. The Emperor aunswered: He hath neither iustice nor right on his side, but it is most apparant wrong which he doth maintaine, and there is no reason that such a traytor as he is, shoulde be by anye other defended: neither is it sÃ©emely that anie Knight of price should charge himselfe in his behalfe, for that he is a traytor. And likewise he that doth defend him and take his part (in this, that hee will sustaine and maintaine so great vniustice) is pertaker of his treason, and meriteth a traytors name. And for that thou art his defender, hÃ©ere I giue thÃ©e to vnderstand, that I care not for thÃ©e, and lesse I doo estÃ©eme thÃ©e: for that hÃ©e which doth take vpon him to defend a traytor, may well be accounted a traytor. This valiaunt <hi>Eleno,</hi> when hÃ©e sawe himselfe to be so ill intreated, aunswered: Thou lyest in so saying, for that I was neuer traytor, neither doo I procÃ©ede of the lynage where traytors euer were: notwithstanding, thou shalt pay me with thy head, the great vncurtesie which thou hast vsed vnto me. Therefore it doth stande thÃ©e in hand to looke vnto thy selfe, and take that part of the fielde which thou thinkest best for thy purpose, and leaue off these blazing words to ioyne with me in battaile, that I maye sÃ©e if thou canst as well defend thy quarrell, as thou canst han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thy tongue. </q>At which words, there drew nigh them the Prince <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> and as the Emperour woulde haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to put himselfe in battel, he did behold him, &amp; straight waye knew him.
And casting his eyes on the one side, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise knew the other thrÃ©e, but he could not knowe who the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> should be: and for the great desire which hÃ©e had to know what he was, he sayd:
<q>Knight, I doo desire thÃ©e for courtesies sake to tell me what thou art: &amp; if thou wilt not grant me this, then I pray thÃ©e to lift vp y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> visor of thy helme, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> I may sÃ©e thy face? for hÃ©ere I giue thÃ©e to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d
<pb facs="tcp:13973:149"/>
thy foure companions I dooe knowe, which is the occasion that I haue no desire to enter into battaile with thÃ©e. Then <hi>Don Eleno</hi> aunswered and sayd: Pagan, of the two things which thou doest aske of mÃ©e (although there is no compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) yet will I pleasure thÃ©e in fulfilling one of them: </q>and in saying these wordes, he lift vp the visour of his healme, and when the Emperour sawe him, he belÃ©eued that it had bÃ©ene his sonne <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and with a loud voice he said.
<q>Oh migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, how can this be true, that vnto knights of my lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage should chaunce so vile a spot, who hetherto in all their dooings haue got great honour and praise, and now are come to defend such apparaunt wickednesse and treason. Thou shalt vnderstand knight, that I am the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and would not willingly now be called thy Father, for that thou art come to defend so apparaunt and knowen an euill, for I knowing the vnreasonable naughtinesse that this king hath committed, am come to take this conquest in hande, for in all my life time I neuer tooke a more iuster cause in hand, neither was there euer in all the worlde a thing more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier of punishment then this, and sÃ©eing that my fortune hath bÃ©en such, that my first enimie that shuld come against me, sÃ©emeth my sonne, put thy selfe hÃ©ere now before thy high progenitour from whence thou doest descend, and for Gods loue doe not blot thy stock, in defending traitours &amp; treason, &amp; therwith in few words he told vnto them all the whole hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, as before I haue tolde you. Then this excellent <hi>Dacian</hi> answered. High &amp; mightie Emperour, although by my name thou hast not knowen me, yet in calling me sonne thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest happen on the truth. For thou shalt vnderstand that I am called <hi>Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> sonne vnto the king of <hi>Dacia</hi> thy brother, and in that which thou hast sayde that we doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine treasons, we are to the contrarie informed, neuertheles I besÃ©ech your highnesse to tarrie hÃ©ere a while, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he and the Prince in a great confusion returned to the place whereas the rest of his companions were, and turning his talke vnto the king, he sayd. King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> thou shalt vnderstand that yonder knight is the Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:13973:149"/>
my vnckle, who in that small time which we haue ben with him, hath told vnto vs all the effect of this thy matter, cleane contrary vnto that which thou hast declared vnto vs. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King, there is no reason, that Knights of so high bloud and name as we are should be set to defend lyes and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: but if it be to the contrary of that which he hath told vnto me, haue no doubt but tell vs the truth. For hÃ©ere I sweare by the loue that I beare vnto that vnlouing <hi>Lidia,</hi> that I will trauayle so with my vnckle, that greatly with thy honour thou shalt goe thorough with this conquest. Then this false King aunswered. O Knights which doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your selues to be Christians, and by the God whome you doo worship haue made a solemne oath to helpe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me by the strength of your armes: how happeneth it now y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> without any care of your oth, which you haue sworn, you will leaue me desolate, and goe from your words, bÃ©eing doubtfull of the very truth. The couragious French man aunswered: Doo thou not thinke King, that our oathes and words shall be abrogated, rather first we will lÃ©ese our liues, both I, the prince, &amp; all our companions: but consider king, that God will not that we shall imagine amisse of <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> who is a prince of great veritie and truth, and agayne, our verie nigh kinsman. Therefore this, and that which hÃ©e hath tolde vs, hath moued vs to come and tell thÃ©e, and doe saye, that none of vs will goe from his word and oath if thy cause be iust. Then the valyaunt <hi>Eleno</hi> did cut off his reasons, and tourning vnto the King he sayd. King of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> hÃ©ere I do most humblye desire thÃ©e, that with false il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions thou putte not vs vnto so great trauaile, for that then it can not be, but either wÃ©e must dye in the hands of him whome we doe desire to serue, or els, (though farre vnlikely) to kill him. Is it possible king, that thou hast brought vs vnto this estate, that crueltie should gouern our wills, without hauing power to doe any other thing. </q>The King when he saw that the Knights were very earnest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to sweare with great oaths that his cause was iust, and that he had tolde vnto them the truth of the matter, and if
<pb facs="tcp:13973:150"/>
so be that the Emperour had tolde them any other thing, it was onely to deceiue them, and to tourne them, that they should not make his defence, and charged them againe with their oath which they had made and how that they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their words to be his vpholder and defender.
This wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Dacian</hi> tourning vnto his companions sayd. <q>Knightes, what doo you thinke in this matter, what is it best that we doo hÃ©erein? For well you doo sÃ©e, that we are so bewrapte &amp; bound one against another, and cousin against cousin, yet for all that we cannot by any meanes excuse the battaile. So they did all determine to retourne vnto the Emperour, and to desire him for to accept it in good part, and to leaue off that battaile, &amp; to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> belÃ©eue that he was falsly informed, &amp; when they came vnto him they said. Worthy Emperour, and our onely Lord, looke well vnto this false information, wherewith they haue informed you, and hauing well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thereof, we doo all request you, for the loue which vnto your sonnes and cousins, and vnto all your friendes you doo owe, that it may moue you to take no occasion to put vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this extremitie, for that by anie meanes we cannot goe from our oath and word. Unto the which the Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and sayd. My louing friends, if that you haue giuen your word and oath to procure to make defence of so false a King, doo you likewise indeuour to performe the same: for the like will I doe to accomplish that which I haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for that there is no more reason for the one then for the other. But this one thing I doe tell you, that it is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that you will maintaine the treason of this false King, as it appereth plainly by many reasons, which I haue told vnto you: and the principall cause, wherin you maye sÃ©e plainely his treason and falshoode, is the little hast that hÃ©e doeth make himselfe vnto the battaile, and if he knew that he doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h maintaine the truth, let him come forth and make his owne defence.</q>
At the which reasons they all helde theyr peace, considering the great reason which the Emperour had declared, and determined that the next daie they woulde conclude, what were best to bÃ©e done, &amp; so these sixe knights
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13973:150"/>
returned vnto the Citie, and the Emperour vnto the campe. Of all this that happened, he that receiued the most content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was the Prince <hi>Eleno,</hi> for he desired verye much to retourne vnto the Citie, for that at his departure he left his Lady very sicke, so that he thought not to finde her aliue, and comming to the Citie, hÃ©e was no sooner alighted from his horse, but hÃ©e went straight vnto her Chamber, whereas hÃ©e found her with a mightie burning ague, and sÃ©eing her in that case, he was as one that was beside himselfe, and the more that her ague increased, the more furious she did shew her selfe and farther out of quiet. So this grÃ©euous and sicke Ladie did aske paper and inke for to write a few lines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him which was the causer of all this her harme, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an ende of her writing, without power to doo any other thing, with the great fÃ©eblenesse shÃ©e felt, she fell downe vpon her pillowe, &amp; speaking vnto <hi>Eleno</hi> she sayd.
<q>Ualiant knight, behold hÃ©ere thy <hi>Lidia,</hi> at her last ende: for that there doth not remaine in me strength for to giue thÃ©e thankes, for so great benefits as I haue receiued at thy handes: yet I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one great comfort with me, which is, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> although I dye, yet thy great loyaltie doeth not dye, neyther my firme faith, and although I was vnloued of an vnfaythfull Knight, yet am I beloued of the most couragious knight in the worlde.</q>
This sorrowfull and troubled Prince woulde not suffer her to goe forwards with her talke, but with shedding of manie teares from his eyes, he sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Oh my swÃ©ete Mistresse, doe not giue me to vnderstande that thou wilt dye, if that thou meane I shall remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. Oh my loue, I would rather that my heart shoulde be parted in twaine, by the greatest enimie that I haue, then to remaine without thÃ©e. Oh my louing Mistres, let this thy youthfull yeres and great beautie which thou hast, incourage thÃ©e, &amp; die not in this order:</q> this feeble <hi>Lidia</hi> for to shew with more feruentnesse the good will which she did owe vnto the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

for his great curtesie forced her selfe to holde vp her head, and he lifted it vp with such quicknesse, as though her weake members had felt no griefe, &amp; as though the furie of

                  </gap>, and with her face of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery colour she sayd. <q>My Lord, time doth not giue me anye place, that with words I might gratifie the great courtesie that of thÃ©e I haue receiued: for that I doo feele, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is come, and that the three fatall sisters haue the thred of my life betwÃ©ene the edges of their shÃ©eres, so that it lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing but to put them together: insomuch, that I miserable creature doo fÃ©ele my soule tremble in my flesh, at this my last hower. But one thing, (oh my swÃ©ete and true louer) I will desire thÃ©e before that I doo dye, which is, that thou wouldest procure, that this letter maye bÃ©e giuen vnto that cruell Knight, who hath brought me vnto this estate, giuing him to vnderstande of this my troublesome death, the occasion whereof, was his vnreasonable crueltie.</q>
And making an end of saying this, this miserable Lady fell downe, without hauing any more strength to sit vp, but let the letter fall out of her hande before her true louer, who tooke it vp and sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Oh all my ioye, what a cruell knife is this to my heart, to heare thy complayntes, in giuing me to vnderstande the great crueltie that loue hath vsed against thÃ©e, without anye desert or reason: and verely I doo belÃ©eue, that these thy great thoughts and griefes, but most of all thy absence wil be the occasion of my death. And if y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> my enimies are not of power to giue it me, hÃ©ere I doo sweare vnto thee by the great and true loue which I beare vnto thÃ©e, that I my selfe with my owne hands will procure to pull this heart out of his place, for that it knew not how to giue thÃ©e contentment paying therwith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dutie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ow vnto thÃ©e. O happy <hi>Brenio</hi> that didst obtaine so much grace &amp; fauour at <hi>Venus</hi> handes, for to be beloued of the flower of all beautie. The <hi>Clime</hi> in the which thou wert borne was not so happie as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie my <hi>Clime</hi> hath bÃ©en vnhappie &amp; vnfortunate. Take a good heart my Mistres, comfort your selfe and be strong, and bÃ©e not the occasion that I sÃ©eke my owne death, &amp; hÃ©ere I doe promise thÃ©e by thy vnhappie successe, to bring thÃ©e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               </p>
               <p>Then this weake <hi>Lidia</hi> sayde:<q> Gentle Knight, there is nowe no time all bÃ©eing past, for that I doe fÃ©ele my selfe that this is the last fight.

How is it possible my swÃ©et Mistres, sayd the Prince, that now thou art in doubt of my loue, I promise you that my true loue doth not deserue this suspition, and hÃ©ere I giue you to vnderstande, that first the mightie riuer of <hi>Tigris</hi> shall forsake her course and runne backe againe, before that anie lacke shall be found in me of that I owe vnto thy loue, neither anie forgetfulnesse to bee the occasion to withdraw me from doing anie thing that you shall commaund me, therfore swÃ©et mistres aske what your pleasure is, for that thou canst aske nothing at my handes, but it shall be all thine. This weak Ladie, whose power and strength was wholy decayed, and that her houre drew nigh at hande, with a weake and feeble voice she said. That which I desire, gentle Lorde, is, that this my letter may come vnto the handes of <hi>Brenio,</hi> wherein he may see how cruell he hath bene vnto his <hi>Lidia.</hi>
                  </q> So this dead Ladie spake neuer a word more, for at that instaunt the destinies concluded to cut the thrid of her lyfe a sunder.
Heere the Prince lacked both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and patience, heere he lost all his comfort and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; comming vnto the dead bodie of <hi>Lidia,</hi> he fell in a sound, &amp; when (by the procurement of the Ladies and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
<pb facs="tcp:13973:152"/>
that were there present) he came to himselfe, he arose vp with a furious wrath, saying:<q> Is it of truth swÃ©ete soule that thou art departed &amp; gone without me? Is it possible my <hi>Lidia</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shall not follow thÃ©e whether thou doest goe?

So either of them in the best wise he could did procure to comfort him, but this amorous knight with the great anguish that he had, fel in a sound in the armes of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerindo,</hi> who requested the Ladyes and damsells which were there in companie with the dead bodie, that they woulde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine some thing to bring him againe to his remembraunce, and so with such remedies as they did make he came againe vnto himselfe, who then with great rage crieng out, called for his <hi>Lidia.</hi>
                  <q> Oh my <hi>Lidia,</hi> what is become of thÃ©e, who for loue in another mans armes didst die, &amp; now I die for thy loue?

And with these &amp; such lyke reasons he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained without any feeling, in such sort that it sÃ©emed that he was dead.</p>
               <p>The other Princes which were there present sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in that case, tooke him betwÃ©ene them, and carried him vnto another chamber, and procured that <hi>Lidia</hi> shoulde be buried, which straight waie was done, for that the King commaunded his Sepulchre shoulde bÃ©e open, in which they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13973:152"/>
put this dead Ladie. The Prince of <hi>Hungaria</hi> did remaine in companie with the Prince <hi>Eleno,</hi> for that he woulde not let him alone, for hÃ©e loued him out of all measure, because hÃ©e did resemble so much the valiaunt <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> So hÃ©e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there till such time as hÃ©e came vnto himselfe, and the first worde that Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> sayd, was: Where is the Letter of my <hi>Lidia. Liriamandro</hi> did giue it him, who taking it in his hand, he sayd.</p>
               <p>Oh worke, and the last worke of that white Iuorie hande: hÃ©ere I doe sweare vnto thÃ©e by the honour that I doo owe vnto knighthoode, not to a part it from my heart, till such time as the heart of that cruell <hi>Brenio</hi> bÃ©e cut it pÃ©eces, and in speaking this hÃ©e kissed it a thousand times, vttering a thousande varieties. And straight waye with a furious anger, hÃ©e arose vp and sayde: What is this <hi>Eleno,</hi> doest thou belÃ©eue that with lamenting thou shalt recouer thy welbeloued <hi>Lidia,</hi> and not performe that which by her was commaunded thÃ©e. It is more requisite that thou doest trauaile and wander, till such time as thou hast performed that which thou hast promised, gather vnto thy selfe strength and courage, for to performe that which thy heart is bounde to doo. So with this anguish he arose vp at such times as <hi>Aurora,</hi> with his glistering beames hadde spread ouer the earth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next morning when the daie was come, all these stout warriours were readye on horse backe, but Prince <hi>Eleno,</hi> woulde first goe and sÃ©e the Sepulchre of his <hi>Lidia,</hi> and going into the Temple of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> hÃ©e went straight vnto the place whereas they tolde him that his <hi>Lidia</hi> was, and hauing no strength
<pb facs="tcp:13973:153"/>
to suffer the great griefe that his heart did fÃ©ele, he sayd. Oh my swÃ©ete <hi>Lidia,</hi> if thou doest heare my griefe and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let it appeare by some outwarde shewe in these harde stones, which hath bewrapt and inclosed thy white and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate body, that receiuing griefe at these my lamentations, it may giue place that I may sÃ©e thee, let this my anguish grÃ©eue thÃ©e my <hi>Lidia,</hi> likewise let this my misfortune grÃ©eue thÃ©e. But alasse what shall I say, is it not sufficient that the great paine that I doe sustaine for thy death, but I must bewaile my owne sorrowe: Oh mistres, at thy death thou madest an end of all thy paines, and mine doth more and more increase. And in saying these and such like lamentations, he drew out his Dagger, and with the point he wrote an Epitaph, which was as followeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>HEere Lidia lou'de and vnbelou'de doth lie,</l>
                  <l>Whose great good will to her small good did bring:</l>
                  <l>She loue did feele, which causelesse did applie</l>
                  <l>to her (perforce) of death the bitter sting.</l>
                  <l>And though her corps inclosed heere doth lie,</l>
                  <l>her lucklesse fate and fame will neuer die.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So when he had made this Epitaph, he arose vp, saying: hÃ©ere I doe promise thÃ©e <hi>Lidia,</hi> since my fortune is such that I haue lost thÃ©e, there is no other that shall enter into this my heart and hard breast. But how can I saie that it is hard, did it not open at the houre when it felt thy absence, and so without saying anie more, he went out of the temple, with all the rest of his companions, and taking their horses, they altogether issued out of the citie, at such time as the Emperor was arming himselfe in his rich tent. The fierce king of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denia</hi> when he sawe that they returned againe, vnto y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> which the daie before they did intreate of, he could not bÃ©e in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but sayde.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13973:153"/>
the occasion.
<q>Well, doo not thou thinke that it shall be so, but perswade thy selfe, that thou shalt be the first in the incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that thou maist proue how euill it is to suffer the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>urie of the Emperour of <hi>Grecia.</hi> O worthie king of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the king of <hi>Numidia,</hi> how the great affection which thou hast vnto the Emperour, doth cause thÃ©e not to giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit vnto this my iustice and right. HÃ©ere I doe require thÃ©e by the oath which thou madest vnto me, that thou be the first to put thy selfe in the defence of my person. To which the <hi>Sardenian</hi> aunswered: First, the heauen and the earth shall ioyne together, before that I wil consent that my arme shal mooue it selfe against him, whom I take for my Lord and master. And hÃ©ere I saye vnto thÃ©e oh king, that if thou doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est but once againe will me hÃ©ereto, I sweare to thÃ©e by the soueraigne God, that neither thy power, nor all thy subiects shall be able to deliuer thÃ©e out of my hands.</q> So their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was cut off by sÃ©eing the Emperour to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them vpon a very faire horse, who showed so greate furie, that it was a wonder to sÃ©e.
At this present time there appeared comming from those parts which was towardes the sea, two Knights, who were very well armed. If you do remember, these were the two valiant warriours, the prince of the Sunne, and the strong <hi>Sardenian.</hi> The great desire that the Emperour had to sÃ©e himselfe with the <hi>Numidian,</hi> was the occasion that he little estÃ©emed the tarrying for those two knights, for that he thought the houre was come of the battaile, and that the defender should be (as he had demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) that false King and traitour, he put himselfe forwardes towards the place wheras the Princes and the king came. And when they wer together, these Princes with very faire and amorous wordes and of great fidelitie, indeuoured so perswade the Emperour for to leaue the battaile, and that therein they should receiue meruailous great contentment, if he would accept it. The knight of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> sunne stood &amp; did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their reasonings, &amp; did looke for no other thing but furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous battaile, by all tokens y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shewed with their handes and other demeanors of their bodies: &amp; knowing fiue of the
<pb facs="tcp:13973:154"/>
knightes, he very much meruailed what shoulde be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and with this desire he had to knowe what should moue them to this controuersie, he sawe a Lackie which passed by, and he called him, &amp; asked of him in the Saracen tongue, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: Friend, tell me if thou cannest what is the occason that doth cause them to make this cruell and furious battaile, and who they be that doo make it. This Lackie (by the riches of his armour, and by his good proportion) iudged him to bÃ©e a knight of estimation, he saide: Gentle Knight, the cause of this controuersie and defence, if I should stand to tell you it all, it would be verie tedious, but of all the rest that thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est aske me, I will giue thÃ©e to vnderstand that which I dooe knowe. You shall vnderstand that the knight which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the mightie Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and that which hÃ©e doth maintaine is great iustice and right, and will giue great punishment for the same, which is that that the others doe defend. The knight of the Sunne was very much amazed at that which he hearde, and therewith he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them before they had made an end of their reasoning<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and so without anie shew of trouble he sayd vnto the Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi> (who was still sore troubled with the sorrowe, as you haue heard). Art thou <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> my cousin, and brothers sonne vnto the Emperour, my Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I am he aunswered the <hi>Dacian,</hi> who ought not for to dye, before I giue thÃ©e thy death, for that thou hast caused so much euill to come vpon me, that liuing I doe now die. The knight of the Sunne bÃ©eing almost in a confusion to beare his drie reasons, answered: Louing cousin, I fÃ©ele my selfe somewhat troubled at these thy wordes, and greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed that thou art fallen into so great pride to lift vp thy armed hand against thy naturall parents, and more bÃ©eing informed, that which thou doest pretend to defend is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant treason. The Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> did cut of his talke and said. Oh my cousin, hÃ©ere I doe tell thÃ©e, that I doe sÃ©eke no other thing but death, therefore procure to giue it mÃ©e, for that I shal thinke my selfe happie to die in thy hands, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding defend thy selfe as thou wert wont to do, for that thou
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13973:154"/>
knowest it doth so behooue thÃ©e. With this furie and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnderstanding, speking no more words, he turned about his horse, crying out and saying: I will liue no longer, seeing I haue lost that, beside which, to me can be no greater losse. The knight of the Sun verie much meruailed at these his short reasons, not knowing of anie thing that had happened vnto him, &amp; wondering that his true heart should commit or maintain such wrongs, he turned about his horse for to make his defence, in such sort, that all the knights that were there, were not sufficient to disturbe him, but with great fury they met together with their speares, yet not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their saddles, but remained as though they hadde bene two towers, and straight way with no lesse force they began to lay hold on their swordes, and for that the knight of the Sunne had a respect vnto him, he did rather procure to make his defence, then in anie thing to offend him, but <hi>Don Eleno</hi> stroke such a blowe at his cousin, that he made him to stoope with all his bodie to the horse necke. The knight of the Sun would haue taken reuengement of the same blowe, but hÃ©e considered that he was his cousin, and that he was ignorant of the cause that should moue him to commit this folly, for the which consideration he did suffer him, and would make no reuengement. <hi>Tefereo</hi> who sawe all that had passed, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his first place without remouing, til time did serue him to accomplish that which he had determined in his mind to doo, and when he sawe occasion for the same, he threw his shÃ©eld vpon his arme, and put his speare in his rest, &amp; made a shew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would be doing with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; he put himself in a readinesse, but more to giue him to vnderstand what he was, then to hurt him. This furious <hi>Sardenian</hi> stroke his horse with the spurs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him run like the commet which falleth from the side of <hi>Trion,</hi> &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he came in the middest of his course, he turned his horse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the place whereas the king of <hi>Numidia</hi> was (who had put himselfe a part from the rest) with so great swiftnesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by no meanes he could kÃ©epe or defend himselfe from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, but by reason of the strength wherwith it was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:155"/>
he threw them to the ground, very euill intreated. He was no sooner fallen when that this couragious <hi>Sardenian</hi> leapt from his horse verie lightly, and found that the king of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia</hi> was on foote readie for to defend himselfe, and crying out: Knightes, succour, succour, or else I am but dead. At the which noise all the other fiue knights looked about, and when they sawe the king in the power of that valiant knight, they would haue rescued him, but the light of all knighthoode which was the father and the sonne, did disturbe them, and put themselues before them, and would not suffer them to giue anie such aide, but did there great wonders, striking on euerie side, in such sort, that now one and then the other they made them to recoile backe. The strong and furious <hi>Eleno</hi> did but little harme with his swoorde, neither made he anie great resistaunce, the Gyant with as little hast as might bÃ©e went to helpe the <hi>Numidian</hi> king, &amp; with a reasonable pace he went towards the place whereas the king was, (but for that reason would not consent that such as he is should bÃ©e holpen) with the hast that he made, his horse stumbled, in such sort, that horse and master fell to the ground, of the which he was verie sore hurt and brused, as it appeared by his slow rising vp againe. The valiant <hi>Sardenian</hi> with great pollicie procured to bring to an end his desire, before that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie did come to disturbe him, and bÃ©eing lighted of his horse he made hast to the King and sayde: Thou traytour, it shal little profit or plesure thÃ©e to call for help, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in my hands thou shalt leaue this thy traiterous soule, who doeth deserue to suffer all the euills that may bÃ©e, and therwith hÃ©e stroke him such a blowe vppon his healme, and with so greate furie, that he made him in spite of his heart to knÃ©ele with both his knÃ©es vppon the earth. So when the <hi>Sardenian</hi> perceiued him to bÃ©e in this case, with greate valyauntnesse he straight wayes layde holde of his healme with his lefte hande, and pulled it cleane from his head, and with his right hande he smote him such a blowe vppon the head, that hÃ©e parted it in two pÃ©eces, and immediatly hÃ©e fell downe dead to the ground, and looking about to sÃ©e whether his horse wer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13973:155"/>
gone or no, he found that he was nigh at hande. Then hÃ©e tooke the dead king and made him fast vnto the stiroppes of the Saddle, and with a trice hÃ©e leapt vpon his horse, and so without anie helpe of his stiroppes, hee made his horse to runne, and so drew the king after him throughout all the fielde. The Gyaunt would haue succoured him, but all was in vaine. In this sorte went <hi>Tefereo</hi> drawing the king af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him before all the knightes that were there present and sayde: Knightes, what doe you meane to bÃ©e so still? Why doe you not vpholde and defend this trayterous king, in whose strength was all his confidence? Beholde now where he hath receiued the payment, that such euill workes as his deserued, and therewith he rode round about the fielde as hÃ©e did before. The Emperour when hÃ©e sawe that this fact was ended, would that his cousin <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> and the Prince his sonne shoulde leaue theyr battaile, which was betweene them begunne a newe, and they were giuing one another terrible blowes, but not with such great furie, for that they did knowe the one the other, otherwise it woulde haue gone ill on both parts. The Emperour put himself betwÃ©ene them and said.</p>
               <p>Oh Knights, cease your battaile and hearken vnto my wordes. <hi>Eleno</hi> which was still kindled in wrath, hadde no respect vnto those wordes, neyther woulde hÃ©e part, but lyke a man distraught from himselfe, hÃ©e doubled such a blowe vpon the visour of the Emperour, that hÃ©e made him loose the sight of his eyes. The Emperour who was verie angry and not a lyttle grieued, at the small regarde that he had of his wordes, woulde presently haue reuenged the blowe, but that hÃ©e was disturbed by the Gyaunt, who pulling off his healme went towards the place whereas these thrÃ©e wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie warriours were, and with a heauie and troubled voyce he sayde.</p>
               <p>Heare mÃ©e O noble Emperour and you worthie knights, cease this your controuersie and staye your vnweakened armes, till such time as I haue vttered that which I will saye. Then the Emperour with his accustomed mÃ©eke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:13973:156"/>
sayd. Noble King, what is it that thou canst demaund of me, that I would not willingly accomplish? To whome he aunswered. Well, sÃ©eing it is so my Lord, I doo desire you to returne vnto your Tent, and take your ease, and to leaue off this, and such like controuersies: for that the cause ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, my cousin and brothers sonne, hath taken away from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©ene you. And when he had sayd these &amp; such like words, he retourned vnto his companions, and perswaded them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to retourne vnto the Citie, to the which they all consented, although it was cleane contrary vnto the will of <hi>Don Eleno.</hi> So when they were entered into the Citie, they found that all the people and burgesses thereof were in great lamentation for the losse of their king and Lord, and the more, for that his death was so shamefull and odious. But they rested not till they came to the Kings Pallayce, whereas they were receiued, and were vnarmed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the dinner to be made readye, whereat they were meruailouslye serued. And when that dinner and all was ended, the valyaunt Giaunt began to speake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Worthy Princes, and my Lords and friends, you doo well know, and hÃ©ere you haue sÃ©ene, how that all our trauayle which we haue had for to defend this king, hath bene great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against our honours, and that neither our threatnings nor words were sufficient for to disturbe the will of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour hÃ©erein: for that he knew that his quarrell was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certaine and iust, which was the occasion, that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this fact in all things hath bene fauourable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto his desire. And for the better verefieng of the same, at that present time you saw come in place, his worthy son, accompanied with my brothers sonne my cousin, that with their aide he should conclude to put in execution his iuste &amp; true desired reuengement: which hath bene a great reproch and ignomy vnto vs all, neither was there in any of vs so much force or st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then to goe and yÃ©eldo my selfe vnto them, nor to anye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the whole world. Let euery one doo as he thinketh best, for that the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince will not let to be the same, which his fortune hath ordained, and therewith he arose vp from the table, and made as though he went vnto his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but he did not: for incontinent he called a Lackey of his, and armed himselfe, and commaunded him very secretly to carrie his horse out of the Citie, and to tarrie for him there, and the lackey did as the prince had commanded him. So when he was out of the Citie, he leaped vpon his horse, and carried in no place till he came vnto the waters side, and by chaunce he came vnto the place whereas the barke was, that brought his cousin thether, into which he entered, and his lackey put in his horse.

               <p>Now I will retourne vnto the Princes, who after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reasonings, determined to goe foorthwith vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours tent, and went vnto the chamber of <hi>Don Eleno</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to perswade him to doo the like, but when they came ther, they neither found him nor his armour, for the which they were very sad and sorrie, imagining straight waye what he had done. And sÃ©eing that it was labour lost to goe and sÃ©eke him, they themselues determined to departe without him. And when they came vnto the scowtes of the host, it was asked them what they fought, and what they would haue? The Giaunt sayd vnto them: Friends, goe vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and tell him that hÃ©ere are the Knights with whom he had all his late contention, that are very desirous to speak with him.

The next daie in the morning the king of <hi>Cimarra</hi> did arise, meruailouslye richlye apparelled, with roabes of cloth of golde, and went vnto the knightes, giuing them to vnderstand that he was more contented and in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et then anie other king, in that he was reuenged in such sort as you haue heard. This good king neuer ceased in giuing thanks vnto the Emperour for the great curtesie which hee receiued at his hands, and there they gaue order that all the whole camp should returne vnto their owne countrie, for that which they came for was concluded, and that their departure shuld be in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people shuld not do anie harme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was straight waie accomplished, &amp; they appointed for king ouer that countrie a valiant knight, of whom we will intreate in the third part of this historie.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore in the historie, if you doo remember, the fierce Moore <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> came vnto the place whereas a companye of Ladyes and damsells were, whereas he stayed to looke and beholde them: and with them wer sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting knights of a good disposition, and well proportioned. At which time as we began to intreate of them, I did not tell you who they were: but now you shall vnderstand, that they were the two Empresses of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> and <hi>Trapisond,</hi> who were come vnto that house of pleasure for to recreate themselues, which was verye nigh vnto a faire village. And the occasion of this theyr going foorth, was the great estÃ©emed QuÃ©ene of <hi>Lira,</hi> (of whom till now our historie hath made no mention, nor of hir surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing excellencies, but hath referred them till time did serue) ShÃ©e bÃ©eing manye times with the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:13973:158"/>
heard her teil of some feates of knighthoode that had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by her, the which the QuÃ©ene with great contentment gaue eare vnto, imagining within her selfe to be of as good disposition, and haue as much strength as she, yea, and rather more: and knowing that her strength was much, she purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed verye secretlye to proue her selfe, and taking this place (whether as they went to recreate themselues) to be very fit for to performe her will, with all secrecie in the worlde, she commaunded that her armour (which <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto her) should be carried thether, which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and done by the damosells, for that they all had a great delight to pleasure and serue her, she was of them so welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and her excellent vertues deserued no lesse. So when they were come vnto the house of pleasure, she went foorthe to recreate her selfe with two Ladyes towards a fountaine somewhat out of the waye, whereas the Empres &amp; her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes were set downe. And for that the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> did vnderstand, (whether by her owne imagination, or that <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> had aduised her) that in such place commonly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fall out some aduentures, she commaunded to giue vnto her, her armour, which she caused to be brought vnto that house: and whilest she was arming, came the Moore <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldoro,</hi> thether: who sÃ©eing so faire a company, had a great desire to knowe who they were, and comming vnto a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell which was thereby, speaking with great courtesie, hÃ©e sayd. Damosell let me obtaine. I pray you, so much fauour at your hands, that you will tell me who they be that are in this faire company. This damsell sÃ©eing that with so great curtesie and good manners he did request her, and being a knight of so good disposition, she said. Sir knight, they be the Empresse of <hi>Grecia</hi> and her Ladies, which are come to this place to recreate themselues: and haue brought hether for their sauegard these well proportioned knights. When the Moore vnderstood that there was the Empresse of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> there entred straight way many things in his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many thoughts troubled his minde, till such time, as he dermined to doo that, which I will tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:159"/>So with a determined purpose he came vnto the place wher as the Empresse was: and without saying any worde, hÃ©e tooke her vy the arme, and with great strength lifte her vp, till he had her on his saddle bowe before him, and tourning his horse about he tooke his waye towards that place, from whence he came, with purpose to imbarke himselfe againe, in that shippe in which he came thether, and so to carrie her away: but the noyse and shrikes of the Ladyes and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosells were so pitifull and lowde, that there came vnto them the knights that were dispersed abroad in the forrest and other places. And when they came, and saw all that had passed, they altogether followed the Moore, so fast as theyr horse could runne: and in a short time they came for to take away his bootie, so that whether he would or not, he was driuen to let her goe, for to defende himselfe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blowes which the knights layd on him, who on the one side and on the other, began to strike fiercely at him: but he made no more reckoning of them, then the huge and mightie Rocke doth of the troublesome waues of the seas, beating against it continually. Euen so were the blowes which the GrÃ©eke knights stroke vpon the Pagan, who sÃ©eing himselfe hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his purpose, drew out his sword, and stroke one of those knights such a blowe vpon the shoulder, that he cut him downe to the girdle, so that he fell downe dead to the ground: and not content hÃ©erewith, but began so to bestur himselfe, that in a small time, he seperated them all, some slaine and some very sore hurt &amp; wounded. In this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ime, that these knights were in their battaile, the Empresse <hi>Claridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi> was armed, and set vpon a mightie strong horse, and came with great yre, and sayd. Oh infernall Pagan, what diuell was that, which made thÃ©e so bolde with those vyle &amp; wicked hands to come and take holde of the Empresse: and in saieng these words, she drew out her sworde, and stroke him such a blowe vpon the healme, that she made him boow his head vnto his breast: but straight wayes the Pagan came to himselfe, and firming his fÃ©ete in his stirroppes hÃ©e made her aunswere, with a blowe no lesse furious then that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13973:159"/>
that he had receiued. So there began one of the best fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten battailes that euer was betwÃ©ene two Knights. The Empresse when she sawe her selfe cleare out of the handes of the Moore, got on the one side, and sate downe vpon the grÃ©ene hearbs and did beholde the battaile. All the Ladyes &amp; Damosells when they sawe her at libertie, ranne vnto the place whereas shÃ©e was, and in small time they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed her with a milde lamentation. At the same time out of the thickest of the Forrest came foorth a Knight verye well armed, with grÃ©ene armour, all to be spotted with Lyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes; and his shÃ©elde of the same manner, but in the middest thereof was painted a hand, which sÃ©emed to be in a lake of water, holding in it a Lilly flower. And as he saw that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious battaile, he went vnto one of the Ladyes, and with a gracious courtesie he demaunded the occasion thereof. The effect thereof she tolde, and declared vnto him which was the knight that was in the Empresse defence. At this time the battaile was so kindeled, that with the furious blowes that were giuen, it had bene sufficient to haue cut a rocke in pÃ©eces. This strong Empresse was so wrathfull, that her battaile was more gouerned with yre then by pollicie, and with the great choller that she had, she stroke the Pagan so terrible a blow, that he fell downe vpon his horse necke, without any remembraunce, and with the sound of that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blow the horse was somwhat scarred, in such sort, that he carried his master a while about the fielde. The Empres following him with her light horse, thinking that she hadde made an ende of the battaile, when that in the middest of her course, the Moore came to himselfe againe, and with madnesse, he fomed at the mouth, and beginning to vse his accustomed cursings against <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And recouering his sword, taking it fast in both his hands, he went towards the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> threatening her with a furious blowe.</p>
               <p>The Empresse who sawe the blowe comming, shÃ©e lyfte vp her shÃ©elde to receiue it therewith, the blowe fell so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:13973:160"/>
thereon, that it parted it in two pÃ©eces, and lighted on her healm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> in such great force and furie, that it made her to fall backwards vpon the crouper of her horse without anie fÃ©eling, voyding much bloud out of her visour, with which blowe the horse was scarred, and ranne rounde about the fielde, the which when the Pagan saw, he followed after the Empresse, as the hauke, when you haue taken of her hood, discouering the Heron, with great fury flieth at her: euen so went this Moore saying. Now will I sÃ©e Empresse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the strength of this knight be sufficient for to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, that I carry thÃ©e not into a place, where <hi>Mahomet</hi> shall not be able to deliuer thÃ©e, nor take thÃ©e out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Then the gentle Knight of the Lillyes, did put himselfe before the Empresse, and sayd. Stande thou proud Pagan, for first before thou dost that which thou thinkest to doo, it standeth thÃ©e in hand to looke to thy selfe, and in saying these words, he drew out his sword, and stroke him such an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart blowe vppon the visour of his healme, that he was ready to fall downe on the other side, and with the strength thereof, it depriued him of his sight, and after that hÃ©e stroke another blowe on the other side, that the Moore was not able to make any defence, but that he fell downe vpon his horse head. The Moore being kindeled with great madnesse, to sÃ©e two such mightie blowes giuen him, and he not able to make any defence. when he was come to himselfe, he went against his aduersary with his sword fast in both his hands, who was in the same sort tarrying for him: &amp; they strake both together such terrible blowes, that both of them were constrayned to imbrace their horse neckes for not falling: but setteling themselues again, they recouered their swords, and pressed the one against the other, as commonlye the wilde Bulls doo in their fight, with the lyke yre these two ioyned together, making one of the most perillous battells in the world, striking one another whereas they might doo most harme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:13973:160"/>It was so much without pittie, and with so furious wrath, as though it had bene two Lyons, and giuing such notable blowes, and battering of the copper and yron with such great noyse, that it did not onely glowe in the eares of those Ladies and the rest that were looking on, but the mountaines thereabout were moued with compassion and pitie, to sÃ©e their great crueltie one toward another. At this time the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> was come to her selfe, and when she remembred the great peril in the which she was, she called vnto God for his helpe, and tourning about her light horse with so great swiftnesse, that wheresoeuer he did put his foote, there was no signe sÃ©ene, she came vnto the place whereas the battaile was. The Knight with the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Lyllyes with a high voyce sayde. Most mightle and Emperiall Lady, take you the Empresse and carrie her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, and leaue her in safetie, and let me alone to punish this vncourteous Knight.</p>
               <p>Then the Empresse and all her Ladyes did call her and sayd. Ualyaunt and worthy Lady, prouide to set vs at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, where we may be out of daunger, that you maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne in time to helpe this Knight that hath done vs so much good. The Empres consented hÃ©ereto at their requests, and so taking their palfrayes, they went with great hast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Village. But when the Pagan did vnderstand, that it was a woman, which had brought him into so great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, with a great noyse he sayd.

The gentle knight with the Lillyes to those wordes sayd.</p>
               <p>

And for that thou shalt vnderstand how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thou art estÃ©emed in <hi>Greece,</hi> and how much more thou maist complaine thy vnhappinesse, knowe that I am lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a woman as she is, and am called <hi>Archisilora</hi> QuÃ©ene of <hi>Lira,</hi> and with the strength of my armes, I hope to cut off this wretched head from thy accursed shoulders. And it was very true which was spoken, for when she went away from the company of the Ladies, she went to arme her selfe, with purpose to demaund battaile of the Empresse <hi>Claridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> but when she came forth, she founde them as you haue alreadye heard.</p>
               <p>The Pagan could be no more angry and wrathfull then he was, and without speaking any word, he turned &amp; stroke very strongly at the QuÃ©ene, who with no lesse fury defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her selfe, and returned his blowes with both her hands, that it made a meruailous noyse. At this present time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched the two lights of all knighthood, the Emperour of <hi>Grecia</hi> and his sonne, and with them the Giaunt and the rest of the Princes that came with them. You shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande that these were the two knights, that in the high waye they founde in cruell battaile, and meruailing verye much at the power that was in the two warriours, they stayed to behold them, not knowing who they were. The Knight of the Sunne who had his eyes more fixed on them then the rest, did knowe the Pagan, as one which had first proued his furious force, &amp; turning vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he told him all that which had hapned vnto him in the fierce battaile which he hadde fought before with him in <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they estÃ©emed much the knight with the Lilies, to sÃ©e how well and how valiauntly he did behaue himselfe, not onely in this subtill defence, which against his aduersarie he made, but also his pollicie he made in offending his enimie.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13973:161"/>
So the knight of the Sunne with the greate desire that hÃ©e had to reuenge himselfe on the Pagan, mooued his horse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him. At which time there came forth of the village a Knight with white armour, all full of Garlands of golde, made by subtill art. Likewise his shÃ©elde was white, and there was painted on it an Emperiall head, which shewed as though it had bÃ©ene cut off with a cruell knife, the throat all so bÃ©e rayed with bloud, verie artificially wrought, and when hÃ©e sawe the battaile, hÃ©e put himselfe to behold them, at such time as the valyaunt GrÃ©eke approched vnto the two knightes that were in battaile for to speake vnto them, and hÃ©e sayd: Worthie knight with the Lyllyes, for curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies sake (if this battayle be of small importaunce) that thou wouldest let me alone with this Pagan, for that I haue a iust quarrell against him. This excellent Ladie looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the knight of the Sunne as one which had neuer sÃ©ene him, meruailing much at his fayre disposition, and replyed, saying: I woulde be verie gladde sir Knight, for your great curtesie and gentle demeanour, to leaue to you the battaile, if the occasion were not of so greate waight. Therefore I dooe desire you that you would stand aside, for if my successe fall out vnfortunatly, there will time inough remaine, for to execute your anger. The Moore did well vnderstand the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde of the Knight of the Sunne, and knewe him verye well to bÃ©e the same that gaue him the order of Knighthood, and when hÃ©e sawe him, hÃ©e roared lyke a furious Lyon, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Oh vile and base Knight, to whome <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath giuen more power and strength then hÃ©e hath himselfe, come, come, and bring with thÃ©e in companie all these that bÃ©e there with thÃ©e, for of all you together I dooe estÃ©eme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, and in saying these wordes, hÃ©e pressed vnto the Knight of the Sunne, verie fiercely and with greate courage the knight of the Sunne met him in the waye, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before the QuÃ©ene, but this excellent Ladie with great lightnesse returned and did recouer her standing, and said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>

The knight with the Lillyes did put himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine before and sayde. In an euill houre doest thou vse this greate vncurtesie with one that thou doest not knowe. The fearce Pagan in all this time was not idle, but at such time as the QuÃ©ene did crosse the waye for to take her roome, the Pagan stroke her so stronglye, that it lacked but a little, that shÃ©e fell not from her horse to the ground. The knight with the Emperiall head when he sawe that, set his spurres to his horse, and sayd.</p>
               <p>O men of small estimation, come hether to mÃ©e one of you, and dooe not occupie your selues in such controuersies. And with saying these and such lyke wordes, hÃ©e stroke the QuÃ©ene such a blowe, that he made her tÃ©eth to chatter in her head, in such sorte, that shÃ©e had almost lost her fÃ©eling, but hÃ©e had no cause to boast himselfe verie much of that blowe, for that quickly she retourned his salutation with so great strength, that shÃ©e gaue him well to vnderstand her cauragious force. Nowe there beganne a rigorous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, and the Knight of the Sun remained alone with the Pagan: Oh wise and warrelyke <hi>Eliza,</hi> giue mÃ©e to drinke of that water which the nine sisters did discouer, that by the helpe of that swÃ©et liquor I may make sharpe my rude tongue, so that mixing the spÃ©ech of <hi>Mercurie</hi> with the prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse of <hi>Mars,</hi> I maye vnfolde this furious battayle which these foure knightes made, who with excÃ©eding and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull blowes stroke one another, without anie casing, that they made them whether they woulde or no, to incline their bodyes to theyr horse head, without anie fÃ©eling. In this sorte continued these valyaunt and warlyke knightes a good space, till such time as the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi> came in great hast, running with her light horse, and making a great noise, without anie consideration, but onely to bÃ©e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>My dÃ©ere and welbeloued Lord, sÃ©eing that fortune hath brought you hether at this instaunt, procure ioyntly with your reuengement to work mine against this Pagan. Then the knight of the Sunne did knowe that it was his Ladie, wherewith his strength increased, and also his anger, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the Pagan had vsed discurtesie agaynst her, and sayd: How is this thou false Pagan, that thou hast ben so hardie, for to anger and disquiet such a Ladie: Tarry, for hÃ©ere I wil giue thÃ©e thy reward according vnto thy deserts. And with a new strength and valiant courage he pressed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. This pagan was amazed in sÃ©eing his enimy to shew more strength and better courage, which continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more and more, yet for all that hÃ©e shewed no kinde of faintnesse, but rather he stroke at him such terrible blowes and with so greate strength, as at anie time before hÃ©e had not done the lyke. At this time the Emperour, (which tyll that time did beholde all that had passed, and suffered not himselfe to be knowen vnto anie, by reason that he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had his healme on his head) pulled off the same, that the more better to his contentment he might sÃ©e and beholde this furious battayle. Then the people of the Uillage

So with like furie this valiaunt Pagan past thorough amongest the people that were there, so that some he threwe downe from their horse, and others he lefte very sore hurt, and with this perillous assault he put himselfe into the thicke woods. The QuÃ©ene which was fighting with the knight of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall head, did sÃ©e very well, how that the the Moore was es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, and with the great anger which she had to sÃ©e him runne away without taking reuengement of him, she gaue so terrible a blowe vnto her aduersarie that it made him to ioyne his head with his breast, and lefte him without any remembraunce, and without any more tarrying, shÃ©e went

And there it was tolde him of his desperate run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away. The Prince would haue followed him, if the Emperour had not letted him. Likewise the Knight with the Emperiall heade came againe vnto himselfe, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haue made payment of that blow vnto his aduersary, he looked round about and could not sÃ©e her, and beholding all the rest which were in that company, he sawe that they were all well content and very ioyfull, and full of pleasure, wherefore without any more tarrying he put himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the forrest, leauing the Emperour and all the rest, verye desirous to know who he was, as also of the knight of the Lillyes: the which was straight waye tolde him by a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell of the QuÃ©enes, at the which they all remained much amazed, iudging it to be one of the most notablest things, that was in all the world.

For by reason of the water that he dronke at the fountaine, he had cleane forgotten and lost the loue he had to <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> which was the occasion of a double delight with his welbeloued Lady. This faire Empresse somewhat dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muling the sorrow which she had for the losse of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, declared it vnto her dÃ©ere beloued spouse, who with no lesse discretion, did giue her the hearing, not suffering her to knowe the griefe that he receiued, but rather comforted her, and gaue her to vnderstande by outwarde showes, that hÃ©e was very well content of all that had happened, which was vnto her great and perticular ioye and pleasure. So in this order they went talking together, till they came vnto the village, whereas they were receiued of all the people, with great ioye and reioycings, and with sundry pastimes, and there they dined: and in this sort they passed the rest of the daye.</p>
               <p>The next daye in the morning they went towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> ane there was not one who sawe the Emperor and his company but receiued great pleasure. But <hi>Sindera</hi> the Dutchesse, and Aunt vnto <hi>Archisilora,</hi> was greatly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for hir absence. As they trauailed by the way, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight of the Sunne determined to giue the Emperour to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande of all the loue that had passed betwÃ©ene him and the Empresse <hi>Claridiana.</hi> So the Emperour when he vnderstood it, was nothing sorrie for that which had past, but rather did determine to sende and call for the subiects and vassalles of the Empresse, and so in publike to marrie them together: yet at that time he did not giue him to vnderstande of the losse of the two children,</p>
               <p>So with this and like communication, they came vnto the Citie, whereas they were receiued, as vnto their estate appertayned. And at their entering into the Pallaice, there came forth to receiue them, the Princesse <hi>Tigliasa,</hi> and the faire <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who for the discontentment which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the absence of their Knights, would not goe forth of

The which did fall out cleane contrary: for that the knowledge of man doth little auaile to hinder the will of the Creator of all things. As hÃ©ereafter shall be tolde you in the third part of this historie.</p>
               <p>Now to retourne vnto the great pleasure which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the Emperour receiued for his comming: it was in such sort, that they did no other thing but make feastes and pastimes. In the meane time whilest they were making all these pastimes in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they sent to call the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes and vassalles of the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who came straight waye without anye delaye: and they which came, were the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the King <hi>Simonia,</hi> and the great Duke of <hi>Alafonte.</hi> Unto whome was declared the whole occasion wherefore they were called. And when they knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shuld obtayne for their Lord so royal a prince, they were meruailously well contented and receiued greate pleasure: and without any more tarrying they made them sure together, whereat was made great feasts and pastimes<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and there he was sworne Emperour, and they desired them, that they would goe &amp; acknowledge their lands &amp; countries, and gaue them to vnderstande, that the long absence of the Empresse was the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of many dissentions, wherein some rebellious people did begin to shew their cankered thoughts.

The QuÃ©ene looking towards that part whereas the Damsell did shew her, sawe the Barke which was verie faire and great. The Damsell lighted from her palfraie, and put her selfe in the barke, and sayd: Knight with the Lillyes, if thou wilt haue that thou sÃ©ekest, it behooueth thÃ©e to enter into this Barke with me, that I may carrie thÃ©e whereas thou shalt loose on a sodaine thy great mirth and gladnesse, thy heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in so great captiuitie, that the best remedie that thou shalt conceiue, shall be to desire the death.

And while she perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in this her purpose, shÃ©e hearde a voyce which sayde: Wo bee vnto mee, wherfore doo you in this manner so greatly torment me, let not the coueting of this bough ouercome thÃ©e: let all this euill suffice thÃ©e which thou hast bÃ©en the occasion of to mÃ©e. For perswade thy selfe it shall not profit thÃ©e any thing. Beholde I am <hi>Alpatrafio</hi> the vnfortunate Emperour of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who for that I was murtherer vnto my owne daughter, I doo suffer hÃ©ere this torment. This worthye Queene did finde greate alteration in her selfe to heare so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable a voyce, &amp; letting go the braunch out of her hands, shee looked about to sÃ©e who it shoulde bÃ©e that spake those dolefull wordes, but shÃ©e coulde not obtaine to the sight of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie one: and for to proue and sÃ©e if it woulde againe speake, shee tooke the braunch once more in her hande, and pulled it with double furie and with so greate strength, that almost shee remained hanging by it as shÃ©e was on horsebacke, wherein shÃ©e got little honour, for that shÃ©e did no more then at the first time. So shÃ©e stayed to heare what the voyce woulde saye, which vttered this spÃ©ech: O grÃ©edie Knight, why doest thou contend in such vnsatiable couetousnesse, what dost thou thinke that this siluer is not a sufficient trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? HÃ©ere I giue thÃ©e to vnderstand that thy mallice shall not haue so much strength for to atchieue to the ende of that which the bodie of the trÃ©e hath declared vnto thÃ©e. Therefore get thÃ©e hence, and let me alone with this my sorrowfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, for that there bÃ©e manie more besides thy selfe which doe torment me, and let this content thÃ©e, that by thy arme I am all bathed in bloud. This valyaunt QuÃ©ene who was attendaunt vnto all that was spoken, shÃ©e did perceiue that the sounde of the voyce came foorth of the bodye of the trÃ©e, and not beeing then cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou shalt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that by prouing at thy braunch, I well hoped to haue made an ende of this inchauntment, but this braunch of golde hath resisted mÃ©e verie much, therefore I will prooue this other which is of siluer, and without tarrying to heare her aunswere, shÃ©e layde holde on the braunch with so great furie, that shÃ©e tore it off from the trÃ©e, the braunch remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in her hands: and out of the place from whence it was torne, there issued out a streme of bloud, that all to be sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the QuÃ©enes<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> armour, in such sorte, that it neuer lost the coulour, and when she had torne it awaye shee heard the voyce with a lamentable crie to saie: O Knight, the cause of my greate affliction: O mercilesse man, that without pittie hast thus wounded me? What did mooue thee so cruelly to teare off these my sorrowfull white haires, leauing me all to be bathed in my redde bloud, make an ende to kill me with thy cruell swoorde, for that by death I shall finish the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of these cruell tormentes which I passe heere, and in so dooing I will take thee for pittifull: O cruell Knight, make an ende of this worke which thou hast begunne, and giue me heere the death.

she sawe layd along vpon a blacke Carpet two dead knights well proportioned and of greate beautie, and going more nÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to sÃ©e if shee coulde knowe them, shÃ©e knewe straight one of them to be the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> but the other shÃ©e did not knowe, for that shee hadde neuer seene him, but by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable words which were spoken by an Emperour which was at the head of them, shee vnderstoode that it shoulde bÃ©e the knight of the Sunne, and he which made that greate lamentation was the Emperour his Father, at the which shÃ©e remained greatly amazed, and hearkening vnto that which the Emperour sayde, shÃ©e hearde that he complained on Fortune, saying: Oh fortune that hath so persecuted me: Oh my sonne <hi>Alfebo,</hi> flowre of all chiualrie, is it possible that there was so much power and strength in the people of <hi>Africa</hi> that they haue depriued thÃ©e of thy lyfe, and giuen thy bodye to rest on the colde earth: With no lesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint this excellent Queene did celebrate that of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

this second companie, then at the sight of the first, but the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and sorrowful words which the Empresse vttered did moue her to beare her companie, if that at that time shÃ©e had not sÃ©ene come forth at a doore which was in the hall, a Ladie, sÃ©eming to bÃ©e of great authoritie, accompanyed with two faire Nymphs, all apparelled in russet Satten, pinked &amp; cut, and lined with grÃ©ene Satten, which coulours were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pleasant, and greatly delighted the sight. And when shÃ©e came nigh vnto the quÃ©ene she sayd: Knight, whosoeuer thou art, and doest shew thy selfe to be so furious, why doest thou hearken and giue eare vnto this lamentation: tell mÃ©e out of hande, without anie farther delaie who thou art, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou commest hether, for that thou shalt vnderstand that this place is prohibited to all knightes, except he first bring with him some signe or token of the braunch of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trÃ©e, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he who was murtherer to his owne daughter is inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if it hath ben thy fortune to atchieue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cutting either of the braunch of gold or siluer, shew it me forthwith, if not, vnderstand that thou shalt die a terrible death. This worthie QuÃ©ene who with a sober countenaunce gaue<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> eare vnto the sayings of the Ladie, and beholding much her great sobrietie: likewise the beautie of those which bare her companie, held vp the braunch of siluer in her hande, and with a high voyce she sayd: Ladie, I woulde not haue ben so bolde to haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched hether, except I had brought with me the token which you speake off: therefore I ought not to incurre the paine prouided, beholde is this it which you sÃ©e, and therwith shÃ©e shewed her braunch. The Ladie when she knew that to be the braunch of the trÃ©e that she spake of, did abate her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that she before had, and shewed a merrie countenaunce, and taking her right hand from the shoulder of the Nymph, she laide holde on the armed hand of the quÃ©ene, and holding it verie fast, she sayd: Excellent Ladie, many dayes past I was giuen to vnderstand of thy great worthinesse, and that thou shouldest giue some contentment vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afflicted hearts, wherefore come with me and I will shew thÃ©e my habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that vnto thÃ©e the sight hath bene graunted, and not

vnto anie other: come on Ladie and reioyce the selfe in the sight of that which hÃ©ereafter shall come to passe, without all doubt. And in saying these wordes she carried her in at the same doore whereas shÃ©e came forth in great hast, for that shÃ©e did knowe the tendernesse of her heart which was moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the lamentation shÃ©e heard, and there shewed vnto her greate riches and verie faire buildinges, but especiallye shÃ©e carryed her into a verie faire and foure square Court, which had at euerie corner foure pillers, and vpon the toppe of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them an Image, meruailously wrought, and euerie one of them had his title written what it did signifie, and shÃ©e tolde her that those which shÃ©e had shewed her, were kings and Princes, and famous Lordes, that were there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted. And how that all that should be made frustrate by one of the best knightes in all the world, who shall bring for his deuice blased on his shÃ©elde, a braunch of golde, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieng the same which she sawe in the first Court, in the which was inchaunted the Emperour of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Likewise he shall deliuer the daughter of the sayd Emperour, whome hÃ©e supposeth he hath murthered, and shÃ©e was the fayrest Damosell in the whole world. And for that in the end of the third booke of this historie shall be declared the rest, where you shall receiue more contentment in the reading: <hi>Lyrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo</hi> will now goe no farther hÃ©erein. And telling vnto her these and many other thinges, they went farther, and passed through verie manie and fayre halls, the which were ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the stories of the notable actes of worthie knights, but in one hall, in the middest of a Cloth, shÃ©e sawe the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a knight of a greate stature, who was nine foote in height, and armed with Purple armour, and his shÃ©elde of the same coulour, without hauing anie deuice, and his face was verie fayre. The QuÃ©ene coulde not by any meanes, but by sight thereof staie a while and beholde his greate beautie, and felt within her heart a new and strange wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of loue, which tourned afterwarde into an amorous fire. This Ladie did well perceiue her newe imaginations, and with a gracious smiling shÃ©e tooke her by the hande, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13973:170"/>
carried her out of that Chamber, (although shÃ©e coulde not bring her out of her newe conceit) shÃ©e went out so troubled, that all which the Ladie shewed her afterwardes, shÃ©e little respected, and when she thought least shÃ©e found her selfe out of the Pallaice, betweene the dÃ©epe Moate, and the fayre and rich walles, euen as one that had bÃ©ene newe awaked out of his slÃ©epe, and tourning her selfe vnto the Ladie, dissembling her newe paine she sayde. Ladie, I dooe not desire hÃ©ere to haue gotten more honour, then in that I haue obtayned the knowledge and secreate of so notable a thing as this which you haue discouered vnto mÃ©e, and more to haue atchieued the desert of this braunch, so that by you it be graunted that I maye carrye it with mÃ©e.

The time &amp; winde was so prosperous vnto them, that in a short space they arriued, &amp; toke land in the hauen of the great citie of <hi>Lira,</hi> without any contradiction. And when they were a lande, they determined to sende a Page to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund safeconduct of the Giants, giuing them to vnderstand of their comming. This gallant louer would nÃ©edes be the messenger, and therewith mounting vpon a very faire horse, he entered into the Citie, and stayed not till he came vnto the Pallayce of the Gyants, but went asking where there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding was. And strayght way they were giuen to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande thereof by a Knight, which sayde, that there was a strange knight which did demaund after them, &amp; comming before them, without showing anye humilitie or stooping downe his head, he sayd<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Giants, ther are two knights come

I doe not know wherefore these vnfortunate knights will occupy themselues in profering to defend that, which manye other would haue done, and yet were neuer able.

Their comming thether was at such time as <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far</hi> and <hi>Mandroco</hi> came forth of the Pallaice, all ready and prepared for the battaile, and brought in their companye a great number of Knights. At that time the place was very full of people, who desired secretly in their hearts, that the straunge Knights might winne the victory, that they might be cleare and at libertie from that great subiection, in the which the Gyaunts helde them: the which they thought to be almost impossible, considering the great worthinesse and strength that was in the giants. And when they wer altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, <hi>Mandroco</hi> with a milde voice sayd: Miserable knights, at such time as you offred your perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quÃ©ene <hi>Archisilora,</hi> with whom did you thinke to haue battaile, that you gaue credite, supposing your selues to haue sufficient force to execute your wils.

The anger and yre of the Giant was such, that without any more tarrying, with great fury he turned about his horse, and his father did the like, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Knights also did the same. And when they were right the one against the other, at the sound of sundry instruments of warres, they ranne the one against the other, in such sorte, that not one of them missed his blowe, but made the shiuers of the speares to flye in very small pÃ©eces in the aire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiuing any griefe.

At this time, the fierce <hi>Bulfar</hi> sÃ©eing the great resistance of his aduersarie, threw his shÃ©eld at his backe, and his sonne <hi>Mandroco</hi> did the like, &amp; both together they stroke such blowes at the knights, that without fÃ©eling it caused the horse of <hi>Rosicleer</hi> to giue a tourne in the place, and the like happened vnto <hi>Brandimardo</hi>

came forth at his visor, and setting spurres to his mightye horse, he made him to mooue like the winde, and said with a loude voyce.</p>
               <p>O vile beastes, that so villanously haue slaine him, who is more worth then both of you. HÃ©ere I doo sweare vnto you by the liuing God to force my power in such sort, that onely w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> two blowes I will send you vnto hell, which is your habitation, &amp; therwith he came vnto <hi>Mandroco,</hi> who likewise came towards him, &amp; stroke him such a blow vpon the helme, that the strength thereof little profited him, for by the fury of his arme he parted it in two pÃ©eces together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the head, so that the Giant fell down dead to the ground, &amp; by reason of his great wayght, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fall sÃ©emed almost to shake the earth. The Gyant <hi>Bulfar</hi> when he sawe his sonne dead, with so desperate a blow, roaring out against his Gods, he lifte by his sword to strike the Prince: but he, who had as much pollicie as prowes, spurred his horse a litle forwards, &amp; with a furious leape he cleared himselfe from that blow, and finding himselfe on the lefte side of <hi>Bulfar,</hi> he threw at him so terrible a foyne, that his harnesse deceiued him, and his sword entered into his body vp to the hilts, and at the pulling of his sword out, he drew out therewith his infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall soule, and he fell downe dead to the grounde. Then when the people sawe the good successe that their desires had, they began to crye out with mightie voyces, saying: Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, Libertie, and ranne vnto the Prince, some kissing his handes, some his skirtes of Maile, and some his fÃ©ete, in such sorte they pressed on him that he coulde scantly stirre himselfe, but by reason of the greate griefe and sorrowe which he had for his friend <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> who coulde not receiue anie pleasure at all in this high and mightie victory: and without any care thereof, he alighted from his horse, and went vnto him, and tooke off his healme, and lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:173"/>Then this weake knight somewhat lifting vp his eyes, and sÃ©eing himselfe in the armes of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and vnderstanding that the battaile was finished, to the honour of his Lady and mistresse, with a fÃ©eble &amp; fainting voice he sayd: Ah my Lord, and perfect friend, hÃ©ere may you sÃ©e how contrarie fortune hath bene vnto me, in that she woulde not consent that I shuld reioyce in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> triumph of this victorie: it doth not grÃ©eue me to die, for that it is in defending the right of her whom I best loued. There is nothing that doth grÃ©eue me so much, as that I cannot obtaine the reward I looked for. HÃ©ere I do desire thee my Lord, that by you she may vnderstand of all this my paine: and doe my heartie commendations vnto that my great desired <hi>Archi.</hi> HÃ©ere he could not make an ende to speake her name, but yÃ©elded vp the Ghoast, his vnfortunate bodie remaining in the armes of the Prince, and with great wÃ©eping he turned vnto the people that were there, and sayd. O you knights and Gentlemen of <hi>Lyra,</hi> how dÃ©erely is this your libertie bought, for in the recouerie thereof was slaine the best knight in all <hi>Asia.</hi> Then he sÃ©eing that there was no remedie for the harme that was done, he commaunded that hÃ©e should be carryed vnto the pallaice, and by the agrÃ©ement of all the nobles he was buried in that place whereas the kings of <hi>Lyra</hi> were accustomed to be buried. So when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> had sÃ©ene the funerall of his friend, he would staie no longer in that kingdome, but by the consent of all that were present, he left the gouernement in the power of a worthie knight and noble gentleman of the realme, and tooke his oth that straight waie they should surrender it to their quÃ©ene &amp; Ladie. And therewith he departed out of the Citie, &amp; when he came vnto the water side, and woulde haue entered into the ship in the which he came, he sawe nigh vnto it the barks wherein he was wont to trauaile, and considering y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it should not be there without occasion, without anie more deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he entered into the same, who straight waie beganne to moue her selfe with her accustomed furie, and so without tarrying in anie place, he trauailed sixe dayes &amp; sixe nightes, in the end of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the Barke brought her selfe a ground

into a faire wide and sandie Baie, whereas he sawe vppon the shoare manie knightes which made battaile against one alone knight. The Prince seeing all that passed, with great anger he went out of the Barke to helpe him, who with great courage and pollicie did defend himselfe, whereas now we will leaue them, and retourne vnto <hi>Grecia</hi> for to make an ende of our first part. You doe well remember how that the knight with the Emperiall head, when he sawe himselfe cleere of that blow which the Queene of <hi>Lyra</hi> gaue him, put himselfe into the forrest, euen vnto the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he thought that it was time, he went vnto the Court and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for the Emperours pallace, when he came thether, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted from his horse and went vp into the great hall wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Emperour was, with all them of his Court, exercising courtly pastimes and pleasures, and without making anye reuerence hee went vnto the place whereas the Emperour was, and he sayd: Good and noble Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi> this speake I for a truth (according vnto that which I haue heard reported of thÃ©e) that thou art one of those Princes that doth maintaine all iustice and equitie. The subiects and vassalls doe not alone make this report, but all the world is ful of it. And (as I vnderstand) although it be euen against thy owne person, yet thou wilt not let to doe that which is right, iustice being demaunded of thÃ©e, wherfore I doubt not but vnto me shall be graunted lisence hÃ©ere in thy Countrie to put a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vnto whom it shall thinke me best, certifieng thÃ©e that it shall be a iust thing. The Emperour who knew him by the deuice that he had on his shÃ©eld, that it was he which made the battaile with the QuÃ©ene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> with a sober countenaunce he sayd: Knight, although my fame be not such as you haue hÃ©ere published, yet demanding any of this with equitie (as you doe certifie me you will) I cannot but graunt it vnto thÃ©e. And therefore hÃ©ere I doe giue thÃ©e lisence that thou maist propone all that thy pleasure is, although it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:13973:174"/>
my selfe. The Knight who was very attendaunt to all that the Emperour sayd, and saw that license was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to aske at his pleasure, he sayd. O mightie Prince I would to God that my demaund were not that which it is, that without it I might inioye and comfort my selfe in beeing in your company, and the more that I doo certifie my selfe of thy vertue, I doo finde my selfe the more troubled, meruailing, how that in so noble a person, should remaine so great naughtinesse, as that which thou didst vse with the QuÃ©ene of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> who comforting &amp; refreshing thÃ©e, when thou arriuedst there in great pouertie and distresse, in the ende, thou didst leaue her very sorrowfull and made a mock of her. Looke well vnto it Emperour, for that thou canst not make satisfaction for so great a fault, neyther will shÃ©e take any of thÃ©e, except it be with sending thy head, I will not that thou makest any amends, but that for her, I doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thÃ©e to mortall battaile, onely thy person and mine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I may fulfill the promise that I haue made vnto her: and if it so fall out that Fortune be to me contrary, I will remaine for the payment of my fullye, with my heade out from my shoulders. And with this he helde his peace: and looking on the one side and on the other, very ioyfull to sÃ©e so goodly a company of Knights as was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time with the Emperour, he expected his aunswere. The Emperour who well vnderstoode his reasons, without showing any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in his countenaunce, aunswered. I doo not knowe whether my aunswere shall be sufficient for to excuse the fault, which the Queene without all reason doth burden me with. For the which, valiant Knight, I wold, as the QuÃ©ene hath tolde you the little reason that I had, so she shuld haue tolde you the great reason I had to doo that which I did. HÃ©ere I doo certefie thÃ©e that my thought doth not deserue, that she should be vnto me so cruell, nor extend so farre, for to desire my death. And certainly in this, the QuÃ©ene hath no reason, for that the head of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> maye doo her more seruice liuing, then it can doo being dead: but sÃ©eing it is her will. HÃ©ere I doo tell thÃ©e, that so long as I doo liue, I will
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13973:174"/>
practise no other thing but onely to pacifie her, and so lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise will I procure to keepe and defende my head, and not onely mine owne, but also the heads of those which at her commaundement doo come, thinking to take away mine: &amp; in this she shal vnderstand how much I am desirous to serue her. The battaile heere I doe graunt it vnto thee, and if thou wilt, let it be out of hand, and heere I doe promise thee Knight to procure to ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh how the Moore found himselfe troubled, when hee heard the Emperours answere, and the little reckoning that he made of the battaile, and somewhat touched in pride, hee replyed and sayd. I know well Emperour, that the greate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fidence which thou hast in thy self, maketh thee to esteeme little of the King of the <hi>Garamantes</hi> whom thou hast in thy presence: but I doe hope and trust in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that before one hower when we are in the field, to make thee to lose thy confidence. And in saying these words, he went downe out of the Pallaice, and leapt vp vpon his horse, and went into the fielde, which was right agaynst the Pallaice, ordayned for such like occasions. The Emperour demaunded for his armour, and called for that with the starres, the same which the Queene <hi>Garrofilea</hi> gaue him. So in a trice he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not without many teares of the Empresse, who sayd. Ah my Lord I do well vnderstand, that of so long absence, there can grow nothing but great troubles, as doth appeare by this sodaine battaile. The Emperor not letting her to go forwards with her talke, but casting both his armes about her necke, and with shewe of great loue, he sayd. Thou my Lady and Empresse wert the occasion of all that euill, for if it had not bene onely for the losse of thy sight, I vowe that thy Emperour would first haue dyed the death, then meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the name to be disloyall. And that in not fulfilling her intent, there should not onelye haue happened one euill, but a great number. So it was Gods will that I shuld escape out of the battaile, as more at large I will tell you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more leasure. And in this manner hÃ©e departed from the Empresse, leauing her verie sadde and sorrowfull.
<pb facs="tcp:13973:175"/>
And the Emperour went to take his horse, carrying with him the king of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> who carryed his healme, and the Prince <hi>Claueryndo</hi> who carryed his shÃ©eld, &amp; his speare the Prince of <hi>Hungaria</hi> carryed. And when they went forth of the gates of the Pallaice, they beganne to sound a greate number of instruments, which indured till such time as they were entered into the field, whereas he put on his healme, and the rest of his armour giuen him which those Princes did carrie. So with a gallant demeanour he put himselfe on the one part of the field, awaiting a token or signe that shuld be giuen them. So it was not long after that the Prince <hi>Bargandel</hi> did sound a Clarion the which he had in his hand, at the sound whereof they ranne one against another with great furie, and in the middest of their course they gaue such incounters with their Speares, not missing of their blowes, but it was with so great force that they brake all to small p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Moore had well thought that the Emperour had bene dead, and stoode still and sayd. Well, I doe beleeue Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour that thy promise shall be in vaine, and mine shall fal out true. At that time the Pagan spoke the truth, for that

The Prince <hi>Claridiano</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13973:177"/>
and the second is, that you doo giue me license to answere the messenger of <hi>Arginaria.</hi> It grieued the King very much, for that he had graunted him these two things, for that he did well vnderstand his intent: but sÃ©eing that he could doo no otherwise, he was content. Great pleasure receiued <hi>Galte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> to sÃ©e with what good grace, <hi>Claridiano</hi> did aske these two things of the king, and for to put away part of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment which they shoulde receiue at the messengers hand, he tolde vnto them some pleasaunt and ioyfull deuices. So straight way it was accorded, that <hi>Claridiano</hi> shoulde that night watch his armour, the which was giuen him by <hi>Galtenor.</hi> They were all white, and bespangled with twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling starres of golde, and his shield was also all white, and in it one onely <hi>Luzero,</hi> which did occupie all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole shield, all garnished with fine pearles, that it made them that did looke on it, almost to lose their sight, the brightnesse was so great that procÃ©eded from them, and they were such, that no Lorde in all the worlde had the like. When this famous youth was armed with them, the delight was so much, that the king <hi>Delfo</hi> receiued to sÃ©e him so well set and so gallant, that he could not refrayne but distill some salt teares from his eyes for very ioye, and sayd. My brother hÃ©ere I doo desire the soueraigne Gods, that they make me so ioyful with thy good fortune, as I am now at thy sight. The prince did watch his armour that night, and the next daye with great solemnitie, he was armed Knight, and gaue that daye many and great gifts. In the afternoone was ordained great Iustings and daunces of all sorts, of very faire Ladyes and damosells, which the King had commaunded to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the same effect. But they who did most participate of all these pleasures and pastimes, was the heroycal young man, and his nourse, whom he tooke to be his mother. So that in the Kings Pallaice, there was no other thing but feasts and pastimes, tarrying for the Embassadour that shuld come: and they of the Citie had care in the fortifieng of the same, as well with victualls, as repayring the wals, and putting all the people in good order, in such sorte, that
<pb facs="tcp:13973:178"/>
within eight dayes they found within the Citie tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Knights, meruailously well appointed, at the which <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano</hi> did receiue greate contentment. The ninth daie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hÃ©e was made knight, there was brought newes how that the messenger of <hi>Arginaria</hi> was come a lande: of the which the king bÃ©eing aduertised, hÃ©e sate himselfe in his royall seate abiding his comming, beeing accompanied with verie rich and well estÃ©emed knightes, and on his ryght hand was <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and on his lefte hande the banished King of <hi>Arginaria,</hi> and bÃ©eing all in this manner as hath bÃ©ene tolde you, the Embassadour <hi>Bruno</hi> entered into the hall, with a furious countenaunce, and without humbling or making anie kinde of reuerence, he drew nigh vnto the king, and with a wrathfull voyce he sayde: King, what diuell was that which put it in thy head, to denie that tribute that thou wert wont to giue vnto my mightie brother, and thou doest not onely denie it, but I sÃ©e that thou makest thy selfe in a readinesse to make resistaunce, for the which hÃ©ere I doe tell thÃ©e, that there is no punishment that can make satisfaction of thy boldnes and follie, notwithstanding if thou wilt clÃ©ere thy selfe better then thy ouermuch pride doeth deserue, giue mÃ©e straight waye double tribute, of that which thou art bounde to paie, but if thou doest it not, by the mightie Gods I sweare to thÃ©e, that he will take of thÃ©e and thine reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with such rigor, that the mightie Gods shall tremble when they sÃ©e it. All this he spake with so greate pride and wrath, that it made them all to quake to sÃ©e his furious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, saue onely he to whome all the honour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode belonged, who did little estÃ©eme his vnreasonable and proude wordes, but with greate sobrietie he aunswered. They dooe not denie anie thing which they ought for to giue vnto this tyraunt whome thou doest name for thy Brother, and although he did loose the Ilande that he doeth nowe pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, yet shoulde hÃ©e loose nothing that hath bene his, for that with tyrannie hÃ©e hath vsurped the same. Therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie more tarrying, get thÃ©e hence and tell thy brother, that the king of <hi>Trapobana</hi> wil not onely detaine from him

the tribute which hÃ©e doth not nor neuer did owe him, but also with armed arme he doth pretend to recouer againe all that which without reason he hath receiued &amp; carried awaie, and he doth giue him to vnderstand, that hÃ©e will not rest till such time as he doth thrust him out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iland, which with so great tyrannie he doth possesse, &amp; from which he depriued my father <hi>Galtenor.</hi> So w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this answere thou maist returne vnto him who sent thÃ©e hether, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out anie hope of other. The giant stood &amp; did behold him very much, &amp; with a fearful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance his eies turned into a sanguin coulour, &amp; laughing or smiling in manner of mocking, he said: I sÃ©e without anie outward proofe, but onely by thy foolish wordes, that thou art but a young and new made knight, &amp; as such a one I wil est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ã©eme &amp; intreate thÃ©e: &amp; if my comming hether were not more for a messenger, then for a warriour, for this thy boldnesse which thou dost shew, I would vse thÃ©e in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere shuld little auaile thÃ©e, &amp; yet I should remaine satisfied of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anger which thou hast caused me to haue. The prince <hi>Claridiano</hi> when he heard that with so great disdaine he was rauiled, with as much anger he went towards him, and with an altered voice he sayd: By all the Gods that are in heauen I sweare vnto thÃ©e, if I did not consider &amp; respect the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie which is due and ought to be shewed to Embassadours, I would bereaue thÃ©e of this thy brauerie, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when thou art before such a king as now thou art, thou shouldest bridle thy tongue, &amp; euer after haue in remembraunce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I would giue thÃ©e, but not respecting thy follie, but onely my estate, I will stay my selfe from correcting of this thy ouermuch pride.

The Prince when hÃ©e sawe this, stayed without doing anie more harme, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hÃ©e would not disgrace the king, but put himself on the one side: the king did shew himselfe verie much grÃ©eued for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, for if it had not ben done by him which did it, who so euer els should haue done it, would hardly haue escaped w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

with the great paine he felt, vnderstood all that was spoken, and without making anie aunswere, hee went out of the kings Pallaice, and returned vnto his Galleyes where hÃ©e was cured, and put his Sailes into the power of the winde, and in a verie short time he ariued at <hi>Arginaria,</hi> and went a shoare, carrying all his face wrapt and bound with bondes and rowles of linnen cloth, and his mouth all to be plaistred. In this sorte he went and presented himselfe before his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and sayd: I haue giuen thy Embassage vnto king <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo,</hi> as thou hast commaunded me, and to giue me aunswere there arose vp a new and young knight, whom I doe beleeue and as I haue proued the same, that he hath in his bodie all the infernall strength, and in his fistes all the Legyons of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells that are in hell, as it did appeare by the greate furye wherewith he hurt mÃ©e, that he did not onely strike out my tÃ©eth, but also threw me to the ground as though I had bene a child.

But when this <hi>Arginarian</hi> king heard this, hee arose vp and went from him with so much wrath and anger, that he sÃ©emed rather a Diuell then a man: and without taking anie farther counsell, he commaunded to assemble all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together, and that they should bÃ©e called with all the spÃ©ed that possible might bÃ©e, and when they were come all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he found that there were two thousand horse men, and sixe thousand foote men, &amp; made Captaine generall ouer them two Gyants &amp; brothers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were Lordes of one Iland, ioyning

One of the ministers that alwayes did assist them in their sacrifices, sayd with a bolde courage. Wherefore do you so euill intreate and misuse your Gods.

And therewith he threwe his great speare at the Giant, that without hauing anye power to defend himselfe from that blowe it pearced his shield, and bored through his armour, and not staieng there, the sharpe poynt passed through his body from the one side to the other taking from him that miserable s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At all that passed, was present the proud &amp; strong <hi>Geredeon,</hi> who with an infernall wrath threw fire from him, and in great hast called for his armor: at which time the other giant, brother vnto <hi>Belorophonte,</hi> no lesse irefull and furious, whose name was <hi>Bolifo,</hi> sayde with a great voyce. Mightie <hi>Geredeon,</hi> and Lorde, let me take this reuengement, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of right it appertaineth more vnto me, then vnto thÃ©e. And heere I dooe promise thÃ©e (or els the Gods shall be false in dooing iustice, and my strong arme without vertue) that I will take cruell reuengement of that diuell: and so without speaking moe wordes, he went towards the place wheras this new knight was, who without any feare with a great speare in his hand, did tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie his comming. This Giant who was blinded with his vnreasonable anger without any reasoning, he set spurs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Elephant, and likewise, the new knight set spurres to his horse, and met together in the middest of their course, so that neither of them lost his blowe: but the incounter was with so great force, that the Gyant did pearce through the shÃ©eld of the Prince, without doing anie other harme, &amp; the speare shiuered all to pÃ©eces, but this warlike youth with his speare gaue vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant so strong an incounter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through his shÃ©eld, &amp; made him to fall backwards vpon the crouper of his Elephant, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made the great beast to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with his legs, and falling downe he fell vpon one of the giants legs. The Prince when he saw him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extremitie, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not arise, he leapt from his horse w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great lightnes, &amp; did help him to take out his leg from vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Elephant: likewise he did helpe him to arise vpon his fÃ©ete, and sayd.

The Gyant without any consideration of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie showed him, clasped fast his broad sword, striking a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fearfull blow at the Prince, who by leaping on the one side, caused him to loose his blowe, &amp; stepping on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side, he gaue him such a stroke vpon the waste, that the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse broke, and his sword hid it selfe in the Giants flesh, and hurt him very sore, whereat ran out very much bloud.

This diuelish giant, when he saw him in that case, would haue stroke him another blowe: but at such time as he would haue discharged it, this inuincible Knight arose vp with so great wrath, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a thicke smoke came out of his visor, and without any more tarrying, he threw the pÃ©ece of the shield that remained from him, and with a light leape he ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his enemie, and stroke him so horrible and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a blow vpon his helme, that it did little profite him the strength of the stÃ©ele, but he cut it in two pÃ©eces, head &amp; all, and he fell downe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground.

Knight, I know not what to saye vnto so hainous a matter that by thÃ©e is committed against me, for sÃ©eing thy great boldnesse which thou hast had to disquiet and anger me, it doth cause me to procure to haue reuengement of thÃ©e. And to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie I sÃ©e thou art one alone knight, and therefore I dooe take it for a dishonour and rebuke to lift vp my furious arme agaynst thÃ©e. Therfore that which I desire thÃ©e, is this, that thou doest returne vnto the citie and cause to be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one hundreth of the best knights, chosen out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the rest, and sÃ©e that you come straight againe, for that of you all together, I wil take this my desired reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And yet for all this, I doe tell thÃ©e, I shall not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the great anger &amp; wrath the which I haue against thÃ©e. Whosoeuer had bene present to haue heard him speake these wordes woulde haue trembled with feare, but hee in whome feare could neuer take place, and one which tooke no care nor did not esteeme his words, sayde: I doe not knowe wherevppon thou doest staye, if thou doest meane to take reuengement of him who hath so much offended thÃ©e, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye hauing him before thÃ©e: but thou shalt vnderstande, thou diuellish Gyant, that thy furious looke, nor thy beastlye body, neither thy monstrous members, can put me in feare, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being as thou art, furnished w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a cruell heart, &amp; so great a friend vnto tyranie, &amp; hÃ©ere I tell thÃ©e, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the aduauntage
<pb facs="tcp:13973:184"/>
which thou biddest me to take, I doe not desire it, neither I will not take it, but rather I will thÃ©e that thou make thy selfe readie for thy defence, and procure if thou canst to driue me out of the field, and when thou hast ouercome me and got the victorie, then maist thou make thy combat with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ninetie and nine. And with this he did put himselfe a parte, shaking his sword with a meruailous good grace. When the Gyant sawe this, in manner of mocking he sayd: Go get thÃ©e hence thou vile thing, and take vnto thÃ©e the fauour and aide which I doe will thee, and doe not thinke that thou shalt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of me so honourable and end, to be slaine of me in equall battaile. HÃ©ere this new knight by anie meanes coulde not suffer his outragious arrogancie, but sayd vnto him: Thou cruell tyrant, subiect to all pride, defend thy selfe, and leaue off these reuilinges and boastes. And in saying these wordes the Prince pressed to the Gyant, and stroke at him so strong a blow vpon one of his thighs, that his strong armour did fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie, and he made a little wound, out of the which issued very much bloud. When this infernall monster felt himselfe thus hurt, and sÃ©eing that he made little account of him, but rather despised his wordes, without anie more tarrying, he lift vp a verie heauie mase of yron, which was greate and long, and had hanging at the ende thereof fiue balles of stÃ©ele, each of them hanged by a stÃ©ele chaine of greate strength. The king <hi>Delfo</hi> was meruailously troubled, when he sawe the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med weapon which was raised in the aire, making a greate noise, and with greate furie readie to be discharged vpon the head of this warlike knight, who when he saw it comming, with his accustomed lightnesse did procure to deliuer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from so horrible a blowe, and in such sort it came, that all those fiue balls fell together on the ground, at which fall by reason of the great waight of the mase, he was constrained to fall forwards with the blowe. The Prince which at that time was not without care, but sÃ©eing him in that sorte, hÃ©e stepped quickly vnto him, &amp; stroke him so mightie and great a blow vpon his strong helme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great strength wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was giuen, did constraine the gyant by pure force to

The Princes swoord was not so fine &amp; strong to suffer so great strokes, but broke in pÃ©eces with those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blowes, which was the occasion that as then the battel was not finished. So the Prince when he saw himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his swoord, thought it best to withdrawe himselfe backe, and the <hi>Arginarian</hi> king when he beheld himselfe so vsed, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing terrible rorings, he arose vp, so that he made all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth to shake, and when he was on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Gyaunt felt this great harme, he let loose his holde from the mase with his left hand, and clapped it vnto his face. The new knight, who receiued no griefe at his extremitie, but waying the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie into which he was driuen, for lacke of a weapon, but seeing the Gyant occupyed in feeling of his face, and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bodie at the griefe thereof, he did procure to winne from him his mase, and giuing a contrarie leap, as the Ounce doth when she is oppressed by the hunter, layed ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The Gyant when he saw that he had lost his mase, and that it was in the power of his enimie, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnto him for to catch him betwÃ©ene his armes, but this new knight, who was nothing desirous of such imbrasing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himselfe from the same by putting himselfe on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side, and as the Gyant passed by, he stroke him with that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mase so terrible a blow on the backe, that he made him to go forwards spite of his tÃ©eth, which made him forget to desire anie more to come to wrastle. So when the Gyant had stretched himselfe vpright, he drew out his broad and sharpe sword, and with a gallant demeanour, his sword all aloft, he pressed vnto the new knight, who was with his mase readie at his standing, abiding his comming. The new knight did first discharge his blow, for that he might strike him a farre of, and chaunced with one of the balls to hit him vpon the left arme, with so strong a blowe, that the bone of the wrist he brake in pÃ©eces, which made the Gyant to loose his furious blowe.

In me thou foundest so much fidelitie, that I did furnish thÃ©e with armour and horse, that with them thou shouldst delyuer me from those, which did sÃ©eke to haue me against my will: But I with my good will did yÃ©eld my selfe, I say my selfe vnto him, which now doth sÃ©eke my death. Ah Emperour, remember, that I sawe thÃ©e depriued of all helpe: an vnhappy day for me, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in making much of thÃ©e, and giuing thÃ©e ioye, I bereaued my selfe of all, and lost the possession of my libertie and honour: and although thou hadst not estÃ©emed, nor tooke any care of the sorrowfull QuÃ©ene of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> yet thou shouldest not haue moued thy selfe to haue made a mocke of the perfecte loue which I did shew thÃ©e, and the great desire that I had to serue thÃ©e. Thou shouldest haue had some care and griefe sÃ©eing that I defended thÃ©e from all my Nobles &amp; Knights who sought thy death, thou hauing depriued so manye of my knights of their liues: thou shouldest haue had pitie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that had pitie on thÃ©e. O loue, that so quickly diddest make me blinde, &amp; depriuedst me of the knowledge which I should

haue had, vnto my royall highnesse. O Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi> I being blinde with the loue of thÃ©e, did deny my honestie, which I ought to haue kepte. If thou hadst pretended to mocke me, thou shouldst haue put me out of all doubt, and not haue suffered me, to loose so much as I haue lost for thy sake, but haue procured that I might haue eschewed all this harme, whereof thou hast bene the occasion. Tell me, why didst thou not suffer me to execute my will, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I might haue opened my white breast with that sharpe sword: it had ben better for me to haue dyed then, than now, for now liuing, for thÃ©e I dayly dye. Remember thy selfe Emperour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the harme that will come hÃ©erof, and doo not vse so much crueltie with them, that haue not deserued it at thy handes. Haue thou a care vnto the pawn which thou didst leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde thÃ©e, &amp; let it be an occasion that thou dost retourne to sÃ©e me.

O false Emperour, diddest thou not sÃ©e that she was not a ladie to be thus moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and deceiued. Surely thou hast recouered to thy selfe a verie good name, for the exalting of thy lygnage. Thy sonne whom we honour there for a God, may well praise himselfe for his descent, in hauing thÃ©e for his father. O false and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, is this the inheritaunce which thou diddest inherit of thy most famous bloud? Is this the great loyaltie which thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est shew vnto thy sonnes? O vile Greeke, how doe the Gods consent that so disloyall a knight should liue in the world. Is it not possible that these sorrowfull &amp; continuall complaints of <hi>Tinacria</hi> doe not open your eares, and cause you to sende downe punishment, for this greate offence. O ingratefull Gods, receiue the sacrifice of my chastitie in paiment of the reuengement which from your high heauens I hope shall bÃ©e done vpon this counterfait without all fayth, and make that my bloud hÃ©ere shed vpon this stoore, maye shewe the single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and cleane loue of <hi>Garofil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in vttering of these &amp; such like sorrowes she tooke forth a naked sword which shÃ©e brought readie for the same effect, and put the pomell to the ground, and cast her breast vpon the point, the which she did with so great hast, that the Emperour nor anie of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there present could not succour her, nor take her from doing that fact. All that were present remained verie much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to see so sodaine a mischaunce. The Emperour verie full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

would not consent that any one should speake a word vnto him. The couragious Empresse with a royall stomacke &amp; great discretion, dissembling her griefe in the best wise shÃ©e could, commaunded her body to be caried out of the pallaice, and in the Court of the pallaice she commanned to be made a rich tombe, in the which she was buried: there was made her proportion, which did shew what chaunced vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: and about the tombe was written an Epitaph, which did declare the occasion of her death. All the time that this damsell was a burying, the Emperour neuer came forth out of his closet, neither would he haue come forth when hÃ©e did, and if it had not bene by the great importance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. Whereas now we will leaue them, for to tell you of the chaunces and aduentures which hapned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince <hi>Eleno,</hi> the time that he trauailed in the world, the which for that he was as noble as warlyke, and of great strength, it is not reason, that he should passe so long without making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mention of him. You doo well remember how he wente out of <hi>Numidia,</hi> with one onely Page, putting himselfe to sea, in that inchaunted barke of the Knight of the Sunne. He was so heauie and sorrowfull for the death of his Ladie and Mistresse, that he was cleane changed, and appeared not to be him that he was woont, neither had he so great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to gouerne himselfe. In this manner he trauayled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a whole yeare, and neuer could mÃ©ete with <hi>Brenio,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he was commaunded to giue the letter from <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> neither could he heare in any place whersoeuer he came, where he might goe to sÃ©eke him: in which his trauaile, he did not let but to mÃ©ete with some aduentures, the which, with great honour to his person, be finished. Yet for all this he could haue no ease of his sorrow &amp; griefe, which brought him in such perplexitie, that if he had not considered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great losse of his soule, many times he would haue slain himselfe, So it happened y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one morning very early, the barke had put her selfe a ground, giuing him to vnderstand, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite there for him to goe a lande. The Prince who was very desirous thereof, quickly went a shore, and after him
<pb facs="tcp:13973:190"/>
his page, who as you haue heard, that by reason of the great hast that the barke made, he coulde not retourne a lande to <hi>Numidia.</hi> His name was called <hi>Fabio,</hi> who was to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster such companye that many times he would comforte the Prince, when he was most troubled with very comfortable words and perswasions, and did serue him with great loue and fidelitie. The Prince and his Page began to trauayle a foote with an easie pace through a narow and straight path, and with a meruailous and diligent eye, he did beholde that countrey, and it sÃ©emed vnto him, that he should know it, &amp; that before that time he had passed by that waye: but the firme loue that he had to <hi>Lidia,</hi> was the occasion that it was out of his remembraunce. So with this sorrowe he trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, till such time as <hi>Phoebus</hi> had passed the fourth parte of his iourney, when that being wery with the long way, &amp; the great waight of his armor, he was forced to take some rest &amp; ease, vnder the fresh &amp; grÃ©ene mirtle trÃ©es, whose leaues did hath themselues in a faire &amp; clÃ©ere fountaine, whereas he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a new to haue in remembrance his former paine, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of Fortune, he published his great griefe, making thow of the great sorrow that he felt, &amp; although he was we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of complaining, &amp; seeing himselfe so without all remedye, he called for his lute, for that <hi>Fabio</hi> did alwayes carry with him, &amp; taking it in his hands, onely to giue some ease vnto his tormented hart, he began to sing these verses following.</p>

               <p>His Page <hi>Fabio</hi> did cause him to leaue off his singing, for with the great attention that he gaue to heare his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he likewise heard a lamentable sound, which sÃ©emed to be of a Lady. Likewise the Prince, when he had ended his swÃ©ete musicke, did hearken to heare it: and giuing a very attentiue eare, that although she did complaine with a lowe voyce, yet he might heare that the sound of the voice, came forth of the thickest from amongst those trÃ©es: and without any more tarrying, he left his lute with his Page, and went that way from which he thought the voyce came, and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went, the better he might heare, that weake and fÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voyce. Still he went forwards, til such time as he might see who it was that made that lamentation.

The Prince came vnto her, and before that he sayd any word, he did vntie her, and cut the cordes wherewith she was bound, and tooke a gowne which was there of the Ladyes, and couered her delicate and white bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. The Ladie was very much ashamed to sÃ©e her selfe loose and at libertie: and sitting downe vnder a grÃ©ene Oake, the Prince asked of her who he was, that without respect of his owne honestie and honour, had lefte her in that sort. This fayre Lady sayd: Knight, thou shalt vnderstand that I am Daughter vnto a verye good Knight and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who was Lorde ouer thrÃ©e Castles of the best in all this Countrey.
<q>My Fathers name was <hi>Cosdros,</hi>

he was one of them that was slaine by the handes of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marandus,</hi> whom afterwardes the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> slew in battaile. So I remained all alone, very much made off, &amp; well beloued of the widdowe my mother, and we kepte our selues in a very faire castle of ours, not far from this place, whereas we did passe our solitary liues. So I was required of loue, of a Gentleman, more richer in goodes and landes, than in linage or vertue, and I vnderstanding his litle esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, did alwayes esteeme him as little, and neuer made any reckoning of his messages: the which was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that his desire was the more stronger, in such sorte, that he sÃ©eing himselfe by me not estÃ©emed, but put off, with the great griefe that he receiued for my loue, he dyed, and at the houre of his death, he neuer left naming of, <hi>Felina, the cause of all my harme.</hi> At such time as he dyed there was a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his present: and hearing him to declare the causer of his death, there kindeled in him so much anger and wrath, that he bare vnto me a perpetuall hatred and did procure to haue amends for the death of his brother. So it hapned on a time, that I went out of the Castle without any mistrust, in the company of other two damsells, at which time I was stole away by him, and other foure Knightes, who broughte me vnto this place, which is to my great sorrow and grÃ©efe, whereas they bound me in that sort as thou hast found me gentle Knight, and not content hÃ©erewith (but for my more paine and sorrow) they left me naked, with greater desire to die then to liue.</q>

This faire Ladye was somewhat comforted with the offer of the Knight, and gaue him great thanks for the fauor which he did offer her. In this sort they passed the rest of the night that remained,

The Prince receiued great delight at the sight of him, and taking him by the bridle, he leaped on his back, and went to sÃ©eke the Ladyes Palfraie, which was let loose amongst those thicke trÃ©es, and they found him fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a faire and grÃ©ene medowe, adorned with many fresh and swÃ©ete flowers. So his page leapt on his backe, &amp; tooke the Ladie behinde him, and trauailed through a narow and well beaten path which brought them into a broad waie that carried them into a verie great and large plaine, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

him a mightie blow vpon his helme with all his strength: but this <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince made little account thereof: and passing by he stroke him a blow vpon his shield, and for that his blow could extend no farther, he remained with his life, otherwise it had cost him the price thereof, for it parted his shield in two pÃ©eces. The Knight returned, and gaue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother blow, that it made the sparks of fire to fly out of his healme. Then the <hi>Dacian</hi> full of yre, let goe his shield, and clasped fast his sword in both his hands, and stroke him so terrible a blow vpon his helme, that he cut helme and heade in two pÃ©eces, and he fell down dead to the earth. The other seeing their companion dead, all thrÃ©e together set vpon him: but this valiant <hi>Dacian</hi> who in such like aduentures neuer had any feare, did receiue them with his accustomed furye, striking on them both on the right and lefte hand with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall blowes. In the meane time, this afflicted Lady, when she sawe the Knight dead, which caused her dishonour<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> lyke a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lionesse she went towards him and sayd. Oh howe the gods haue giuen thÃ©e thy paiment for the dishonor, which thou hast done me: yet she said. O heauie <hi>Felina,</hi> what doth this reuengement profite thy honour, being lost, it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great riches vnto me, that by the death of him which hath robbed me of it, it might be restored me again. Oh my gods, I am in no falt, in the loosing of my chastitie, for that it was violently taken from me, in the thicke forrest. There shall be none able to disturbe, but that I will execute my fury vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my selfe, although I doo not deserue the same: and in saying these words, she tooke the sword of that dead knight, and put the poynt to her breast, and threw her selfe thereon, in such sort, that <hi>Fabio</hi> could not succour her, although with great hast he would haue done it. The <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head on the one side, and saw the harme done, he pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed forwards with great furie and yrefull wrath, and lifte vp his sword, and stroke such a blow at one of them vppon his right arme, that arme and sworde together fell to the ground, and strayght tourned vnto another, and with an ouerthwart blowe, he stroke him on the making fast of his

But the <hi>Dacian</hi> perceiuing it, before that hÃ©e could put in execution his desire, he stroke him such a blow vpon his helme, that being parted in pÃ©eces with the head, he made him to beare company with his dead companions. So when he had concluded this battaile, he went vnto the dead Lady, and hauing great sorrow to sÃ©e her he pulled the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die sword out of her body, and commaunded <hi>Fabio</hi> that in the best manner he could to make a graue, and to bury her. The <hi>Dacian</hi> did helpe him all that he could, and bÃ©eing done vnto their contentment, he put an Epitaph ouer her, which was in this wife.</p>

How do we know, answered the shepheard: he is of such strength and subtiltie, that he doth not onely shew his force vpon vs, but also he is the occasion that we doo occupie our imaginations in his delights (which is so greate a torment that we cannot receiue a greater) he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that our cattell (that doe not deserue anye such harme) lacke their good fÃ©eding which wÃ©e shoulde procure, the which our small regarde doeth appeare in theyr weake and leane bodyes, lowing more time for hunger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for too much fÃ©eding or good pasture.</p>

The which words was the occasion, that the Prince <hi>Eleno</hi> was constrained to doe that, which since his departure out of <hi>Dacia</hi> he did not, which was, that he laughed to heare the simplicitie of this shepheard, and taking in hand to aunswere him, he sayd: Friend, I doe tell thÃ©e that thy resistaunce is great: likewise thy vnderstanding is verie much, that being conuersant dayly and hearing the great complaints and communication of so amorous sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, thou art not intangled with the same. And hÃ©ere I do desire thÃ©e, that thou hold thy selfe firme in the same, and kÃ©ep thy selfe still as thou art, least peraduenture that which thou doest now call follie, hÃ©ereafter thou wilt call discreation and wisedome. Thou mayst now well account thy selfe happie, for that without all care and sorrow, thou mayst reuile them who doth complaine of so manie miseries. With a greate laughter this shepheard aunswered and sayd: Nowe gentle Knight, I doe tell thÃ©e, that I will as little contend with thÃ©e as with thy companions, for that it sÃ©emeth vnto mÃ©e that thou art also a vassall vnto that foolish loue, and I doe more estÃ©eme my libertie, thus simple as thou doest sÃ©e mÃ©e, then all the wisedome which thou dost presume to haue: it is much better for the shepheard to haue care and kÃ©epe of his cattell, to guide them in good fÃ©eding, and not euerie small time to call for his crowde, and singing two thousand songes, the
<pb facs="tcp:13973:195"/>
which the Diuell cannot vnderstand, and although they sing them, yet I thinke they vnderstand them not themselues. So one of his companions cut off his reasons and sayde: <hi>Tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> doest thou not know, how at mine owne libertie, in times past I did gouerne my selfe, and mocking and iesting at them who did publish the lyke complaintes.

The shepheard
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13973:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did declare vnto him all that hath bene tolde you in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie past of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and of all that passed with the QuÃ©ene. <hi>Tarido,</hi> who of all this had no care, but onely to the fÃ©eding of his cattell, did breake off this conuersation, in rising vp to put abroad his Cattel into the grÃ©ene medowes, the other shepheardes that were in companie with <hi>Tarido,</hi> desired that the night wer come, for to returne and to reioyce themselues in hearing the swÃ©et and well consorted musicke of the Prince, &amp; so they made agrÃ©ement to returne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place, but it fell not out as they had determined, for that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a sodaine and vnawares <hi>Eleno</hi> heard a verie dolorous sigh towards his left hand, which was so terrible, heauy, and bitter, that it made him giue attentiue eare to sÃ©e if he coulde vnderstand what it should be, and with the quiet eare that he gaue, he might discerne that the occasion of all that euill was loue, which caused him to say: Oh almightie God, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that this is the place wher in olde time they reported to bÃ©e planted the dwelling of the Goddesse <hi>Venus,</hi> for that since my comming hether to take my rest, I haue hearde no other thing but lamentations, and so with making the least noise possible, he arose vp and began to goe towards the place whereas he might sÃ©e what it was, and there hÃ©e behelde a knight verie well armed, which thou didde alight from his horse, vnder a fayre and grÃ©ene Myrtle trÃ©e, his armour was all russet, and full of barres of blacke stÃ©ele, which shewed to be a verie sadde, sorrowfull, and heauie enamelling<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> hÃ©e was somewhat of a bigge stature of bodie and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and there sÃ©emed by his disposition to bÃ©e in him greate vertue, and with sorrowfull sighes hÃ©e laide himselfe downe on the grÃ©ene grasse, and with sadde and heauy words he sayd.</p>
               <p>Ah heauie and peruerse fortune why doost thou consent that so naughtie and euill a man as I am doe liue so long: Oh my <hi>Lidia,</hi> with how much reason maist thou complaine of the cruell outrage that thou receiuedst at the handes of <hi>Brenio,</hi> bÃ©eing nothing of him considered:
<q>O <hi>Brenio, Brenio,</hi> whereon was thy thought &amp; vnderstanding<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> which did induce
<pb facs="tcp:13973:197"/>
thÃ©e to commit so great euill, in leauing all alone and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort, the thing, of whome thou wert most beloued in the world, giuing and leauing her, vnto the will of the wilde and furious beasts. It is possible indÃ©ede that they will haue more compassion on thee my <hi>Lidia,</hi> then he who had more reason to comfort and loue thÃ©e. Oh cruell, and without all faith, thou wert born into this world, for thy own torment, when with thy selfe thou didst consent to commit so greate treason. Where was thy vnderstanding that thou couldest not remember thy selfe, &amp; take pitie on her, that did forsake her affinitie and Countrey, for thÃ©e and thy loue. O <hi>Lidia,</hi> who made me to forget all the great paines and trauaile which thou tookest, in wandring by lande alone lamenting, and sometimes by sea sorrowing, and all for to set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie him, who lefte thÃ©e prisoner amongst the wilde beastes. Oh happy beast is he, that chaunceth to bury thÃ©e in his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and woe be vnto me traitor, without any knowledge of vertue or pittie. What doth it now profite me to fill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire with my lamentations, sÃ©eing that the harme and euill is alreadie past, and without all remedy or hope of comfort: </q>&amp; hÃ©erewith he gaue a terrible and grieuous sigh, &amp; so held his peace.
<hi>Don Eleno</hi> by those heauie and sorrowfull wÃ©epings together with his reasons which he heard, knewe him to bÃ©e that <hi>Brenio,</hi> whom so long time he had laboured to sÃ©eke and find out with so great trauaile, and knew him to be the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the death of his Lady and Mistresse, the paine and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe was so extreame the which he felt, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained without anie fÃ©eling to fall down to the ground, but yet the furie of his couragious heart woulde not giue place that he should so remaine long, but straight wayes with the great anguish that he had, he arose vp againe on foote, with great desire to fight with <hi>Brenio,</hi> but calling to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>brance all that which was commanded him, he would first performe the same, in giuing him the letter, and then when hÃ©e hadde made an ende of reading the same, to demaunde of him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> So with this thought and determination, he went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place whereas <hi>Brenio</hi> was, who, when he heard the

noyse, straight wayes on his fÃ©ete: then <hi>Eleno</hi> did salute him with a voyce somewhat heauie. And <hi>Brenio</hi> did return vnto him his salutation, with no lesse showe of griefe. Then this amorous <hi>Eleno,</hi> tooke forth the letter out of the place, whereas so long time he had kept it, and taking it into his hand he sayd.
<q>Is it possible that thou art y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forgetful and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall <hi>Brenio,</hi> the which left <hi>Lidia,</hi> with so great paine and sorrow, all alone in the power, of the wilde beasts.</q> 
                  <hi>Brenio</hi> when he heard him to saye these words, he began to behold him, although his eyes were all to be blubbered and wearie with wÃ©epings, he aunswered him and sayd.
<q>I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thÃ©e gentle Knight, that which the high heauens doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

but with an inward lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, which did torment his hart, he called continually vpon <hi>Lidia,</hi> and with that diuellish fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wherin he was, he drew out his dagger, and lifting vp the skirte of his shirt of mayle, he thrust it into his body, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himself this vnhappy death, with calling vpon <hi>Lidia,</hi> he finished his life. The <hi>Dacian</hi> knight remained in a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion to see this sodayne chaunce, and that in such sort, that he could put no remedy therein, but with the great heauines and sorrow, that he receiued, he fell downe in a sounde, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remembraunce of himselfe. The Page which <hi>Eleno</hi> brought with him, did then procure all remedies that were possible for to bring him againe vnto his remembrance, and laboured to doe it with great loue, but yet for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could do or procure, ther was no possibilitie of his recouery, til such time as <hi>Phoebus</hi> had made an end of his iourney, &amp; that <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> had begun hir gouernment, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he began to come a litle to himselfe, &amp; looking on the one side, and sawe that <hi>Brenio</hi> lay dead by his side, with a dolorous voice he said vnto his page.

At this time he had great nÃ©ede of the force and strength of his chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian courage, for to assist him that he did not that, which should cause him to beare company with this dead <hi>Brenio.</hi> His Page <hi>Fabio</hi> did very much comfort him, and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by all meanes to giue him ease: but all that euer he could doo did profit very little, or giue any contentment vnto his paine, till such time as he hearde a greate noyse of armed knights, which was the occasion that he came vnto himselfe, and for that he would not be discouered, he put him selfe into the thickest of the bushes, &amp; with the helpe of <hi>Fabio</hi>; he carryed <hi>Brenio,</hi> drawing him from the place wher he was, and couered him with boughes and leaues, till such time as they might haue opportunitie to burie him, as hÃ©ereafter you shall vnderstand. So there he continued all that night till the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13973:199"/>
morning, with great sorrow and paine, lamenting much his vnhappy lot, in a place whereas he could not be discouerd or heard, not for any feare that was in him, but onely to haue time to lament, weepe &amp; bewaile his vnhappy fortune. Then at such time as the bright <hi>Apollo,</hi> did spred abroade his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den beames, ouer all the fields and cragged mountaines, he did perceiue that those which did lodge themselues nigh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place wheras he was, did procure to depart, he let them goe, without any desire to know who they were, but rather being still, did let them passe forwards on their way, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to put in execution his former intent. But first of all he caused to vnarme <hi>Brenio</hi> of his armour, the which was according vnto his passion, in colour and all things, and as strong as a Diamond, &amp; made by Arte Magicke, with great lamentation he armed himselfe with them, and tooke also his shield, which was all of a russet field, and in the midst ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was put <hi>Cupide</hi> with two faces, the one was very faire and bound with a cloath about his eyes, and the other was made meruailous fierce and furious. He continued and was so long in arming himselfe, that he heard a great number of Knights, which passed along by the sides of the forrest, and amongst them there was a dolorous lamentation, which sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be of Ladyes and Damsels, and it sÃ©emed that they were forced and constrained against their wills, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the courage of this <hi>Dacian,</hi> to desire to know what it was. And leaping vpon his horse, his Page tooke the horse of <hi>Brenio,</hi> which was very good, &amp; with as little noyse as was possible, they went out of the forrest into the high waye, whereas they might sÃ©e all that which in the chapter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall be told you.</p>

And there he discouered thirtie Knights, which rode before a chariot, that was drawen with foure horses, and therein a companye of Ladies and damsels, apparailed with meruailous rich robes, making great lamentation and sorrowe: and in the midst amongst them, ther was a very faire Lady, who had before her two childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: and before the Chariot rode a Giant of a fierce and furious countenaunce mounted on a wonderful beast, and after the same went another giant, not altogether so furious as the first, that was mounted on a mightie horse: these made great hast to trauaile forwards. When this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Dacian</hi> saw this aduenture, he was in a great confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that he found himselfe so leane and weake, yet for all that, the great valour of his person, and courage of his hart, would not suffer anye sluggishnesse, but determined to set them at libertie, and to punish so great outrage, or els to die in the demaunde. And with this determination he said. Let life suffer the paine, and let not the honour be blotted with cowardnesse, and perusing well his armour, he committed himselfe vnto God, and issued out of the forrest with a swift pace, at such time as the Chariot with the great hast that it made, had passed by a good space, and setting spurres, vnto his horse, he made him to flye lyke the winde, and with a high voyce he bad them tarrie. At which calling, the Giant that was hindermost looked backe, and when he sawe that it was a Knight that called him, and that he came running towards him with great swiftnesse, he said vnto those that gouerned the Chariot. Goe and kÃ©epe on your waye, and let me alone to sÃ©e what that vnhappie creature would haue: and he turned about his horse, at such time as that warlike <hi>Dacian,</hi> was come nigh vnto him, the Gyant sayd vnto him: Knight what hast is this that thou makest. The <hi>Dacian</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: It is to amend if I maye this outrage which I
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13973:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
suppose thou dost vnto those Ladyes, which thou dost carrie away with thÃ©e in the waggon. The Giant smiling, and as it wer, sÃ©eming to haue him in derision, disdainfully sayd. I doo tell thÃ©e of a truth knight, that if I did not belÃ©eue, that folly doth make thÃ©e to speake that which thou hast vttered, thou mightest well take me to be the vilest person in the world<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to haue so small courage, to put my selfe before one alone Knight in this demand. The <hi>Dacian</hi> did well perceiue that these words proceeded of great pride &amp; presumption, and without giuing him any aunswere, he drew out his sharpe sworde, and then without anye more tarrying, he stroke him vpon his helme so great a blowe, that it sounded like a bell, and made him to decline his head downe to his breast. But straight way he had his payment for the same, for that the Gyant layd hold on his great and cutting sword, &amp; with straunge swiftnesse, he stroke him vppon the fine and harde helme, that he almost made him to loose his fÃ©eling. By which blow, this couragious <hi>Eleno</hi> perceiued, that it stoode him in hand, not to be idle, and hauing great feare, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time while they made their battaile, the rest would go away with their pray, and then all his labour and trauayle should be in vaine, he let his shield hang at his backe, and clasped his sword fast with both his hands<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> &amp; stroke him so furious a blow vpon his helme, that the strength therof did litle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him; for that it was not able to make any defence, but it was cut in pÃ©eces with the head, and the Giant fell dead to the ground, &amp; without any more tarying, he followed after the waggon, and did procure to disturbe them, that they should not goe forwards on their way. So all those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went with the waggon, were alighted from their horses, ready to imbarke themselues into a small barke which they tarried for, to carry them vnto a great and faire shippe, which was there, a litle farther from the shore. This <hi>Dacian</hi> called with a loud voice, &amp; said. Tarrie, tarrie, &amp; do not thinke, so much at your ease to carry away your praye, for that I hope first to take away your liues, or els to be slaine in their defence.

And when they saw and knew that it was the Knight that remained with the Giaunt, and sÃ©eing him come in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they were all meruailously astonied. The other Giaunt which was yet still vpon his beast, and was not alighted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned against him, more furious than a Tiger, and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a thousand varieties, he asked where he remained that made battaile with him. <hi>Don Eleno</hi> sayd: Put at libertye these Ladyes which thou dost carry away by force, and aske not for him: for he wanting life, hath finished all his euill dÃ©edes and workes, and without tarrying for an aunswere, he lifte vp his sword, all to be bathed with the bloud of the dead Gyant, and stroke at him so terrible a blowe, that hÃ©e gaue him to vnderstand very well, the strength of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie arme. The Giant who felt the blowe to be very strong drew out from his side, a broad and heauie sword, and stroke at him such a blow, that almost it brought him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, if it had not bene for the great force, which he put in firming himselfe in his stiroppes, which was the occasion that in a trice he setled himselfe againe in the saddle, &amp; sÃ©eing himselfe so euill intreated he pressed towards him, and began to laye on him so sharpe and strong blowes, that he made the sparks of fire flie out of his armour, and although he was meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously occupied in striking of the Gyant, yet did he not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to haue alwayes an eie vnto Chariot wheras the captiue Ladies were, to sÃ©e if they did procure by anie meanes to do them harme or damage, and he sawe that they went about to take them out of the waggen, and to put them a land, for to imbarke them, which made him to make more hast in his battaile, and knowing the strong enimie, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and inraged with that sodaine sight, to sÃ©e them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking, and that if they should carry them to sea, then by no meanes he could neither fauour nor succour them, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued so great wrath, that he threw his shield at his backe and tooke his cutting sword in both his hands, and went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Giant on his left side, and firming himselfe in his stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops, he stroke him so terrible a blow, that he made him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13973:201"/>
and to void at his mouth and nose great abundance of bloud, and without anie tarrying he spurred his horse and in great hast he went towards those knights that had those Ladies in kÃ©eping, &amp; began to sturre himselfe amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, in such sort, that when they remembred themselues to make resistance, there was thrÃ©e of them slaine, then all the rest ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues together, &amp; put backe to backe, &amp; made a round circle, with their swords in their hands to make their defence. At this time the prince <hi>Eleno</hi> had forgot the great vertue which his horse had, but because he wold not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shuld kill him, he alighted from him, the which was the occasion that he put himselfe in great trauaile and perill, notwithstanding with the great anger which he had, he pressed in amongst them, &amp; stroke &amp; wounded them on euery side, without taking anie rest, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a wonder to sÃ©e, and he so besturred &amp; tossed his cutting sword vpon them that made resistaunce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made them to know and fÃ©ele his great strength, although that they were chosen &amp; valiant knights, &amp; they did not let to intreate him very euill, in such sort, that many times they made him to stoope &amp; fÃ©ele the griefe of their blowes: notwithstanding the courage &amp; strength of <hi>Eleno</hi> was such, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in a very short time he brought twelue of them to the ground before him. The marriners which sawe the great furie that was in that one knight, in great hast put of their barke from the waters side, and with the feare which they had likewise to be there slaine, retourned vnto their shippe, forcing their barke with the great strength of their armes, striking in the water with their oares, and when they came to the ship they called aloud giuing &amp; making a great noise vnto the rest of the knightes that were in the ship, which was to the number of twentie, that they shoulde come and giue aide and succour to those which were a land, for that some of them were slaine, &amp; some verie sore hurt, and other some standing stil in their defence. In the meane time this furious <hi>Dacian</hi> did so behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe amongst them, &amp; in such sort, that quickly he had clÃ©ered himselfe of all those, if at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> present time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant which was before astonied &amp; beside himselfe, had not come wheras they
<pb facs="tcp:13973:202"/>
were, for being come againe vnto himselfe, and sawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great perill wherein he was brought, I cannot nor am not able to declare hÃ©ere the great and vnmeasurable furie the which hÃ©e had, and it did the more increase in him when he saw so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knights slaine and dead, onely by the power and strength of that one knight: his wrath was so greate, that he began to cry out against his Gods, and alighted from his beast, &amp; toke his sword into his hand, and with a furious pace hÃ©e went towards whereas the Prince was, but when the valiant <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno</hi> sawe him, he could not but thinke that he shoulde passe great trouble with him, notwithstanding for that he sawe no other thing but death amongest those barbarous and rude people, he did determine to sell his life verie dÃ©ere, &amp; had good regard vnto the blows which the Gyant shuld strike at him, and in the best wise he could he clÃ©ered himselfe from them. In this sort went this valiant knight maintaining his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, &amp; damnifieng his enimies when opportunitie did serue, and alwayes had a good hope to clÃ©ere himselfe of that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, although that there were come a land thrÃ©e and twenty other knights, against whom he made his defence at his ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for that they feared his terrible blowes, and had hurt &amp; wounded them in many parts, although the wounds wer not very great, for that he could neuer fasten on them one blow to his contentment. At this time there came another Gyant a shore out of the barke, which had remained in the ship, and with him came other twentie knights, and thirtie men with hatchets and other weapons, which made great hast to come a land. At such time as this warlyke <hi>Dacian</hi> was intangled &amp; in battaile with the other, this gyant came before all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest and stroke this knight behinde him so terrible a blow that it made him to bow both his knÃ©es to the ground, but his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie courage which in such like chaunces alwaies recouered strength with great hast &amp; a valiaunt heart, he put himselfe a foote againe, and looking about him to sÃ©e who it was that so tormented him, he sawe that it was a mightie and terrible Gyaunt, who with a greate clubbe was readie to giue him the second blowe, the Prince with good aduisement did put
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13973:202"/>
himselfe a part from the force thereof, and made him to spend his blowe in vaine, and tooke his sworde in his handes, and pressed vnto the Gyant before he could defend himselfe, and stroke him such a terryble blowe vpon the right knÃ©e, that he cut it a sunder in the middest, and the heauie and fierce Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant fell dead to the ground. At this time all those that came out of the ship pressed on him for to kill him, that by reason of their thicke and mightie blowes, so many together, he was constrained to fall downe to the earth, but when he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this great perill, he did procure to kill all that euer he could of them that put themselues before him, which was the occasion that he had space to arise vp againe on foote, and sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe in this great daunger, he began to call vpon Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, committing vnto him his soule, and besought him that he would take mercie on it, and therwith he pressed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his enimies, and with double force he laide on them on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie side, but all was in vaine for him to make resistance, for that the companie was so great that did compasse him about, striking at him as though they were desperate men, so that this good knight was constrained to retire vnto the sea side, and to put himselfe into the water vp to the wast, whereas he made his backe sure, that they could not come behind him, &amp; there hÃ©e made his defence somewhat with lesse trauaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that did procure to offend him: the Gyant which sawe so great a slaughter of men committed by one knight, with a furious voyce retourned vnto the people, and reuiled them, calling them cowardes, and cursing himselfe for that hÃ©e woulde accompanie himselfe with so naughtie and vile a generation, and sayde vnto them: Enter into the water and followe him, for it is but one knight that is before you. And therewith he put himselfe into the water, then all the rest for verie shame were constrayned to doe the lyke. At this time this valiant knight sawe himselfe in the greatest daunger that euer before that time in all his life he had bene in, and made not anie reckoning to liue longer, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he thought to sell his lyfe verie dÃ©ere, with the death of all such as hÃ©e might possiblie fasten one blowe vppon:
<pb facs="tcp:13973:203"/>
But at this instant came vnto his minde his beloued <hi>Lidia,</hi> and he sayd with a dÃ©epe and profound sigh. Ah my <hi>Lidia,</hi> what great delight doo I fÃ©ele in my selfe, hÃ©ere to make my ende, and to set me at libertie of so great sorrow and care, which I doo suffer in not sÃ©eing thÃ©e: but therewith remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himselfe, he sayd. O Lord what is this, what haue I sayd? I doo finde my selfe at the poynt to be slaine, and doo I now call to remembrance her, that I know is in the depth of the earth. Am not I a Christian? It is better for me to returne vnto thÃ©e my God, vnto whom I doo commit my soule: and Lord, for thy mercies sake, doo not looke vpon this my weaknesse, but according vnto thy great mercie take pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vpon me. And although he was weary, yet was not his valiant armes at this time vnoccupied, but rather with a more strength he did procure to defende himselfe, working such wondrous feates, that sÃ©emed euen impossible, but vnto them that sawe it. And he recouered vnto himselfe a newe courage and force, in such sort, that the water of the Sea did giue testimoniall of his great prowesse, for that vnto more then ten of them which did pursue him, hÃ©e gaue the sea for their sepulchar: and if it had not bene for the Gyaunt that did trouble him very much, he would before he hadde bene slaine, made that very few of the rest should haue remained, for to brag themselues of their victory. But I promise you, he was in such plight, that of very fÃ©eblenesse he was forced to make his strength. This wearied <hi>Eleno</hi> was in this sorte as you haue heard in great weaknesse, and voyde of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane strength, although he lacked no courage in his heart. At which time there arriued in great hast a barke at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shore side, in the which came one alone Knight, armed with verye rich armor, who (if you doo remember) was the valiant <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer,</hi> that after he had made an ende of that perillous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile at <hi>Lira,</hi> in the which he lost the company of that good Knight <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> he full of sorrow and griefe, retourned vnto the sea, whereas by fortune he found his light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted barke, which with her accustomed swiftnes did ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, whereas he saw was made a fearefull battaile, the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13973:203"/>
which was this that hÃ©ere before I haue tolde you that the afflicted Prince did make. So that when <hi>Rosileer</hi> sawe that one alone Knight with so great courage did make resistance against so many, who did molest him without all pitie, it mooued in him a desire to helpe him, which straight way he put in vre, and leping a shore with his accustomed courage, he went towards the place whereas they were in battaile, and hauing his sword fast in both his hands, he pressed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those vile people, and when he saw that he which did most trouble the Knight, was that furious and diuelish Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, he stroke him such a blow vpon his left shoulder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and body altogether he cut downe to the wast, &amp; made him fall dead into the water where he was. Yet his fury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted not with this, but striking about him, at foure blowes he brought foure Knights to their end. And as the watered hearbes or flowers doth recreate themselues when they are couered with the beames of the sonne of <hi>Tona,</hi> in such sort did the Prince <hi>Don Eleno</hi> reioyce at the comming of this new succour vnlooked for, and therewith recouering newe strength, with one leape he sprong out of the water, and put himselfe by the side of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and layd vpon his enimies, with great and mightie blowes. The worthy <hi>Rosicleer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued with the great outrage that those vile people did, wrought such valiant wonders, that it was to be meruailed at, and vnhappy might he account himselfe, who chaunced to receiue a blow at his hande. They made so great hast in cutting, wounding and killing of those vile people, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing some dead, and other sore wounded, others running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to deliuer themselues from the furie of their vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull blowes, these knights wer frÃ©e &amp; at libertie of all their former perill. This valyant <hi>Eleno</hi> would haue gratified the Prince for his good sucour and ayde, and went towards him for the same effect: and when he woulde haue spoken, hÃ©e knewe that it was <hi>Rosicleer</hi> his Cousin, by the deuice that he had in his shielde which was <hi>Cupide</hi> painted in it, and therewith in greate hast hÃ©e pulled off his healme, and sayd.</p>

The <hi>Greeke</hi> was very attentiue vnto the wordes that <hi>Eleno</hi> spake and when he sawe his face discouered and his his helme off, it sÃ©emed vnto him, that he saw the proportion of his owne naturall face, as though he were looking of him selfe in a glasse, and he receiued great contentment at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight of him, although he did very much meruaile to sÃ©e him in that place, and therewith he pulled off his healme, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered that seuere and faire face, with great delight vnto all them that did beholde him, and it was the more to be reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at, for that they were the one so like the other (that except it were for the little bearde that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had) not without great difficultie they could know, which was the one, and which was the other. The two Knights could not perseuer in their communication, for that they were disturbed by the lamentable noyse of those Ladies which were prisoners, for that some of them had their hands bound, &amp; some both hands and fÃ©ete, and they cryed out for succour and helpe to those Knights, and for that they did see them to prolong the time, they made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more hast in crying for their libertie, at whose pitifull cryes they were constrained to goe vnto them, &amp; to cut asunder the cords wherwith they wer bound. The great ioye which they receiued when they sawe themselues at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, I do refer it vnto the iudgement and consideration of them, which haue bene themselues in captiuitie, &amp; afterward obtained like libertie. The Ladye which had the two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in her lap, sÃ©eing hir selfe at libertie, with the great ioy thereof, she chaunged a newe coulour, so that the bloud that entred into her face, caused her to appeare to be very faire, &amp; with a seuere Maiestie, she did surrender vnto them greate thanks, for the goodnes, which by them they had recouered. This faire Lady did not let in the meane time whilest they were talking to behold the countenance of the two knights and in her owne imagination did consider, that she saw the naturall proportion and gesture of him, whom she carryed

High and mightie Lady, ther is no reason that I doo aunswere you vnto those words, which your troubled heart hath pronounced against him, that I am sure, and doo right well know, in your seruice would loose his lyfe, &amp; not he alone, but also all his sonnes and subiects, for the greate good wil y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> to you we haue, as it doth appeare in this ayde &amp; succour which now we haue made.

hauing anie power to make resistaunce against so terrible a blowe: she did shew verie plainely and clÃ©erely what she felt in her, and giuing a great sigh which procÃ©eded from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of her heart, she sayd: Alasse for me, O fortune, canne this be true, that that which I receiued for glorie, is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a troublesome paine. So she sayd no more, for that she was disturbed by a great noise which a damsell made, by reason of two men, who when they sawe y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> 
                  <hi>Rosicleer</hi> &amp; <hi>Don Eleno</hi> were occupied in talking with the quÃ©ene, they went running to put themselues into the barke of the Prince, and procured to put it from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shoare, thinking to saue their liues in rowing awaie with the Barke. And when <hi>Rosicleer</hi> sawe them, not hauing anie time to put on his helme, he carried it in his hand, and leapt out of the waggen, as light as a Hart amongest the cragged mountaines, and in a trice hÃ©e was with them, yet the strength of those two men was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to launch the barke from the shoare, the which <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> had forgotten, and for couetousnesse that he would not loose his horse, he went to disturbe them, and leapt into the Barke: he was no sooner within it, when that with his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed swiftnesse the barke began to mooue it selfe from the shoare, the which when these two men sawe, they woulde haue leapt into the water, but <hi>Rosicleer</hi> caught fast holde of the one, and staide him, but the other he could not, for that it was so quickly done. Whereas we will leaue them for to tell you of his cousin, who when he sawe that the Barke so sodeinely did departe awaie, I cannot hÃ©ere declare the great heauinesse and sorow that he receiued, because he could not delight himselfe in his good companie.

The sighs of this Moore were so great &amp; terrible, that all the woodes and mountaines did sound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. O thou outragious and hardie Pagan, how strong and stout doest thou shew thy selfe, thou shalt quickly know and haue thy payment for these thy reuiling wordes, in subiecting thy selfe vnto them, that nowe thou doest publish for false. O Ladyes and Damsells aske reuengement of so cruell an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that with so many reasons doth reuile you all to naught. So with these lamentations the which I haue tolde you the Pagan passed awaie the night till the morning, that <hi>Apollo</hi> began with his glistering beames to couer all the earth, the which bÃ©eing sÃ©ene by the Pagan, with a trise he arose vp, and tooke his horse for to prosecute his iourney begun, and lifting vp his eyes towardes the heauens, he did discouer hanging vpon a high and mightie pine apple trÃ©e which was nigh him the armour of <hi>Bramarant,</hi> which was put there for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, as hath bene tolde you in the first part of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The armour had all lost their coulour, yet for all that, it did shewe the great value of them, and looking about, he sawe the Epitaph which the two bretheren had made there. And
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13973:207"/>
vnderstanding the reason thereof, it gaue him a farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to take them downe, without respecting the harme that might thereof procÃ©ed, not making anie reckoning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words that were there manifested. And for that he might the better bring to passe his pretence, he vnarmed himselfe, and climbed vpon the trÃ©e, and tooke them from the place where they wer and brought them downe, and when he was below, and saw the armour to be so good, he armed himselfe with them, and when he lacked no more to put on but his healme, he hearde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voyce of a knight which sayd: Be not so hardie thou knight as to vndoo this <hi>Tropheo,</hi> erected by the GrÃ©eke Princes, and looke well to thy selfe for thou shalt die for the same. The Moore at the noise which he made, east his head on the one side and sawe that he that spake those words was a well set and armed knight, but for all this he did not let to make an ende of arming himselfe, and without setting his foote into the sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop he leapt into the saddle, and setteling himselfe therein hÃ©e went towards the demaunder with his sword in his hande. You shall vnderstand, that he which did threaten him was the <hi>Tartarian Zoylo,</hi> who if you do reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber departed in great hast from the amorous <hi>Tigliafa,</hi> and vnawares entered into this wildernesse, and by reason of his wearinesse in making so great hast in his trauaile, it caused him to be verie drie, and hauing great desire to drinke, he crossed hÃ©ere and ther in the forrest, at last there appeared before him a verie auncient old man, who had his beard and haire all white with age, who did succour him with water, and gaue him a great cup full, &amp; with the great thirst that <hi>Zoylo</hi> had he dranke well thereof, till such time as he felt himselfe satisfied, and returned the cup againe vnto him, and when he thought to haue giuen thanks for his curtesie shewed, he was vanished cleane out of his sight, so that he sawe him no more. For you shall vnderstand that it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise <hi>Lirgandeo,</hi> which brought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup ful of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fountain of <hi>Merlin,</hi> who vnderstanding by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirst <hi>Zoilo</hi> had, brought him of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, for so mitigate his drinesse, increasing in him a new desire to the loue of <hi>Tigliafa.</hi> He had scant made an ende of drinking
<pb facs="tcp:13973:208"/>
when that he felt in himselfe a new thought of loue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting himselfe of all hatred past, bÃ©eing ouercome by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fixed in that new loue, he determined to retourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and craue pardon of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, but that cruell <hi>Atropos</hi> who had his blow readie, wold not graunt vnto him anie time for the same, neither was the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> able to deliuer him from the death. And so it fell out, that when he woulde haue made his retourne to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he chaunced to come to that place whereas <hi>Bramarant</hi> did kill himselfe, and whereas <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme himselfe, and armed himselfe againe with the armour of the <hi>Tropheo.</hi> And the valiaunt <hi>Tartarian</hi> knowing the great harme that would procÃ©ede vnto them which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to come vnto the <hi>Tropheo,</hi> he woulde giue aduisement vnto him that was so bolde to giue the attempt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hÃ©e might vnderstand, that it would be demaunded at his hand. And so he did aduise <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> in that sort as you haue heard, who without anie aunswering came against him with his sword in his hand, inuiting him to mortall battaile. <hi>Zoylo</hi> who sawe his determination, did procure to defend himselfe and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his enimie. Oh my Muse, that nowe I had so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and eloquence for to set out and declare the greate harme that this daie happened in this vnfortunate Forrest. This valiant <hi>Tartarian</hi> when his enimie came vnto him, stroke him so terrible a blowe vpon the visour of his helme that with the furie thereof he made sparkles of fire to issue out thereof with great abundaunce, and to bowe downe his head vpon his breast. The Pagan did returne vnto him his salutation, and stroke him such a blowe vpon his helme, that with the great noise therof it made a sound in all the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Now began betweene them a meruailous and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full battaile, at the great noise whereof, Fortune willing to vse her extremitie, for to amplifie a farther euill, caused the Princesse. <hi>Tigliafa</hi> in the companie of her Ladyes and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells to come vnto that place whereas these knightes were, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in great anguish with her selfe. These Knights thought on no other thing, but either of them procured to bring his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie to his ende, striking at eache other suche terrible blows, and with so great fury, that many times it made ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them to loose his fÃ©eling: and both sÃ©eing the greate force of one another, were meruailously incensed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. This fierce <hi>Tartarian</hi> threw his shield at his backe, that with more force he might strike and hurt his enemie, and therewith gaue him so strong a blow vpon his helme, that all astonied he forced him to fall vpon the crupper of his horse, who carried him a great space round about the fielde, without any fÃ©eling. But when he came againe vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, this fierce <hi>Mauritanian</hi> setling himselfe in his saddle, stroke at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Tartarian</hi> so terrible a blow, that if it had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on him, it would haue turned him to much griefe, but with great discretion he clÃ©ered himselfe therof, in such sort, that it was stroken in vaine, and with great lightnesse, hee retourned, and stroke the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> so, that he made him once againe to fall vpon the crouper of his horse all astony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there appeared by the visour of his helme, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of bloud that issued out of his mouth, and his horse bÃ©eing grÃ©uÃ©d with that blow, stooped with his forefeete to the ground, and being amazed, with great fury he rose vp &amp; with his great kicking and flinging backwards, he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that the <hi>Tartarian</hi> could not come nigh to hurt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanian,</hi> which was the occasion that he could not haue any time for to giue him the second blowe, although he neuer left to follow him, to see if he could make an end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, which would haue made much of his part, not to haue giuen way that this fierce <hi>Mauritanian</hi> should haue retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to himselfe so quickly which was in so short time, and with so great anger, that the smoake which came from his mouth, seemed like a myst about his helme, so that almost it could not be seene. Then this furious diuell set spurres to his horse, &amp; blaspheming against his Gods, hauing his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sword very fast in his hande, he ranne towards his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who without any feare of his fury, went forth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

him, and when they met together, they discharged their blowes at once, but it fortuned that the <hi>Mauritanians</hi> blow did first fasten, with so great strength, that for all the helme which <hi>Zoylo</hi> had was so good, it was not sufficient to make defence, but that with the diuellish furie wherwith it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, it bended, in such sorte, that it brake all to pÃ©eces the scalpe of that vnhappie <hi>Tartarian,</hi> wherewith he gaue a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fall to the ground. So when the Pagon sawe his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie on the earth, with a loude voyce he sayde: Nowe shalt not thou bÃ©e he that shall disturbe mÃ©e, that I carrie not this armour with mÃ©e. This sadde and heauie Princesse when she sawe her swÃ©ete and welbeloued friende on the earth, with great suspition what was happened, beganne to wÃ©epe bitterly. And as a Lyon who sÃ©eing before her her young Lyon euill intreated of the hunter: euen so she leapt from her Palfraie and ranne vnto her welbeloued <hi>Zoylo,</hi> and with greate spÃ©ed shÃ©e pulled off the healme from that woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded head, and with a fayre linnen cloth she wiped of the bloud from his mortall face, and when she was certaine that it was hÃ©e that cost her so dÃ©ere the sÃ©eking, and that he was without lyfe, with furious madnesse she tore her attire from her head, and all to rent her golden haire, tearing it in pÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and retourned againe and wiped that infernall face, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such sorrowfull lamentation, that whosoeuer had seene her woulde haue bene moued to haue had compassion. Then shÃ©e tooke the head betwÃ©ene her handes, and did procure without dooing it anie harme to lifte it vp, and to put it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her lappe, and sÃ©eing for all this that there was no moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in him, she ioyned her face vnto the face of that vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Zoylo,</hi> and with sorowfull wordes shÃ©e sayd: Oh my loue, open thine eyes and beholde me, open them, I saie, and looke vppon this thy Ladie most vnfortunate, and while lyfe remaineth giue mÃ©e some contentment, if fortune be so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable: Oh my Lorde, strengthen thy selfe to looke vpon me, wherein I shall receiue such delight, that willinglye I will beare thÃ©e companie: Ah <hi>Zoylo</hi> and my onely loue, sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in former time my teares were not sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime

thÃ©e in anie parte, make me satisfaction for the greate trauaile which I haue taken in sÃ©eking thÃ©e out, come nowe in death and inioye this thy vnfortunate louer, and dye not without sÃ©eing me, open these eyes and beholde mÃ©e, giue me I praie thÃ©e some comfort: Ah my Lorde, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in sÃ©eing me thou shalt receiue paine, or no, for that at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie time thou neuer delightedst in anie thing that was mine, but now I will gratifie thÃ©e in dying with thÃ©e, and sÃ©eing that in thy lyfe time I coulde not reioyce in thÃ©e, nor haue anie companie with thÃ©e, I will now in thy death sÃ©eke thÃ©e, and peraduenture thou wilt nowe haue more pittie on mÃ©e. The Princesse sorrowfull lamentations and greate wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings were such, that she almost sounded. But this discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted Ladie comming to her selfe and sawe that her loue made no appearaunce of lyfe, shÃ©e beganne againe to wipe his face, for that it was againe all to bÃ©e bathed with bloud, and with her white hande she felt his eyes and mouth and all his face and his head, till such time as shÃ©e chaunced to put her hande on the mortall wounde, and when shÃ©e knew that there was all the harme, she held her hand still, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him whether he mooued or no, with the greate feare which she had that he woulde die, without giuing her anye comfort to speake vnto her, she made a meruailous and great lamentation, and cryed out with terrible shrikes, the which did augement much heauinesse and sorrowe in them which were in companye with the Princesse, and she sayd. Ah my loue, how many troubles and great trauailes haue I passed in seeking thee, by mountaines and hils, by vallies, wilde fields and high wayes, watering them with my amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous teares, alwayes demaunding for thee, and alwayes in vaine calling thÃ©e, yet was I neuer desolate of the true loue which I bare vnto thÃ©e: Oh howe many times in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for thÃ©e, haue I bene answered by the ecko, which was vnto me great dolor and griefe, and nowe that fortune hath brought me into the same place whereas thou art, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create and reioyce my selfe with thy beutie, the same fortune

Oh cruell Fortune, I haue not deserued to be thus ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vsed at thy hands: for when I thought to be clÃ©ere of all sorrow and trouble, now I finde my selfe most afflicted therewith. Ah my Lord, sÃ©eing that in thy lyfe time thou gauest me so bitter and euill a life, for that thou didst hate &amp; abhorre me, now in thy death giue me some comfort.

Ah <hi>Zoylo</hi> my ioye, if euer thou didst beare me any loue, it is now time to giue me to vnderstand thereof, before thy soule depart from thy body, and in saying these lamentable words, she was constrained to hold her peace, for that she saw that this wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

This sad and discomforted Ladie answered: Ah <hi>Zoilo,</hi> what doest aske of me, what wouldest that I shuld giue thÃ©e, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes was thine, I haue nothing of mine owne, I am all thine, it were now a straunge thing to beginne a new to loue thÃ©e, for all that euer I could giue thÃ©e, I gaue it thee long ere this, oh my loue, why doest thou not vnderstand this: alasse what shall I saie, I that am without all good fortune, for now I sÃ©e that thy time draweth on, &amp; that my contentment, ioy, and comfort is verie short: Ah my Lord, dost thou request of me to giue thy bodie a Sepulchre: well, I see that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to sÃ©eke some to giue it vnto vs both. And without stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gth to procÃ©ede anie farther in spÃ©eches, she kissed the face of her welbeloued &amp; so long desired <hi>Zoilo,</hi> with great sobbing &amp; sighs making within her selfe a terrible conflict, tarrying for the answere of her welbeloued friend, who with no lesse paine &amp; anguish of death sayd: Ah my Ladie and mistres, I do know that thou wert alwaies mine, &amp; I thine. That which I will now desire of thÃ©e, is, for that I was beloued of thÃ©e in my life time, that now in my death I may be fauoured of thÃ©e. Oh cruell loue, oh what a wish is this, a case neuer the like heard of before, that I shuld desire the death of her that so long time hath trauailed and taken paines and sorrowes with terrible wÃ©epings and sighs for my sake. Ah my mistres, how happie shoulde I be, that thus imbracing one in the others armes we might depart together: Oh what a happie death would it be, oh swÃ©ete Fortune, I haue no other griefe with me but to leaue thÃ©e behinde me: Oh vnhappie that I am, I neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to desire thy death, but nowe, and onely for that I woulde not leaue thy companie. The Princesse bÃ©eing very much troubled with griefe and sorrowe, aunswered him and sayde: Oh my loue, therein take thou neyther griefe nor care, for hÃ©ere. I dooe promise thÃ©e by the greate loue that I doe beare vnto thee, that if death doe shew himselfe any thing contrarie vnto mÃ©e, that I will procure it with mine owne handes, for that the Gods will not consent that I should liue and thou die, therefore I saye, that if hÃ©e doe contrarie mÃ©e, I will giue thee this contentment, for that without thÃ©e I shall

finde hÃ©ere no ioye nor comfort at all for me, neyther yet any ease of this my great griefe, so that I shall thinke it for the best to loose all my ioye, and now I doe finde in my selfe that death will be my friend. Ah my swÃ©et loue and Lord, ioyne thy face vnto mine, let vs kisse together, and let vs make our departure both together. The Prince bÃ©eing troubled with the anguish of his hastie death, sayd: HÃ©ere I doo desire thÃ©e my <hi>Tigliafa,</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firme &amp; faithfull loue which thou doest beare me, not to consent that I be the occasion, that with a cruell death thou doest finish thy life, but to sustaine &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it so long as the Gods doth permit the same, and when that I am dead (which shall be verie quickly) let me receiue this fauour at thy handes, that thou wouldest vouchsafe to giue a Sepulchre vnto this my bodie, for with great ease and comfort shall I depart, sÃ©eing that I die in the armes of my Ladie and mistres, and a greate deale more comfort shall I receiue if I knew of a certaintie that thou woldest performe this, that I doe craue and desire at thy hands: Oh my loue, doe not denie this my supplication, and for that I am certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that thou wilt performe the same, hÃ©ere I take my leaue of thÃ©e, farewell, the Gods preserue thÃ©e, and take me to theyr mercies. And when he sayde these wordes, he inclined his necke vpon the face of the Princesse. When this sorrowfull Ladie sawe that the soule had got the victorie and departed from the bodie, she kissed the mouth of the dead bodie, and giuing dÃ©epe and dolorous sighes, she beganne a meruailous and heauie lamentation, calling her selfe vnhappie and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and laide her selfe vppon the dead bodie, cursing her selfe so that it was lamentable to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

griefe, which procÃ©eded from the bottome of her heart, and sayde: Ah my good friend, what small benefite haue I recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for all my trauaile and paine, the which I haue suffered in sÃ©eking of thÃ©e, and nowe in finding of thÃ©e it is the more for my griefe, for that I came to sÃ©e thÃ©e die: Ah most vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie that I am, where was I when I sawe descend vpon thÃ©e that mortall sworde?

Why doe you not come and take pittie of my griefe, and put remedie therein, in taking awaie my life, for in so doing you shall shewe your selues pittifull, for that I doe abhorre this dolorous lyfe. Yet she did not forget the promise the which she made vnto her welbeloued <hi>Zoylo,</hi> which was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that she did somewhat cease her lamentation. And taking vnto her selfe more courage then her dolorous griefe did consent vnto. With the helpe of her Damselles, she put the dead bodie vnder that greate and mightie Pine apple trÃ©e, where the armour did hang, commanding some of those that were with her, that they should goe vnto those villages that wer nigh at hand, to cause some people to come thether, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So his horse brought him into a great plaine, where a farre off he discouered an armed Tent pitched, which sÃ©emed to be faire and rich, and by it vpon the grÃ©ene grasse, ther lay foure great Gyants, who had in the midst among them, a verye faire Damsell, who was very heauie and sorrowfull, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her chÃ©eke vpon her hand. The Pagan being nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Giants, did kÃ©epe his way, till such time as hÃ©e came whereas the Giants were laid, and he came so nigh, that he might sÃ©e the face of the Damsell, which sÃ©emed not to be any humane creature, by reason of her excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, with hir golde yeolow haire dispersed all vpon her backe, and her Lilly white hand whereon she leaned her chÃ©eke, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering her faire face, with her eyes shut, which showed her well set browes, from vnder which, distilled many toares which sÃ©emed to be orientall pearles, dispersed vpon her faire and white face, and sundry times giuing dÃ©ep and sorrowfull sighes, which declared the great paine and griefe that she did suffer.

But the Pagan for that he would not that he should kill his horse, was constrained to put himselfe somewhat on the one side, and lighting from the saddle, he lefte his horse alone, and layde hold vppon his sword, wherewith his enimie stroke at him a mightie &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blow, who with a strange lightnesse caused it to be stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vaine, in stepping on the one side, and therewith hÃ©e closed with the Giant, and threw at his breast so terrible &amp; strong a foyne, that his armour was not sufficient for to make resistaunce, but that the fury thereof must be executed, and pearced him thorough vnto the backe, wherewith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant gaue a terrible fal to the ground, at which noyse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other thrÃ©e Giants did awake, and one of them put himself quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on foote, and without tarrying for to put on his healme, or to take his shield, but blaspheming against his Gods, he ran against the Pagan, who abode his comming with such like courage, as his presumption did require.

This terrible blowe was no sooner passed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth when that this valiant Mauritanian stroke a blowe at his armes, which was with so great strength, that he cut them both off by the wristes, and his hands bÃ©eing fast to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> club, they fell all to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. The Gyant who felt himselfe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; lame, would haue imbraced with the Pagan, thinking by his great strength to haue crushed him to death, but this <hi>Mauritanian</hi> with great valiantnesse did put himselfe before him, his sword in his hand with the point forwardes, so that the Gyant (with the great paine that he felt of his wounds, and the great anger he had in his heart,) without anie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration he pressed himselfe forwardes, &amp; the Pagan followed in his determination in such sort, that the sword entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gyants bodie vp to the hard hilts, falling downe dead to the ground, with no lesse noise then the rest. Then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth Gyant which remained, did put himselfe on foote, who was

of a greater and huger stature and bignesse then the other which were dead, and taking in his hand a great and mighty speare which laie on the ground by him, with a terrible and fearefull voice he sayd: O thou infernall diuell, for that thou canst not be other, sÃ©eing thou hast slaine my three compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for I tell thÃ©e that the Gods in the heauens did tremble for feare of them. HÃ©ere I doe promise thÃ©e that thou shalt not depart without thy reward and punishment, neyther I without taking vengeaunce of thÃ©e. The valiant Moore who verie well heard and vnderstoode his wordes, made little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his proude spÃ©ech, but sayd: Make an end thou furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diuell and come vnto the battaile, delaie not I saye, that thou mayst beare these thy companions companie. Then the Gyant lifted vp his arme aboue his head, hauing fast in his hande that greate and mightie Speare, which was all full of knots, with the barke remaining still thereon, and threw it at him with so great strength, that it made a meruailous sound in the aire, but this valyant Mauritanian was not without great care of the comming thereof, but with a counter pace he put himselfe on the one side, with so greate pollicie, that the blowe passed on the one side, and the Speare stuck fast in the ground, and by reason of the greate force wherewith it was throwen, it made it to shake as though it would haue flowen in a thousand pÃ©eces, and turning round like a Snake when she doth make hast to goe awaie from him that woulde kill her. Then the strong and stout Mauritanian being very ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to sÃ©e so great villanie, he ranne vnto the speare, and with great strength he pulled it out of the ground, and in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it againe at the gyant, he said: O thou furious beast, take vnto thÃ©e thy dart. It did wel appeare that it was not throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by a sluggish arme, for that by reason of the great strength striking on his shÃ©eld it pearced it through, yet it did not ther remaine, but likewise pearced his armour and shirt of maile and neuer stayed till such time as it shewed it selfe at his backe all to be bathed with bloud, wherewith the Gyant fell downe dead to the ground, whose fall was so terrible that it made the earth tremble, and all the trÃ©es that were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

The valyaunt Moore did pull of his healme, and did discouer his face, which did represent a great maiestie &amp; seueritie, such as his state did require, and although he was of a great stature &amp; bignesse of bodie, yet his faire face did giue greate delight vnto all them that did beholde it, and when he came nigh vnto the faire la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, he knÃ©eled downe on the ground and said: Faire Ladie, I know not whether you are discontented, or haue receiued a small benefit or seruice in this which I haue done, but of this be you assured, that my determined thought was to doe you seruice, belÃ©euing that so faire a Ladie shoulde not with her good will keepe companie with so monstrous people: she with with great curtesie did aunswere him &amp; sayd: Gentle knight I cannot denie but that I was constrained by force to kÃ©epe companie with these proude and ill conditioned Gyants, and much lesse can I kÃ©epe in secret the great ioy which I haue to finde my selfe at libertie and clÃ©ere from them, but one thing there is which I doe greatly feare, that is, that nowe I falling into thy hands and power, I dread to come into a new prison, therefore I besÃ©ech you to giue me frÃ©e libertie, with the seguritie which belongeth vnto my honour. The Pagan who was verie attentiue vnto the words of the Ladie, would haue made her answere, but this faire lady did disturbe him, desiring him first to sit downe by her, for that she was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that with the great trauaile which he had taken in the battaile with the Gyants, it could not be but that he was wearie, and therewith taking him fast by both the hands she made him to sit downe, to whom <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> sayd: Ah fayre Ladie if I did knowe that my heart were as frÃ©e and clÃ©ere of your loue, as you are sure of me for offering you anie vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then with great reason I might account my selfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, as well in the doing of your seruice, as in giuing you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, but I am he Ladie that must aske libertie of your beautie, desiring you not to haue anie doubt of me. So with
<pb facs="tcp:13973:216"/>
dÃ©epe &amp; sorrowful sighs this Moore did giue her to vnderstand how his troubled heart was tormented with excessiue loue. The Ladie when she vnderstoode and knewe that she had of him so sure a pawne, was nothing discontent with all, for that he sÃ©emed vnto her to be a knight of a verie good disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of great value, more then anie other, and for that he shuld receiue some contentment, she answered and sayd: Sir, I am verie well satisfied, that a knight in whom is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended so great beautie, cannot be without the curtesie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in so worthie a warriour, for the which cause I doe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate and put all my honour into your handes, and belÃ©eue me that time shall not lacke to put remedie in this your new griefe and paine, without incurring vnto my selfe anie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, but to maintaine and kÃ©epe my honour, as belongeth vnto the royall bloud from whence I do descend, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time gentle knight, I would craue one boone at your hands, which in telling you I would not haue it denied me: Oh how great was the ioye that this valyant Pagan receiued when he vnderstoode so good hope which she pronounced vnto him, and therewith he turned vnto the Ladie, and whether shÃ©e would or not, he kissed her hands, with great thanks for the grace and fauour which she shewed him, and therewith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remembring the wordes which passed by the Nymph at the riuer, he sayd vnto himselfe: How is it that not long since I made a mocke and a iest of the aduice the which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan me, and now I doo sÃ©e that I made a mocke &amp; a iest of the aduice which is turned into good earnest. And in saying these words he returned vnto the Ladie and sayde: What is that faire Ladie that I should binde my selfe vnto you to do, nay what is it, that lying in my power to accomplish, I woulde not do, being wholy yours, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> my heart is your prisoner, &amp; my libertie subiect to your wil, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you shuld desire the graunt of me, but commaund me to fulfil all your will and request, but yet fayre Ladie, before that you doe procÃ©ede to your request, I doe desire you that I maye know the occasion of your kÃ©eping companie and trauailing with these foure furious Gyants in this Countrie of <hi>Grecia.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:217"/>
This wil I declare vnto you with a verie good will answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this fayre Ladie. You shall vnderstand that I am daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto the king of the Ilandes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> my parents had no more daughters but I alone, the which was the occasion that I was the more made off and estÃ©emed of them. And by reason of my beutie, they put me into a strong tower, which was nigh the sea side, whereout many times for my recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I issued in companie with many Ladyes and Damsells, which were with me to beare me companie: so it chaunced one day when I was abroad in my accustomed recreation &amp; sport, I was beset with this infernall companie, who carried me into their mightie and strong shippe in this order as you doe sÃ©e me, whereas I did no other thing but lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my sadde and heauie misfortune. So the first Gyaunt which you did kill, sÃ©eing me make so great lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tation, with louing and amorous wordes did procure to comfort me, and did offer me, that all which was my will to be done, he wold fulfill the same, and I sÃ©eing his greate curtesie, and agayne, that my remedie was so farre from me, vpon a sodaine ther came a thought into my minde, which I supposed to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good and requisite for to redresse my harme &amp; griefe, and I desired of him to graunt me a boone, this gyant did graunt me my request, and the rest did promise to fulfill all that I would aske them, and my demaund was, that they shoulde carrie me vnto <hi>Grecia,</hi> vnto the court of the Emperour <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio,</hi> and that they should for the space of twentie dayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my beautie and fairenesse, making a challenge agaynst all other. These Gyants by reason of theyr great pride, didde thinke it good to accomplish my request, the which they did graunt vnto me in such sort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no other thing coulde disturbe them.

fortune, or their great pride I know not, that wold not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that they should come thether, but first they should heere end their dayes. And being in this discourse, they saw a great number of people comming towardes them, which sÃ©emed to be householde seruants or such like, who came with all theyr beastes laden with victualls and other necessaries, who were all seruants vnto those Gyaunts, and when they came nigh the place and sawe that wonderful spectacle of their masters: euen as you sÃ©e the small birdes howe they will hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues amongest the bushes, briers, and thicke trÃ©es, from the sight of anie rauenous foule: euen so did all these seruants of those vile Gyaunts, hide themselues in the thickest of the woods and mountaines of the Forrest, fearing the like inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. This valiant Moore when he sawe the sodaine fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, without hauing anie care of them, and making little reckoning, he tooke that gentle Ladie in his armes and set her vpon her palfraie, and he himselfe without putting foot in his stirop, leapt vpon his horse backe with great lightnes, and tooke their iourney towards the place whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others had left their ship, into the which he entered with great spÃ©ed verie ioyfull of his good hap, &amp; straight waie he commanded to hoise vp their sailes, &amp; to take the waie towards <hi>Maurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> whereas we will leaue them for to tell you the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment that the valiant knight <hi>Claridiano</hi> had, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his long tarrying in the Iland of <hi>Trapobana.</hi> O om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God, I doe desire thÃ©e to giue me wisdome &amp; discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to declare the great worthinesse of this young knight, for without thy helpe I do not finde my selfe able for to set forth so many and so meruailous feates of armes as was done by this worthie knight, as in this chapter following and in all the rest shall be declared.</p>

This young knight thought the time to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie long, which was the occasion that he was verie sadde and sorrowfull, in such sort, that his fayre and beautifull face had lost part of his naturall and liuely coulour, and dayly hÃ©e did exercise himselfe in no other thing but to goe to the sea side, and there to set himselfe vpon a rocke, hauing no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation but to beholde how the water with greate furie and force did strike and beate vpon the sayd rocke. So after long time vsing this disport, it chanced on a daie at such time as the Sunne had made an ende of his iourney, hÃ©e saw at the foote of that Rocke a Dwarfe, who with an outragious and irefull voyce sayde: <hi>Don Claridiano</hi> of <hi>Grecia,</hi> what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou thinke that the hardnesse of that Rocke is sufficient to blaze thy fame and to get vnto thÃ©e honour?

Therefore I saye aryse vp O Greeke, and procure to finde out thy royall bloud and generation from whence thou doest procÃ©ede, and let not thy descent lye hidde, neyther thy prowesse vnknowen. HÃ©e

had no sooner made an ende of his spÃ©eches, but that vppon a sodaine hÃ©e vanished cleane awaie, and was not anie more sÃ©ene. The sorrowe and heauinesse was verie much which the Prince then felt in himselfe, in hearing the wordes and reasons of the Dwarfe, and the more, when that hÃ©e vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode that hÃ©e was not sonne vnto him whome he alwaies thought he had bÃ©ene, the which caused his courage greatly to alter within him, and made him to saie: Unfortunate that I am, what doe I make hÃ©ere amongest those which are not of my lignage, I had thought for certainetie that I had beene with my Father and kindred, and nowe I doe sÃ©e that it is to the contrarie, and that I am kept in this Ilande lyke a weake and sillie woman: O <hi>Galtenor,</hi> sÃ©eing that it was thy pleasure that by my handes thou shouldest bÃ©e restored vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy kingdome, and for that effect thou hast had mÃ©e he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in thy kÃ©eping: Why doest thou now consent that my fame perish and decaie, I remaining in this Ilande<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall <hi>Mars,</hi> to thÃ©e I do inuocate, that being by thÃ©e holpen and with thy fauour I may stretch forth the bright beame, which with thy partiall hande thou gauest me. So vttering these and such like complaints, he passed a few dayes, till that vpon a certaine daye, following his accustomed exercise, hÃ©e saw comming towards the shore a Foyst, which was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with foure marriners, and beholding who was therein, he saw come from vnder the hatches, a very faire Damosell, who was all apparailed with mourning apparaile, and with her two auncient Squires, who led her by the armes, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>railed in the same manner and guise. This Ladies face was all to bedewed with teares, and her countenaunce did declare and showe, that she suffered great sorrow and anguish. This valyaunt and worthy young knight very desirous to know the occasion of her greate lamentation, mooued himselfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and hauing saluted her, he desired her if it were her plesure, to declare vnto him the occasion of hir complaint. The Lady turning vnto him who had demaunded the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of her sorrow, and being greatly amazed in viewing his

comely grace and gentle disposition, she sayd. Gentle knight, if thou doest desire to knowe the occasion of all my harme, bring me before that worthie young knight who slew <hi>Gere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion Bendambul,</hi> and ther thou shalt vnderstand the greatest wrong without all reason that euer was done to so noble a Damsell as I am. The Prince taking pittie of her great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row aunswered: I doe not not knowe for what effect &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you doe aske after this knight, but be it what it will be, you shall vnderstand gentle Ladie, that he who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> you doe aske for is before you, and sÃ©eing that it is so, you may be bolde to declare your pleasure, and hÃ©ere I doe saie vnto you, that if it be requisite and necessarie in your seruice, I will venture my life without putting anie excuse for to remedie this your great sorrow and griefe which you do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And you shal vnderstand that I will do it without taking anie leaue of my Lord, the king <hi>Delfo,</hi> and there is nothing that dooth so much grÃ©eue mee, as that I am not armed. This sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ladie sÃ©eing her good fortune would not loose the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but with a new lamentation and complaint shÃ©e knÃ©eled downe before him and kissed his handes for the great offers which he made vnto her, the Prince did take her vp from the ground with great reuerence, then the Ladie with amorous wordes sayde. If that by the occasion of king <hi>Delfo</hi> (gentle knight) we shall receiue anie disturbaunce: hÃ©ere I doe desire thÃ©e by the honour which thou dost owe vnto all vertue, that we make no farther delaie nor detainment, for hÃ©ere I doe giue you to vnderstande that there remaineth but a small time for the remedying of my sorrowe and griefe. Well, let it bÃ©e out of hand answered this valiant GrÃ©eke, and at our comming a land, the first knight that we do mÃ©et, either with his good will or ill will shall lend me his armour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with taking that faire Ladie by the hand, they put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>selues into the Foist, commaunding straight waye that they should retourne theyr voyage vnto the Sea, so finding the time and winde fauourable, in a verye short space they were pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on their waie so farre that they cleane lost the sight of anye land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>What shall I saie of the king <hi>Delfo</hi> and the Princes nurse, when they could not heare of the Prince what was become of him, but onely that he was departed awaie. But if I did not put before me the great duetie which I do owe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the grauitie of a Prince, I might saie that he did things more lyker a mad man, then a Prince, &amp; surely he had great reason, for he had lost the companie of the best knight in all the world: so this warlyke GrÃ©eke did saile vppon the Sea with an indifferent thought, bÃ©eing in companie with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faire Ladie who likewise went verie well content, for that with so great ease she had found and obtained him that she sought for. But this I can certifie you of <hi>Claridiano,</hi> that he had not forgot y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words which the dwarfe had tolde him, but alwaies remembring the same, it put him in great confusion, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did not remember to demand of the Damsel the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of her griefe, who with such dilligence went to seeke him. At such time as <hi>Diana</hi> did spred abroad her golden haire ouer all those troublesome waters, he discouered that there came towards them a barke, in such hast, that in a smal time they were come vnto them, the which barke came without anie gouernment, and he sawe sitting on the poope of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barke a gyant, who had his head and beard verie white, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with roabes of estate, who was straight wayes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by <hi>Claridiano</hi> to be <hi>Galtenor,</hi> for the which he receiued great ioy. When the barkes were ioyned together <hi>Galtenor</hi> went and imbraced the Prince, saying: Sonne do not thinke to depart awaie in such sort, but that first I will reioyce my selfe with the presence, for it shal be more profitable vnto thÃ©e then thou doest thinke for, as well for the remedie and ease of thy thought, as for the adorning and sauegard of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. To whom the Prince aunswered and sayd: I do verie well know my Lord, that from you can procÃ©ede nothing but that which is good, as alwaies hath bene the vse and custome hetherto. Then the Gyant sayd vnto him: This thou maist perfectly belÃ©eue, that so long as my soule is ioyned and knit with my bodie, that it shall not exercise it selfe in anie other thing but in thy seruice. And now for that thou stand est in
<pb facs="tcp:13973:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nÃ©ede of armor, hÃ©ere I doo bring it vnto thÃ©e, for that before many daies come to an ende, thou shalt haue nÃ©ede thereof. Also I doo bring thÃ©e a meruailous precious sword, forged and made by my great skill, such a one as in all the worlde there is not a better. And this shall continue &amp; indure with thÃ©e, till such time as thou shalt be in battaile with the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Lyon, then shall it loose his vertue and valor, for that thou shalt recouer another of no lesse price, and of a greater fame, ioyntly with thy honor in the acknowledging of thy vnknowen parents, and in that time thou shalt loose all thy seruice, that euer thou hast done in the honour of <hi>Cupide,</hi> bÃ©eing in company with the disguised Hinde, all though alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thou shalt not loose thy great loue, till such time as by the Goddesse <hi>Venus</hi> shal be throwen at thÃ©e the <hi>African</hi> launce, which shall pearce thy heart cleane through. Then did he declare vnto him, how he was stoln out from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lap, certefieng him that he was sonne vnto the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Emperour in all the world: but more light then this, hÃ©e would not giue him, neither the place wheras his sister was lost, and therwith he tooke out from vnder the hatches of the barke, a fardle which was bound vp, the which he did dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto the Marriners, that they should laye it vp safe, and imbrace him againe with great loue, and put vpon the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the heart, on his left hand, a King, which had in it a precious Diamond, that was of so great clÃ©ernesse, that in a darke night it gaue as great a light wher it was, as though a torch were lighted. This did he straightly charge him to kÃ©epe, for that it was of so great vertue, that so long time as he had it about him there was no inchauntment that should hurt him. This excellent young Knight woulde haue sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered greate thankes for his precious giftes, but at such time as he wold haue giuen it, <hi>Galtenor</hi> was departed vpon a sodaine a greate space from them, who made so much hast, that in a verie small time he lost the sight of him. This young knight remayned with greate contentment, in knowing that hÃ©e did descende from so high a generation:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:13973:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and lykewise for the succour he receiued in the armour hÃ©e had brought him, the which he commaunded to bÃ©e very well kept till such time as occasion shoulde serue that he had nÃ©ede of them: in this sort he passed away all the nighte, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the wordes of <hi>Galtenor.</hi> So the next morning this young knight sitting on the poope of the Foyst, with this faire Lady, he requested her to tell him the whole occasion of her comming to sÃ©eke for him. The which this Lady with great lamentation began to tell him, saying. Gentle Knight you shall vnderstand that I am daughter vnto the King of <hi>Mesapotamia,</hi> which is a prouince scituated betwÃ©en the two great riuers <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris.</hi> Of long time was I of him welbeloued and made very much on, till such time as my fathers Court was in great heauinesse, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could not heare any newes of a brother of mine, who was prince of that kingdome, whose absence at this time is verye grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto me. There came from the other side of the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> a prince, whose dominion was ouer the Prouince <hi>Palestina.</hi> He was the proudest and arrogantest Knight that euer hath bene sÃ©ene, in such sort, that by reason of his fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he was not onely feared of them, who of dutie did owe it him, but also of all the Prouinces that ioyned with his kingdome, which extended from that riuer vnto the mayne sea of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> the mount <hi>Libano, Gamogenia,</hi> and the high and mightie cragged rockes and mountaines <hi>Nabateos.</hi> To conclude, almost all <hi>Asia</hi> did tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ble at his furie. This knight at the great fame which was vttered of my beautie, came vnto the famous and large Prouince of <hi>Mesapotamia,</hi> vnto the great citie of <hi>Mesos,</hi> whereas I was of him meruailous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated and requested of loue, but yet all that euer hÃ©e did or could doo, did little profit him, for that by any meanes I coulde not admit him into my seruice, and the occasion was, because of his great and vnmeasurable pride. So like wise came thether the Prince of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> a Knight of great price, and adorned with many vertues, vnto whom I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes showed a better countenaunce, and made acceptation of his seruice.</p>

The departing of the Prince was verie grÃ©euous vnto the Princes <hi>Antemisca,</hi> and she vnderstanding that it was in vaine to say to the contrarie by reason of his determination she pretended to beare him companie, and sayd vnto him.

At this time the Prince woulde haue bene verie gladde that the Princesse <hi>Antemisca</hi> had not bene with him, for that he found himselfe greatly troubled with her, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> desired her that she would remaine and kÃ©epe her selfe secret amongest certain bushes that were there, the which she was constrained to doe, more for to giue contentment vnto the

This couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous knight when he sawe himselfe alone (after that hÃ©e had left the Princesse) with great hast he put himselfe into the caue, and going about from one place to another, he chanced into a great hall, which was made in manner like vnto a great court, sauing the place where the light entered, was a a louer hole, which was in the middest thereof, and going round about the same, he chaunced into a place where manie bones &amp; skulls of dead men were, which did amaze much the Prince, and caused in him a newe desire to knowe what it should be. And going farther in where the light shewed most, he sawe where was a woman laide along vpon a bed, who was the most deformedst person that could be sÃ©ene, and by her laie a young child which sÃ©emed to be of a yeare olde, who was of the stature of a meane man, and on the one side hÃ©e sawe a doore, which was verie strong and all of yron, out of the which came forth that sorrowfull voyce. The Gyantesse when she sawe the knight there within, she with great hast laide holde on a bow which lay at her beds side, and straight waies bent it and nocked a sharpe arrowe therein, and drew the bow with so great strength, that almost she brought both ends together, the knight who remained with great care, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he sawe the arrow comming, clÃ©ered himselfe thereof, but the arrowe had not so soone passed by him, when as like vnto the winde he went vnto her, and with his close fist he stroke her such a mightie blow vpon her mouth, that without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce she fell downe vpon the ground, &amp; without making farther reckoning of her, he went vnto the yron doore, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked which waie he might open it, and hauing proued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same he sawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was all in vaine, by reason of the great strength therof, so that he was constrained to returne againe vnto the place where the Gyan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then the knight went straight waie foorth, and sawe that there was fire, the which he blew, and lighted a Rosin sticke, that did burne verye well, and went into the place where the Damosell had aunswered him, and in the farthest end of that chamber he found the damosell that did so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complaine, who lay a long on the ground verie euill appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, and that which she had was all torne in pÃ©eces, in such sort that her skinne was seene in many places, and beholding her cruell vsage it mooued the knight to haue great compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without speaking anie worde, with his owne hands he brake all the yrons &amp; chaines wherewith shÃ©e was bound, and tooke her by the hand and brought her out of that darke roome, into the great hall where it was verie light. This Damosell when she vnderstoode that he tooke her out to set her at libertie, she knÃ©eled downe on her knÃ©es before him, and sayd: O Knight, the comfort of my grÃ©euous paine, tell mee I praie you if that foule butcherly gyant be dead or not, or how you had power to come hether into this place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beeing disturbed by him or his cruell sonne.

This infernall monster went towardes <hi>Claridiano</hi> with his club all aloft, and with great furie he did assault him: Oh almightie God, saue, kÃ©epe, and deliuer thy knight from this infernall furie, and doe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that he dye in the hands of so cruell an enimie, but first he knowe that thou art his true and perfect God.

But who should haue sÃ©ene there the great light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and prowesse of this young knight, would haue iudged him to be one of the best knightes of all the worlde, for that in all the time of the battaile, and all the terrible blowes which the giant did strike at him, yet he neuer brake maile, nor hurt anie part of his armour, and yet he hurt his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in more then tenne places, although they were not verye greate, yet did they trouble him, and it was by reason of the greate hast he made in the striking of his blowes, but when the Gyaunt sawe himselfe to be so euill intreated, he beganne to puffe, bluster, and blowe, much lyke vnto a bayted Bull, and doubled his blowes with so greate hast, that the Prince coulde not haue anie time of aduauntage to hurt him, but had inough to doe for to clÃ©ere and defend himselfe from his furie. And bÃ©eing in this greate extremitie he hearde those two Damosells which he had brought with him crie out, making a greate noyse, aduertising him to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13973:227"/>
it did profit him much, for so soone as the arrow did strike on it, it recoyled backe againe a great waie, at this present time did the knight finde himselfe in greate perill and daunger, for that he must make his defence against that infernall monster, and likewise against that diuellysh and furious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who continually assaulted him with her arrowes, and then he could not profit himselfe of his force and strength, but onely of his great lightnesse, shunning the furie of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie blowes, so by little and little he drew nigh vnto the place whereas the Gyauntesse was, who hauing spent all her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, she tooke in her hande a mightie clubbe and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her furious husband to helpe him. This valyaunt GrÃ©eke founde himselfe in greate extremitie, and with the greate anger which he had, it changed his eyes into sanguine coulour, and was determined to clÃ©ere himselfe of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall woman, and with that purpose he tourned towardes her, and letting her blowe to passe by, he stepped in to her on the left side, and thrust so terrible a foine at her brest, that his swoord entered in vp to the hard hiltes, and she fell downe dead to the ground. The Gyaunt who at that instaunt was not idle, stroke the GrÃ©eke such a monstrous blowe vppon his backe, that hÃ©e ouerthrewe him to the grounde as dear, without anie remembraunce or token of moouing, the Gyant seeing him in this case threw from him his clubbe, and tooke the knight in his furious nayles, and with the greate rage and wrath which hÃ©e had he woulde haue eaten him vp at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> instaunt, but it fell not out with him as he thought it would, for that hÃ©e found the armour which hÃ©e had on was verye harde, and when the Gyaunt sawe that his sharpe tÃ©eth did lyttle profite him, hee beganne to tumble and toosse him vp and downe from one place to another, and by reason that he was not expert in the lacinges and buckeling of armour, hÃ©e did nothing but tumble and tosse him hÃ©ere and there, to sÃ©e if hÃ©e coulde finde a place where hÃ©e might beginne to teare him in pÃ©eces. Whosoeuer should at that instaunt haue seene the greate affliction of those two Damosells, might verye well haue iudged in himselfe the anguish and sorrowe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:13973:227"/>
which they receiued, iudging themselues to be wholly lost &amp; destroyed. But the Princesse <hi>Antemisca,</hi> lifted vp her eyes vnto heauen and sayd. I doo sÃ©e O <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that thou art very well pleased, that I doo suffer this grieuous pain and sorow. Ah Fortune, it is now great reason to leaue me, and not to persecute me any farther, and if it be so, that as yet thou hast not accomplished thy whole desire. Oh <hi>Iupiter</hi> make sharpe thy cutting sword, and therewith take awaye my life. Oh <hi>Mars,</hi> behold that now thy strength doth faile, if thou dost permit that this Knight doo perish. O what woman amongst all women hath bene so infortunate as I? Oh Gods, I doo not know wherefore you doo thus persecute me, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue bene alwayes obedient vnto you, and now sÃ©eing that you had giuen me a Knight for to be my defence, (against y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust cause, which was laid against me) you shoulde likewise haue suffered me to giue testimonie of my truth, and theyr false accusation? Oh thou chast Goddesse, be fauourable vnto me, sÃ©eing that <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath forgotten me, turne and take my cause vpon thÃ©e, and be fauourable, for that I neuer offended thÃ©e. These and such like complaintes vttered this afflicted Princesse, and hauing concluded, the Prince was come again to himselfe and recouered his memorie, and sÃ©eing himselfe in that perplexitie, he did procure by all meanes and pollicie to clÃ©ere himselfe out of the Gyants clawes, and bÃ©eing clÃ©ere hÃ©e put himselfe on foote, and recouered againe his swoord, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming against the smal power of his Gods, and was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailously kindled with wrath and anger, the Gyant likewise recouered his mightie club, and stroke at the Prince a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie blow, who sÃ©eing it comming did procure to clÃ©ere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the furie thereof, and letting it passe, he stepped in to the Gyant, and stroke at him so terrible a blowe on the wast, that it little did profit anie defence that he had, but that his mightie sword must needs cut him a sunder in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of his body, and he fell a sunder, each part from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other dead to the ground.

And in saying these wordes he threwe his heauie club from him, and came towardes the Prince with his fist bent for to strike him, in the like sorte did this noble warriour, and for to strike him at his ease he was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to raise vp himselfe in his stirops, otherwise he could not reach his head, but yet he lent him so terrible a blowe vpon the forehad, that he droue the bone to the braines, and beeing therewith amazed he fell downe to the ground, and with the great force and strength that he put to strike that blowe, it lacked little that he fell not from his horse, but incontinent he stroke him againe the second blowe, wherewith he made an end to beate out his braines, and there remayned dead. The Prince was greatly amazed in beholding him, for as he lay along vpon the ground he sÃ©emed to be a greate Oake blowen downe with the winde, the knight could not refraine himselfe but that he must nÃ©edes laugh, and sayd: Of truth I am a notable guest, for that before I doe enter into my

And entring therein they saw that he had put to rost a whole DÃ©ere, which was a very great one, and sÃ©eing that which should giue them comfort, euery one of them fell to worke, hoping for their trauaile to eate part of that dÃ©ere. The olde Squire tourned the spit, and the Ladyes made the fire, and the Prince pulled out coales, so that there was none idle, in hope of the benefit to come: and with the great hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they had, and desire to eate, that when the dÃ©ere was scant hot on the spit, they thought it ouer rosted and halfe burned, likewise they procured to sÃ©e if they could finde any breade. <hi>Claridiano</hi> descended into a roome, he had vnder the caue, whereas he found two great loues, so great in compasse as the cyrbe of a well, and two great flagons full of bÃ©ere, with great ioy and pleasure the Prince came forth out of the caue, and for to giue contentment vnto the Ladyes, he brought it forth, &amp; shewed them what he had found. And when the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies saw so good prouision, they made hast of the dÃ©ere, and hauing nothing wherewith to cut their victualls, the Prince vsed his sword at that time in stÃ©ed of a knife.

To whom <hi>Claridiano</hi> sayde, We are straungers, whose fortune hath brought vs hether, and we do desire thÃ©e to doe vs to much pleasure as to receiue vs into your castell this night, that we may take some rest: Friends, aunswered the knight of the Castell, we are hÃ©ere so feared with a grat diuell, whose habitation is in the height of the mountaine, that not onely in the night, we dare not open our gates, but also we keepe them shut all day. Who is this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so much trouble and vexe you, sayd <hi>Libernio.</hi> The Knight sayd. A mightie great Giant, and of a maruelous height, &amp; formed like vnto a diuell.

<pb facs="tcp:13973:233"/>
The Prince sayd vnto the Ladie which he released out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: It shall be good faire Ladie now that you are at liberty and out of all daunger, that you doe tell vs the occasion of your imprisonment, and how it hath bene, if so be that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring doth not trouble you. The Damsell aunswered: Of truth my Lord, this will I doe with a verie good will, and if it were but onely for to giue you contentment, and it is great reason and iustice, for that you did put your person in greate daunger for my deliueraunce: You shall vnderstand, gentle knight, that along the huge and mightie riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> towards the Orientall partes, there is a mightie Citie called <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> the which is not far from the head of the said ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, on the other side of the riuer towards the Sunne setting is there another Citie called <hi>Sabiosa,</hi> of these and of other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and townes there about, my Father is king and Lorde euer. The Gods who were so pleased for to inrich mÃ©e, not onely of goods, but also of beautie &amp; fairenesse, more then anie other in all the kingdome, or in a great part there abouts, the fame of my great beautie was published in all places, which was the occasion that there repaired vnto my fathers Court many Lords &amp; knights of great estimation, amongst whome there came one young knight and a straunger, who was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall of the kingdome of <hi>Tigliafa,</hi> and Lord of the Citye of <hi>Zina,</hi> and he bÃ©eing in loue with me and I lykewise of him, and before that eyther of vs could manifest our loue the one vnto the other, ther passed a long time, but onely by our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards showes, we did declare each to other the abundance of our hearts and signes of loue, the which indured many daies.

So trauailing forwards, they came vnto a bridge which was ouer the riuer <hi>Tygris,</hi> &amp; on the other side there was a Tent armed which was verie rich, wherein was a knight armed which did defend that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and there were set vp against a trÃ©e a greate number of Speares, and when the dutchesse with all her knights &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie entered the bridge, there appeared vnto them a knight of a gentle disposition, who with great lightnesse leapt vpon his horse, and sent a Squire vnto them to tell them that they could not passe that waie, but first they should confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be ouercome by the best knight of all the world, but if they will stand vnto the iust, he that receiueth the foyle to loose both his horse and armour, so in a trice they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in order, at which time the Prince <hi>Claridiano</hi> came vnto that place, and when he sawe that they did make readie and addresse themselues vnto the iust, hee stayed on the one side whereas he might verie well at his pleasure see them. It so fell out, that in twentie iusts all these twentie knights were ouerthrowen and fayled, at which the Dutchesse recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued great sorrow and griefe, and sent the same damsel (which the other had sent before) vnto the Prince, and when she came vnto him, she sayd: Knight, enimie vnto iusts and trauaile, my Ladie, the dutchesse of the valley doth desire thÃ©e, for that it was not thy pleasure for her knights to shew thy bounty,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:236"/>
that now at her request thou wouldest make frÃ©e this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, &amp; do that which her knights could not. Friend sayd <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano,</hi> goe and tell vnto thy Ladie the Dutchesse, that I will procure to make the way sure for me and my companie, and will her highnesse likewise to bring knights that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende her, as well as they can with theyr scoffes knowe how to make a iest at one they know not. The damsell said: Cursed be the reasons &amp; excuses of so euill a knight, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Ladie of estimation, nor knight of prowesse, will bÃ©e moued to vertue, and hÃ©erewith she returned to giue her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the aunswere. So straight way came forth many men for to pull off the armour of those ouercome Knights, the which when <hi>Claridiano</hi> saw, he spurred forwardes his horse with his speare in his hand, ready at all assayes to the iust, and went towards the Dutchesse saying. Lady, now will I shew vnto you, whether I can better kÃ©epe my whole armor, then your Knights their broken, and therewith he called vnto that Knight which kept the passage, that he should make himselfe ready &amp; come to him, and being both set in their places, they mooued their horses the one against the other with great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in the middest of theyr course they met together, and neither of them did misse his blow, but met with so greate force, that the speare of the Knight of the Passage was shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered all to pÃ©eces, and made the Prince to encline his body vpon the saddle, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Passage receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither his shield, nor his armour could make any resistance, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> speare showed it selfe at his back, wherewith he fell from his horse dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d. The Dutchesse when she saw it, receiued great ioy, although the folly of her Knights was a griefe vnto her, in such sorte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she sayd. Oh what doo they deserue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valour of a person wil haue him in derision, for we may wel consider that the Gods can bestow their giftes on persons of small valour, at the least on them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue small capacitie for to vse it, for hÃ©ere you may see this knight, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those knights which did beare me companie, dÃ©emed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did refuse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iust with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of verie cowardnesse, &amp; yet he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deliuereth them,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13973:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they might not altogether be shamed: Oh disordinate pride, enimie to all vertue, such is it that doth remaine in our estates, that altogether it doth make vs to forget all goodnes, yet in our subiects meaner persons we may learne that which is requisite for our commoditie and honour, and yet we doe thinke that all which the Gods doth giue vs, we doe deserue, and yet we finde not our selues satisfied. At which reasons of the Dutchesse, <hi>Claridiano</hi> was verie attentiue, &amp; thought wel of her repentance, for that which her knightes had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and was verie well content, &amp; had her in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be verie honourable, &amp; drawing nigh vnto her he said: Faire Ladie, hÃ©ere you doe sÃ©e y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with great reason the horse &amp; armour of these your knights is mine, &amp; doth pertaine vnto me, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their experience was such to be lanched out of their saddles, as also to mock and iest at trauailing and venterous knights, therefore your pleasure may be to commaund them to be deliuered vnto me<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they knew not how to defend them. The Dutchesse was cut off from her answere by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the comming of a knight with great pride that sayde: The horse and armour is none of thine, first I do giue thee to vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we will defend them with the losse of thy life. And in saying these words he drew out his sword, &amp; before that the Prince could make anie resistance, he cut off one of his horse legs, and the Prince perceiuing it, before his horse did fall, with great lightnesse he clÃ©ered himselfe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and like vnto the winde he went against that vncourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Knight, with his sword in his hande, he stroke him such a blow vpon the head, that he cut it in two parts, and he fel dead to the earth. The rest of the Knights which saw this, came vnto him with their swords in their hands, and for all the crying out of the Dutchesse &amp; her daughter to withdraw them, they did compasse him about altogether, striking him with terrible blowes on euery side: but yet they found him not so weake and without courage as they thought, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a valiant hart he made his defence, &amp; did intreate them in such sort, that afterward it grieued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to haue beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that enterprise, for the Prince so behaued himself, that at thrÃ©e blowes he brought three of them dead to the ground, and for that they were all chosen knightes, for the losse of those that were slaine, they would not leaue to perseuer against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie warriour. The Prince when he perceiued that they dyd still procure to intreate him euill, with great ire and wrath he beganne a new to plague them with his strong and fury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arme, in such sort, that in a small time he made that the halfe of them had lost their strength for to strike at him, the rest which remained when they sawe that there they should looke for no other but death, except they made theyr defence better, or else procure to kill him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which straight way they did put in vre. Then the Prince when he perceiued that stil with great furie they did persecute him, he let slip his shÃ©elde and threw it on his backe, and tooke fast holde of his sword in both his handes, and stroke so terrible a blowe at him which came first to hand, that hitting him on the shoulder, he cut him downe vnto the wast and he fell dead to the ground, then casting his sword about, with an ouerthwart blowe he stroke another on the throate, that he made his head to flye from his shoulders, &amp; in that furie he brought other two dead to the ground, the other sixe which remained sÃ©eing his diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish furie began to withdrawe themselues. Then the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Dutchesse sÃ©eing the other knights to retire, came vnto the Prince, and with great grace and curtesie she said: Valiant knight of the Ladies, I doe desire thÃ©e for curtesies sake to cease thy furie, &amp; let not the force of thy strong arme procÃ©ede farther, but let this my desire and request moue thÃ©e to that which twentie knightes of valour could not obtaine. This noble warriour although he was blind and ouercome with anger and wrath, yet could he not but pacifie himselfe, seeing with what humilitie this faire Gentlewoman did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him, and without anie more replying he did withdrawe himselfe, and leapt vpon the horse of the knight of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, for that <hi>Fidelio</hi> did take and brought after that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horse of his master was slaine, and therewith he passed ouer the bridge, and began to take his iourney forwards, leauing all

them which saw the battaile, very much amazed at his great prowesse. So they trauailed with great haste, because they would come vnto their lodging before night, &amp; making hast, they came vnto a mans house, who did lodge them, being in great feare, the occasion shall be told you in the next chapter following.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T such time as the bright <hi>Apollo,</hi> woulde spread abroad his beames vpon the cold and moyst earth, was that valiaunt knight <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano</hi> on horseback, with all his company, for to prosecute his iourney, and vppon a sodaine, he heard with a great noyse &amp; rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they shut the gates of the house. Then the Prince asked what was the occasion of that great noyse, and it was told him by his hoast, how that it was for to kÃ©epe out two great Gyants, which of late dayes did vse all those wayes &amp; fields, dooing all the harme possible, in taking and killing all that euer they might, and they doo carrye with them fifteene Knights, for to help them to doo all this euill, for which cause all this Countrey standeth in great feare, and dare not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile by the wayes, and vnderstanding that many doe come this way, to goe sÃ©e the triumphs and feasts at <hi>Nabatea,</hi> they doo vse hÃ©ere great pride and arrogancie, carrying away with them many prisoners, as well men as women. So when the Prince heard this, as one that did procure no other thing, but to augment his honour, and increase his fame, he sayd. Commaund that the gates may be open, for that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accompt my selfe in the number of Knights, but that I will cause them to leaue off dooing such harme, and also set them at libertie, whom they doo carry captiues, and ease thÃ©e of this great feare in the which thou art. O for the loue thou
<pb facs="tcp:13973:238"/>
dost beare vnto the Gods, gentle Knight, sayd the Hoste of the house, doo not put these thy tender yeares in perill to bee slaine, or carried away prisoner by those furious beasts. To whom <hi>Claridiano</hi> aunswered. It will be rather a shamefull reproch vnto my fame, if there shuld lack in me, that which I am bound by the order of Knighthood to performe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my good Host, let this suffice, that neither your request nor any others peticions, shall perswade me to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but that I will goe forth and procure to abate so greate pride and harme, for that in making an ende of my dayes, in defence against these cruell people, then haue I performed that I am bound to, &amp; haue promised to doo, therfore I pray thÃ©e comnaund that the gates may be opened. When the Host saw his determined purpose and will, he commaunded the gates to be opened. The two Ladyes receiued great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and griefe, for that which the Knight did: but much more was the griefe of <hi>Fidelio,</hi> although he was throughlie certified of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valour of his Lord, yet he letted not but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feare his returne, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the enterprise was very daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and doubtfull, and would very faine haue gone with his Lord, but he wold in no case consent thervnto, but wold alone goe forth vpon this enterprise. So this noble warrior rode forth with the visor of his helme vp, and his shield on his arme, and a mightie cutting sword in his hand, and put himselfe in the middest of the high waye, and in a smal time after, he saw a chariot which was drawen with sixe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the Giants saw his great hardines, one of them,

which by reason of his deformed members, trauailed on a mightie great horse, came foorth before all the rest, whereas this GrÃ©eke was: and when he came nigh him, he sayde in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> tongue. Thou Knight, what diuell hath caused thÃ©e to commit so great folly, for to abide my fury, arte thou so certefied of thy great valor, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wilt sÃ©e the proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Then the valiant sonne of the great <hi>Alphebo</hi> answered. Neither my folly, nor yet the trust which thou saist I haue, hath moued me, but onely this thy crueltie &amp; euill customes which thou dost vse, for that the immortall Gods are verye angry, that they haue indued you with so mightie members and strength, and you thus imploye them, exercising nothing but vilenesse and crueltie, and therefore they doo send me, as their messenger, to make manifest vnto you their great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wrath, promising great punishment, if you doo not leaue to follow these peruerse customes which you doo vse, &amp; if it be so that you are determined not to leaue this euill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and amend your life, hÃ©ere in their names I doo defie you in mortall battaile. The Giant with the great pride he had, and with the anger that he receiued, when he heard the spÃ©ech of the Prince, the words doubled so in his mouth, that he could not make any aunswere, but threwe out from his mouth and nose great abundaunce of smoake, which almost tooke away their sights like a myst, and spurring forwardes his great beast, who was very light, that with a trice he was with the Prince, and before he could make any resistaunce, he stroke him so terrible a blow with both his handes with his heauie clubbe vpon his fine and hard stÃ©eled helme that it made him to stagger, and to fall down vpon his horse neck, and his spears fell out of his hande, and his armes hanged downe, as though he had bene dead and out of his nose and mouth procÃ©eded great quantitie of bloud.</p>
               <p>His horse who was verye swifte and strong, gaue a spring in the aire, and tourned about, carrying his master a long time about the fielde, sprinkeling with bloud all the waye whereas he went.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:239"/>The Giant did not remaine content after that he had giuen him this blow, but did follow him for to double it, with the which he thought to make an ende of that worke: but this thought lasted not long, for that this GrÃ©eke Knight was come againe to himselfe, and as he was setlyng himselfe in his saddle, he perceiued very well the great daunger, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ord, and went towards the Gyaunt saying. Tarie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thou furious beast, for hÃ©ere I sweare vnto thÃ©e by the immortal Gods, that very quickly I meane to giue thÃ©e thy paiment, which thy terrible blow doth deserue. The Prince at that time was so full of wrath, that he might well haue bene counted hardie, that durst at that time come to him face to face. And when he came whereas the Giant was, he stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched himselfe vpon his stirrops, and stroke so terrible a blow vpon the giants shoulder, which was with so great strength, that all that quarter he cut cleane awaye, and threwe him dead to the ground: which caused great contentment vnto all those, that were in the house beholding them. The other Giant when he saw his companion dead, with great wrathe he commaunded the fiftÃ©ene Knightes, that altogether they should assault that mortall enimye, who were not slacke in accomplishing his commaundement. Oh vnhappy people, if you had considered, how that this young Knight had lost the reynes of his pacience, you would not haue bene so hardy to assault him, for that strong mountaines were not sufficient to make resistance against him, neither would ye haue ben so bold, to giue him any occasion of offence. This worthy war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour when he saw this his shamefull assault, without loosing any part of his courage, he went and encountred them, laying about him, striking on the right hand, and on the left hand, with so much fury, as a Lyon, when he is compassed about
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13973:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with expert hunters, euen so be vsed himself. These knights were all stout and chosen knights, and of the lineall descent of Gyants, and did not let to strike him manye and furious blowes, which made him many times almost to lÃ©ese his wittes, which was caused by his great ire and wrathe, for it was such, that he felt in himselfe no increasing of force: yet for all that, he did so imploye his blowes, that ten of them, some with their heads clouen in pÃ©eces, and other some with their armes cut off, he ouerthrew dead to the ground. The other Giant was meruailously amazed to sÃ©e so incredible a thing, but puffing and blowing like to a Bull, he set hand to his mightie and great cutting sword, and with great furye he likewise assaulted the valiant Knight on the one side, and stroke at him such a blow, that he made him to stoope &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his body to his horse necke, but quickly he raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vp againe, and with great lightnesse he clÃ©ered himselfe from the second blow, which he sawe descending vpon him, and therewith he stroke two blowes at two of those fiue Knights which remained, so that he brought them both dead to the ground. The Gyant when he saw so much strength in one Knight, being very much kindeled in wrath, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the thrÃ©e Knights which remained, to withdrawe themselues a parte, so that the Giaunt and the Knight made their assault together with such terrible blowes, that it was wonderfull to see. The Knight with both his hands stroake at the Giant, so that both their blowes descended together, with so great strength and noyse, that it made a meruailous sound throughout all the mountaints. The Giaunt was he which receceiued the most harme, by reason that his armor made but small resistance against the terrible blowes of the Knight, which was the occasion that he was hurt and wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in many places. The Giant sÃ©eing his great resistaunce roared like a baighted Bul, procuring withall the power he had to hurt the Prince. In this sort they indured more then an houre without taking any rest, at which time the Giant did fÃ©ele in himselfe some wearinesse, and would with one blow make an ende of this battaile, or put his life in ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:240"/>
and therewith he stroke with all his force so terrible a blow at the prince, that he made him to fall vpon his horse crupper, but straight waye he was setled againe in his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and striking his horse with the spurs, he came vnto the Gyant, at such time as he had his sword aloft, to discharge it vpon the Prince, but he thrust at him a foyne at the sight of his healme, which was very large, in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he stroke him betwixt both his eyes, and the sword passed through to his necke, so that the Gyant fell downe dead to the ground, which was no small ioye vnto all the Prisoners that were in the Chariot. The other thrÃ©e Knights when they saw all things to goe so ill on their parts, they let loose their horse bridles, and with great hast they procured to hide themselues in the thickest of the forrest. The Prince made no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, but let them goe, and went straight waye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chariot, and lighted from his horse, and went vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it for to vnloose those prisoners which were bounde, and sayd vnto those Ladyes. Receiue this seruice of me, not for any courtesie that I found in your Knights, but for the great bountie and vertue, which is in the Dutches and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Earle of the dÃ©epe lake aunswered and sayde. Of truth, gentle Knight, it had bene better that you had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our demaund, which we asked in the seruice of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: for that being subdued by your great valour, we had not come into so great miserie and trouble in the which we haue sÃ©ene our selues. Sir Earle aunswered the prince <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano,</hi> my heart is so cleane voyd of the subiection of loue, (putting apart my bounden dutie towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>) that by the oath that I haue sworne to the order of Knighthood, that it is not to be meruailed if I did denie your demaund, putting for intercessour that, which my heart was neuer subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Then the Dutchesse with a goodly grace sayd: Yet I do certefie you gentle Knight, that at this time you shall not remaine so much at your owne libertie, but that by me you shal be constrained to be my guide to the Citie of <hi>Nabatea.</hi> With condition sayd the Prince, that the day of the iusting, you doo not manifest my person, vnto any creature.

The condition aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Dutchesse daughter, is graunted and accepted, but yet I must nÃ©edes charge you with another request, which I will aske of you, and it is, that in my name, and as my Knight, you wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I cannot deny anything y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you doo aske of me, said <hi>Claridiano,</hi> for that you haue power to commaund me, and therefore I doo accept, and graunt vnto all things that your highnesse shall demaund. And being in this communication, the Princesses thet remained at their Hostes, came whereas they were, and in their companye the Knight of the house, who was almost in an extasie with the great ioye and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he had, to sÃ©e the two Giants and his company dead, and requested them instantly, that they would goe vnto his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to take their rest: to the which they did graunt, for the necessitie which did mooue them. <hi>Galtenor</hi> did declare vnto vs what shuld be done vnto these Giants, and said that they were Lords of the faire Ilands, enemies vnto the King of the <hi>Nabateos,</hi> and as they had vnderstanding of the greate triumphs and feasts which was proclaimed in <hi>Nabatea,</hi> thrÃ©e of those Giaunts, which were all bretheren, went forth to doo all the harme they might, in company with their mother who was a great inchaunter. The one of the Giants who was more furious and of a mightier strength then the other two, wold goe alone, and these two came together of whom wer haue tolde you. The Knights of the Dutchesse wer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailously ill intreated in the battaile which they had with <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and it was requisite that they should remaine a few daies in the castle, for to ease &amp; comfort themselues: but the Prince his hart could not in any wise suffer to tarry so long to ease himselfe, but tooke his leaue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dutchesse for to depart, who did graunt it vnto him with a very good wil, for that she would remaine in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Castle, till such time as her knights wer better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>forted &amp; amended.

And when they vnderstoode that the time of the Triumphes drew nÃ©ere, they tooke the waye which led them straight vnto the Citie of <hi>Nabatea</hi>: and for to goe thether, they must nÃ©edes passe thorough a woode of eight miles long, in the which they trauailed til it was noone time, and therein they discouered a very faire castle, and fÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themselues somewhat weary, they went thether for to refresh themselues, the which chanced vnto them otherwise, as in the chapter following you shall vnderstand.</p>

There was no long tarrying after when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out of a window from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest part of the castell, there was let downe a basket which was made verie fast aboue with a strong rope.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of teares. Whan this grÃ©eke knight saw this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creature, he remayned in great admiration, considering with him selfe, if that by aduenture she should be the same <hi>Pastora,</hi> which the princes of <hi>Ierosolima</hi> had told him of. Then this <hi>Pastora</hi> did open hir faire and christalyne eyes, looking earnestly vpon the knight, and giuing a greuous and sorowfull sigh, she withdrew hir selfe from the grate, which caused the grÃ©eke knight to haue great desire to know who it should be, suspecting that by force of some inchantment, she should be put therein, where-with there kindled in his heart a new Fyer of loue: And casting vp his eyes agayne to sÃ©e if he might sÃ©e her, he could not, but saw in the very same place, a woman, of a very great stature, who was all armed, with a sword gyrt at hir wast, &amp; had hanging at her neck a bowe, and a gylt Quiuer, this lady was of so greate beautie, that she seemed almost to excell the <hi>Pastora,</hi> so that the Prince, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight which he had before him, forgot that which was past, and fixed his eyes on hir. But in the same sort vpon a sodayne, she went away as the first dyd, leuing the knight with no lesse trouble in his thought, then before he was. This knight had not much tyme to bewayle the absence of that Ladie, for that without sÃ©eing any body, he was stroken such a blow with so great fury vpon his back, that he was constrained to stoop with one knÃ©e to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d. Yet with a tryse he arose vp agayne: and looking about him to sÃ©e who it was that stroke him, he perceiued that it was
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:13973:242"/>
a knight, which with great hast ran in at a dore which was at one of the corners of the court. And with the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which the Prince reseiued, to sÃ©e him selfe in such sort so ill intreated, he followed him with his accustomed light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, following after that Knight in at the dore. He was not two steppes in at the dore, when that he fell downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dÃ©epe caue, which was couered ouer in such subtyl sort, that whosoeuer dyd treade on it, he straight-way fell down into the caue, except he were aduertised thereof. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the caue it was very darke, and no light appeared. The Knight sÃ©eing himselfe so betrayed in that trappe, he feared to receiue some harme in the fall. But yet verye lightlie he put him selfe on foote, with his Sword drawen in his hand, for to make his defence, againste whatsoeuer should happen. But by reason of the great darknesse, he could not see any thing, neither discouer wherein he was fallen, but determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to settle himselfe againste somewhat, if he might fynde where, groping to sÃ©e if he might fynde any other dore of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into that darke Denne.</p>
               <p>And as the knight went groping and fÃ©eling, he found that he trode on no other thing but dead mennes bones, which caused him to stand still. And not long after there was open a louer hole, at the which entred much clearenesse, and gaue great light into the place whereas he was: whereat appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a very olde woman, who was so leane &amp; so ful of wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, that it seemed she had nothing but skin and bones on hir, who sayd vnto the Prince, in an euill houre thou camest he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; so shall thy lodging be, and thine entertainment, for that thou art now in place, that thou maist looke for no other thing, but to be meate vnto a furious beast. And thy surmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted strength shal not be able to make any defence. The prince who was very wrath, answered, Oh false &amp; cursed Witch, whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods confound, who hath taught thÃ©e to vse so great disceit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy false &amp; diuelish vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ding, thou dost work so much euil against all traueling &amp; ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trous knights.

All that thou doest and wilt doe sayd the olde woman, I wil suffer at thy handes, onely for the reuengement I will take of thÃ©e, and that verie quickly, and therewith she went from that windowe and shut it fast againe. So not long after at his backe he heard a noise, as though they were opening of a doore little and little, whereas there appeared a little light, the Prince procuring to go thether, saw that the bones wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he trode were of two humane bodies, which appeared not to be verie long since their flesh was torne of with hard and cruel tÃ©eth, but this consideration could not indure long with him, for that he heard a great rumor, &amp; looking what it should be, he sawe that there was comming forth of another den a mightie Serpent with wings, as great in bodie as an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, which had onely two fÃ©ete which appeared out of that monstrous bodie but a span in length, and each foot had thrÃ©e clawes of thrÃ©e spans in length, she came with her mouth open of so monstrous and huge bignesse, and so deformed, that a whole armed knight might enter in therat, and she had on her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But fortune was so fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto him, that he might strike her on the belly, whereas she had no defence with shells nor any other thing but fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereas he gaue her a great wound: but if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blowe had bene ouerthwart as it was right downe, he had surelye slaine her at that time, but yet it was not so little, but that it was mortall, whereout issued much bloud.

But that terrible blow was not so soone passed ouer him, but straight waies he was on his feete, at such time as the furious beast came towards him. HÃ©ere the Prince hauing a great confidence in his owne strength, did so high and valiant prowesse, that you may put in obliuion, all the valiantnes that euer was done by his predecessors, and put this in perpetuall memorie. For that he threw his sword out of his hand, and went vnto this monster, and imbraced himselfe with her, &amp; did so quease her betwixt his mightie armes, with so much strength y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beast could not profit her self of her sharp clawes, but only with her wings, she beat him on euery side, this valiant

Long time indured this great &amp; daungerous wrastling, &amp; that infernall beast fast vnto the noble and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant breast of the GrÃ©eke Prince, till such time as he plainly perceiued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this monster begane to waxe faint &amp; to loose hir strength: likewise it could not be otherwise but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince waxed somewhat wearie, notwithstanding he did animate himselfe sÃ©eing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great weaknesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Serpent, which was by reason of the great quantitie of bloud which came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> her wound, &amp; hauing opportunitie he tooke his sword wherwith he thrust her into the heart with so great strength y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he cloue it in two peeces, and so this infernall monster fell downe dead to the ground, and carried the Prince with her, for that they wer still fast together, and by reason that she lacked her strength to make her defence he quickly clÃ©ered himselfe out of her clawes, and recouered his sword, and when he sawe certainly that he was clÃ©ere from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruell monster, he knÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe and gaue great thankes vnto his Gods, the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was great which this monster threw out for to infect the knight, but by reason of the greate vertue which was in the armour that <hi>Galtenor</hi> gaue him, there was nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> could hurt him, although he remained verie wearie &amp; vnquiet, and was constrained to sit &amp; coole and refresh himselfe by a well which was full of water there hard by, whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furious beast came forth, &amp; when he found himselfe somwhat refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he looked about him and sawe a paire of staires, wherat he determined to go vp: he had not ascended many steps, but at the clift of a doore which he found, he saw sitting at a great table many people eating and drinking, and at the vpper end ther sate the gyantesse, and next vnto her by her side a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie great &amp; furious Gyant, such a one as he had neuer sÃ©ene the like, &amp; hearkning what they did say, he heard y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse said: Now hath our reuenger his dinner betwÃ©ene his

clawes, for that hÃ©e is so quiet, although he hath bene a great while in making of it ready, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant asked &amp; said: Was ther anie of you which saw what armor this knight brought &amp; what recognices he had, then one which was there eating said: I did sÃ©e what recognices he had, then the old magicall witch said vnto her sonne, now that you certainly know he is dead, I wil tell you who it was: You shall vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the knight that slew my two sonnes &amp; thy brothers. The gyant when he heard this, stroke with his hand a great blow vpon the table, saying: Oh Gods, &amp; wherefore did you not tel me thereof before, that I with my own hands might haue taken the reuengment, cursed be thine inchantments, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are the occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mightie force of my armes do loose the glorie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do deserue. All this which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the knight heard, &amp; by their reasons he knew that they were all of the lineall desent of those gyants which he slew, for to set at libertie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princesse of the valley, &amp; hearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so vilely spoken of he could not indure to stand there long, for his cholar did so ouercome him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger refraine, but set his shulder vnto the doore with so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble strength, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he threw it downe to the ground, at which fal it made a terrible noise, which caused al them that were ther to be greatly amazed, but yet their wonder was much more to sÃ©e that the knight was at libertie &amp; clÃ©ere from that vgly beast, who they thought had ben dead and deuoured by her, but when they sawe him they all procured to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and to runne away, so that the Gyant remained all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in that place, &amp; rising vp from the boord, stretching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on his fÃ©et, he said: O my Gods I do giue thanks for y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> you haue deliuered this vile knight fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> furious beast, that I with my hands may take reuengment of him. And in saying these wordes hÃ©e drew out a mightie sword which he had hanging at his side, &amp; went towards the prince striking at him a terrible blow, from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which this GrÃ©ek did clÃ©ere himselfe with his accustomed lightnesse, &amp; being past y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blow he sayd: Gyant, goe &amp; arme thy selfe, and hÃ©ere I will tarrie for thee, by which meanes thou maist defend thy selfe,

and make thy reuengement as thy heart desireth, and do not thou thinke that I will glorie in the abating of thy courage, but with the great valour the which my high minde doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. The Gyant when he sawe himselfe derided and that the knight made little account of him, was with the greate anger which he receiued almost beside himselfe, and sayd: Oh vile and miserable creature, is it possible that the Gods will doo me so great outrage, as to consent that I shall take ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour against thÃ©e, and that thou hast so much force, as to driue me vnto that necessitie. And in saying these words, he lift vp againe his broad &amp; mightie sword against the prince, who lykewise clÃ©ered himselfe of that blow as he did of the first. Then the Prince sayd vnto him: Thou deformed beast without any humane reason, doo not procure by thy greate pride to spot or staine the nobilitie of my person, to cause me to strike thÃ©e, without hauing any armour, to make thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The Giant made little accompt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counsell he gaue him, but rather assalted him with more terrible blowes. But all that euer he did was in vaine, for that the Prince with great experience and lightnesse cleered himselfe from them, and tarried y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time, that he might haue opportunitie to close with him, for to shew him the fruites of his fists, for at that time he had not drawen his sword. A good while they were in this contention, till such time as those Knights which ran away (which was to the number of ten) had time to arme themselues, and to returne againe into that place whereas they were eating, who came all in a readinesse with theyr swords in their hands. When the Prince saw the great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill which was towards him, he was constrained to drawe out his sword for to make his defence against that wicked company. The olde Witch called with a mightie voyce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her sonne, that he should enter in and arme himselfe, for that she suspected as a Deuine, what should happen. (O cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed heart, that is so great a friend vnto cruell reuengment: how dost thou procure to heape vpon thy selfe such shame &amp; reproch, seeking without all Iustice to doo that, which it wer better for thee to haue left vndone.) Full little did it profit

The other fiue knights when they sawe that terrible blowe, they threw their swords vnto the ground, and yÃ©elded themselues vnto the curtesie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> GrÃ©eke knight. The olde Gyantesse when she sawe her sonne dead, and those knights yeelded, with a great furie and terrible shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king she put her selfe before the knight and sayd: O cruell Butcher, the destroyer of my welbeloued sonnes, make now an end of her who doth more deserue the death then they, and doe not thinke that thou shalt obtaine so much victorie as to carrie me awaie with thÃ©e aliue, and if that with thy cruell hand thou wilt not make an end of her that is without all good fortune, I promise thÃ©e that I will procure to giue it my selfe with my owne hands. And in saying these wordes shÃ©e went vnto the place whereas he sonne lay dead, and layde holde on his sharpe sword, and with a trice she thrust it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her bodie, that none that were there present had anie time to withdraw her from doing it, which bÃ©eing done, her mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Surely it caused great admiration to all them that remained a liue: but much more was the griefe of the Ladies which tarried for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, when they saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he tarried so long, &amp; also afterward when they heard that great noyse of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at the breaking vp of that inchaunted Castle. It was no lesse to be wondred at, to sÃ©e the huge and mightie Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, &amp; the great giant with his mother, and the fiue knights that were slaine, vnderstanding that the Prince had made all that destruction.

And at such time as the gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Apollo</hi> began to hide his face, and to couer himselfe, according to his accustomed order, they came vnto a fayre Castle, which was a little without the woode, whereas of the Lorde thereof, they were verye well receiued: yet much more royal was their entertainment, and farre greater was his affection towards them, when he knew of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> destruction of that inchaunted Castle, for that he had felte and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the inconuenience of that ill neighbour.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE fame of the valiant knight <hi>Claridiano,</hi> with his accustomed gentillitie was noised throughout all those Prouinces of <hi>Nabatea,</hi> publishing his heroicall actes and feates of armes, naming him to be the knight of the damsells, and when he drew nigh vnto <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batea,</hi> there did not lacke them which gaue the king to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand of all that passed. When the king heard of so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and valiant dÃ©edes, and in speciall of that which was done in the inchaunted castell, and of the furiousnesse of the serpent, he commanded straight y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men shuld be sent thether, for to bring them vnto his presence which straight way was accomplished, and when the King saw, so great worthinesse, he commaunded that forthwith for a perpetuall memory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight, they shuld be hanged at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pallaice gate, desirous to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight, &amp; to haue him in his court for to do him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: but they which had more desire to sÃ©e him, wer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of the valley and her Daughter. Who were at that time come so the Court, and declared the greate prowesse of the Prince, and thought long for the daye of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, for as then hÃ©e promised without faile to be at <hi>Nabatea,</hi> so the daie of the feastes were come, at the fame wherof, resorted thether a great number of great valour and strength. Amongst whom was the prince of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> with a goodly company of noble persone, and the Prince of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenia</hi> with many and very well proprtioned Knightes. Likewise came thether the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> with greate
<pb facs="tcp:13973:247"/>
maiestie, and with no lesse maiestie came the king of <hi>Silicia,</hi> and a brother of his, who were both Gyants. So likewise came thether the king of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> all these be Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that doth border the one with the other, &amp; the most part of these Princes are vassalls vnto the Prince of <hi>Palestino,</hi> all these Princes came thether for to honour that good king of <hi>Nabatea,</hi> for that he was very well estÃ©emed of them all: and as they came to honour the King, so likewise they came to proue themselues, and to get fame and name, &amp; the praise that belongeth therevnto. It was supposed of all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the king of <hi>Silicia</hi> would haue the prowesse and praise of all the rest, for that he was a gyant of verie bigge members, although his brother was taken to be more furious, who determined not to iust, for that his brother shuld get the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; praise, but it fell out otherwise, as heereafter you shal vnderstand. So when the daie was come all the Ladies and Damsells put themselues in places for to beholde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feasts, and euerie one procured to set out her selfe with the greatest brauerie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might be, and the great court full of people which came thether for to see the feasts and triumphs. What shall I saie heere of the daughter of the Dutchesse of the valley, who was of so great beautie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she was noted amongst them all. So the knights began to enter into the place of iust, and he which was the first that entered was the Prince of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenia,</hi> who was mounted vpon a verie faire and well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned courser, he was armed with blacke armour all to bÃ©e spotted full of Martines, &amp; brought with him fiftie knightes all apparelled with the same liuerey, and with great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13973:247"/>
must make themselues ready. These Knights were nothing vnwilling, but spurred their coursers with great fury. The Prince of <hi>Camogenia</hi> made his encounter whole, &amp; stroke the Pagan without missing any poynt: but the pagan stroke the other in such sort that he heaued him out of the saddle, &amp; he fell to the ground, wherewith the Pagan Knight remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with great pride and gladnesse. In the meane time that these two wer in the Iust, there entred in a Knight of <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> who entred in with great pompe and pride, who when he saw that the Prince of <hi>Camogenia</hi> was ouerthrowen, he put himselfe vnto the Iust. Little did profite him his great pride and arrogancie, &amp; outward show to be a strong knight against him of <hi>Siria,</hi> for that at the first encounter he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him to the ground: in like sort did he vse other fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tÃ©ene Knights of diuers Prouinces. So straight way entred the Prince of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> who was a meruailous well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned knight, armed all in white armour, wrought with excellent knots of gold, and he brought in his companye an hundred Knights, all apparailed in white satten, and riding about the place, he shewed his obedience vnto the King and all the Ladies. Then he put himselfe at his standing, for at that time ther was not a knight to iust withall. So straight way they sounded the trumpets, at which noyse the Knights mooued themselues to the Iust with their horses, and made their encounter so strong, &amp; with so great fury, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the strong Pagan was cast to the grounde, and the like he did to other sixe ventrous Knights, which entred into the place. Straight way entred the braue King of <hi>Silicia,</hi> who was armed with glistering armour of very fine stÃ©ele, and was mounted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a very mightie and rich courser, and brought in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany two hundred Knights all apparailed with rich cloth of golde, accompanied with greate musicke of minstrelles which was a pleasaunt noyse to be heard, and after that hÃ©e had made the accustomed compasse and curtesie in the place, he put himselfe at the Iust. So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>n signs were made, they spurred their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13973:248"/>
but the prince was caryed ouer his horse buttocks, &amp; caryed the saddle with him betwixt his legges, which was a great griefe vnto all them that dyd see him, for that he was wel-beloued of them all. This arrogant gyant was so encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, &amp; so furyous that in a small tyme he left not a knight remaining in their saddles on horseback. And being in this great pryde, there was hard a great noyse and russhing, in maner of a tumult in the place. And loking what it should be, they saw that it was the knight of the Damsells which entred, who was armed with his riche and strong Armour, all of Purple, full of golden Starres. And before him came the two Damsells, which alwayes were in his company. The Princes of <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> caryed his shield, &amp; the Princes of <hi>Mesopotamia<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> his Speare. Showing by his person the highnesse of his discent. Who passed by the royal seat wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the good King was, in whose company was his sonne the prince, armed with very rich armour, also the lord of mount <hi>Libano,</hi> a very auncient knight and of great authoritie. So on the other side was the princes, the daughter of the King of <hi>Nabatea,</hi> who was the bryde, a very fayre and comely gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and with her the Dutches of the valley and her Daughter. And behinde them, was the Earle of the dÃ©epe Lake, who was still very weake of the passed battaile, and was richly apparelled with blew cloth of Gold. And as this knight passed by, the knight arose vp and showed him cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie. The Dutches of the Ualley could not refraine hir selfe but that with a high voyce she sayd vnto the King. Mightie king, this is the knight in whom the gods hath put all their power &amp; strength, that his valour may be more then theirs. This warlike knight, although he heard very well what the Dutches had sayde, passed on, and descembled as though he had hard nothing. And when he came to the Iust, he toke his shylde and his speare, and prepared himselfe redy to the Iust. So strayght wayes being in a readinesse, they sowned the Trumpets, where at which great fury, they moued their Coursers, &amp; neither of them missed theyr blow at theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, but by reason that the GrÃ©eke had great good will to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13973:248"/>
extol his fame, he stroke the gyant so mightie a blow, that he ouerthrew him to the ground. So the prince passed alongest, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great magestie, without any show of disdaine. The people with a great shout sayde. The great mightie &amp; royal <hi>Agilao</hi> is ouerthrowen to the ground, so that his mightie strength hath little auailed him. Then the prince of <hi>Fenicia,</hi> would proue his aduenture with the Greke, but with great ease he was turned to the ground. So all the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights that were of any estimation, made their Iust, but they were all w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great ease ouerthrowen to the ground, in lesse then the space of two houres. So at such time as the bright <hi>Febus</hi> would make an ende of his long iourney, there apeared to enter in to the place the braue and mightie Gyant, brother vnto the king of <hi>Silicia,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a mightie great speare in his hand, whose glystering poynt of Steele showed through all the field. He brought with him but one only squyer, which brought with him another speare, and without any care of courtesie due, he put himselfe into the place. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Squire which brought his other Speare, went vnto <hi>Claridiano,</hi> &amp; sayd: Knight, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der valiant gyant doth send vnto thÃ©e this Speare, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thÃ©e that thou dost procure to doo the vttermost of thy power before that the Sunne doth set, for that he will doo the like: &amp; likewise he saith, that he doth not only defie thÃ©e in the Iust, but also to mortall battaile. To whom <hi>Claridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> said: Friend, go thy waies &amp; tell this giant y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sent thee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I doe accept his demaund, although it doth grÃ©eue me verie much, for that without anie occasion he maketh this defiance in time of so great ioy and pleasure, which is done in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of so mightie a king, but sÃ©eing his will is moued with so great pride, tell him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am readie to make my defence, &amp; also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shortly he shall repent him of this enterprise, &amp; in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these words he tooke the speare of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> squire, &amp; put himself in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> standing: at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time he was verie nigh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where the king was, who heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> answere which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> GrÃ©eke made, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he receiued great anger, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Giant in such sort shuld defie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any occasion: but it was no time as then to speake, but to hold his peace, &amp; prayed vnto his
<pb facs="tcp:13973:249"/>
Gods for to take away his great pride and arrogancie. At this time the two warriours tarryed the signe to be made by the trumpets: which being giuen, these Knights mooued their coursers, with their speares in their rests, with so great yre and desire the one to hurt the other, that they both fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in theyr incounter. The Giant who was verye proude, when he saw that he had erred his blow, he returned against <hi>Claridiano,</hi> carrieng his speare vppon his shoulder, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming nigh him, vpon a sodaine and with great fury he tooke it from his shoulder, and before the GrÃ©eke could clÃ©ere him selfe, he strake him a mightie blow vpon the armour, so that his staffe broke by reason of the finenesse of the armour, and made the good warriour to double his body backwards vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Horse crupper. But when he saw the great villany which the Giaunt vsed with him, his anger increased verye much, &amp; taking his speare in the same sort, he went towards the Giant and sayd. Thou furious and proude beast, what didst thou thinke to goare me lyke as thou wouldest doo a wilde Boare, tarrie, and I will make thÃ©e to vnderstand, if I can make my knottie speare to flye in the aire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he threw his speare at him with so great furie, that he stroke him on the breast in such sort, that the speare passed through his body, and showed it selfe at his backe, so that this Giant fell downe dead to the ground, and all that were there present, were very much amazed at the great-strength and force of this Knight. At this time the Sunne had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his course, hauing nothing aboue the Horizon but his gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering beames, then the Iudges of the feastes commaunded with sound of trumpets that the Iusts should cease, &amp; make an ende of the day. So the King descended from the place where he was into the Court with all his Knights for to receiue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat good warriour, and desired him that he wold go with them vnto his pallaice, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he could not make deniall. And when he should enter into the great gate of the Pallaice, he saw the Serpent, and the heads of the Gyants, and when the King perceiued that he did beholde them, he sayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:13973:249"/>This remembraunce (good knight) I commaunded to be put here in thy name, for to be a perpetuall memorie of thy high and mightie Chiualrie. The Prince there at would not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere making as though he did not esteme it much, for that he had with himselfe no pryde. And therewith they assendid vp into the great hall, where as they were maruailously wel receiued of the Ladies and damsells. And leauing <hi>Antemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and <hi>Belia,</hi> with the Bryde, and with the QuÃ©ene hir mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe, he retourned and went with the King, wheras they dyd intreate him with great maiestie. So he remained eight dayes in company with the King in his courte, for to take his ease, in which tyme the most part of the kings, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and knightes were departed, and the King of <hi>Silicia,</hi> with the dead bodie of his brother. These eight dayes past this GrÃ©eke prince dyd take his leaue of the King, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time to make defence in the quarrell of the Princesse drawe on, the which he had great care thereof. It grieued the king ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much for his departure, but seing that he was constrained therevnto, he would not hinder him, but offered him verye great and rich giftes, but the prince would not receiue any.

The King brought him vnto the foote of the stayre, whereas <hi>Fidelio</hi> was tarying for him, with a mightie and rich Horse, one of the furious that was to be founde in all the countrie.

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a new he fel down in a sownd, as at the first. Both the princes wer greatly amased, not knowing what it should be, which hath caused so much alteration.

For that the new wound would not suffer him to take any rest, which caused him to take his leaue of the king and his daughter, and departed, and toke the way towards <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> with great desyre to be there.

And if it be so that your highnesse doth accept thereof, and giue them lisence, he will come he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and defend hir right. The prince of <hi>Palestina</hi> when he hard that which was spoken, with great laughter, although not very well content, sayde. And who is he that is so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; foole-hardie, to come, and gaine-saye my fury, the truth being on my syde. <hi>Libernio</hi> sayde, it is he that will make thee to acknowledge thy falsehod, and will make thÃ©e forget thy fury &amp; mightie strength, by vsing of his valiant prowes. Whereat <hi>Brandemoran</hi> was so full of wrath, and his eyes

sparkling lyke fyer, he sayde: If it were not for that I am before the royall presence of the King, I would giue thee to vnderstand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy gray haires had not spake with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which thou oughtest to haue. Then the King sayd, prince pacifie your courage, &amp; be quiet, and thou <hi>Libernio</hi> retourne, &amp; tell them that they may come when their pleasure is. And for the right of my daughter, (if she haue any) he shall haue safe conduct to come and make hir defence. And if it be so that they haue nÃ©ede of any thing, speake that they may haue all furnished that is requisite. Go thy wayes and tary not, for that I haue great desire to sÃ©e either my shame or honour. For I am in such a stay, to se my selfe so dishonoured, that I think it better that I were dead.

So <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> put in order his departure out of hand, leauing the king somewhat content, &amp; almost without suspection of any euill, seing that his daughter was returned to defend hir right. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernio</hi> when he had got mourning apparell for the Princes, departed to the place whereas he left them, declaring vnto hir all that hir father had sayde, and what passed in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. So therewith they procured and made hast, to finishe their iourney. And they made so much hast, that before it was night they came within two myles of the citie wher as they rested all that night, with great desire that the morning wer come. So verye earely in the morning at the breake of the day, they put them selues on horseback, and went forwards on theyr iourney. So that one houre after the Sunne had stretched forth his golden beames vpon the moyst earth and fragrant flowers, this GrÃ©eke knight and the Princes entred into the citie of <hi>Mesos,</hi> not resting in any place, til they came vnto the kinges pallaice, wheras they alighted and went vp into the great hall. <hi>Claridiano</hi> led <hi>Antemisca</hi> by the hande, his Helme fast vpon his head, and his purple Shylde on his shoulder, but the visor of his Helme was vp, so that all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might sÃ©e his fayre &amp; great visage, and all that saw him, dyd iudge him to be of a high lynage.

The lady vnderstode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of hir father, gathered stomack vnto hir selfe &amp; said: I am <hi>Antemisca,</hi> your welbeloued daughter, although at this time I am abhorred, I am she who vniustly hath gone wandring, paying such debts as I neuer made, for that I did neuer let but to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lady I ought to be.

And I do thank my Gods, that they haue so much fauoured me, in giuing me his mightie &amp; strong arme, for to defend my truth, and for to punish that euill, the which that traytour <hi>Brandemoran,</hi> hath layde and raysed vpon me. The braue <hi>Palestina,</hi> who was present at the words which the Princes sayde, was so full of pryde and yre, that without any respect vnto the kings highnesse, he sayde: Oh false adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse, wherfore wilt thou deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> had thy virginitie, and that with thy consent. And what knight is he that is so hardie &amp; hath so much courage, to saye vnto the contrary.

Here would I know of thÃ©e, if that thou art content to referre all thy right and iustice into his handes. The prince <hi>Gelerosio</hi> somewhat heauy, aunswered the king and sayd, Unto the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Goddes and vnto him, I doe commit all my right although I had rather with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength of myne own armes make my defence: and tourning vnto the GrÃ©eke, he sayde. And for that gentle Knight, thou shalt be certified that thou defende the truth: Here I doe sweare vnto thÃ©e by the high &amp; mightie <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that the Prince of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> did neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which with great falsehood he is accused. Then <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoran</hi> dyd replye, and sayde. All that euer thou doest saye, I will suffer, for that I doe thinke before the Sunne hath made an ende of his accustomed course, to haue satisfaction. And likewise to punishe the pryde of this foole, who by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce or rather foolish hardienesse, commeth to seeke his owne death.</p>
               <p>This valiaunt and couragious GrÃ©eke coulde no longer suffer his proude and slaunderous speaches, but sayde vnto him: <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath power to giue the death vnto whome he pleaseth, and I doe thinke that which thou doest pretende vnto me, will fall vpon thy selfe, for to punish thÃ©e for this thy false and surmised treason which thou most dispightfully hast raysed, against this noble Princes, who is guiltlesse of this crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:255"/>And for that this muste be concluded by armes, and not by words, se that thou dost make no tarying, but arme thy selfe and come forth vnto the battaile, &amp; then thou shalt see how I will make thee to vnderstand in the field, that I am none of them of whome thou hast hetherto gotten honour. I will not make thee any aunswere sayde <hi>Brandemoran,</hi> for that I think very quickly to reuenge my selfe of thÃ©e, and to pluck out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tongue which hath bene so bolde to speake these words vnto me. And therwith he went straight out of the pallace, and went vnto his lodging for to arme himself vnto the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. The GrÃ©eke at his answere was somewhat yrefull, but retourning vnto the king he sayde, mightie king and Lorde, I doe desyre your highnesse that you would commaund, that your daughter may be set in a place, where as she may well sÃ©e the restoring of hir honour. The King sayde this shalbe done with a very good wil, without any tarying. The Greke dyd take his leaue of the King and of the Ladyes that were in the great hall. And went downe the stayres where as he left his page and his horse, and without the helpe of his stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, he leapt into the saddle, &amp; hauing his healme on, and his speare in his hand, he commaunded his page to tary, and not to go with him.

that valiant <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> You doo well remember, that for to succour his Horse, he leapt into his barke, &amp; was not so soone therein, but that it sailed and made such waye as the arrow which is forced out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bowe. And one of the two knights which entred the barke, leapt into the Sea for feare, and the other remained, and yeelded himselfe vnto the mercie of the Knight, which afterward did serue him for Squire, and very faithfully vsed his office, who was called <hi>Argolio. Rosicleer</hi> went trauailing to sea-wards, in his Barcke, very heauy and sorowfull, for that he was departed from his cosin so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In this sort they trauailed syxe dayes, &amp; the seuenth they discouered lande very far of, but the swiftnesse of the Barcke was such, that in a short time it brought them to the waters side. And being a land, he saw that it was an Iland, and very fragrant, for that towards the Occident, there appeared but little playne ground, and towards the Orient, a verye high &amp; sharpe Mountaine. So when the Barcke had fyxed it selfe a shore, he vnderstode, that there he must go a land, and taking his horse, with great lightnesse, he leapt into the saddle, and <hi>Argolio</hi> folowed him. And they trauailed into a narrow way which led them vp vnto that croked Mountaine, &amp; followed that way till they came to the height thereof, whereas they alighted for to refresh themselues, with that which the squire brought. And for that I haue great nÃ©ede of fauour &amp; helpe, to go forwardes with this historie, here I doe desire the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> to graunt it vnto me, that I may with more courage, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that which followeth in the other Chapter.</p>

And in saying these wordes, with great lightnesse this <hi>Troyan</hi> leapt in with <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and with his strong armes, he clasped him about the middle, and procured by casting him about to ouerthrow him, in such sort, that he had almost ouer throwne himselfe, but the Prince layde such holde with his hands, embrasing the <hi>Troyan,</hi> that betwixt them there began a terrible wrastling, eche one procuring by polisie to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the other. The <hi>Troyan</hi> dyd force himselfe by little &amp; little to cary <hi>Rosicleer</hi> towards the place whereas the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was, but <hi>Rosicleer</hi> perseuing it, dyd procure to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, vsing policies for to clere himselfe from that perill. But alwayes he found that the <hi>Troyans</hi> strength did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. And by reason that the mightie strength of <hi>Rosicleer</hi>
was such, the <hi>Troyan</hi> could not by his force make any resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but that he must nÃ©edes be caryed out of a compasse that was marked, of iust thirtie paces from the place where as the Serpent was.

somewhat discomforted. But yet he sawe that for to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes in his enterprise, it was requisite to ioyne battayle with that flying Serpent. And without resting himselfe, he strayte wayes toke a great and mightie speare, and with a valyant courage he went towards the place wheras the Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent was, who seing him comming, and that he was within the compasse, she put hir selfe on foote, and beating with hyr wynges, she gaue two wonderfull shrykes, and with greate lightnesse lyke a byrd, she came towards <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> puffing

This valiant and couragious knight when he sawe her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming he put the great end of his speare vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, and firming it fast with both his hands, the point forwards, he tarried her comming. This furious Serpent without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any account of the spere, with the great desire she had to lay hold on the knight, put her selfe forwards with great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, so that the speare chaunced into one of her great &amp; wide nosethrills, that almost it ranne vp into her braines, but if he had held the point of the Speare a little lower, he had giuen the most worthiest blow in all the world, but yet for all that it did not let to make a mortall wound. This furious serpent with the great fiercenesse she had she brake the speare, so that there remained in her head more then two spans thereof, and therewith she stroke at the knight with her nailes so terrible a blow, that she ouerthrew him, in such sort, that he tumbled on the ground. The beast who was troubled and astonied with that cruell wound, &amp; againe by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and furie she could not take anie holde of his armour, but passed forwards on, insomuch that the knight had time to arise and put himselfe on foote, and finding by him the tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon that remained of the speare, he turned and firmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therewith, procuring as he did at the first to receiue the blow, which he saw comming with great swiftnesse, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was so fauourable vnto him, that he chaunced with the tronchon of hir Speare vpon one of his strong hornes, and by reason that his speare was strong and ful of knots, it was fast vpon one of them, and by her great swiftnesse broke it cleane from her head, wherwith she remained with that great blow astonied and amazed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> terrible paine. The tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon of the Speare was driuen out of his hande, so that hÃ©e was costrained to laie hand on his sword, and to shrowde himselfe vnder his hard and stÃ©ele shÃ©eld, to make his defenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13973:258"/>
who was not without great care of his defence, did abide her comming, and stood stil, and the wounded Serpent sÃ©eing her selfe nigh vnto the Knight, with great beating of her wings arose vp in the aire, thinking thereby to gripe fast hold with her sharpe nayles, and to carry him into the aire, and from thence to let him fall downe to the ground to destroye him. The courage of this Knight was very much, and likewise his iudgement, for that this Serpent had not so soone began to beate with his wings when that he suspected in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der she would assault him, but he lifted vp the poynt of his sword on high, and likewise his strong shield, that she might thereof make her praye. This furious serpent assaulted him to take her holde in such sort, that the sharpe sword ran into her belly and guts, and so the heart: but if that wound had not chaunced in the same place, at that time the Knight had bene meruailous ill intreated, for that the serpent tooke her hold with her long clawes in the midst of his body in such sort, that by her great strength she made his bones to crack: but by reason of the sharpnesse of the sworde which opened the wound wide, and cloue her heart asunder, the Serpent fell downe dead to the ground, leauing the GrÃ©eke verye sore troubled and amazed. When the Knight sawe that she was dead, he gaue great thankes vnto God, for his aide and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour heerein. So straight waye he went to sÃ©e who was the Knight that was bound at the trÃ©e with the Snakes, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming nigh him, he knewe him to be the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> for the which he receiued great sorrow. There he remained a while thinking how he might vnloose him and set him at libertie, and comming vnto the serpents, with his <hi>Herculine</hi> hand, he layde holde on the necke of them that were at his fÃ©ete, in such sort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him to loose his strength, &amp; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the vse of his cruell office, leauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others fÃ©ete &amp; win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about his arme, that he was constrained to procure to clÃ©ere himselfe: but all was in vaine, for that it was so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fastened about him, that of necessitie he must vnloose it as he would vndoo a company of knots, and the more he vndid,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13973:258"/>
the more it wounde about with such wreathings from one place vnto another, that it was very straunge, that if it had not bene by the great strength he vsed in quÃ©esing of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he could neuer haue clÃ©ered himselfe thereof, but in the ende it fell downe dead to the ground. Then he laide holde of the other, hauing no lesse trouble with it, then he had with the first, and slew it lykewise, so that the fÃ©et of this tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Barbarian</hi> were at libertie of his greate paine, who gaue meruaylous and grÃ©euous shrikes.

In this space hÃ©e had time for to laye holde with his lefte hande vppon the other Serpent, and in the same sorte as with the other hÃ©e did kill her, wherewith the Pagan fell downe to the ground without anie remembraunce.</p>

This Greeke did procure to couer his naked bodie with certaine leaues which he cut from the trees, lamentablie beholding his leane face, which didde well shew the great sorrowe &amp; paine that he had receiued. At this time the GrÃ©eke Princes Squire came whereas they were, forasmuch as the inchauntment was ended by the death of the last serpent, and pulling from his backe the cloake which he ware, he put it on the Pagan, therewith the better to couer himselfe. Also the valiaunt <hi>Troyan</hi> was come againe vnto himselfe, and cast his eies towardes the place whereas the Prince was hanged, to sÃ©e if he were stil in the same torment, who when he sawe him not, hÃ©e looked whether he was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len downe to the ground, supposing that he had ended his life with that torment, but when he saw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furious monster dead, and how the GrÃ©eke was contemplating himselfe vppon the Pagan, then with great ioy he went towards them, but much more pleasure he receiued when he knew him to be the sonne of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> neuerthelesse all his mirth was mittigated whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he sawe the deadly force of this Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> and seeing him in that plight, he could not but lament his heauie &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell fortune. The GrÃ©eke did comfort him, praying him to leaue off his sorrowfull lamentation, giuing him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that he was not dead: <hi>Orgalio</hi> tooke his masters helme and ranne vnto the water side which was there at hand, and brought it ful of water, &amp; when he came vnto them, he threw thereof vpon the Pagans face, and being therewith refreshed he came somewhat vnto himselfe, &amp; opening his eies he sawe there his friend <hi>Oristedes,</hi> &amp; looking about he beheld another knight, who he likewise knew to be <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> &amp; straight way he vnderstood y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was the occasion of his libertie, &amp; with a grÃ©euous grone he sayd: O renowmed sonne of the worthie <hi>Trebatio,</hi> how God doth in all things exalt thy fame, &amp; now sÃ©eing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast succoured me in this torment, likewise I beseech thÃ©e aide and succour me in one other thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may receiue my full delight, which is, that my louing spouse may likewise be set at libertie, who is captiue in this Ilande.

The Greke aunswerid: worthy Prince, my power &amp; strength is ready at your commaundement, &amp; I will imploy all my force and polefie in your seruice, or lose my life in it. Therfore let vs procure to depart from hence, &amp; giue me to vnderstand the occasion of all this your sorow and torment: and when that my strong arme cannot satisfie your will, my lyfe shall remaine in recompence of my large promis. So straight way they put the Pagan vpon the Squires Horse, &amp; couered him with the same cloake, that first he had, and toke the Squyre behind him for to holde him vp, for that he was so leane, that he could not kÃ©epe himselfe vp-right in the saddle. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they retourned, &amp; toke the way wherin <hi>Rosicleer</hi> came, &amp; following an other path vnder the hills side which brought them vnto a faire Castell. And in trauailing by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> dyd demaund of <hi>Oristedes</hi> the cause and increasing of all his sorow, to whome he began to tell as followeth.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand, worthy Prince, that this Iland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto a very great and monstrous Gyant, whom the Prince slew, for to set at libertie certaine Ladies, the which he caryed captiue. So a sonne of this Gyant many dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, dyd procure to be reuenged of the death of his father, and followed it so hard, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende he founde such occasion, that he met w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prince, hauing no other defence but his sword, without any armour, for that he was sportinge himselfe at the sea side, and in his company was I, &amp; a few other knights, the Gyant with them that were with him, assalted vs with so great power and strength, that in spight of all that euer we could doe to make our defence, they brought vs vnto this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainde, wherein we were a great time prisoners.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13973:260"/>
a great and mightie broad plaine, and in it there was a fayre castel, wrought with verie many towers, whose battlements were of so great fairenesse, that with the Sun they shewed a very faire sight, on the one side the maine sea did beate on it, whose waters striking vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rockes did make a meruailous noise, which was caused by that hastie &amp; furious wind <hi>Bori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and on that side whereas the Prince was, it was all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed about with a verie broade &amp; dÃ©epe ditch or moate, and had in it but one entering, and that was verie narrow. The sight of that Castell did giue great contentment vnto them which beheld it, by reason it was so faire, and being so early in the morning, the windowes were not open. The GrÃ©eke being all alone musing to himselfe, vppon a sodaine he heard ouer the gate of the Castle a window to be open, wherat loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out a Gyant of so great height as he had not sÃ©ene the lyke, he was in this shirt, and couered with a night gowne of black veluet, and sÃ©eing <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> he knew by his deuice that he was none of them of the castle, and when he saw and was certified that he was none of his knightes, he said: Knight, what doest thou sÃ©eke in this countrie, for as it doth appeare by thy straunge demeanour, thou shouldest be a stranger. To whom the Greeke aunswered and sayd: Thou saiest truth Gyant I am a straunger, for I neuer dwelt in it, but my fortune hath brought mÃ©e hether, bÃ©eing driuen by the great furie and tempests of the sea, and bÃ©eing a shoare I found in it a verie straunge aduenture, which hath giuen me occasion to come and speake with thÃ©e, if it bÃ©e thy pleasure to heare mÃ©e, eyther within the Castle or without it. At such time as this valyaunt <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was saying these wordes, hÃ©e had a sight of his face, his healme bÃ©eing vp, whereat might be sÃ©ene his faire face, on whom the Gyant did very much behold, and answered.</p>
               <p>If thou doest sÃ©eke mÃ©e I will heare thÃ©e in what sorte thou wilt, but if thou dost aske for the King my father, thou shalt vnderstand that he is not in the Iland, but is a broad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout businesse, forced of necessitie touching his kingdome.
<pb facs="tcp:13973:261"/>
I would haue bene very glad, sayd <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> to haue founde the king thy Father, for that I doe vnderstand, that it should be he, who dyd assalt and take the Prince of the <hi>Scitas,</hi> &amp; the worthy <hi>Troyan.</hi> And I am come to giue him to vnderstand, how he should entertaine and intreate, such knights as they are, and not with so great pryde to put them vnto such sorow and paine, &amp; kepe the princes in prison, vsing them as though they were his vassailes, who had done some cruel &amp; haynous offence against his owne person, or as rebells against theyr naturall Lorde and Prince, but he hath bene the bolder, for that he doth knowe they are a great waye from their owne countries. And I doe much maruaile, that such a person as thou art, wilt consent to the doing of such crueltie, for that it doth apeare, thou art sufficiently furnished with stature and strength. And thou semest vnto me, to be a very good knight, which doth bynde thÃ©e to acknowledge great modestie, &amp; not to minister or consent vnto such crueltie. But I doe sÃ©e that thou art voide of all, and that thou hast no knowledge of the goodnesse whereunto thou art bound. Therefore if thou doest maintaine that which thy Father doth vpholde and sustaine in this Castell and Iland, is not euill: I will make thÃ©e to say the contrary, both of vs being to gether, therefore chuse whether thou wilt graunt me frÃ©e entry into the Castell, or whether thou wilt come forth where as I am. The Gyant dyd not show anye kinde of alteration in his countenance, neither did he aunswere with any proude wordes, but rather mittigating his yre, he sayde. Doe not beleue knight, that I am so blynde and so voyd of knowledge, that I doe not know what is good and what is euill. Neither will I consent that thou shalt speake euill of that which my father hath done, but rather I tell thÃ©e, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I will venter my person in his defence: therefore I bid thÃ©e to abyde, &amp; thou shalt sÃ©e how I am not afrayde of the perill, for it shalbe more death vnto me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne aliue, with my honour blemished, then to dye in his quarell and defence. And I will commaund that the gates of the Castel shalbe open, and I do warrant that so long as our battaile shall indure, thou shalt not receue any harme. And if
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13973:261"/>
it be so that fortune doth runne on thy side, then can I not assure the any farther, for that I haue a brother, who is not so great a friend vnto courtesie as I am. Cause the gates to be open, sayde <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> help of God I wil make my part good w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all.

And therewith he withdrew him selfe from the window, &amp; called for his apparaile, &amp; lykewise for his armour. His brother when he heard him speake with so great alterasion, he looked out at the same wyndow, for to sÃ©e who he was that gaue the occasion.

I am he, sayde <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> who doe pretend to reuenge the wrong and force done vnto the Prince <hi>Meridian.</hi> O vile coward, sayde the Gyant, what diuel hath made thÃ©e so hardy to make an enterprise, that <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe durst not giue the like attempt. Oh ye Gods, how doe you consent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one poore knight should haue so much boldnesse, to put himselfe before me, with such a demaund. It grieued <hi>Rosicleer</hi> very much, to see himself to intreated, of a proude Giant, &amp; aunswering him he sayde. In truth I haue defyed thy brother, who semeth to haue more discresion then thou hast. And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same demaund I doe defie thÃ©e to mortall battaile. In the which I think to make thÃ©e know, the vylenesse of thy reasons, &amp; the basenesse vsed in thy wordes. And take from that huge membred body, thy head, with the force of this my stronge arme. At which wordes the Gyant who first apeared, and was putting on his armour, sayde vnto his brother: This knight of his owne vertue and bountie doth come to be slayne, or els procure ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the Princes, and he semeth to haue souerayne har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse and strength, and there is no reason, to shew thy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in speaking so proudly &amp; vnsemely words, but with the fury of thy vntamed arme. And if the Gods doe graunt vnto him to haue the victory ouer me, there shal remayne time for thÃ©e to showe thy valoure. And there with he made him to

withdrawe himselfe from the windowe, leauing <hi>Rosicleer</hi> verie well satisfied with his courtesie. So within a lyttle while after he heard them opening the gates of the Castle, &amp; letting downe the draw bridge. Then the couragious GrÃ©eke tooke the bridge and put himself within the castel into a very faire &amp; large court, all adorned round about with rich win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and on the one side a verie faire Orchard, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with verie sweete &amp; odoriferous flowers, &amp; all manner of sweete hearbs, in the which were many that were drossing those trÃ©es and hearbes, &amp; putting them in order, some were occupyed in making of fine hedges and arbours, &amp; others in husbanding the trees and cutting of them, others in digging of the ground, &amp; others in setting of hearbes, who when they sawe <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> they all stayed from their worke, &amp; imputed that knight to be verie vnwise to giue that enterprise, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them was the Gyant who last of all spake vnto <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi>
at the window, with a mightie great club in his hand, and for the defence of his bodie a simple harnesse, who sayde vnto <hi>Rosicleer</hi>: Come in, come in, thou hardie foole, for that thou shalt receiue the paiment of thy vndiscrÃ©et &amp; foolish bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The Prince without making anie aunswere went on forwards, &amp; entering in at the other gate, he came into a very faire and paued Court, the which was compassed about with three faire galleries one aboue another, the Prince receiued great delight to sÃ©e the excellent worke of them. So not long after there descended downe a paire of staires the first giant, armed with strong armour, his shÃ©elde on his arme, and a great broad cutting sword in his hand, who without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anie word assaulted him with mortall battaile. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie GrÃ©eke was in a readinesse for to make his defence with his sword in his hand. The Gyant stroke at him a terrible blow right down, but the GrÃ©eke with a light leap made him to misse his blow, and his swoord fell downe vpon the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in such sort, that it made a great number of sparkes of fire to flie out, as soone as the blowe was passed, the Greeke stroke him vpon the arme, which blow was not verie great, for that he could not verie well reach him vnto his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:13973:262"/>
yet for all that it did not let to cut his armour, flesh and all vnto the hard bone, and although the Gyant did feele the wound somewhat greeuous, yet did he procure to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the feeling of the paine and griefe, and with the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he had to feele himselfe hurt, he threwe his sheelde from him to the ground, and tooke his greate sworde fast in both his handes, and returned thinking to haue stroke the GrÃ©eke with double force more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> before, but he did procure to clÃ©ere himselfe as he did at the first, striking a blow at the Gyant, thinking to haue stroke him againe on his armes, but hee could not reach him, but it lighted vpon the Gyants sword, and the blowe was such, that the force of the steelie blade was not sufficient to make resistaunce, but that the swoorde of the GrÃ©eke did enter in and made a great gappe, but the Gyauntes third blowe was such, that without resistaunce it chaunced vppon the Greekes shÃ©elde, and all that euer it hit it carryed to the grounde, and parte of it lyghted on his healme, in such sort that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was constrained to stoope with his knÃ©es to the grounde, but with greate lyghtnesse he arose vp againe, and bÃ©eing verie wrathfull that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued such a blowe, hÃ©e let loose his shÃ©elde, and stepped to the Gyaunt with his sworde in both his handes, and stroke him vpon his left shoulder, and the blowe glaunced, but if it had chaunced to haue stroke him full, at that blowe hee had made an ende of the battaile, but for all that hÃ©e remayned verie sore hurt, and his swoorde fell to the grounde, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manye sparkes of fire. The Gyaunt was verye much amazed at the power and strength of his enimie, but not in such sorte, that it shoulde cause in him anie weaknesse, but rather with a newe courage hÃ©e retourned vnto his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne battaile, with so greate courage as though he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued no hurt at all, at that time both of them stroke the one at the other with great strength &amp; power, although the Gyaunt was verie much disturbed by reason of his wounds, but yet for all that he shewed greate prowesse. This battayle and contencion betwÃ©ene them continued more then two long houres, in which time there went from his
<pb facs="tcp:13973:263"/>
wounds great aboundance of bloud, so in the ende, whether with werinesse of the long contempt, or with the losse of so much bloud, the Gyaunt could not kÃ©epe himself on foote, but fell downe vnto the ground, as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were dead. The prince who had thought he had bene dead, did not receue much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, for that he was a reasonable Gyant, and of much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and courtesie. But yet in great hast he went to pul of his helme, and then he hard that out of the Castel they began to crye out and sayde, holde thy hande euill knight, and doe not make an ende to kill our naturall Lord, for in doing it thou shalt dye the death. And loking about him to sÃ©e who it was that spake vnto him those threatning wordes, he saw desen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe at a broade payre of stayres to the number of fiftene knights, who with a great rushing and noyse, being all very well armed, and semed to be very good knights, for that they were of a good disposition. And as he saw them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming, with a furious courage, he encountred them and sayde. The name which you haue giuen me, I will make that hereafter you shall vse it no more, or els I will lose my lyfe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he put himselfe amongst them, with so great furye, as the cruell and hongery Wolfe doeth amongst a company of simple sheepe, and stroke the first with so great strength, that with the fury of his arme, he cloue his head a sunder in the middest, but yet he could not let but receue great hurt of his person, for that he was assalted by them, who desired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the death of theyr Lorde. The other Gyant cryed out against them, reuiling them with maruailous foule words, for that one alone knight should so long endure aliue in their handes. But this miserable people did not know with whom they made this contension, for if they had knowne &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode who was before them, they would not haue hilde this battaile, for they did not know how they had to do with the sonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> against whome the Diamant Rockes doe seme weake, as it apeared by the great strength he had in wounding of them. For some he slew out right, and some were very sore hurt, but notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ding of those which did remaine, he was assalted very desperately, but this Greke
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13973:263"/>
sÃ©eing still their contention, his courage the more increased, and tooke his sword in both his hands, &amp; stroke one of them so terrible a blow vpon the shoulder, that his sworde passed downe vnto his wast: so there remained but fiue of them, who altogether did strike at him such fiue blowes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it made him to stoope with both his knÃ©es to the ground, the which the Prince did feele verye much, neuerthelesse with greate strength he arose vp againe, in spite of all them that stroke him, and it was vnto their harme, for that he was not so soone vp, when he stroke him that was next hand so terrible a blow vpon his helme, that he cut him downe vnto the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke in two pÃ©eces, and casting about his sword ouer his head, he stroke another on the necke, that he made his heade flye from his shoulders, to the ground, the other thrÃ©e which remained, sÃ©eing the great slaughter that was made on their companions, and likewise themselues to be hurt and werye, they procured to runne away vp the staires, and they think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to flye from their death, fell into the like daunger, and rather worse, for that at the head of the staires, they met with the other Giant who was descending downe, giuing terrible shrikes, and meeting them with his mightie cutting sworde, he cut them all to pÃ©eces saying. Take the payment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such cowardes doo deserue. So leauing them dead, he descended downe the staires, and found this strong <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> leaning with his breast vpon the pomell of his sword, easing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe somwhat of the great trauaile passed, but it indured with him but a small time, for that the Gyant lift vp his broade and mightie sword, and went toward him to strike him, but the Prince stoode still tarrying his comming, and was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaile more by pollicie then by strength, fearing that the wearinesse which he had receiued should bÃ©e the occasion that his force should faile him and his courage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, if that peraduenture he should haue to doe with more then he had at that present before him. So when the Gyant came whereas the Prince was, he discharged his mightie stroke for to wound the GrÃ©eke, but he with a light leap clÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe from the furie of that blowe, and closing with
<pb facs="tcp:13973:264"/>
him in great hast, he stroke him vpon one of his legs, that his harnesse deceiued him, and he wounded him vnto the bone, but for all that the giant did not leaue to lay vpon him very thicke blowes, as one that was very expert in that exercise. It was great delight to sÃ©e how the GrÃ©eke did clÃ©ere himself with great lightnesse from his blowes without fÃ©eling anie wearinesse. The Gyaunt with the greate furie that he had, made great hast in striking at the Prince, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that he waxed wearie, and was verie sore vexed and troubled, and when the GrÃ©eke perceiued his faint and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled stomacke, he entred in &amp; out with him with great light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, procuring for to hurt the Gyant, and did it with greate ease, although the Gyant did not let likewise with great has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> to strike mightie and terrible blowes at him. This Prince procured still to sÃ©e if he could finde time, that alonely with one blow he might make an end of the battaile without any perill to himselfe, notwithstanding he did not let to wounde him where he might, in many places the Gyant was all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with bloud which issued out of the woundes hÃ©e had, and although they were not greate, yet they were trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. This battaile indured a long time, for which cause, and the greate losse of bloud, this Gyaunt beganne to waxe feeble and weake. When the GrÃ©eke perceiued this, and sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he did not make his assault with so great hast as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and although he was wearie with striking so manye blowes, which brought him almost to an ende, yet nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with great hast he stroke the Gyant many and terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes, then the Gyant sÃ©eing himselfe so ill intreated, and knowing his end to be at hand, he cryed out making a great noise, which range through the aire, blaspheming against his Gods, and called all his Pages and household seruaunts, and sayd: O you lost creatures why doe you not come and helpe me? At whose noise and calling there came together aboue thirtie seruaunts, some with clubbes and staues, and some with stones, and compassed him rounde about, throwing stones at him so thicke, that hÃ©e coulde not approch vnto them, for they durst not come nigh vnto him, the stones ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

The Greeke went towards them for to hurt them, but they ran in at the doores to saue themselues, as commonly they who doth baite a Bull with dartes in a trenched place, after they haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, they hide themselues in corners to saue them from the furie of his hornes, and tourning himselfe they straight waye torment him behinde: in this sorte did his seruaunts intreate this GrÃ©eke, till such time that hÃ©e was constrained by his ire to goe agaynst them, shaking off his sworde, then as before they ranne awaie. So the GrÃ©eke returned where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Gyaunt was, who was so wearie, that hÃ©e could not remoue out of the place where hÃ©e had lefte him, who clÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himselfe from one terrible blowe which the furyous Gyant stroke at him, presently retourned the lyke blowe, which lighted vpon his left shoulder, that hÃ©e opened the hard harnesse and the flesh vnto the bone. This blowe was not so soone giuen him, when that with great hast he stroke him with both his handes on his breast, and by reason that hÃ©e was weake and wearie, hÃ©e nÃ©eded not much strength to ouerthrowe him to the ground, who receiued on his backe a terrible fall. The GrÃ©eke lykewise with the great strength that hÃ©e put to ouerthrowe him, fell to the grounde, but it fell out better with him then hÃ©e thought, for that falling, he rowled a good waye from the place whereas the Gyant fell, and straight waie with a trice hÃ©e arose vp againe, and found himselfe all to be compassed againe with the seruants, who battered at him with staues and stones, as many times a wall is battered with Artillerie. Some of them woulde haue runne and embrased themselues with him, thinking that he had not beene so nimble as he was, but when they sawe him on foote, they retyred backe againe with greate feare. At this time the Gyaunt beganne to arise, although it was
<pb facs="tcp:13973:265"/>
with great trouble, but the GrÃ©eke who was verie angrie to see himselfe so intreated with boies and seruants, with a trice he was with the Gyant, and before that he could put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on foote, he stroke him so terrible a blow with both his hands vpon the head, that he cut it in two pÃ©eces, and he fell dead to the ground. These seruantes when they sawe that their Lord was slaine, they all ranne awaie making a great noise. This worthie Greeke when he saw that the fierce gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was dead, and that he was cleere from that conflict, hee went towards that place whereas he left the first Gyant, &amp; when he came vnto him he pulled off his healme, at which time he heard one which from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

At that time the Gyant was somewhat come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for by reason that the aire had catched him, he had some remembraunce, of the which the Prince was verie gladde, and turning vnto the Ladie he sayd.

So they entred into a faire large hal, which led them into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, whereas was an old giantesse of a maruailous good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, who made great lamentation, for that it was tolde her of all that had passed in the Castle, who had in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany more then thirtie Ladyes and Gentlewomen, which did comfort her: to whom the sister of the Giant sayd, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this Knight, to whom the Gods hath giuen so much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, doth demaund the Princesse of the <hi>Scitas</hi> our prisoner, for whose cause, all this harme and euill happened vnto vs. This Lady with a grieuous sigh beholding the Prince said. O cruell murderer of my welbeloued sonnes, and faithfull seruaunts: make an ende to execute thy crueltie, showing
<pb facs="tcp:13973:266"/>
the same and like vpon this vnfortunate QuÃ©ene; whose po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer hath profited her very little. This good GrÃ©eke bÃ©eing tender harted, when he heard so great lamentation he sayde: QuÃ©ene, doe not meruaile, for those which doo offend God, doo hope of no other thing, but punishment for their sinnes, &amp; so those that liue with pride, cannot let but to be payed with the like. I doo desire thÃ©e to commaund the Princesse to bÃ©e giuen vnto me, whom thou hast in prison, for that she doth not deserue to be intreated amongest you as a prisoner, but as a Lady. The QuÃ©ene without giuing him any aunswer, threw vnto him two keyes which she had tied at her girdle, and afterward sayd vnto him: Under these thou shalt finde that which thou seekest, and enioye the glory which thou hast got by this occasion, til such time as he doth come, who with his mightie arme, will reuenge the great wrong, which thy good fortune hath brought to passe. The GrÃ©ek tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keies, and being led by that Gentlewoman (who wold neuer leaue him) they went out of that parler, and went vp a payre of staires, which brought them vnto another hall of no lesse bignesse then the first, and with the keye she opened a doore, and sayd: Enter O Knight, which hast as much crueltie as prowesse and strength, and there thou shalt finde her whome thou sÃ©ekest. Faire Gentlewoman sayd <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> I doo not determine to enter, but that your highnesse shall goe before. This Princesse giuing a grieuous sigh entered in first, and brought him into a faire chamber, and then opened another doore, wherin they entred into another hall, very well garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with many and faire windowes, which was towardes the Sea: at one of the which, there sate the Princesse, who was combing of her faire haire, and with her there was a Damsell, the which helde the glasse in her hands before her. When <hi>Rosicleer</hi> saw her, he receiued great pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght, and for that the Princesse shoulde knowe him, he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off his healme, and straight waye she knewe him, and with great alteration she arose vp against him, and sayde. Oh GrÃ©eke Prince, the flower of all Knighthoode in the

worlde, hath Fortune so much fauoured me, that all my griefes and sorrowes be finished, and likewise those of the prince my spouse, to whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince aunswered with great reioycing and sayd. Most mightie Princesse, God of his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

So <hi>Rosicleer</hi> and the Princesses went out of that chamber, &amp; the faire Giantesse folowed them, the Princesse had great desire to sÃ©e <hi>Meridian,</hi> but it was not long after, that in the case as before was told you he came.

               <p>The GrÃ©eke Prince with amorous words and swÃ©ete perswasions, caused the QuÃ©ene and her Daughter to sit downe at the Table to eate, bÃ©eing somewhat comforted, for that they knewe howe that <hi>Brandafidel</hi> was without daunger of death, for that of them and of all the rest that were in the Castle, he was verye well beloued for his great vertue.</p>

Thou wert (sayd <hi>Rosicleer</hi>) but now for thy great pride and foolish hardinesse thou hast lost it, and it is now in my power: Where be my sonnes that kept it, sayd the Gyant, what is become of them? The Grake sayd, one of them is slaine by the strength of my arme, &amp; the other yeelded, fulfilling that which he doth owe vnto the order of knighthoode, as it becommeth a good knight. Oh immortall Gods, sayd the king, is it possible to be true that I doe beare, that so vile a wretch as thou art should be the occasion of so much harme? O thou traitor and false knight, command the gates to be opened, for that thy great strength shall little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile thee, if they be opened vnto mee. And if thou doest not command them to be open, I will so vse the matter, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the deapth of the meate, nor towers of the castell, shal be able to make anie resistance against me for thy defence. And with the great madnesse which he had, he drew out his great and broad cutting sword, and with both his hands be stroke at the gate, as though he woulde cut it in peeces, but all his labour was in vaine, for that the gates were verie strong, and therewith the Prince <hi>Rosicleer</hi> determined to descende downe into the Court, and commaunded the <hi>Troyan</hi> that in the meane time that the battaile endured, that he should haue great care of the keeping of the gate, and tooke his healme of <hi>Argolio</hi> and laced it on, and also a strong and well stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sheeld, and when he came vnto the gate, he saw that the king was a foote, &amp; beating at the gate with all his strength, to whom the Prince sayd.</p>

the Gyaunt when he sawe it, with an earnest furye hÃ©e thrust himselfe in thereat.

To make battaile with thÃ©e sayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, therfore if thou wilt enter into the battaile, thou must come in alone. I am verye well content sayd the King, the which he spake with a great deale more meekenesse, than his greate pride did giue him license, or could suffer, and all to see him within the castle: for that he was perswaded with himselfe, that if he were once within, there were not in all the world one Knight that could ouercome him, neither make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistaunce against his power. So <hi>Rosicleer</hi> commaunded that the gate might be open, whereat the Giaunt entred, and also his great Elephant. When the King was entred, the <hi>Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> had great care and diligence to shut the gate again, whom when the King knew, the more was his griefe: but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great anger that he had, he made no stay, till such time as he came into the great Court, and there he mounted vppon his furious and great beast, and <hi>Argolio</hi> brought vnto his Lord his horse, and without profiting himselfe of the stirrop, he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the saddle.

Then the king said, what a diuell should this be that hath caused so great alteration in our horses, hath hÃ©ere passed by anie fiend, or doth there any diuell remaine lodged amongest these bushes, well let it bÃ©e what it shall be, for with the fauour of God, if I dooe mÃ©ete him I will giue him his paiment, for scarring of our horses,

And if you doo denie me this, verye quickly you shall see your welbeloued Ladye without life: but I doo beleeue you wil not denie me this thing, the which I doo so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and in whom doth consist so much vertue, and therwith shedding a few teares from her eyes, she helde her peace. The Duke beeing halfe amased, aunswered and sayde: Oh my loue and sweete Mistresse, wherfore haue you any doubt that I wil not fulfill &amp; accomplish your desire in all things, therefore out of hand put all things in order, that your will is to haue done: for what more benefite and contentment can I receiue, then to enioye you continually, in such sorte, that neither of vs may depart the one from the other: and if it so fall out, that Fortune will be so contrary against vs,

Great ioye and pleasure these two louers receiued, when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in such a place whereas they might take their ease, &amp; enioye their loues. The Duke delighted in no other thing, but to goe a hunting with his Squires and Pages, leauing his sweete <hi>Damelis,</hi> accompanied with her damosells in that strong house, aduising them alwayes not to open the gates, except they should aunswere vnto a watch word, and many times for her contentment<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
                     <hi>Damelis</hi> would goe and mÃ©ete with the Duke at the gates. So in this order they liued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether foure yeares: but in the ende, Time who neuer rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in one degrÃ©e, did take from them their rest, giuing them double trauaile and sorrow. For that when the King her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found her missing, the sorrow and griefe was so much that he receiued, that he kept his chamber a long time, and would not come foorth of it, and if it had not bene for speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all businesse, necessarie for his kingdome, he wold (as I say) neuer haue come forth: and although he was occupied very much therein, yet could he not forget his great griefe, calling many times vpon his welbeloued daughter. All this foure yeares he passed the time in great heauinesse, which euerie day increased more his sorrow and griefe. Of all which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, a great Magitian whose name was <hi>Demofronte,</hi> by his learning came to the knowledge off, and strayght waye by his science he made a chariot to be brought, that was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by two flying Dragons, and put himselfe therein, who in a very short space, was carryed whereas this sorrowfull King dwelt, and he chaunced to come at such time as he was alone in his chamber with his accustomed sorrowe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the losse of his Daughter: and without bÃ©eing sÃ©ene of any person, he entred whereas this afflicted King was, and sayd.</q>

This Magitian called at the gate, and gaue the watch word that the Duke was accustomed to giue, and when <hi>Damelis</hi> heard it, she her selfe went vnto the gate and did open it: and when she went to imbrace him, thinking it to be her louer, she sawe that it was her father, &amp; with a sodayne alteration she gaue a great shrike and retourned and put her selfe within the house. The King her father somewhat angry did folow her saying, It doth little auaile thÃ©e <hi>Damelis</hi> to run away, for that thou shalt dye in my power, paying me with thy death, the greate dishonour which my royall crowne hath receiued. So he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>followed her till he came vnto the chamber whereas her da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosells were, amongst whome this fearefull Lady did hide her selfe, who sÃ©eing her to enter in that sort, they arose to sÃ©e what was the occasion of so great chaunge and trouble. <hi>Floria,</hi> straight way did know the King, who had a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenaunce, &amp; she fearing the harme which shuld hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto her Lady put her selfe ouer her &amp; gaue terrible and loud shrikes. The King as one kindeled in great wrath forgetting that which hÃ©e had promised vnto the Magitian, laide hande on his sword, saying: It doth not profite thee <hi>Damelis</hi> to flie from the death, for thy desert is such, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou

Then <hi>Damelis</hi> answered and sayd: Ah my Lord and father, will you be now as cruell vnto me, as you were wont to be pittifull, appease your wrath, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe your vnmercifull sword, and harken vnto this which I will saie, in discharging my selfe in that you charge mÃ©e with all: You shall vnderstand my Lord and father, that I was ouercome and constrained by loue for to loue, forgetting thy fatherly loue, and my duetie, yet for all that hauing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to accomplish the same, it was not vnto your dishonour, for that therwith I doe liue honourablie with my husband. Then the king sayd, oh false traitor and without faith, holde thy peace, what reason hast thou to make this excuse, hauing committed so great an errour. And in saying this he lifte vp his sword for to strike her, the foure damsells y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there, with terrible shrikes they threw themselues vpon that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie <hi>Damelis,</hi> offring their bodies vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furie of that cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The king who sawe them in this sort make her defence, with his left hand he pulled them off from her, some by the haire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, and some by the shoulders, for to make waie that hee might execute his determined purpose, and none to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie resistaunce against him. <hi>Floria</hi> when she sawe the King determined to kil his daughter, like vnto a Lionesse she hung about his necke and sayd: Oh mad dogge, what determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this that thou doest bring for to do euill vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most chast and loyall Ladie in all the world, is it a new thing for loue to vse such like dÃ©edes: vnto thy selfe may be attributed the occasion of all this euill, and thou art in the fault thereof, for that thou wert so malitious and so full of mischiefe, that she durst not giue thee to vnderstand of her sodaine loue. The words and teares of <hi>Floria</hi> did little profit with the king, but rather like a wilde Boare in the wildernesse, bÃ©eing compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a companie of dogges doth shake himselfe: euen so the king did shake his members, and threw <hi>Floria</hi> from him, and with double wrath he did procure to execute his furie, out the damsells with terrible shrikes, sometimes one and

sometimes another did disturbe him, till such time as with his cruell hande betwÃ©ene the Damosells, he thrust in the poynt of his sharpe sword, and with the force of his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arme he thrust it, till it passed through her breast, &amp; came forth at her backe. (The wise <hi>Democrites</hi> when that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the greatest contentment in his heart, would weepe to thinke vpon the great vnquietnesse and discontentment that should followe: euen so this vnhappie <hi>Damelis,</hi> when shÃ©e was most at quiet and delight with her prosperous life, then fortune did turne it vnto her sodaine death.) At this time the Magitian came into the chamber, and when he saw the king contrary vnto that which he promised him, had done y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full act, he began to blaspheme against himselfe, for that hÃ©e had bene the occasion of all that euill, and with an yrefull voyce he sayd.

And in saying these words he drew a booke out of his bosome, and reading on it, hee made a great cloud to appeare in the skyes very black, which was brought by terrible and hastie windes, the which came with a very great tempest and storme: and when the skies waxed clÃ©ere, then was there sÃ©ene hÃ©ere this fortresse, where in this cruell King of <hi>Arabia</hi> is inchanted, and this sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Velegrato</hi> and his Damsells: and he that is desirous to sÃ©e how and in what sort, let him blowe this horne, and straight waye the gates shall be open, but heere I doo aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise him, that the going out will be doubtfull.</q>

procÃ©eded two mightie great and huge hornes verye sharpe. Her spÃ©ech was very perfect and cleere, and made aunswere in any language that was spoken vnto her. She would make battaile with none, but it should procÃ©ede of questions and aunsweres, and as <hi>Galtenor</hi> doth affirme and say, that the inchaunted <hi>Merlin</hi> was shut vp in that beast. This furious beast when she saw that the Prince went towards that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dore she put her selfe before him, and disturbed his going: this couragious Knight shrowded vnder his shield, did abide her comming. Then the beast sayd. Stay thy selfe and stand still <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and doo not trouble thy selfe so much, for a thing, that for all the dominions and Empires of thy father thou woldest not haue begun, neither haue giuen the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.

Thus in fewe words, I haue told thee of thy descent, and from whence thou dost proceede if thou wilt vnderstand it: and more I doo say vnto thee, that thou art not worthie to accompt thy selfe of such a linage, for that they be Christians, and thou art a Pagan, therefore aske me no more, for I haue tolde thÃ©e i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And now sÃ©eing I haue accomplished thy will and desire, haue a respect what thou wilt doo with thine own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for if thou wilt retourne without making any battaile with me, thou must of two things choose to doo one of them, which is to returne backe againe that waye which thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest, or els to declare vnto me the resolution of a question, which I will demaund of thÃ©e.

And in saying these words hee imbraced his shÃ©eld, and firming his sword in his hande, hee began his terrible and timerous battaile. The furious beast hissing like vnto a Snake, did withdrawe himselfe somwhat backwards, and with great violence did stretch out her long necke, and bearing her head somewhat lowe, she pretended with her hornes to make her encounter, the Prince stood still till that the beast drew somewhat nigher him, and wold not at that time abide the furiousnesse of the blowe, but rather clÃ©ering himselfe from it by stepping on the one side, with a light leape towards the left hand, and passing this furious beast by missing her blowe, he stroke an ouerthwart blow at her with so great furie and force, which lighted vpon the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of her taile (that although she carried it verie low for her most aduauntage, for that therewith she did most offend and defend) yet for all that the Princes fortune was such, that the blow chanced betwÃ©ene two scales, &amp; with a trice it was cut a sunder in the middest: Oh how furious and outragy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was this deformed beast when she felt her selfe so sore wounded, and turning her selfe as the wind against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince before he could make his defence, that needs he must receiue vpon his strong armour a blowe with those long and sharpe hornes, the blowe was giuen him with so great force, that it ouerthrew him to the ground, and seeing him in this sorte, with a diuellish rage and ire she ranne towards him procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to claspe him betwixt her sharpe clawes, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her great furie and rage, she had not so much time, but passed by and could not fasten anie hold on him.

was meruailously troubled at that mightie blowe which hÃ©e receiued, the beast with double furie returned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight to strike him as shee did before, the GrÃ©eke did abide his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, with his swoord verie firme in his hande, and at such time as the beast would strike her blowe, bearing her head verie lowe. The Prince at that present was not idle, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his mightie blow with great strength, and stroke the beast betwixt both the horns, but by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse his sworde could not enter, yet he made her to decline her head to the ground spite of her teeth. This furious beast seeing that she had missed her blowe, iourned that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of her taile and stroke him in the middest of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a terrible blow, in such sorte that if she had had the rest, she had parted him a sunder with the furiousnesse thereof, but for all that it made him fall to the grounde, he was not so soone fallen downe, when that the monster stroke him with her sharpe hornes verie strongly, yet for all that there was no signe made on his armour by reason of the greate hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but all the harme was by the strength of the blow, his bodie was somewhat brused. Oh holie God, &amp; with what ire was this Greek brought in subiection, at that time if a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and hard mountaine had bÃ©ene before him, he would haue torne it in pÃ©eces. Now was there no resistaunce to be made against his mightie cutting swoord, he threw his shÃ©eld from him to the grounde, and tooke his swoorde fast in both his handes, and abode the comming of this beast, who retourned to strike him agayne, verie much meruailing to sÃ©e how lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hir blowes did profit her. The knight stoode still verye firmely in his place, and when the beast put downe her head, hee discharged his blowe on her, and chaunced vpon the one side of her head, that her harde skull and strong skinne was insufficient to withstand the sharpnesse of his swoorde, but that it cut the flesh and carried awaie one of her hornes, wherewith this beast remained verie sore hurt and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who fÃ©eling her self in that perplexitie, she withdrew her self backe and sayd.</p>

The Prince answered and sayd: Diuell make thy defence by all the meanes thou canst, and all shall bee lyttle inough. And in saying these wordes he firmed his sworde in his hand, then this furious monster began to make a new noise in hissing, and approched towardes the Prince, making as though shÃ©e woulde strike him with her horne that remayned, and when she came nigh him, vppon a sodaine shÃ©e tourned her tayle with so great lightnesse, that the Prince could not make his defence, and stroke him vpon the helme in such sort that shÃ©e ouerthrew him to the ground almost without anie remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, the Prince was not so soone fallen but this monster leapt vnto him with hir hard and sharpe nailes, and griped his hard harnes, thinking with them to teare him all to pÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but she did him no more harme but onely wearied him, in tumbling him vp and downe, yet this inuincible Knight was not without great care to prouide for himselfe and did not loose one iot of his strength and courage, but rather with a double stomack and furious courage procured to clÃ©ere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of the beasts nailes, and with the great strength and pollicie that he vsed, in spite of the monster he clÃ©ered himself, and bÃ©eing at libertie, with great lightnesse he arose on his fÃ©ete, he was not so soone vp when the beast stroke him with his one horne which remained, in such sort that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to fall downe againe to the grounde, the beast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to catch him againe in her clawes, but she coulde not, for that the Prince with great lightnesse rose vp againe, and hauing his sword in his hand he tarried her comming, the beast made a shew as though he would strike at the Prince with his horne, but when she sawe him with his sworde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, she raised her selfe vp on her hinder feete, and fell vppon the Prince, imbracing him with her nailes about his backe scratching and pinching his armour, but it didde lyttle

The Prince sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe so bewrapt with this monster, with greate strength and pollicie brought his swoorde downe vnder the beast, and thrust the point into her bellye vp to the harde hil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The furious monster when shÃ©e felt her selfe so sore wounded, queased the Prince so harde betwÃ©ene hir clawes, that hÃ©e thought verily shee would haue broken all his bones in his bodie, and if it should haue indured long in this order, it had not beene possible to haue escaped the death, but that mortall wounde did so trouble the beast, &amp; was so grÃ©euous vnto her, that she was constrained to let him loose, and to withdrawe her selfe backe, for to put some remedie therein, and sayde vnto the Prince: Oh thou Infidell without all faith, thou hast slaine mee, but tarrie yet there doeth remaine in me courage for to make thee that thou shalt not goe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing of thy selfe, and bearing hir head verie lowe she pressed vnto the Prince, thinking to take him with hir horne and to ouerthrowe him, with pretence to get him againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt hir clawes and nailes, and although she was dying yet not to leaue him till she had torne him all too pÃ©eces. This couragious knight did abide her comming, and perceyuing her deceit, when hee thought that shee would strike him hee stepped on the one side, and in the passing the Prince stroke her so mightie a blowe vppon the necke, that it cut the lame a sunder, so that that horrible and wonderfull monster fell downe dead to the grounde. The Knight with the long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and wrastling remained verie wearye, in such sorte, that hee was constrained to sit downe to ease himselfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a banke that was there made against a wall, giuing greate thankes vnto his Gods for the victorie which they had giuen him.

The knight entered in thereat, and sawe that it was verye darke, and it sÃ©emed vnto him that it should be a verie great hall, and therein he heard very fearefull howlings, yet for all this the valiant GrÃ©eke did not loose anie of his accustomed courage, but entered in farther, and tooke off his gantlet from his left hand, whereon he wore a meruailous great and fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this cannot be tolde thÃ©e by anie other but by me, and yet I will not tell thÃ©e except thou doest graunt me one thing that I will aske of thÃ©e.

This false inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did still stand in this contention to get the ring from him, and contended in such sort that he forgot the respect that hee

This inuincible young man sayd: There is so little truth in this house, that I stand in doubt whether I may belÃ©eue thy words or not, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing tell me who thou art, then shall I know whether I may giue credit vnto thy wordes.

And in saying these words he helde his peace, and with dolorous grones he began to curse himselfe, and it was so grÃ©euous that the Prince withdrewe himselfe because he would not heare it, &amp; without anie more tarrying he embraced his shÃ©eld and laide hand vpon his good sword,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:286"/>
and with great violence he went vnto the Sepulcher, and as he would haue stroke therat, there appeared before him a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, the which the Prince tooke to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyant that he slew in the mountaine <hi>Nabateos,</hi> who stroke the Prince vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brest with both his hands y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him to recoile backe a great way, whether he would or not: notwithstanding with great discreation he kept himselfe vpright, &amp; with wonderful light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, accompanied with no lesse anger, he threw his shÃ©eld at his back, &amp; tooke his sword in both his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds, &amp; went to strike the gyant a mortall blow, at which time there appered before him a whole legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of diuells, with flesh hooks in their hands, with the which they did torment him. The valiant GrÃ©eke with great wrath and double force put himselfe amongest them, striking on euery side such terrible blowes, that in spite of them he came vnto the tombe, and with great lightnesse he stroke on it two blowes, but he had no time to strike the third, for that this diuellish companie did put him from it w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> their terrible assaults and striking of him. Oh in what great trauaile and perplexitie this knight found himselfe amongst this wicked and diuellish generation, for to defend himselfe, that they might not driue him from the Tombe, and tooke great courage, and stretching forth his mightie and strong arme, hÃ©e so flour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

that there was in the Chariot certaine Knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen depriued of their vnderstanding. Likewise he saw a man with a whip in his hand, who did gouern the Dragons and that furious monster, who with a loud voyce said. Nephew vnto <hi>Trebatio,</hi> doo not thou thinke that thy strength is sufficient, for to set at libertie, and to cleere out of paine this vnnaturall and cruell King, and in saying these words, he whipped forwards those terrible Dragons, and with a trice they vanished out of the Princes sight, leauing him somewhat troubled, and not without great reason.</p>

The warlike GrÃ©eke demaunded his horse, and mounting on him, he tooke his way towards <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> and continuallye had in his imagination the names of his grandfather, father and mother, with intent to go towards <hi>Greece,</hi> with all hast possible.

Oh loue, what great falshood is in thÃ©e: and without saying any more she remained verye pensiue, with her eyes looking downwards to the ground, &amp; dissembling her griefe, she did offer vnto him, all fauour and diligence, such as her royall estate was able to giue, which was not a little, for that she was Lady of all that riuer and landes thereabouts, the GrÃ©eke did giue her greate thankes for her gentle offer, and with this determination, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse retourned vnto her chamber, whereas with many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and grieuous thoughts, she passed away the night.

               <p>The Princesse when she saw him in that order, with a sorrowfull countenaunce she sayd: Knight, I cannot iudge what will come of this: but yet I am sure, that thou goest captiue onely to one, and thou dost leaue captiue more than a thousand, who are in no fault of all this thy grÃ©efe.

Oh Gods, is it possible that any base attempt should come vnto light, but with the authoritie that belongeth vnto your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: vpon you I doo call, and vnto you I doo offer this my wounded breast, that you make sacrifice thereof, for this my boldnesse, if therein I haue offended, and therwith he leaned his backe vnto the Myrtle trÃ©e, and tooke his Lute, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play as swÃ©etely as euer did <hi>Orpheus,</hi> when with his lute he made the infernall furyes to sleepe. <hi>Claridiano</hi> with his lute did not onely bring the furies, but also the Queene <hi>Proserpina,</hi> and the auncient <hi>Pluto,</hi> he brought into a greate perplexitie. So likewise at times he vttered his swÃ©ete voice that they which did heare it, did iudge it to be some celestiall thing, and not terrenal, and by reason that his songs did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cÃ©ede from his heart, it did in double wise sÃ©eme the better. This newe shephearde thought no body had hearde him: but there were other two shepheards, who were very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue and hearde, that he sung this song which hÃ©ereafter followeth.</p>

               <p>This new shepheard was very attentiue vnto that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious song of the other shepheard, and when he hearde that he helde his peace, he would haue returned and sung againe, but he was disturbed by hearing a noyse of people. This gentle shepheard when he heard it, arose vp vpon his fÃ©ete, and went out from vnder the shadowe of the Tree farther into the Sunne, and sawe that it was a shephearde and a <hi>Pastora,</hi> which were comming into the place whereas hÃ©e was, and when they came vnto him, they did salute him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteously. So they sate downe altogether, and put the new shepheard in the midst, very much meruayling at his gracious countenaunce: and with a very good grace &amp; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle disposition, the <hi>Pastora</hi> began first to speake, and sayde: Your swÃ©ete Musicke (brother shepheard) did awake me and my brother <hi>Coridon</hi> out of our slÃ©ep and we doo rather choose to lose our naturall rest, then thy conuersation, accompanied with thy delicate song. We doo not know, whether that the faire beautie of <hi>Cayserlinga</hi> a <hi>Pastora,</hi> brought vp by this delightfull riuer, hath bene the occasion thereof, or any other griefe, which doth raigne in thy heart: but if it be so gentle shepheard, that your eyes haue not behelde nor sÃ©ene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our <hi>Pastora,</hi> doo you procure not to sÃ©e her, that your hart be not taken captiue with the sight of her: for you shal vnderstand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is nothing to be hoped for at her hands but death, her disdaine is such This sorrowfull brother of mine, one day did sing before her with his Rebecke, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained so imprisoned with her, as euer was shepheard with
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:13973:289"/>
                  <hi>Pastora.</hi> And if it be thy Fortune to abide long time in these partes, thou shalt knowe the greate power that her face and countenaunce hath, and the greate crueltye that she vseth. Thou shalt see no other thing alongst all this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but shepheardes who haue forgot to gouerne and feede theyr shÃ©epe, sitting vnder trÃ©es wounded with her greate beautie and fayrenesse, and hauing more care to make their Rebeckes fayre and trimme, then to call together their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and to delyuer them from the rauening Wolues. And by reason that shÃ©e doth knowe that her beautie is so great, shÃ©e is so proude, that shee doth make them all equall in her estimation, although not all equall in suffering. I doo promise thÃ©e of a truth (gallant shephearde) that this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dooth seeme to be no other thing, but the habitation of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupide. Coridon</hi> did cut off the words of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismena,</hi> and sayd.</p>
               <p>Ah sister <hi>Galismena,</hi> the little accompt that thou doest make of loue, doth cause thÃ©e to speake of that, which thy sorrowfull brother doth fÃ©ele. What doost thou thinke <hi>Galis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> that of this my contentious passion, I shall reape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye other benefitte, but that I haue put my loue vppon the most excellentest <hi>Pastora,</hi> that euer Nature did forme. Tell me I praye thÃ©e <hi>Pastora,</hi> what shephearde haue you belonging vnto this Riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> vnto whome shÃ©e dooth extend her thought more then vnto me. Hold thy peace <hi>Coridon</hi> sayd <hi>Galismena,</hi> doo not exalt <hi>Cayserlinga</hi> so much: for in her respecte thou doost not onelye put from thÃ©e all other <hi>Pastoras,</hi> but thou dost likewise disable all shepheards alongst this Riuer. Truth it is although that <hi>Cayserlinga</hi> doth deserue much: yet for that she is a woman, she doth not deserue so much, as the worst Shephearde in all this our habitation, for that this onelye is sufficient, that he is a man.</p>
               <p>Then said <hi>Coridon</hi> with great anger: I would it were not thy selfe, but some other that should speake such words, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I promise thÃ©e with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of my arme, I wold make
<pb facs="tcp:13973:290"/>
him to know, that his words were not true, but very false. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> did interrupt their communication, and sayd. Gentle shepheards, let these your contentions cease, for that there commeth nothing of them but anger and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out: but I doo desire you that you would shew vnto me this <hi>Pastora,</hi> for that her fame doeth giue me a desire to sÃ©e her. HÃ©ere by the riuer of <hi>Euphrates</hi> sayd <hi>Coridon,</hi> in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which is made of very faire and grÃ©ene sallowes, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantlye wrought, there euerye morning she doth combe her yeolow golden hayre, thether maist thou goe very earlye in the morning, whereas thou maist recreate thy selfe of that new sight. And in the meane tune before that thou dost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, we doo desire thÃ©e to tell vs thy name, and what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman thou art. This new shepheard aunswered and said, My name is <hi>Filipensio,</hi> and am naturally of <hi>Siria,</hi> and of the plaines of <hi>Caniphia,</hi> a kingdome of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and the great desire of these greene fieldes and fresh feeding which is hÃ©ere growing about this cleere riuer, hath brought me hether, for to feede a little Cattle, the which the Gods hath made mÃ©e Lord and gouernour of. Ah shepheard sayd <hi>Coridon,</hi> (with a dolorous sigh) doest thou come to fÃ©ede thy shÃ©epe in fresh &amp; grÃ©ene medowes, and dost not know that in sÃ©eing that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stora,</hi> thou shalt fÃ©ede loue within thy delicate and tender breast.</p>
               <p>So with this, and other such like pleasaunt communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they passed all that night till the next morning, and when it was time for to departe, they tooke their waye to the accustomed abiding of the beautifull <hi>Pastora,</hi> and they met in the waye manye shepheardes, who complained very much against the fury of loue. So vnder a greate Sallowe TrÃ©e, they sawe two shepheards, the one did complaine of loue very grieuously, and laye all alongst vppon the ground, and the other was playing vppon a Rebecke, and sung ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye swÃ©etelye, wherewith <hi>Filipensio</hi> did staye<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and heard that he sung as followeth.</p>

fayre Princesse his sister, so that the knights did not occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie themselues in anie other exercise but in iustes and tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes. The QuÃ©ene did continually perswade her sonne with gentle and louing wordes to tarrie and not to take the order vppon him till such time as hÃ©e came to more yeares, laying before him the greate inconueniences which myght happen for lacke of his full growth and strength, but this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying of the QuÃ©ene did cause the Prince to be very sadde and pensiue, and also caused that all the feastes and sportes that the knights did dayly vse, waxed altogether colde, in sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince to be in that heauie case, and vpon a daie as hÃ©e was imagining with himselfe, sÃ©eing the small comfort and good will which hÃ©e receiued in his mother for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his desire, he determined in greate secret as soone as was possible to depart the court, the which hÃ©e straight waies put in vre, and tooke out of the armourie verie secretly an excÃ©eding good armour, the which was all russet, and ename<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with blacke, and imbroudered round about with grauen worke all guilt: also hÃ©e tooke out a shÃ©elde of the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, sauing that it was not graued as his armour was, and commaunded a young Gentleman that was sonne vnto <hi>Rubio,</hi> of a good disposition and hardie, that he shoulde kÃ©epe themselues, &amp; gaue him to vnderstand of all his determined pretence, and although it did grieue this young man verye much, yet for all that, sÃ©eing the great friendshippe which he vsed with him in vttering his secrete vnto him before anie other, without replying to the contrarie, he verie diligently tooke the armour and hidde it, till hÃ©e found conuenient time to put it into a ship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So likewise he put into the sayde Ship two of the best horses which the Prince had, and forthwith hÃ©e gaue his Lorde vnderstanding howe that all thinges were then in a readinesse and in good order. The Prince dissembling with the accustomed heauinesse hÃ©e vsed, withdrew himselfe into his chamber till such time as the night came, which when it was come, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe readie with his apparaile, and when that all the people
<pb facs="tcp:13973:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Court were at their rest and a slÃ©ep, he alone with his page, who was named <hi>Macedonio,</hi> went out of the pallaice, and went vnto the sea side. His page did call the marriners of the ship, who straight way brought vnto them their boat, in the which they entered, and went straight a boord the ship, and being therin for that the winde was very faire, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to waye their ankers, and to spread their sayles, and to take their way towards <hi>Grecia,</hi> and as he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all was done, and in a short time they found themselues ingulfed into the sea, farre from the lande. This excellent Prince went very much to his contentment: but when the QuÃ©ene vnderstood of his departure, the lamentation which she made was very much, and commaunded to go vnto the sea side, to know if there were any shippe that departed that night, and it was tolde them that there was a ship of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> which that night haled vp their ankers, &amp; hoised saile, and went to sea: so straight waye they vnderstood that the Prince was gone in her. I cannot hÃ©ere declare the greate griefe and sorrow which the QuÃ©ene felt in her sorrowfull heart, for the absence of the Prince, which she alwayes sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected &amp; feared. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> absence of <hi>Poliphebo</hi> was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen in <hi>Tinacria,</hi> all feasts &amp; sports ceased, for that you shall vnderstand, of all his vassailes he was very well beloued. The QuÃ©ene did procure to dissemble all her griefe, for the great sorrow which her vassailes had, shewing her self more ioyful in her face, more then anie contentment she had in her heart, giuing them to vnderstand, that he had done it, for that which he did owe vnto his high linage, and the great ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he had to procure his honour and fame: and that hÃ©e had done that, which she and all them should haue desired, &amp; that they should not be sorrowfull for that, which hÃ©ereafter would be the occasion of great ioye and plesure. With these and such lyke resons, she did quiet all her vassailes and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and caused them to returne vnto their accustomed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime and sports. So <hi>Poliphebo</hi> sayled forwardes on his iourney, through the dÃ©epe sea, with great delight to sÃ©e howe he had fulfilled his desire. And he sayled thrÃ©e dayes with a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:13973:294"/>
very faire and prosperous winde, and the fourth daye in the euening it was very calme, and no winde at all, so that the Marriners went to take their rest, some on the poope, &amp; some in the foreships, for to ease their wearied bodyes. The prince who sate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poope of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ship, asked for his lute of his page, the which straight way was giuen him, and when he had it in his hands, he played and sung so swÃ©etly, that it sÃ©emed to be a heauenly melodie. And being in this swÃ©ete musicke, hÃ©e heard a very lamentable crye as it were of a woman, and leauing his musicke, he gaue attentiue eare to hearken what she sayd, and he heard the voyce saye: It will little profitte thÃ©e thou cruell tyrant, this thy bolde hardinesse, for thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est well know, that I am of a lignage, that will reuenge it of thÃ©e to thy cost. Then he heard another voyce which said: Now I haue thÃ©e in my power, there is no humane power able to deliuer thÃ©e from me<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
                  <hi>Poliphebo</hi> could heare no more by reason that the barke wherein they were, passed by in so great hast. This heroycall Prince by the words he hearde, vnderstood that she was carryed by force awaye, and putting the lute away, he began to fall into a great thought, and was very heauie and sorrowfull, for that he had not receiued the order of Knighthoode, for to giue the enterprise of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture: but yet his stout stomacke could not suffer, that such compulsion and vyolence should passe without being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. And returning vnto his Page <hi>Masedonio,</hi> which was a slÃ©epe, he strake him with his foote and awaked him, saying: What, didst not thou heare the great lamentation, and sorrowfull complaint, which a Ladye made (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) in a small bark that is passed by, and is gone forwards along the sea, (to the which <hi>Masedonio</hi> aunswered nothing, for that he was still a slÃ©epe,) what counsayle dost thou giue me, that I may doe in so great outrage which is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes, that I may receiue no shame thereof.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:295"/>Then <hi>Poliphebo</hi> sayde, He is not a Knight which doth set his force against a woman, and doth breake the law &amp; oath made vnto Knighthoode. Therefore bring me foorth my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and call the marriners, that they maye launch their boat, into the sea: for by the omnipotent <hi>Iupiter</hi> I do sweare, that I will not be called the sonne of my father, if I do suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such force to be done before me, and not procure with all my strength to amend and correct the same. <hi>Masedonio</hi>
would haue replyed vnto him, but the furious countenaunce of the Prince would not giue him leaue, no not once to looke vpon him. So he brought foorth his armour, and armed him selfe therewith. In the meane time the marriners had lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the boate into the sea, wherein he leaped with a hastie fury, and carried with him foure marriners for to rowe the bark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>, and he commaunded for to take the way towards the other that passed by. All that remained in the ship greatlye meruailed at his hardinesse. This Prince of <hi>Tinacria</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the marriners to make great hast with their oares, for that they would not loose the way which they had. So they trauailed all that night, till such time as the cleare <hi>Phoebus</hi> with his glittering beames gaue vnto them such lyght, that they might discouer and sÃ©e the other barke, although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a farre off. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> had great contentment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, hoping that very quickly they should ouertake them, but it did little profit them: for if that he did make hast to ouer take them, they were not idle, but did make as much hast to goe from them. So in this contention they trauailed til two partes of the daye was spent, at which time they sawe come after them a galley which was gouerned with eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tÃ©ene oares on a side, and it made so great waye, that with a trice they were with them, and he saw that ther was in hir a Knight all armed with blacke armour, and was of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle disposition and well proportioned body, who made greate hast vnto the mariners to rowe forwards. And as they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by, the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> said vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> with a loud voyce: Knight I doo request thÃ©e, that you wilt take me into your Galley, that being in her, I may the better accomplish my desire.

Those that were at the oares, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailyng at the great boldnesse of the Knight, did cease theyr exercise and worke of rowing. The blacke Knight being full of anger, as he which was one of the best in all the worlde, drew out his sword, and went towards that bolde Knight. This furious <hi>Tinacrian</hi> sÃ©eing himselfe without the order of knighthood, would not lay hands on his sword, but laid hold of one of those long and heauie oares, and went and stroake at the black Knight, who did defend it and sayd: What do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou pretend to doo, thou foole and without wit, what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou thinke with staues as a countrey clowne or villain to make battaile with me?

This new Knight was very attentiue vnto the words which the countriman told him, and although he spake in the <hi>Tuscan</hi> tongue, yet he did vnderstand him, for that he was broughte vp to vnderstand and speake all languages, and thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, that he with whom he had battaile in the galley, was the King of <hi>Mruritania,</hi> and thinking thereon, it caused him to be more furious in his heart, for that as you haue hearde, he had the experience of his force and strength, and thought by him he was ouercome, and without saying anye word, he followed on his way, and did determine, that if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did so fauour him to rescue and set at libertie this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not for to let her passe, till such time, as the King did come in her demaund, (and if it were he with whom he had the battaile) he would not deliuer her but with mortall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.

<pb facs="tcp:13973:300"/>
he would prosecute it. In such sort, that many times he made resistaunce against inchantments, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had more strength and force, than euer Knight or Giant had, at any time before, and did surmount very much his bretheren and Cousins. He made no reckoning of loue in his youth, by which he was iudged to be the Emperours sonne, as in the third parte of this booke shall be tolde you. So when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning was come, this young <hi>Mars</hi> was not slothfull, but arose vp and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his iourney, and his Page followed him with his helme: he had not trauailed scarce halfe a mile, when that he heard a pitifull lamentation of a woman, who by reason of her great wÃ©eping, her voyce was very hoarce. So he stayed to heare from whence that lamentable noyse should come, and went towards that place whereas it was, and saw a far off a high piller of stone, out of the which, there came foorthe a spoute of very faire and clÃ©ere water, and thereat was bound a woman all naked, her backe fastened to the piller, and her armes backward imbracing the piller, and there her handes fast bound. Her skin was so faire and white, that if it had not bene that he heard her lamentation, he would haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to haue bene an image made artificially of Alabaster ioyned vnto the piller. This warlike young Knight laced on his helme, and came vnto the place whereas she was: and when he saw her, he thought verely that it was the QuÃ©ene of <hi>Mauritania</hi> of whom the countrey man told him, and by reason of the coldnesse of the darke night, and with her great lamentation and wÃ©epings, she was so full of sorow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that she could scarce speake. Likewise the Knightes heart so yerned at the sight of that vnhappie Lady, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most he could not looke on her for wÃ©eping: but with a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull sigh he sayd.

bloud. And taking a cloke from one of the mariners, he threw it vpon her, for to couer her body, and tooke her in his arms and commaunded <hi>Macedonio</hi> for to vnlose her. This vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Lady neuer felt nor knew what was done vnto her, till such time as she was vnbound out of those bands, and in the Knights armes: and giuing a terrible sigh, she thought that she had bene in the armes of that furious Giaunt, saying. Oh <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> my Lord and husband. The Knight hearing those wordes, was fully certified, that it was he with whom he had had battaile: and so it was true as hath bene tolde you. This new Knight would haue aunswered her, but hÃ©e was disturbed by hearing of a great noyse of a horse, which sÃ©emed to be in the wood amongst the trÃ©es, and for to sÃ©e what it should be, he left the Ladie lieng along vpon the grounde, in the kÃ©eping of his Page and the marriners, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that place, whereas he heard that rushing noyse, and sawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a mightie great &amp; monstrous Giant mounted vpon a great beast, the which was <hi>Marmoraton,</hi> who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to see if the Lady were aliue, for to torment her a new. And when he came vnto the piller, and saw not the Ladye, with an irefull looke he cast his eyes, looking about on euerye side, and at last he saw the Knight, who was comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him with a reasonable and quiet pace, and how that the Lady was vntyed, making her sorrowfull complaint. And sÃ©eing them in this order, with great fury vpon his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible beast he came towardes them, and when he was nigh them, he staid and did behold the great proportion and gentle disposition of the Knight, hnd asked him saying. Art thou by fortune the King of <hi>Mauritania</hi> that traiterously hath slaine in the field my brother and his children.

aduenture against them, that will sÃ©eme farther to misuse her. In the meane time whiles the Knight was saying these words, the Gyant was beholding him very preciselye, and knit his browes with the great anger he receiued to heare these words, and with great fury he spurred his monstrous beast, that he made him giue so mightie a leape, that he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto the place whereas the knight was, and it lacked little, that he had not fallen vpon this new knight, who with great lightnesse did apart himselfe from him, and drewe out his sword, and would haue stroke him: but the beast passed by with so great fury that he could not reach him.

This inuincible <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did abide his comming, and at the discharging of the Giaunts blowe, he stepped on the one side towards his left hand, and stroke an ouerthwart blow with so great strength vpon his knÃ©e, that by reason his armour was not very good, he cut it a sunder, so that leg and all fell downe to the grounde, and the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Giant fell on the other side likewise to the earth, and with great roaring began to blaspheme against the heauens for this his sodaine mishap. There was a man that came with the Gyant, who when he saw all that had passed, with great feare returned the way from whence he came. The Prince when he saw that with so great ease he was cleare of the Giant, with a loude voyce he said. Oh God whom the Christians doo worship, I doo giue thÃ©e thankes, and I doo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that all this my good successe doth procÃ©ede from thee, and hÃ©ere I doo promise and vowe, that once comming vnto my father, to accomplysh and performe all that I am bounde to doo, for to be a true Christian. The great beast whereon the Gyaunt latelye rode, did very well please and gaue great contentment vnto the Knight, for that he was of a bigge stature, and of a very good haire, because the halfe parte forwardes was was of the colour of a Wolfe, and the other halfe was all blacke, sauing that hÃ©ere and there it was spotted with little white spots. His feete were clouen, so

that he nÃ©eded not at anie time to be shooed, his necke was somewhat long, and a little head, with great cares hanging down like a hound, his pace was with great maiestie, and he doubled his necke that his mouth touched his breast, there came foorth of his mouth two great tusks, and he did exceed all beasts in the world in lightnesse, and did runne with a verie good grace. The young knight receiued so great delight in him, that he did determine to take and kÃ©epe him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; not to vse anie other horse so long as this beast would indure, and without the helpe of stirop or anie other thing he leapt into the saddle, and commaunded his Page and the Marriners, that in the thickest of the forrest they shoulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his comming, and to haue great care of that Ladie, and not to remoue from thence till such time as they dyd heare the sound of his horne, and when he had aduertised the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> what they should doe, he tooke the narrow path by which the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant came, in the which he had not trauailed long, when that vpon a sodaine (not knowing what it should be) there came a damsell and put her selfe before him, who brought vnto him a shÃ©eld verie rich, in the which was painted a trÃ©e, the one halfe was of siluer and had a braunch broken which hung downe, out of the which ranne streames of red bloud, and the other ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

the deuise which the shield had, he did imagine to what ende it shuld apply, and likewise of the words which the damosel had sayd. And bÃ©eing troubled with these thoughts and such lyke, he prosecuted his waye: and when he came foorthe of that narrow and straight way, he came into a great plaine, in the which he saw a Castle, scituated vppon a rocke, and a mile from that place there was another Castle, which sÃ©emed to be very strong. And in the Castle that was in the plaine, there was a great noyse, and strayght way there issued out a company of Knights, and amongst them a valyant Giaunt, who with great pride came towards the Knight, and when they came nigh, and saw that he was mounted vpon the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunts beast, with great anger and fury they assaulted him, &amp; they were to the number of twentie Knights. This coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious young Knight was nothing troubled to sÃ©e them, but rather did abide their comming with his sword in his hand, and with as much courage, as though he had had as manye more in his company to help him. And when they had made their encounter vpon him, yet he remained as firme in the saddle, as a strong and hard Rocke: but yet at their passing by, he stroke one of them such a blow vpon the shoulder, that cutting it in two pÃ©eces, he ouerthrew him to the grounde. At that time approched the Gyant, who by reason of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie in bignesse, his horse could not trauaile so fast as the others did. He brought in his hand a strong speare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he made his encounter against the young Knight, that he made him to leane on the one side in the saddle: but with a trice he setled himselfe againe, and throwing his shielde at his backe, he tooke his sword strongly in both his handes, &amp; stroke his beast with the spurres, who with a light leap was with his enimie, and discharged his blow vpon the Gyants shield with so great furie, that he cut it in two pÃ©eces, and it descended from thence vpon his hard and stÃ©elie healme with so great strength, that he made him to fall vppon his Horse necke without anye remembraunce, and retourned with his sword, thinking to giue him the seconde blowe, which by no meanes he could, for that the Knights did so assault him on

euery side: but it did little profite them all that euer they did or could doo, for returning against them with his light beast, he intreated them in such sort, that when the astonished Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant came vnto himselfe, there were fiftÃ©ene of his Knightes ouerthrowen to the ground. Oh how angrie and wrathfull was this Giant when he saw so great slaughter, who with a furious rage drew out his fawchon, &amp; with both his hands he stroke him such a blow vpon his fine and hard helme, that he did depriue him of his vnderstanding. His furious beast being scarred with that terrible blowe, began to run about the field, in such sort, that if the knight had not quickly come to himselfe, he had carried him into the Castle: but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himselfe, he rayned the bridle of the beast, and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his enimie with such fury, and with his sword all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, he stroke him such a blow vpon his helme, that cleauing it in pÃ©eces with the head downe to the shoulders, hÃ©e fell downe dead to the ground. The rest of the Knights which remained, when they saw that terrible blow wold haue run away: but sodainly they sawe come forth out of the other Castle, as many moe knights, as came at the first, and with the like pride and fury as the others did, they assauted <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo,</hi> who sÃ©eing that new assault, and that there came an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Giant in their company, he made himselfe readye for his defence, and procured to doo his best to deliuer himselfe from them, and taking a speare which was one of the dead knights, and being shrowded vnder his shield, he went foorth to mtÃ©ee the Gyant, who when he saw him come, addressed himselfe. They made their incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ter very strongly vpon their shÃ©elds, and the Giant did no more but breake his speare in small pÃ©eces, but he neuer moued the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> in his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, who made his encounter so stronglye, and stroke him with so great fury vppon his shÃ©elde, that by reason of the great sharpnesse of his speare it rested not there, but pearce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it thorough and also his armour, it appeared behinde him at his backe, in such sort, that he ouerthrew him dead to the grounde.</p>

In suche sort he behaued himselfe amongst them, ouerthrowing and wounding on euery side, that in short time they left him at his libertie, &amp; the like he would haue done, if there had bene as many more before him, his anger and fury was such, the rest which remained, being about the number of six knights, put themselues vnto flight. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, neither made he any reckoning of them, but ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Castle, and did alight from his great beast, and went into a broade Courte, whereas were all the Giauntes household seruaunts, and when they saw him, they began to runne away, and to hide themselues, as from theyr sodayne death. The knight did call them againe, and bad them be in quiet, and not to feare, for that he would not hurt them, if they would shewe him where the prisoners were in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Then one of them said: Prisoners there are, but what shall it profite to showe thÃ©e the place, when thou canst not deliuer them, for that ther be such kÃ©epers to kÃ©epe them. Let it be what it will be said the Knight, for once thou shalte showe me where they are. As for their kÃ©epers they haue but smal defence, neither haue you any occasion to feare, for that this daye they haue made accompt and payd all the euills &amp; harmes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue done. The man when he heard this, without any replying tooke a bundle of keyes, and came out of the kitchin into the Court, whereas he opened a doore, and entred therein, they descended downe a paire of staires into a dÃ©epe dungeon, whereas they heard a very sorrowfull and lamentable noyse. The knight spake with a lowde voyce &amp; sayd. Who is it that lyeth so lamenting within this darke

dungeon. To whom was aunswered with a verye dolorous voyce: HÃ©ere lyeth the most grieuous and afflicted knight that may be found in all the worlde, &amp; in his company other Knights, brought vnto this place by forcible vyolence, why I doo not know, for that we haue not seene one another, by reason of the great and terrible darknesse that is heere. Wel sayd the Prince, come forth, if heereafter you can defend and kÃ©epe your selues from other prisons, so it is, for of this, from this day forwards you are cleere: and in saying these words, he ascended vp the staires, and after him the man which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doore. Then the prisoners in great hast came vp the staires, and comming foorth whereas the Knight was, they all fell downe on their knÃ©es, giuing thankes vnto God for that he had giuen them libertie: and afterward they kissed the Knights hands, desiring God to increase his powers and honour, who with a very good grace gaue them such answer, that they were all very well content. Amongst them there was one prisoner of a very goodly disposition and faire face, and of a double stature, more then the others, who with a seuere countenaunce and well placed wordes, did surrender vnto the Knight great thankes for that good tourne which he receiued at his hands: he spake to him in the <hi>Tuscane</hi> tongue. It sÃ©emed vnto the Prince that he should be a person of estimation, and asked of him his name, and what countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was? To whom the prisoner sayde: My name (sir knight) is <hi>Florisarte,</hi> sonne vnto the Duke of <hi>Bauiera,</hi> brother vnto the good Emperour <hi>Ladislao</hi> of <hi>Almania,</hi> who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner villainously by these euill Giants.

of a meruailous and extreame beautie, who was at her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie accompanied with many worthy Knightes, for that all did respect the Earle verye much, because he was a very no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble man. At the great fame and reporte of this daughter of the Earle of <hi>Tirol,</hi> for that she was of so excellent beautie, came many young Knights out of diuers countreyes to sÃ©e her, amongst whom came two bretheren, iolly young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and sonnes vnto the Earle of <hi>Olanda,</hi> and a cousin of theirs, a valiant Knight, sonne vnto the Duke of <hi>Brabant.</hi> There was no great friendship betwixt these two brethren as it appeared, because they were of different condition the one from the other, &amp; likewise great difference in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: for that the eldest had a very fierce countenaunce, and ill fauoured, and of great pride: and the youngest of a seuere and gentle countenaunce, and very humble of person, and was well beloued of all them in the Court. Both of them set their eyes vpon <hi>Clarentina,</hi> daughter vnto the Earle of <hi>Tirol,</hi> and for a farther euill, that false <hi>Cupide</hi> would not, but that she shuld likewise set her eyes on one of them, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her heart into captiuitie with the loue of <hi>Pinorante,</hi> the youngest of the two bretheren. <hi>Firidefonte</hi> who was the eldest hauing vnderstanding thereof, (being gouerned by his great pride) and seeing the small accompt that <hi>Clarentina</hi> made of him, the diuell straight wayes put into his heade, (with the great ieelousie that he had) for to kill his brother: but many dayes after, he went meruailously troubled, with great alterations in his thought, about the dooing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked dÃ©ede, sometimes ouercome by brotherly loue to leaue that enterprise, and at other times counsailed by his owne cholar to the contrarie.

Wherfore vpon a night as <hi>Pinorante</hi> was walking on the backe side of the Court, his euill brother did kill him with great crueltie, &amp; leauing him vpon the ground, he returned vnto his lodging, and it was neuer knowen,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:306"/>
who was the murtherer of him, and for that the fraternall bloud could not let but to wound verie much his heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the euill fact which he had done, he straight way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented himselfe thereof, which was afterward a farther euill, and forsomuch as the diuell was lodged in his heart, this his euill pretence did not rest with the death of his brother, but gathered in his thought to do a fact farre worser, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion was, for that <hi>Clarentina</hi> made so great lamentation for the death of that vnhappie <hi>Pinaronte,</hi> and this was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption that he would vse, ordeined by the diuell, and it so fell out, that I was wounded by that false <hi>Cupide</hi> with the loue of <hi>Firidefonte,</hi> not hauing anie respect vnto the ill fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse of his face, and being constrained by the grÃ©euousnes of my wound, I gaue him clÃ©erly to vnderstand therof, which was the occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was the bolder to doe that which hÃ©e did, &amp; seeing me so captiue in loue of him, he was in no doubt to discouer vnto me his whole heart, all the which he tolde me, being in place where boldly he might speake. And he said: Ah <hi>Clarentina</hi> my verie friend, I haue had greate desire to haue had this opportunitie for to talke with thÃ©e, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer my whole heart. Thou hast well sÃ©ene this vnhappie and cruell death of my vnfortunate brother, thou shalt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that <hi>Clarentina</hi> was the occasion of his death, but and if thou wilt doe that which now I will desire thÃ©e, I do hÃ©ere sweare vnto thÃ©e by the high and mightie God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there shall none be Ladie of my heart but alonely thy beautie, then I (vnhappie and without all good fortune) being wholy yÃ©elded and so ouercome with his loue, did offer my selfe to doe all that which his pleasure was to commaunde mÃ©e. Then this traitour with dissembling wordes sayde: I alwayes had this good opinion in you my loue, that you woulde accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish my request. Well, thou shalt nowe vnderstande that I doe pretende to accuse <hi>Clarentina</hi> for the murther of my brother, and the better to bring to passe my desire, I will saye that thou art witnesse therevnto, and doest knowe the certaintie thereof. Then I thinking to obtaine that which
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:13973:306"/>
so long time I had desired, did promise him to doe it, as by the proofe it shoulde plainely appeare. And with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion he departed from me, and went and gaue his cousin <hi>Rodelando</hi> to vnderstand of it, who is one of the strongest and valyauntest knightes in all this Countrie, and <hi>Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando</hi> belÃ©euing that it should bÃ©e true, did offer himselfe to be the seconde in the defence in helping of his cousin, and so both of them went and made their accusation before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the Emperour commaunded mÃ©e to bÃ©e called before him, for to declare what I did knowe therein, and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish and performe all that I had promised. Then this faultlesse Ladie sÃ©eing her selfe so falsely accused, did wÃ©epe verie grÃ©euously, desiring the Emperour to appoint a time that shÃ©e might seeke one for to make aunswere in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and for to prooue that it was all false that was layde against her. So it was agrÃ©ed, that in the space of two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths shÃ©e should bring a knight that shoulde defend her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and if so be that shÃ©e coulde not, that then shÃ©e shoulde be condempned according vnto the lawe, that is, to burne her quicke, and in the meane time that shÃ©e should be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a tower, and there well and strongly kept, not forbidding anie, whosoeuer hÃ©e were, naturall or straunger, but that hÃ©e might lawfully make battaile in her defence. So likewise they commaunded that I should be put in another tower, that if it were so that I should be found a liar, that I shoulde bÃ©e punished with her prouided death. So I when I vnderstood it was in a great feare, and went priuelye vnto the lodging of <hi>Firidefonte,</hi> of whome I was verie well receiued, and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he would send me into his Countrie, he put all thinges in order for my iourney, and gaue me these two vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines whom thou hast slain to be my keepers, who brought me hether, and brought me vnto the point as you found me. And as I do beleeue it came determined from thence, for that his euill pretence should not be discouered. Heere you maye vnderstand sir knight, wherefore I sayd that it had ben bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to haue let me ben slaine then to liue with so great griefe.</q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:307"/>
And now that I haue told you all the matter, and the truth, heere I doo desire you, that if there be in you any bountie, (as it doth appeare and shewe by your presence) that thou wilt take vppon thy owne charge this battaile and defence, for that I would (sÃ©eing that I haue bene the occasion of all this euill and trouble happened vnto this guiltlesse Lady, in giuing false euidence) be the meanes whereby she might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue remedie for the same. This <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was very much amazed to heare of such an intangled and false forged mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and for that he was one that did procure to aide and helpe the afflicted, he did very frÃ©ely offer himselfe, to procure to make her defence. At this instant the dawning of the day appeared, and the Prince tooke the Gentlewoman, and went whereas the Knight of <hi>Bauier</hi> was, and did awake him, and gaue him to vnderstand, of all that the Gentlewoman hadde tolde him, who incontinent did offer himself to be the second in the battaile for her defence. When the QuÃ©ene was all in a readinesse to trauaile on their iourney and all the rest, they made great hast, and tooke the way which led them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Espira,</hi> and carried the Gentlewoman with her face coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that she might not be knowen. So when they came with in a mile of the Citie of <hi>Espira,</hi> they must nÃ©edes passe a great and mightie broad riuer, whereas they lefte <hi>Candisea</hi> in a dayrie house, giuing great charge that she shuld be well looked vnto, and the QuÃ©ene and all the rest passed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in a barke, and neuer staid till they entered into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and had their helmes on, and their shields at their backs. This strong and stout <hi>Tinacrian</hi> rode mounted vppon his temerous beast, with so great and goodly a demeanour, that all which did behold him, greatly meruailed what knight it shuld be, of so great and comely stature, and when they saw the deuise of the trÃ©e and broken braunch on his shielde, they straight wayes know that he was the Knight that had slaine the Gyaunts, for that they had heard the newes there of in the Court, which was the occasion that much people, did folow him to behold his face, if he did put off his helm, to see if they could know him. So these two knightes and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13973:307"/>
the QuÃ©ene (with all the people that followed him) came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperours pallaice, whereas the Prince did alight, &amp; taking the QuÃ©ene in his armes, he tooke her from her Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraie and lead her by the right hand, so with a verie gentle &amp; comely grace they went vp into a royall hall, and <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> remained belowe and kept their horses. When they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered they found the Emperour accompanied with all his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, &amp; the knight was knowen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> al by the deuice of his shÃ©eld, &amp; therfore al people did approch to know wherfore his comming was, &amp; greatly meruailed at his bigge stature &amp; gentle disposition, and they all kept silence to heare what the knight of the Braunch woulde saie, who when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour made a shewe of his high lignage from whence he did descend, in making of his dutifull reuerence.

               <p>These two cosins were there present and heard very wel his words, and <hi>Rodelando</hi> without anie respect vnto the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, taking his cosin <hi>Firidefonte</hi> by the hand, stepped forth with a furious countenance and said:
<q>HÃ©ere thou hast before thÃ©e they whom thou dost demaund for, beholde vs well, and let not thy youthfull courage deceiue thÃ©e, giuing enterprise vpon that, of which the sonnes of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> would make doubtfull, therefore looke what thou doest deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and giue vs our aunswere, and that quicklye. The Knight of the Braunch in the meane time that <hi>Rodelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> was saying these wordes, did verie much beholde and viewe him, and it sÃ©emed vnto him that hÃ©e was a Knight of greate valour, but yet for all that his strong members did not dismaie him, but with a graue spÃ©ech and seuere countenaunce he aunswered: If thou hast so much haste to knowe my determination, hÃ©ere I doe saye that in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation that thou hast put against <hi>Clarentina,</hi> thou doest lye lyke a false Knight, and that thy cosin lyke a cruell murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer doth deserue the death for killing of his owne Brother, committed by his owne handes, who was more worthie in all respects then he is.</q> Then <hi>Firidefonte</hi> with great fury an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and sayd.</p>

I cannot declare the great anger which the knight of the Braunch receiued, for that he tourned vp the white of his eyes, and all his face waxed wanne and blacke, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with very anger moouing his pace he sayd. I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise thÃ©e thou traitour, that I will make thÃ©e with thy owne mouth confesse this great treason which thou hast commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if it were not but that I am before so high an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, hÃ©ere in this place without going anie farther, with my fists like a vile traitour I would make thÃ©e to confesse it. HÃ©ere <hi>Firidefonte</hi> had no patience to heare these things spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his face, but like a tyger he leapt vnto him and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his cloake about his arme and drew out his sword, and went against the knight of the Braunch. This worthy war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour thereat made no kinde of mouing, but did abide his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, making an outward shewe of the greate valour of his heart, <hi>Firidefonte</hi> did strike at him with his sworde, but the knight of the Braunch stepped on the one side, and made him to loose his blow, so that his sword stroke on the ground, and like vnto the winde he closed with him, and stroke him with his hands on the breast with so great furie and strength, that without hauing anie power to saue himselfe, he gaue a great fall backwards to the ground, <hi>Rodelando</hi> sÃ©eing that on the best side entered to him, and did imbrace him, and held him verie strongly betwÃ©ene his armes. Then this gentle knight drew out his swoorde, and hauing his arme aloft he stroke a blowe, the which chaunced vpon a young man called <hi>Polio,</hi> of <hi>Velduque,</hi> sonne vnto the Duke of <hi>Velduque,</hi> and that cruell sword did light vppon his head, and cutting it in two parts, the young man fell downe dead to the ground. Nowe was it not requisite that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> should remaine in the armes of <hi>Rodelando,</hi> but with great strength he did ruste him selfe, &amp; threw him from him. At y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time the whole Court was in a tumult for the death of <hi>Polio,</hi> and euerie one drewe out his sworde and did verie sore assalt the knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Branch,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:309"/>
but he with his sworde made such a slaughter amongest them, that they did verie well feele and vnderstand the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnesse of his heart, &amp; the great noise &amp; crieng out of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, neither his emperiall presence was sufficient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease them. At this time the Emperours gard came into the hall, who were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>manded that with their halberts they shuld indeuour to part them, then the Emperour went to lay hand on <hi>Firidefonte,</hi> the beginner of all this tumult, but he putting himselfe in defence went forth of the hall, so likewise did <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delando,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour sÃ©eing that, laide hand on the <hi>Bauiero,</hi> who with great humilitie did obey his Lord, he would haue done y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like vnto <hi>Poliphebo,</hi> but he put the point of his sword before him &amp; said: KÃ©epe your highnesse backe, for that I am none of them that so lightly wil be taken prisoner, take &amp; put in prison thy owne vassalles, such as hath had little respect vnto thy presence, &amp; let not them which are not of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome pay for this thy anger. The emperour very angry said: If my vassalls are in the fault, they shall haue theyr punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; thou also if thou dost deserue it, therfore yÃ©eld thy self to prison, if not, vnderstand that it wil be to thy cost. I know not what will fall out hÃ©erein, said the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my good will neither you nor all yours shall triumph of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, &amp; before that this doth come to passe, I wil make more then one thousand of them that do pretend to take me prisoner loose their liues. Then the Emperour with a loude voice commaunded to fake him, at which wordes all the whole gard together pressed at him, but this valiaunt knight did determine that in spite of them all he woulde clÃ©ere and set himselfe at libertie, there did he begin to doe wonderfull feates of armes, breaking and cutting a sunder those sharpe Halberts, and killing and wounding that it was terrible to beholde. All the people feeling and sÃ©eing the effect of his rigorous arme, did giue him waye and let him goe tyll hÃ©e came to the stayres, there they beganne to assault him a newe with verye much people, and amongest them some armed knightes. The Knight when he sawe that he coulde not passe in quiet, he was cleane without anye patience,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13973:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not fearing death but forgetting pollicie, he firmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and throwing his shield at his backe, he tooke his sword in both his hands, and layd about him on euerye side, &amp; lyke vnto a furious Lion he pressed amongst the people, cutting, killing and wounding, for to haue way to descend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> staires. At that time was the Knight in great perill, for that those which were before him, did persecute him with the sharpe poynts of their halberds, and likewise those which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him did the like: in such sorte, that the Knight bÃ©eing on the staires, could not tourne himselfe at his pleasure: but yet all that euer they did, did little auaile or profite them, for that with the great furie which he had, he pressed vpon them that were before him, and what with killing and wounding, he forced them to giue him way to descend downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> staires, where hÃ©e founde many people fallen downe with the great hast they had to flye from him. And when he saw that hÃ©e could not passe by reason of the people, he gaue a great leap, &amp; with wonderfull lightnesse he passed ouer the people that were fallen, and went vnto the place whereas <hi>Macedonio</hi> did abide his comming, with his great beast, &amp; with strange lightnes he lept vpon his back, and rode into the great court, whereas he was assaulted of very much people, for that the Emperour at the windowes cryed out vppon them to take him. The knight of the branch, when he found himself mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon his great and light beast, then he feared nothing, and pricking him with the spurres, incouraging him with a showte, he passed downe the strÃ©ete, and neuer stayd, till he came vnto the riuers side, and passed in the barke vnto the other side, and determined not to depart from thence, till such time as he had sÃ©ene an end of that which touched the iustice of <hi>Clarentina,</hi> and also to recouer againe his Lady the quÃ©ene, who with great affliction, as a woman all alone, put her self out of the prease of Knightes, and abode in a corner of the great Hall, to kÃ©epe her selfe from harme. The people of the Emperour, which followed the Knight of the Branch, when they sawe him passe with his great beast so swiftly, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned backe againe whereas the Emperour was, whome
<pb facs="tcp:13973:310"/>
they found verie much amazed at the great prowesse of this knight. The Earle of <hi>Maguntia</hi> who likewise followed the knight, at his returning againe he found <hi>Macedonio,</hi> &amp; tooke him and carryed him before the Emperour and said: This is Page vnto that diuell, who to our cost and spite of our tÃ©eth is gone awaye. The Emperour did beholde him and sawe that he was of a good disposition &amp; had a faire face, he asked of him and said: Tell me my friend, howe doest thou call thy Lord, is he by fortune some diuell, for that according as hÃ©e hath shewed himselfe vnto vs, it cannot be but that he is some infernall creature. This young Gentleman with great deliberation sayd: My Lord is a humane creature and sonne vnto a humane man, and more mightier then your highnesse, for you shall vnderstand that he is sonne vnto the Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and his mother is the quÃ©ene <hi>Garrofilea</hi> QuÃ©ene of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> and your highnesse shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that he is a knight that will reward (and that verye well) all the harme and griefe which is done vnto him, with whatsoeuer knight he be in all the world, the Ladie which he brought with him is of high estate, for you shall vnderstand that she is a great Ladie and a quÃ©ene. The Emperour whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he heard this, he looked about for her, and sawe her in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the hall verie sore afflicted, and commaunded that shÃ©e should be carried with great honour and reuerence whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empres was, &amp; with great anger he returned vnto <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donio</hi> and said: I will sÃ©e how farre the power will, extend of this diuell, for that he shall not haue thÃ©e, neither his Ladie, till such time as I haue him in my power. All that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour sayd was heard by a brother of <hi>Clarentinas,</hi> who was called <hi>Laurentino,</hi> that came vnto the court that present day, &amp; being verie much moued, he said: Your highnesse doth very ill in intreating my sister so euill, is this the rewarde for the great seruice which I &amp; my father haue done for you, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for to destroy &amp; kill him, who respecting our honour, doth put his person in aduenture to deliuer my sister from that false accusation laide against her, and the other which came in his companie thou hast put in prison, and not content
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:13973:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hÃ©erewith, but dost kÃ©epe in thy power from him a Ladie and his Page, it shoulde suffice thÃ©e to knowe who they are, and the highnesse of their linage, and not in such sort to doe them wrong, my Lord, moderate your selfe and doe iustice, for that hetherto you haue bene a friend in dooing iustice and right, &amp; doe not blemish this daie with thy great pride the high fame which in so manie yeares thou hast gotten. The Emperour who was blind &amp; ouercome with anger, &amp; verie wrathfull he sayd: Get thÃ©e hence in an euill houre vnto thy lodging, for that thy sister shall neither winne nor loose for thy speach. This valiant young man did answere: For that you are my Emperour &amp; Lord you may intreat me in this order, but if that reason did now gouerne your breast, you would do more iustice then by your outward shewe you doe meane to doe, therefore now I doe saie, let them take hÃ©ede who is in the fault, for that with my person and goods I doe determine to make my defence, and to aide and succour him, who for my sister doth put his life in adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ture. And in saying these words he departed out of the great hall, leauing the Emperour full of cholar and wrath, who commaunded to burie the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and <hi>Polio</hi> with great honour. His death was verie sore lamented of many, for that he was wel beloued of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court. Then they gaue the Emperour to vnderstand how that the knight whom he had in prison was sonne vnto the Duke of <hi>Bauiera,</hi> for the which he receiued great griefe, for that he was sonne vnto one of the mightyest Lordes that was in all <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> his power was so greate, that hÃ©e and the power of <hi>Laurentino</hi> were able to maintaine warres agaynst the Emperour. So considering all things, the Emperour in his owne person went and tooke the Knight out of prison, of whome he vnderstoode all that happened in the Castell of the Rocke, and likewise the truth of the treason of <hi>Firide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonte,</hi> and bÃ©eing in this communication, they hearde in the Court a greate rumour, and going to sÃ©e what was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thereof, they sawe that there was brought two dead Knightes vppon two horses, and hadde on eyther of them a meruailous greate and cruell wound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then all the rest which remained, when they sawe so great slaughter, trusting more vnto the lightnesse of theyr Horses, then vnto the strength of their armes, determined to flye. But the Knight of the Braunch perceiuing it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a very light beast, put himselfe betwixt them and theyr waye, saying: If you will not receiue the death, staye, and doo that which I will tell you, and I will let you goe at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie:

               <p>The Emperour, who was very attentiue, and hearkened

vnto the Embassage sent with so great pride, was in a maze, and greatly meruailed in such sort that he could not speake, but when he came vnto himselfe, he sayd. Oh God, and what may this be, that ther is so much power and strength in this one Knight, that within my kingdome, yea, within my pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, he doth these actes without feare, and with this yre hÃ©e tooke <hi>Florisarte,</hi> by the hande and entred into his chamber whereas betwixt them there was very much a doo, with hold and keepe. So when he was wel aduertised who the knight and the Lady were, he was fully determined to set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Clarentina,</hi> and <hi>Macedonio,</hi> and to send them vnto the Knight, ioyntly with the Lady, &amp; that <hi>Florisarte</hi> shuld beare them company, till such time as they had deliuered them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Knight, and that they shuld of his part request him to remaine in the Court, for that therewith he shoulde receiue great contentment: so according vnto the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement <hi>Florisarte</hi> went, and in his company <hi>Laurenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> who when he saw his sister clÃ©ere of so great euill was very ioyfufull.

Likewise we doo pray and desire your highnesse of our part to performe the same. The Emperour did straight graunt vnto all their request, &amp; as the yre and wrath did loose their superioritie ouer him, he showed himselfe to be very sorrowfull, to haue lost out of his court so valiant a Knight. Then <hi>Laurentino</hi> did impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate his sister for to aske license of the Emperour for to returne vnto <hi>Tirol,</hi> the which was graunted them: so they carried in their companye the <hi>Bauiero,</hi> and passing through <hi>Augusta,</hi> they came vnto <hi>Minique,</hi> whereas they remained a time with great feasts and triumphs. And when they saw that it was time to depart, they tooke their way to <hi>Espruch,</hi> a Citie of the Earledome of <hi>Tirol</hi>: and passing ouer the <hi>Alpes,</hi> they were taken prisoners by a mightie Giaunt, and twentie armed knights vpon such a sodaine, that they could not make any defence: but all their company were slaine<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> &amp; the rest prisoners, as the two knights. <hi>Florisarte</hi> and <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,</hi> and the Lady his sister.

The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy put her selfe farther into the orchard, and in this sort, they
<pb facs="tcp:13973:314"/>
passed away the night, till the morning came. At which time there chaunced an aduenture, which for to declare in order, I must returne vnto the Knight of the Sunne, whereas wee lefte him, and as you haue hearde, he was beholding the ceremonies of the Princes <hi>Tigliafa,</hi> which she vsed ouer the body of <hi>Zoylo,</hi> vpon her knÃ©es with a sorrowfull lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Knight of the Sunne the better to vnderstand what she sayd, pulled off his helme, and then he heard that she said as followeth.</p>
               <p>I doo not know wherfore I doo loose so much time in this sorrowfull lamentation, for that it is not sufficient for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me from the sorrow and griefe, which continuallye I am afflicted with. Uery heauie I am for thÃ©e my <hi>Zoylo,</hi> &amp; being without thy company, I knewe not how I liue. It were better for me at once to ende my sorrow, procuring w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my owne hands, to goe and beare thÃ©e company. Oh sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lady, how dost thou liue without thy welbeloued? How dost thou sustaine thy self, without thy life? That day in the which thou didst lose him, that daye it had happened well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, if thou hadst lost thine owne life: but in the end wil come an end, that thou shalt goe to sÃ©eke him, in giuing thy selfe cruell death.</p>
               <p>And with this she made an ende of her lamentation, for that lifting vp her eyes, she saw how the two knights were very attentiue vnto that which she said. And giuing a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and grieuous sigh, she arose vp in great hast, and entered into the chamber whereas she came foorth, and with greate wrath she shut the doore, making within the chamber, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous lamentations. The Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> went the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to see if he coulde open the doore, but he found it verye fast shut, as one who had the Fortresse made by the wise <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> and so likewise did he bring that monster for to keepe her, that she might be troubled of no body. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Alphebo</hi> sÃ©eing that his calling was in vaine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted and went out w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his company, and mounting vppon theyr Beastes they did prosecute theyr iourney. So all the rest of the daye almost they trauayled in the same Forrest,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:315"/>
And when it was towards night, they founde themselues in the broad and beaten way of <hi>Pyreo,</hi> which went vnto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> of the which they were very ioyfull: and he did determine to goe vnto the Emperour his father for to kisse his hands, and so they directed their waye vnto <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> They had not ridden long, when that they hearde a great noyse of hunters which followed their game, and they came towards the place where as they wer, for that the night drew on: and they vnderstood by some of the huntsmen, that the Emperour was in that hunt, who for his recreation at that time came forth, and had in his company the Empresse, and the faire <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who was very sorrowful for the absence of <hi>Rosicleer.</hi> When the Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> knew that they were there, he went vnto their tents, and there did not lack them which did aduertise the Emperour and the Empresse, who with much ioye went out to receiue him, as he would haue entred. And when <hi>Alphebo</hi> was before her, he fel down vpon his knÃ©es: then the Empresse with teares of great ioy did imbrace him, and spake words of maternall loue. Then was he receiued of the faire <hi>Oliuia,</hi> and of all the Princes &amp; Ladyes that were there. Likewise they receiued and gaue great intertainment vnto the King of <hi>Sardenia,</hi> for that hÃ©e was welbeloued of them al, from the time that he made bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile with the Giant in the Emperiall Pallaice. And being in this pleasure the Emperour came with as much spÃ©ede as he could, and there beganne a newe the welcomming of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo</hi> and the king, with so much ioye and pleasure vnto al, that I cannot expresse it. So there they passed that night till the morning, and when all things was put in order, they heard diuine seruice, and went to breakfast, with pretence to retourne againe vnto their hunting. So when they were a taking vp of the tables, they heard a great rumour of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, and of the running and coursing of horses. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Alphebo</hi> arose from the Table, and putting on his helme, he went out of the Tent, whereas he found in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse his horse, and with great lightnesse he mounted on him, and rode towards the place from whence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noyse came,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:13973:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and vpon a sodaine he sawe come riding two knightes, and after them followed one knight of a meruailous disposition, with Purple armour all to be spotted with starres of golde, likewise his shÃ©eld was purple, vpon the which was put for the deuice a knight who sÃ©emed to haue the same deuice, his eyes shut by reason that certaine Sunne beames did strike on them, the which sÃ©emed to procÃ©ede out of the face of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knight. This Purple knight brought his sword in his hand all naked, in manner as though he would strike y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other two which ranne awaie. The Emperour <hi>Alfebo</hi> did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the two knights for their running awaie, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before them. At this instant we must leaue the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and his knights, for to returne vnto the Pastor <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano,</hi> whom we left with his swÃ©ete musicke, and his Lute in his hand, compassed round about with a companie of shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, hauing her before him, whose beautie did make him to disguise himselfe in that base apparell, and she was set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the grÃ©ene grasse, whereas she might with good attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heare the delicate swÃ©etnesse of this new shepheards mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke. Also all the rest of the shepheards had no small admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as well therat, as at the sweet melodie he vsed in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at sundrie-times he sent forth dÃ©epe sighs, so that it made all the shepheards hearts to melt, and the verie birdes which did flie in the forrest did staye &amp; were astonied at his swÃ©ete musicke. So when he was wearie of playing &amp; sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the amorous sight of the <hi>Pastora</hi> did graunt him no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lisence, but that with a fewe teares he cast downe his humbled eies, and began to wring his hands.

This is the <hi>Pastora</hi> that hath all these valleyes full of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous fire of loue, and looke in how so much Nature hath indued her with beautie and fairenesse: euen so great a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie hath she accompanied with her crueltie, that there is no shepheard that can suffer it.

               <p>Ah <hi>Filepensio,</hi> I sÃ©e nowe that thou art a new louer, and yet by beholding thÃ©e thou sÃ©emest to bÃ©e an olde louer. This new shepheard would haue made him answere, but he was cut off by a heauie noise which he heard amongest the trÃ©es, which seemed to be of the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and crying out with more vehemencie, he heard that it were shrikes of the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and <hi>Galismena,</hi> which being heard by the shepheards, with great alteration they ranne that waie whereas the noise was, &amp; by reason that in lightnesse and loue this new shepheard did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cÃ©ede all the rest, he was the first that came vnto the place, and

sawe that there was a Gyant, and with him a well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned knight, who had fast hold of the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and with the point of his sword pricked the hands of <hi>Galismena</hi> to make her let goe her holde, for that she imbraced the <hi>Pastora</hi> in her armes with great strength.

with great lightnesse he put himselfe on the one side, so that he stroke his blowe in vaine, and because his <hi>Pastora</hi> should sÃ©e the great strength and force of his armes, hÃ©e tooke the sworde fast in his hande and firmed himselfe on the ground and stroke the Gyaunt on the wast on his left side, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his armour had bÃ©ene made of harde and fine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, it had not bÃ©ene able to haue made resistance against the furie of that great and mightie blowe, which was in such sorte, that the Gyaunt was cut a sunder in the middest, so that the one halfe fell on the one side and the other on the other side. All the Shepheards that were there present were verie much amazed, and lykewise the <hi>Pastoras,</hi> to sÃ©e howe the newe shephearde at two blowes had ouerthrowen two such knightes as they were. The <hi>Pastora</hi> when shÃ©e sawe her selfe clÃ©ere from that perill, went vnto <hi>Filipensio</hi> for to imbrace him, and with amorous wordes she said.

               <p>Oh Goddesse of all beautie and fairenesse, wherewith can I gratifie the God <hi>Pan,</hi> for the great force and strength which he gaue mÃ©e at this present? What sacrifice can I make, to paie this benefite and ioye that I doe fÃ©ele, in hauing this my shepheards bodie imbraced and compassed about, with these delicate armes. This great force and strength I maye attribute vnto you my swÃ©ete <hi>Pastora,</hi> for that by your fayre sight my small strength did the more augment, which was the occasion that I deserue so greate fauour.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:13973:317"/>
seruice which this shepheard doth desire to doe vnto me. At this time the knight that was without remembraunce was come vnto himselfe againe, &amp; put himselfe on foote, the which when <hi>Filepensio</hi> sawe, he ceased his communication, &amp; ranne vnto him with a wrathfull furie, and before that he coulde well settle himselfe, he laide holde vppon his healme with so great strength, that he pulled it from his head, breaking all the buckles and lacings, and when they saw the knight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his healme, he was knowen of all the shepheards to bÃ©e the shepheard called <hi>Tarsides.</hi> Then <hi>Alphesiuio</hi> went vnto <hi>Filepensio,</hi> and requested that he would mittigate his ire, the which this new shepheard did at his request, leauing to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a terrible blow which he had all aloft for to strike him. What shall I saye vnto you of this Knight, when hÃ©e sawe himselfe ouercome of one alone shepheard, belÃ©euing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Knightes had not bene able to haue done it, but looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to see where his companion was, and sawe him deade with so terrible a blow, he could not but with great sorrowe saie: Oh ye Gods come downe all together and doe obedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto this <hi>Pastora,</hi> for that she doth better deserue it then all you, whose beautie hath so much force, that it incouraged one shepheard to doe that which a thousand knightes durst not haue giuen the enterprise off. Oh God <hi>Pan</hi> howe hath thy power extended this daie farre beyond the power of all other Gods, that thou diddest permit thus to be slaine so mightie a king. Ah <hi>Cayserlinga,</hi> no <hi>Pastora,</hi> but a Goddesse, that onely doest not bring in subiection the shepheardes, but also the high and mightie kings. Thou shalt vnderstande <hi>Pastora,</hi> that amongest them which doth beare thee companie is the Prince of <hi>Britania</hi> in disguised apparayle, and I am that vnhappie prince of <hi>Polismago,</hi> and he most vnfortunate whome this shepheard hath slaine, was the King of <hi>Sily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> agaynst whome the Gods hath shewed themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. All this he sayde with great teares which came from his heart, accompanied with terrible sighes. The <hi>Pastora</hi> without anie shewe of pittie she hadde of that Knight, arose from the place whereas she was, and with a gracious
<pb facs="tcp:13973:318"/>

These shepheards spÃ©edely arose vp and went to sÃ©e what it was, and they found <hi>Galismena</hi> who cryed out vnto the Gods, and when she sawe <hi>Filipensio</hi> shÃ©e sayd: Ah good shepheard minne and giue succour, for that the <hi>Pastora</hi> is carried awaie prisoner by the Prince of <hi>Polisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> against her will.

These high words was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that the shepheard came vnto himselfe againe, &amp; lyke vnto an arrow out of a bow he followed the way after them, till such time as he came into a broad high waie, whereas he
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:13973:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did discouer the new foot steps of his horse, by which he knew that he was rode that waie, and with great lightnesse he did prosecute his iourney, til such time as he came to <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> and when he sawe the small remedie that he had to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for that he was on foote, he determined to enter into the citie, and looked backe to sÃ©e if anie of the shepheardes did follow him, and he sawe none but <hi>Coridon</hi> that did followe him, and tarrying for him he sayd: Ah shepheard what shall we doe without our delight, follow me if it be thy pleasure, and let vs procure to restore againe our losse, which is our <hi>Pastora.</hi> For hÃ©ere I doe sweare vnto thÃ©e by the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Iupiter,</hi> neuer to retourne vnto the riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> without the faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> and without anie more tarrying they entered into <hi>Ierosolima,</hi> not staying till they came vnto the Pallaice, and the first that he met with was with <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> whom he commaunded to goe and declare vnto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his comming, who did verie much meruaile when that <hi>Fidelio</hi> did tell her, for that he returned in so short time, and she went out of her chamber and did receiue him with great ioye and pleasure, saying: What quicke returne is this that you haue made, valiant and excellent knight: Uerie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and sorrowfull sayd the Prince, for that good Ladie you shall vnderstand, my <hi>Pastora</hi> is robbed and carried awaye from me, and I am not able to make anie defence.

                  <hi>Coridon</hi> can remaine aliue onely with his bodie, for that my soule is absented and gone after my <hi>Pastora.</hi> With manye teares the shepheard said these words. The Prince sÃ©eing that the detracting of time was perillous, tooke his leaue of the Princesse, and found his horse in a readinesse, and with great lightnesse he mounted vpon him, so likewise his Squire and <hi>Coridon</hi> mounted vpon verie good horses, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princesse commaunded to be giuen them, &amp; with great hast they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the citie, and tooke their iourney into a broad high waie, and at such time as the Sun had couered all the earth, they met with a labouring man who was comming from his accustomed worke in the field, of whom thy asked newes of their <hi>Pastora,</hi> but he could tell them none, but he sayd, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight he hearde certaine lamentations made by a woman, but he knew not the occasion wherefore. So straight way he thought what it might be, which was the occasion that they made the more hast in trauailing, with great feare least they should loose her: So all that daie they trauayled, and rode through <hi>Damasco,</hi> and left the riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> this knight trauailed with great sorrow for the small newes that he heard of his <hi>Pastora,</hi> and the anger was verie great of the Prince, for that he was so carelesse, in such sorte, that neither <hi>Coridon</hi> nor <hi>Fidelio</hi> durst speake a worde vnto him, and diuerse times lifting vp his eyes vnto heauen, with an heauie voice he said: Oh high and mightie God <hi>Iupiter,</hi> how is it possible that I hauing done my duetie vnto thy Deitie in all respects, and almost vsing a quotidian sacrifice, thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est yet suffer thy power to bÃ©e contrarie vnto me in this, giue me now some light to happe on that waie by which that traitour and disloyall knight doth carrie the Goddesse of all shepheardes, that I maye deliuer her, that shee be not scorned nor ill intreated of that false knight: Oh <hi>Diana,</hi> chast God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse, hide thy breast, and send some kÃ©eper of thine to defende her, let that reuenger <hi>Camilia</hi> be her garde, and with her Bowe send a sharpe arrowe to passe through the heart of him that doth all this euill. In this sorte with greate anger the Prince trauailed, and the thirde daie of his iourney, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:13973:319" rendition="simple:additions"/>
early in the morning he sawe vppon a rocke a verie faire and great castell which sÃ©emed to be verie strong. The Prince determined to goe thether, he had not trauailed long when he came into another greate and broade waie, in the which there was a man which came towardes them, &amp; when he drew nigh, they asked of him if he coulde tell anie newes of the <hi>Pastora.</hi> The man lift vp his eies and sÃ©eing the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him that demaunded the question, he saide: For thy profit sir knight, for that thou sÃ©emest vnto me to be of esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I will not tell thÃ©e thy demaund. The valiant knight with more humilitie then his passionate heart would abide, desired him to giue him to vnderstand if he knew anie thing of her. The man said: Sir knight, I knowe not wherefore you will know of that thing, that by sÃ©eking of remedie for her deliuerie, will procure thy selfe death. Notwithstanding sÃ©eing that with so great courtesie you doe request me, I will tell you, although it were better for you not to knowe it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse you shall vnderstande that yesternight a knight brought her vnto yonder Castell which you sÃ©e before you, &amp; put her vnder so strong kÃ©eping, that there is no power able to deliuer her, except the power of the high Gods. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment was great that the Prince receiued when he heard newes of her, the which he so much desired, and giuing great thankes vnto the man, he went towards the Castle, &amp; when he came thether, he found the drawe bridge downe, and the gate open, and no gard there to kÃ©epe it. And without all feare, he entered in at the gate, and left <hi>Coridon</hi> and <hi>Fidelio</hi> without. And being within, he came into a very great and broad Court, the which was paued with very faire and wel wrought stones, and the walls were full of windowes with yron grates very faire, but he saw no body: and discouering a broad and well made paire of staires, he alighted from his horse, and went vp, and being halfe waye vp, ther was a dore open, and looking in thereat, he sawe it was a greate Hall, and that verye darke, sauing at the farther ende thereof, there was a little louer hole, which gaue a small light, wher by he perceiued a little dore, which sÃ©emed to be at the foote
<pb facs="tcp:13973:320"/>
of a payre of winding staires, at which dore the knight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and went vp the staires. And when he came aloft, hÃ©e entred into very great and broad chambers all furnished w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beds, and it sÃ©emed to be a place for the houshold seruaunts, and going from thence he entred into a very faire hall, in the which was a well wrought windowe, and looking out ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he sawe that it was ouer the gate of that ill kept Castle, by which he entered, and looking for <hi>Coridon</hi> and <hi>Fidelio,</hi> he could not sÃ©e them, but belÃ©eued that they had put themselues apart in some place because they would not be sÃ©ene. Then this valiant knight looking downe againe to the gate, sawe a mightie great Gyant of a huge stature, who called with a great loude voice and sayde: Runne quickly and sÃ©eke out that bolde knight, who without anie lisence entered into the Castell, and put him into the most cruellest prison in all the house. These wordes caused little feare in the knight, but rather going from the windowe he went out of the hall, where was a payre of stayres, and as he beganne to descend downe by them, he sawe comming vp thereat in great hast fiue armed knightes, and after them eight clownes, who sÃ©<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be the knight they sought, with theyr swordes drawne verie rigorously they did assault him. This valyant warriour drew out his sword, and stroke two of them two such terrible blowes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made their heads to tumble downe the stayres, and in the fall of them they chaunced to hit two of the clownes, that they made them to fall backwards vpon the stayres, but his furie stayed not in this, but he stroke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knight such a blowe, that he ouerthrewe him deade the same waye, the other two knightes which remained sÃ©eing that slaughter so quickly done, they put themselues the one on the one side of the stayres, and the other on the other, and hauing theyr shÃ©eldes before them they layde on the Knight with great and thicke blowes, but by reason of the desire which the knight had to sÃ©e his <hi>Pastora,</hi> and being very much troubled therewith, hÃ©e determined with spÃ©ede to clÃ©ere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of those two knightes, and therewith he stroke at each
<pb facs="tcp:13973:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them a mightie blow and sent them with the rest downe the stayres, the like did he vnto foure of the clownes that were so hardie as to assault him, the other with a great noise ranne downe the stayres, this valyant knight hasted downe the stayres after them till he came into a great court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he found the Gyant vnarmed, with a shÃ©elde on his arme, and a great broade fauchen in his hande. The knight made shew vnto him that he woulde not fight nor strike him, but put his sworde vp into his sheath, and said: Holde thy hand Gyaunt and strike not, but put on thy armour for to make thy defence, for this vnderstande of a truth, that I will not drawe out my sword so long as thou art vnarmed. The Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt when he sawe howe lyttle hÃ©e did estÃ©eme him, stoode still and did beholde him, and noted the greate riches of his armour, and by the deuice of his shÃ©elde he knewe him to be the knight that wonne the prise and honour in the iustes at <hi>Nabatea,</hi> for you shall vnderstande that all these Gyauntes were of the kingdome of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and the king thereof if you remember was the first with whome the knight did iust, which in that triumph was ouerthrowen, when that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge that quarrell came forth a brother of his, who by the strength of the arme of this knight was slaine, and the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt which he slewe by the riuer of <hi>Euphrates</hi> was the king of <hi>Cilicia</hi> himselfe (the occasion of his comming and who all the rest were shall more at large appeare in the processe of the historie.) When the Gyaunt knewe him, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish countenaunce he sayde: Tell me knight, by fortune art thou that famous warriour, who in the iustes of <hi>Naba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea</hi> (as hath bÃ©ene tolde me) carried awaye all the honour and praise, and ouerthrewe the king of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to whome the Gods did shew themselues enimies, and the same which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise slew his brother, if there be anie curtesie in thÃ©e I desire thÃ©e to tell me.</p>
               <p>This valiant Prince aunswered and said: I do not know to what end thou doest aske it of me, but let it be for what it shall be, thou shalt vnderstand that I am the same that thou
<pb facs="tcp:13973:321"/>
didst speake off. And for that thou shalt be the better certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of this, thou shalt vnderstand that I am he, who in shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards apparaile, onely with my shepheardes crooke, at one blow brought that traitor the Prince of <hi>Polismago</hi> to the ground without remembraunce, and likewise with another blow with the sword of the said Prince, I slew the King of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> and am the same who will doo the like with thÃ©e, if thou dost not deliuer vnto me that faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> who was brought hether by force, by that naughtie Prince of <hi>Polis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mago.</hi> The Giant was very sorrowfull for that which hÃ©e heard, and showed by his countenaunce to be very wrathful. At that time there descended downe the staires another Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who with a furious voyce sayd vnto the first Gyaunt: Brother put thy selfe apart on the one side, and let mÃ©e take reuengement of this vile Knight, that is before thÃ©e: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out speaking any more words, he lift vp his great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie fawchon, and stroke a mightie blow at the Knight, but this pollitike Knight stepped with great lightnesse on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side, which was the occasion that his blow fell downe vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pauement in vain: this terrible blow was no sooner down, when the Knight closed with him, and stroke him with his sword so mightie a blow vpon the right arme, that he cut it cleane a sunder, and it fell downe to the ground, sword and al. The Giant when he saw himselfe so wounded, gaue a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible shrike, and threw his shield from him, and would haue taken the sword in his other hand: but the Prince woulde not suffer it, but stroke him another blow on the same arme, and euen as he did by the other, he cut it a sunder by the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow: so that he was lame of both his armes. Yet for all this, the giant did not loose his furie, but roaring like a Lion, he opened the stumpes of his armes which did remain, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with them to imbrace the Knight, and by his greate force to ouerthrowe him. As he he laboured to enter in, the Knight put the poynt of his sword before him, in such sorte, that what with the strength and furie of the Giant, and the force that he put therevnto, the sword passed through his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that he fell downe dead to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>At this time, there descended downe the staires in great hast a Knight of a mightie proportion, whom <hi>Claridiano</hi> knew to be the Prince of <hi>Polismago.</hi> This GrÃ©ek Knight receiued great delyght at the sight of him. Then the Prince of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismago</hi> said: Thou peruerse dogge, come and take reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, for the griefe and wrong which thou doost publish hÃ©ere to haue receiued: for I am the Prince whom thou dost seeke for: and in saying these words, he did assault him with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blowes. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> did returne vnto him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like, but not in so terrible a sort as he might, for the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion that he had of him, considering that the pangs of loue cause a man to doe that sometimes, which afterward he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth repent himselfe off. So hÃ©ere betwixt them began a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and well foughten battaile, the one striking the other, on all parts, great and terrible blowes. In this sort they indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a while without knowing any aduauauntage betwixte them, the occasion was, for that the GrÃ©eke woulde not vse the rigor of all his strength. And bÃ©eing in this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, the GrÃ©eke lifte vp his eyes, and sawe at a windowe the faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> who was beholding them in their battaile: at which sight he receiued so great plesure and delyght, that the strength of his armes did faile him, and he had no more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to lifte them vp. When the Pagan saw that, he did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault him with more courage: the GrÃ©eke had no power, but onely to beare off the blowes, and recoyled till such time as he came right vnder the window: which made the Pagan to thinke that he was ouercome, and that he had got the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. At that time the other Giant was very well armed, &amp; went vnto the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and tooke her by the haire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, and pulled her from the window, and sayd: Apart thy selfe from that place, thou which art the cause of all this euill, for that thou shalt not content thy selfe in sÃ©eing him, who do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth procure thy libertie, although it be impossible: and I do sweare vnto thÃ©e by my Gods, that the great damage which thy nicenesse hath caused, thy head shall paye for. Oh howe wrathfull this GrÃ©eke was, when he saw the Giant intreat her so euill, for a giuing a terrible shrike he lift vp his right

arme with his sworde, and stroke at the Pagan so mightie a blowe vpon his healme (so that if it had not bene inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) he had cut it in two pÃ©eces, and put the head in great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, but yet he escaped not but he sell downe to the grounde without anie remembraunce, and there ranne out of his mouth great abundance of bloud. When <hi>Claridiano</hi> sawe him in this plight, he made no more reckoning of him, but with a furyous hast he went to goe vp the stayres, at such time as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant came downe with great violence, but when the sonne of <hi>Gran Alfebo</hi> sawe him he returned and did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his comming in the court, and sayd: Make an end thou great beast, and descend downe that I may giue thÃ©e thy pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thy boldnesse which thou hast vsed against the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of <hi>Pastoras.</hi> The Gyant with the great furie which he had vnderstood not what the knight had sayde, and therefore he made him no aunswere, and if that he woulde haue done it, yet his great wrath woulde not consent vnto it, but with his Fauchon all aloft he went towards the GrÃ©eke, assalting him with mortall battaile. The like did this strong knight, making betwixt them a terrible battaile, and striking the one the other where they thought to do most hurt. Who had then seene the great lightnesse of the GrÃ©eke in besturring himselfe, would haue well iudged that the worst part should not be his, for that he so handled his enimie in breaking of his harnesse in many places, and wounding him, in such sort, that he was all to be bathed in bloud, yet for all that the great anger which he had, neither the rigorous battaile could cause him to withdrawe the casting vp of his eyes vnto the place whereas he saw his welbeloued <hi>Pastora,</hi> and he beheld her making her greate lamentation for that which the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant had done vnto her, which was the occasion that he had a greater desire to giue him (who was the occasion of her teares) his payment. At this time the Prince <hi>Polismago</hi> was come againe vnto himselfe, and arose vppon his feete, and sawe the cruell battaile which was betwÃ©ene the Gyant and the Knight, and howe that the knight almost ouercome the Gyant, he did determine to forget that which he was bound

vnto bÃ©eing a Prince, and recouering his sword which hung by the wrist band, he went and ioyned with the Gyaunt, so that both of them together did assalt him, which did nothing grieue the Gyaunt for that he was somewhat wearie. The villanie which he sawe them vse did increase his wrath, and double his strength in such sorte, that it fell out worse for them being both together then before, for that the vilenesse of their assaulting made him to double his blowes, striking now mightely at the one, and then as terribly on the other, with very great power &amp; strength, procuring to indamage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> And for that he dealt with two such valiant knights, it stood him in hand to vse all kinde of pollicie: but yet he could not so at libertie defend himselfe, but that the giant watched his time, and stroke him so furious a blow vpon his steely helm, that he made him to boow with both his knÃ©es to the ground The Prince of <hi>Polismago</hi> seeing him at that poynt, doubled his blowes vpon him very terribly: but in spite of them, he arose vp againe with more fury then a baighted bull, &amp; with his sword fast in his hand, he pressed to the Giant, &amp; stroke him so mortall a blow vpon his shoulder, that he cloue him downe to the waste, cutting harnesse and bones, and with great facilitie ouerthrewe him dead to the ground. He had not so soone giuen that wonderfull blowe, but he retourned another at the Pagan, vppon his inchaunted healme, that he made it sounde lyke vnto a Bell. The which blowe was so mightie that it ouerthrew him downe to the ground, throwing out at his Beauer verye great aboundaunce of bloud</p>
               <p>Who coulde hÃ©ere declare the greate ioye which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stora</hi> receiued when she sawe her enimies in that plight, I I cannot iudge which had the greater ioye, the knight in that he had set her at libertie, or the <hi>Pastora</hi> so sÃ©e her selfe at libertie. So when the knight sawe the Pagan on the ground without remembraunce, he made no more tarrying, but went vp the staires, and stayed not till he came where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Pastora</hi> was. And when he sawe her, he fell
<pb facs="tcp:13973:323"/>
downe vpon his knÃ©es, and lift vp his beuer, which was the occasion that the <hi>Pastora</hi> did know him, and not suffering him to speake, with an excellent grace she sayd. Ah <hi>Filipensio</hi> how much am I bound vnto the Gods, that haue deliuered me from two so great daungers, and set me at libertie from the troubles thereof. Where hast thou lefte thy shepheards apparaile? Who hath chaunged them, for this faire &amp; strong armour, where hast thou lefte thy shepheards crooke. Ah <hi>Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensio,</hi> giue me to vnderstand of thy high estate, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my small vnderstanding be not the occasion that I fall in some errour. The valyant Knight being subiect to her beautie, saide vnto her: I am yours faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> whether I be a shepheard or a Knight, your beautie hath brought me in subection, and it is great glory vnto me to be yÃ©elded vnto you.</p>
               <p>Then the faire <hi>Pastora</hi> at these wordes tooke him faste by both the hands, and not giuing him place to any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, she sayd. I will now sÃ©e, whether you are as valyant in dÃ©eds as in words, sÃ©eing that fortune hath brought vs he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and hÃ©ere I doo aske of thÃ©e two things to be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto me, and it is the first that euer I asked of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in all the world. The amorous Prince aunswered. Ah my swÃ©ete Mistresse, is it possible that I haue deserued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue at your hands so much fauour, in that you doo aske of me any thing, wherin I may or can doo you seruice, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I am yours, you nÃ©ede not to aske but commaunde me as your owne, for that I am bound to whatsoeuer you will. The faire <hi>Pastora</hi> sayd. Wel gentle knight, sÃ©eing that thou dost shew thy selfe to be so subiect and bound to do me pleasure, the first thing that I doo request thÃ©e to graunt me, is, that thou cary me vnto <hi>Grecia</hi> vnto the Emperors court, and there for the space of one moneth to make my defence, &amp; affirme, that my beautie doeth surmount all others in the world. Now maist thou goe and set at libertie <hi>Coridon</hi> and thy seruaunt, who are both in prison. The GrÃ©eke had great contentment of that which the <hi>Pastora</hi> did aske of him: and for to performe that which she had commaunded, he went &amp; sought throughout all the Castle, to sÃ©e if he could finde anye
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:13973:323"/>
that could giue anie knowledge where his companie was, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming vnto a doore he heard a great noise of much people, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince knocked at the doore and bad them open it, &amp; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doe them no harme if they would open the doore. So straight way it was open, whereas he demaunded for <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and his Squire, they were straight waye brought vnto him by one of them which opened the doore, and in the meane time it was tolde him who the Gyants were, you shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that they were nephewes vnto the king of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and vnto the Prince of <hi>Polismago,</hi> who being in loue with the <hi>Pastora,</hi> and being of her cast off, he went and told it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> then they consented together to doe all that you haue heard, and had gone through with their intent if it had not bene for the valour of the Prince <hi>Claridiano.</hi> So when <hi>Coridon</hi> came before the <hi>Pastora</hi> he could not refrain from wÃ©eping, with the great ioy which he receiued at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight of her, and the <hi>Pastora</hi> was no lesse ioyfull. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> remembred the Prince <hi>Polismago,</hi> &amp; commaunded <hi>Fidelio</hi> to sÃ©e whether he were aliue or dead, who went, and when hÃ©e came vnto him, he pulled off his helme and saw that he was dead, for the which it greatly grÃ©eued the knight, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare was so great of <hi>Cayserlinga</hi> for remaining in the castle, that she made great hast to the Prince to depart from thence. The which he was constrained to do for to giue her contentment, and commaunded to make readie their horses and likewise a palfray which they found in the castell. So the next day in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning they tooke their way towards <hi>Grecia,</hi> passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all the kingdome of <hi>Media,</hi> and the kingdome of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopoli,</hi> and all the way that he trauailed he left behinde great fame of wonderful aduentures which happened.

So the second day that they trauailed by that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by reason that it was so fragrant, they lost their waie, in such sort, that when they remembred themselues, they wer entered into the thickest of the wildernesse, and procured to finde the waie againe, which by no meanes they coulde, for that they were so farre entered into the thicket. So with great trouble they trauailed till mid daie, at which time they heard a noise of the running of water, the which they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; it was the occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they brought themselues out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thick wood, and came into a mightie great plaine, through the midst of the which there passed a dÃ©epe riuer. There they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked about them to sÃ©e if they coulde discouer any towne, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, or dwelling places, but they could sÃ©e no other thing but high and mightie Pine trÃ©es, the which grÃ©eued much the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stora,</hi> &amp; much more the GrÃ©eke, for that the <hi>Pastora</hi> should be so sorrowfull, &amp; againe, for that they had no victualls to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her. So they staied a while not knowing which way they might take to bring themselues out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> distresse, but vppon a sodaine they espied towards their right hande a man who trauailed a foot, being somwhat farre off from them, that they could not discerne what he should be. So in greate hast they went towards him, and comming nigh him, they sawe that it was an olde man, who had his head and beard very white, by reason of his great age, and the better for to trauaile, hÃ©e hadde a staffe whereon he might leaue, shewing that he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with greate paine, in that he mooued himselfe so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily. Then came vnto the Princes remembraunce the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that the furious beast did aske him in the inchanted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the king of <hi>Arabia.</hi> So when they came vnto the olde

man, they saluted him, the olde man returned their salutation with a faint and wearie voice. The Prince asked him what aduenture had brought him into that solitarie place. This olde man for to make him answere, was constrained to sit downe vpon the ground and sayd: Gentle knight, I knowe not what to saie, nor what I shall tell you, but onely my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie hath brought me into this misfortune, being mocked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great falsehood by a Page y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I brought with me, who left me all alone and on foote in this solitarie wildernesse. These two daies haue I not eaten any thing, but onely dronke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> with the which I haue borne out my hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the head of which riuer is not far from hence. And hÃ©ere I doe desire thÃ©e gentle knight, if thou hast anie pittie of this my wearie age, for to succour me, in carrying me vpon thy horse, or vpon the horse of anie of thy seruants. The Prince taking great pittie on the olde man, sayd: Feare not good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this thy misfortune, for sÃ©eing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fortune hath brought vs hether, I will not leaue thÃ©e alone in this solitarye place. The Prince leaped from his horse and tooke the olde man in his armes, and put him in the saddle, and helped to settle him well, that by reason of his weaknesse he might not fal, &amp; that he being well set he himselfe might y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better without all feare leap vp behind him. This false olde man sÃ©eing himselfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the horse, stroke him with his hÃ©eles, in so great hast, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made the horse to flie: Oh how the knight was amazed at this act, although he beleeued that he did it to make him go a little on foote, but when he sawe that his mocking proceeded forwards on, he returned that waie which his Squire came, calling out vnto him to bring his horse on the which he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, who in great hast accomplished his demaund. When the knight was on horsebacke, he began to call vnto the olde man for to tarrie. The which the olde man did till such time as he came nigh him, and with a great laughter he sayd. Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful knight, what dost thou thinke to recouer thy horse, and to giue me my payment for that I haue mocked thÃ©e? Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou so quickly loose the name to be pittifull. I doe not meane to loose it sayde the Knight, neither did I giue thÃ©e
<pb facs="tcp:13973:325"/>
my horse for to carrie thÃ©e alone, but both of vs, for it is a horse which can doe it verie well. I shall be counted for a more foole then thou said the olde man, hauing now oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to goe whether I list all alone, and being in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie I shall be constrained to goe whether thy pleasure is. The Prince hearing these wordes went by little and little towards the olde man, but he with a quicke course did apart himselfe from him, making with his mouth and eyes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing astonied said: Thou false olde villaine, more worse then the stinking Foxe, tarrie thou mocker of knights, and do not thinke that the lightnesse of thy horse shall deliuer thÃ©e out of my hands. The olde man shewed as though he esteemed lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his words and threatnings, but ran with the horse from one place vnto another, making a thousand gestures and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his mouth and eyes, which was euen death vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, who said: Oh Gods is it possible that you do permit that this naughtie olde man should thus scorne me with his iestures. <hi>Coridon</hi> and the <hi>Pastora</hi> came behinde, &amp; had great pastime to see how the knight was mocked and beguiled of an olde man, who sÃ©emed as though he could not moue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with age. With the great anger and rage that the prince had to see himselfe so mocked, he pricked his horse with the spurres for to ouertake the olde man, who was a good way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What is this my sonne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is all this furie, for thou doest well knowe that I came not for to cause in you anie anger. The Prince hearing this stayed his horse and did beholde him, and knewe him verye perfectly to be the king of <hi>Arginaria,</hi> and with greate haste hÃ©e alyghted from his horse, and the olde man dyd the like, and with great contentment they louingly imbraced one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then the knight sayd.</p>
               <p>Is it possible louing father that you doe thus misuse him that hath no other desire but to serue you, I doe promise you
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:13973:325"/>
that before I let you goe out of mine armes, to make you promise me to bring me out of this solitarie place, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of this trouble and anger which you haue caused mÃ©e to haue. I came for no other thing said <hi>Galtenor,</hi> for knowing the great trauaile which may happen in this place, &amp; againe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> griefe which thou hast for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouble of a faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> which thou bringest in thy companie, and knowing the great loue which bearest vnto her I did ordaine my comming hether, &amp; determined first to giue thÃ©e this intertainment, for that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I might of thÃ©e with more ioy be receiued. At this time drewe nÃ©ere the <hi>Pastora</hi> and <hi>Coridon,</hi> and <hi>Fidelio,</hi> and sÃ©eing them imbracing one an other they made the more hast on their waie, verie much meruailing to sÃ©e a crooke back and leane olde man to be turned vnto a great and faire Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, with a goodly long white beard, apparailed with rich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. The Prince turning vnto the <hi>Pastora,</hi> said: Faire <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stora,</hi> this noble king who is hÃ©ere present is king of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>Arginaria,</hi> my Lord and father, who vnderstanding by his art the great necessitie in the which we are, is come to put remedie therein. The king of <hi>Arginaria</hi> with an amorous heart and stedfast eyes without mouing them, he did behold the <hi>Pastora,</hi> remembring himselfe at that time of the young childe that he lost by the riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> &amp; straight waie he knew her to be the same, of the which he did not a little reioyce, but sÃ©eing that it was conuenient at that time to hold his peace, he did dissemble it, and kept the great ioy which he receiued for the finding of her in his heart, and retourning vnto the Prince, he said: I doe not now much meruaile faire knight, that thy heart is subiect to so fayre a creature, and I doe thinke my labour verie well bestowed, because that by my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming hether shall be taken awaie a great part of your trouble, which without all doubt you should haue had, &amp; bÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this maner talking, there appeared before them a horse loden with victualls, and straight waye they tooke order that they might eate, for that they had great nÃ©ede thereof. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there was raised a verie faire &amp; rich tent for to ease the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and they knew not which way nor how it was made,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:326"/>
and there they rested all that night, for that the king would not that they shoulde so soone departe from him, because hÃ©e would for a time recreate himself in their conuersation, &amp; told them of some things that shuld happen vnto them. So when the morning was come the Tent was taken awaie, &amp; they began to trauaile by a verie straight and narrow path. The King of <hi>Arginaria</hi> did leade them the waie, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to followe him, who woulde set them out of that wildernesse, and bring them vnto the sea of <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they shall finde all things necessarie for their new begun voyage, and bad them that they shoulde haue verie greate care, for bÃ©eing once in <hi>Grecia,</hi> there shall be ioyned together the nailes and pawes of two of the most furious Lyons that be in all the world, the one bringing the other in so great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that the better of them both cannot be iudged, neither acknowledge anie vauntage till such time as with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious furie be taken awaie the lockes which be vpon their crowned heads, and shall at that instant in a moment be set at libertie by the robber of his first ioy, making restitution of that which a long time hath bene vsurped, remaining one of them without griefe of the young Hinde, that he bringeth with him. When all this shall come to passe I will returne my sonne and see you. And in saying these wordes he vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed awaie, not sÃ©eing anie other thing but the horse which was laden with their victualls, which caused them to remain amazed at his sodaine departure, and yet verie much comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that he had sÃ©ene him: So they trauailed all that daie by a narow path. When night was come, without knowing by whom, the Tent was armed againe that they might rest themselues therein, when they were within and had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their horses to be put in, the doore of the tent did shut of it selfe with so great strength, that they could not open it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did make a proofe, for that <hi>Galtenor</hi> had so made it, because of a greate number of wilde beastes which were in those partes, and in the night time raungeth abroade for to sÃ©eke theyr prayes. So they passed that night with greate rest and ease, till the morning that the Tent doore did open,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:13973:326"/>
the Tent was taken vp and put vppon the horse, and all the rest, tooke their iourney presentlye following still that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe path till it was noone, at which time they came vnto the sea side, and harde by the place whereas they ariued, they sawe at an Anker a Barke meruailously well cauked and trimmed, made after the manner of a Serpent, with mightie wings and a long taile. The Prince when he saw the Barke made after that sorte, straight waie he vnderstoode that that was the Barke which the king of <hi>Arginaria</hi> had spoken of, and without anie more tarrying he commaunded his horse to be put in and all the rest, and he tooke the <hi>Pastora</hi> in his armes and put her into the Barke, they were no sooner within, but that with great swiftnesse she beganne to mooue her selfe, in such sorte that in a small time they were farre from the shoare. Thus they trauailed with great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the space of sixe dayes, and the seauenth daie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie earlye in the morning they were at the shoare verye nigh <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereas with great ioye and pleasure they went a lande, and mounting vppon their horses they entered into a verie geÃ©ene and delightfull Forrest, which stoode in their waie, and within a while they heard a greate noise of hunters, and towardes that way the Prince and his companie went, and in the way they trauailed, they rode by a fountaine, in the which there was to the number of eight knights verie well armed, and they were refreshing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The Prince for that they passed by somewhat out of the waie did not salute them, but passing on his waie with the faire <hi>Pastora,</hi> who followed him, vsing betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues verie swÃ©ete and amorous conuersation. The eight knightes when they sawe them so passe by, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues agrÃ©eued for the small reckoning he made of them, but in especiall one of them who was more proud and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous then the rest, without speaking anie worde at all, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on his healme, and cast his shÃ©elde at his necke, and bÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readie hÃ©e mounted vpon his horse, and tooke his Speare in his hande, which stoode hard by leaning against a frÃ©e, and with a verye reasonable pace hÃ©e followed after him, and
<pb facs="tcp:13973:327"/>
when he was nigh vnto the Prince, he sayd: Knight, with more pride and better adorned with rich armour, then with good manners or courtesie, you must iuste with me, for that making thÃ©e to kisse the ground, constrained by my terrible incounter, thou shalt learne in another place to vse curtesie. The heroycall Prince with his accustomed mÃ©ekenesse, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. If my salutation gentle knight, was not as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a traueling knight, the distaunce of the waye was the occasion thereof: and this being true which I haue said, then haue you no reason to blame me. Thou hast lesse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sayd the Knight of the fountaine, for to excuse thy selfe from the iuste, which I doo aske of thÃ©e, therefore take thy choyce of the field, and procure to settle and firme thy selfe well in the saddle. The GrÃ©eke seing his pride, asked of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridon</hi> his shÃ©eld, and a speare which they brought with them: and hauing it in his hand, he saw that the field was all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very smooth, and a knight made in it, armed with purple armour, striking another Knight, armed likewise in purple armour ouerthwart the eyes, and it was all full of starres of golde. The Prince was meruailously amazed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the great clÃ©erenesse thereof, so that he was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hide his eyes with his owne hands: but the calling out of the Knight of the fountaine did cause him to chaunge his purpose, and called for his speare, and with a furious course, he went foorth vnto the incounter. The Knight of the fountaine did breake his speare, not making the Prince to mooue any more then he had stroke vpon a hard Rocke: but the Princes incounter was such, that he ouerthrew him to the ground, &amp; with the fall he brake his arme in two parts, who hauing no power to mooue himself, and with the great paine &amp; griefe he felt, made a pitifull complaint. The GrÃ©eke sÃ©eing him in that case sayd: Knight, it had bene better thou hadst remained without any salutation quietlye, then nowe quarrelling thervpon, thou hast thy arme broken, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest vnable to helpe thy selfe, and without saying any other thing, he did departe, determining to prosecute his former iourney. So within a while after, he heard a great noyse of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:13973:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calling, and looking about to sÃ©e who called him, he saw that it was the rest of the Knights, which followed with greate spÃ©ede. There he determined to staye their comming, and made himselfe ready vnto the battaile, if they would demand it of him. These seauen knights came with great yre, to sÃ©e the other knight in that perplexitie, (and forgetting the custome of <hi>Grecia,</hi> of long time obserued and kept amongst the Knights) they all seauen together with their speares on their rests, they made their incounter vpon him, and stroke the GrÃ©eke with their firmed blowes, some on the sides, and some on the breast with great furie: yet the Prince remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more firme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> an Anfield of yron. They all brake their speares on him, but at their passing by, he stroke one of them such a blow vpon the healme, that he ouerthrew him deade to the ground. The rest which remained, returned vnto him with their swords in their hand, laying vpon him very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly like knights that were both valiant and couragious: but the Prince moued his horse amongst them, with so great lightnesse and strength, that quicklie his power and force was knowen vnto them, he did so torment them with his mightie blowes. And the more they did grieue him, the worse it was for them: for hauing lost all patience, he threw his shield at his backe, and did assault them with such fury, that in a short time he remained with onely two of them in the field, who sÃ©eing the other of their companions dead, procured to saue their liues, tourning their backes vnto the GrÃ©eke, &amp; pricking their horse with the spurs, they put themselues into a broad waye.</p>
               <p>This furious Knight followed after them, procuring to ouertake them, and to make that not one of them shall beare newes of the successe of the battaile: but by reason they had some vauntage of the waye, and againe their horses were very good, for all the hast that he coulde make, he could not ouertake them, till such time as they came whereas were many tents armed in the field, and at that place ther was a knight y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stept before him to defend the other two which ran away, who were armed with verie strong and straunge ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
<pb facs="tcp:13973:328"/>
Who, if you doo remember was the Emperour <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo,</hi> and our Knight was his sonne, who with his sword in his hand all bloudie, followed the other two knights. The Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> seeing them come running from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one alone Knight, called vnto them and sayd: Tell me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe you runne away you cowards and dishonourers of the GrÃ©ekish genealogie, of whom are you afraide, of one alone Knight? Soueraigne Lord sayd one of the Knightes, he that doeth follow vs, is no Knight, but a diuell, and thy surmounted strength is nÃ©edfull to make resistaunce against his. So at that time the Prince approched as I haue tolde you, and likewise the Emperour <hi>Alphebo,</hi> who did verye much beholde his goodly stature and disposition: the Prince did likewise behold the Emperour, and the straungenesie of his armour. The Emperour was the first that beganne to speake and sayd: Tell me knight, what hath my Knightes, done vnto you, to cause you to vse &amp; intreat them so straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then the Prince who had lost all patience, sayde. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to make their reuengement, and doo not aske mÃ©e the cause of their cowardnesse. For that it is verye apparaunt, that they themselues are in fault of their ill intreating. This good Emperour, as one that made little reckoning of his words, very mÃ©ekely sayd. If they are in the fault it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me very well, therefore I doo desire to know the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion if it be thy pleasure to tell me, that I may altogether lay the fault vpon them. The Prince with a high voyce sayde. By the Gods I doo sweare vnto thÃ©e, that it is true that I haue tolde thÃ©e. The Emperour when he hearde him name those false Gods, without any more tarrying drewe out his sword and sayd. Defende thy selfe Pagan, for it shall cost thÃ©e thy lyfe, for laying hands vpon Christians, who are more worth then thou art. Now doo I not desire to knowe the occasion, for that they are Christians and thou arte a Moore. And I saye, that they are in no faulte. So there they assaulted one another, with most terrible and mortall battayle.</p>

HÃ©ere I doo renounce all your deitie and potencie, for it is all as nothing, and agayne I doo call you vyle, and of small estimation and power. And in saying these words, he ran against the Emperour with so great furye, that hÃ©e made the ground to tremble vnder him, and when he came nigh vnto the Emperour, he stroke him an ouerthwart blow with so great strength and might, that he made him to fall forwards vpon his horse cares without any remembraunce, in such sort that it sÃ©emed he had bene dead, for that there procÃ©eded out of his healme so much bloud. And by the great strength of that blow, his horse was constrained to stoope w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his forefeete. This mightie Prince with double fury turned with his sword to strike him the second blow, but it was in such sort, that the reynes of his horse bridle was fast in the buckle of his armour, and was constrained by the force hee put to strike his blow to pul the bridle, which made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horse to rise vp before, standing vpon his hinder fÃ©ete, which was very perillous vnto the Knight: and being in that sorte, hÃ©e lost the strength of his blow for to succour himselfe, and to gouerne his horse. In which time the Emperour came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his former senses, and settled himselfe in his saddle, who sÃ©eing the great perill in the which he was brought, did meruaile much thereat, and being full of wrath, like vnto a Lyon he recouered his sword, and set spurres vnto his horse, and made him to mooue like vnto the winde, throwing out at his beauer a thicke smoke with very anger, and gaue his assault with so great fury, that the knight could not but som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

At this time the battaile began a new to be very terrible, increasing double their fury, and likewise augmenting their blowes, in such sort, that with the least blow that was stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it sÃ©emed to haue cut the other all to pÃ©eces, which made all them that did behold the battaile very much to meruaile. At this time there appeared to come foorth out of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, a Knight, all armed in white armor, edged and wrought about with an excellent worke of fine golde, his healme on his head, and his shield at his necke, and gyrte with a very<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Knight began the controuersie first, with certaine knights of <hi>Grecia,</hi> who killing of some of them, and other some, verye sore wounded, and following other two which ranne away, the Emperour put himself before him, for to know the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his great furye, and that Knight did aunswere him with great pride and arrogancie, which was the occasion of

                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:332" rendition="simple:additions"/>Soueraigne Emperour, long time past without anye knowledge vnto thÃ©e I came into thy Empire, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was the occasion of great heauinesse and sorrowe vnto the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> whome I doe sÃ©e there armed with that white armour. The Emperour when he heard that wold not staie anie more reasonings, but went towardes her, who pulling off her healme likewise came towards him to kisse his handes, so there the one imbraced and receiued the other with great loue. The king <hi>Galtenor</hi> did cut of theyr talke and addressed his wordes vnto the Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> and sayde: Soueraigne Ladie, do you remember when that you did contemplate your selfe vpon the beautie of your children which you wer deliuered off, begotten by the Emperour <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo,</hi> at which time a wall did open, whereat did enter a Serpent, who at two mouthfulls did burie them in his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells. You shall vnderstand, Empresse and Ladie, that I was the Serpent, being compelled and constrained by greate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the strong arme of your mightie sonne, to doe that which at that time I did, and I did bring them vp in the maiestie as vnto such persons was necessarie and dutifull. In the end of sixe yeares, when I determined to make an ende of my iourney, resting our selues by the riuers side of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> I lost the maiden childe, wher all the time past vnto this present, she hath bene publishing abroade her extreame beautie, till such time as the valour of her brother did bring her from thence, who is the same that is talking with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king <hi>Delfo</hi> of <hi>Trapobana,</hi> and knowe this of a certaintie Ladie, that it is thy sonne <hi>Claridiano</hi> of the Speare. Thou diddest giue him that name by reason of a Speare that he hath on his breast from his birth, and that faire <hi>Pastora</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> you do sÃ©e there, is your proper daughter, and I am he that did rob and take them from you, and hÃ©ere I doe make restitution of them againe, so that I do deserue pardon of all the sorrow and griefe which I haue bÃ©ene the occasion of, onely with this present which I do present you withall. And likewise of you Emperour of <hi>Trabisond,</hi> I doe desire the same pardon,
<pb facs="tcp:13973:333"/>
and ioyntly therewith to forget the anger that you haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your owne sonne. Great was the ioy &amp; contentment of the Empresse, being almost beside her selfe, to sÃ©e that she had recouered her two children, which she thought had bene lost long agoe, and going to imbrace <hi>Claridiano,</hi> she found him vpon his knÃ©es, asking pardon of his Father of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had passed. What shall I heere saie of the good <hi>Trebatio,</hi> who when he knew that the <hi>Pastora</hi> was his nephew (&amp; that his desire was of a daughter, and neuer had anie) with his armes al abroad he went vnto her, who vnderstanding their communication, did alight from her Palfraie, at which time the Emperour came and tooke her in his armes, almost wÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for ioy, and with verye amorous wordes he did imbrace her, &amp; receiued so great contentment of their recouerie as euer he did in all his life for anie thing.</p>

whereas they found the Tables couered, and sate downe to supper, whereas they were with great ioy and pleasure, such as neuer was sÃ©ene the like in the Court.

The Supper indured so long, that <hi>Diana</hi> did extende her beames: at this time they tooke vp the tables, and <hi>Galtenor</hi> with a loude voyce sayd: One of the high glories of my <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarisido,</hi> sonne <hi>Claridiano,</hi> shall appeare in this great Citie, before the day doo come. He had no sooner made an ende of these words, when that the heauens beganne to waxe darke with a very thicke clowde, and it came with great thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and lightenings, &amp; with so terrible a noyse, as though the earth would haue sunke, and the longer it indured, the more was the fury thereof: in such sorte, that they all fell vpon their knÃ©es, and with great humilitie, they desired god to deliuer them from the fury of that great tempest.

So when the breake of the daie was come, the QuÃ©ene dyd very well peruse her armour, and put her selfe on horsbacke, and for that the waie sÃ©emed to be somewhat daungerous, she put on her helme and carryed her Speare in her hande, and with great trauaile they followed that way, when they had well nÃ©ere spent the third part of the daie, and had made an end of the going vp that mountaine, being vpon the toppe thereof, they looked about them on all partes, and towardes the right hand on the foote of that high mountaine they sawe a companie of armed men, and by reason that they were so far of, they could not discerne what it shuld be. So straight way they descended downe the mountaine, and whan they came at the foote therof, they looked round about to see if they could discouer that which they had seene from the top of the same, and sawe that there were to the number of twentie knights verie well armed, and amongest them a Gyant, who brought with them two knights prisoners, armed with verie rich ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, all sauing their heads, &amp; with them a Ladie who was as sad and sorrowfull, as faire and beautifull, and with her certaine Gentlewomen which did beare her companie.

And when she was come nigh him, this couragious Ladie with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voice sayd: Tell me Gyaunt what euill hath these priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners committed, that so without all reason thou doest carrye them so manakled and bounde.

What honour and prowesse is it to thÃ©e, for that thou art so desirous to know, and with so great pride doest aske the question? No other thing sayd this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen Gentlewoman, but to make friendship where none is, and againe if of thee they doe receiue anie griefe or wrong, to amend the same, for that I doe knowe that the condition of all Gyaunts, is nothing, but procuring to doe all wrong, therefore determine to tell me, or make thy selfe readie to thy defence. The furie of the Gyant was verie great when that he heard these words, in such sort, that it sÃ©emed fire flew out of his eyes, and with that furie he spurred forwardes his horse. The like did that worthie matrone, at that time they set spurs to their horses, and with a swift course they made their incounter, and stroke their Speares vppon their stÃ©elie sheelds, the Speare of the Gyant made his stay vpon the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the inchaunted sheelde, but this Ladie did not onely pearce through his armour, but also through his breast and bodie, ouerthrowing him dead with great furie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, whereas he gaue a terrible fall that he made the earth to tremble, and the QuÃ©ene passed a long so quietlye as though she had done nothing, and with great lightnesse she turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her horse, with her naked sword in her hand, and saw that the Gyaunt laye a long on the grounde dead.

These Knights were all chosen Knights, and did trouble her very much, making her sundry times to loose the sight of her eyes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which did bring her very much in cholar, in such sort that she threw her shield at her backe, and taking her sword in both her hands, she bestarred her selfe on the one side and on the other, about their heads, and wounding of knights, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing of them to the ground dead, in such sorte, that when she remembred her selfe, there was no more but fiue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knights left aliue, who when they saw so great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in so short time, they determined the seperation of the controuersie, and to put more confidence in their horse fÃ©ete, than in their owne defence and putting it in vre, they ranne away. This Lady made no reckoning to follow them, but went straight waye and did vnloose the Prisoners. Unto whom <hi>Don Florisarte</hi> of <hi>Bauiera</hi> did giue thankes for all the rest, desiring him that he wold declare vnto them his name for that they might knowe vnto whom they were bound, for that great benefit done vnto them. The Lady did answere them with great courtesie and sayd: Gentle Knightes, my name is of so small valour, that I cannot be knowen by it: but that which I may doo to giue you contentment, is to pul off my healme, and in sÃ©eing my face, you shall sÃ©e if that at any time you haue heard any mention of me: and in saying these words, she her selfe did vnlace and tooke off her helme, And looke with what beautie the Radiaunt Sunne dooeth showe himselfe vppon a sodaine when all his beames hath bene hidden with a darke clowde: euen so, and rather more, did this excellent and beautifull face show it selfe, after that she had pulled off her healme, the which before did cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The QuÃ©ene when she sawe him all in a readinesse to the battaile, with a gracious laughter sayd. I would neuer haue thought that there had bene so great an ouersight in a knight and especiallye of such fame, that so without all feare of a great number that cannot abide them, but procure all euill possible against them, that without all care in the high way doth put himselfe to slÃ©ep. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> answered, and said: There was not in me so great ouersight, as in you care, to venture your selfe, whereas you shall receiue little profite of the same. And doth it sÃ©eme vnto thÃ©e, that I was ouersÃ©ene therein? Possibly thou wilt iudge the contrary, if thou wilte proue the strength of my arme. It cannot but be very much, if it be conformable vnto thy ouersight, saide this faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and belÃ©eue me that it woulde grÃ©eue me to make anye proofe, if there be in thÃ©e so great vertue, as thy fame dooth beare the report.

called for his horse, which was straight waye brought vnto him by <hi>Macedonio,</hi> and without putting foote into the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roppe, he leaped into the saddle, and tooke his speare in his hand, &amp; without replying any other thing, that valiant <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crian</hi> presently withdrew himselfe backe, and tooke of the field that part which was nÃ©edfull for him. The lyke did the QuÃ©ene, and at one time returned their light horses, and in great hast they stroke their horses with the spurs, without all pitie, and with extreame furie, they made the incounter vpon their shÃ©elds, that their speares shiuered all to pÃ©eces, and passed along with their course without any stay of their bodies, or mouing in their saddles, and turned aboute their horse with great lightnes with their swords in their hands. The QuÃ©ene stroke the first blowe at the Prince, that shÃ©e made the sparkes to flye out of his helme, and the Prince to decline his head to the saddle bow, who with great lightnes did settle himselfe againe in the saddle, and did cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the second blow, which was readie to be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon him: &amp; putting himselfe on the one side, he stroke her such a blow vpon the helme, that it made a great sounds throughout all the fields and craggie mountaines, and shÃ©e fell backwards vpon the horse crouper with her heade: but very quickly she arose vp againe, and settled her selfe, and with great yre she layd fast holde vpon her sword, to strike her enimie, whom she did not finde idle, but rather began to assault her with blowes of mortall battaile. Such blowes was stroke betwixt them, that with the least they thought either of them to make an ende of that controuersie. At this time, there came that way a Knight, who was armed with very rich armour. This was that strong and mightie <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldoro,</hi> who if you doo remember, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mightie &amp; strong blow giuen by the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> remained all alongst the floore in his galley without remembrance. And when he came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe, with his accustomed brauery, he would followe that way which the barke went: but calling to remembrance the great trauaile and sorrow in the which his Lady was, loue did there constraine him to follow his owne iourney.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:13973:338" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And when he came thether, he vnderstood that <hi>Poliphebo</hi> had set her at lybertie, and caried her with him, towards the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Court: &amp; by the way that he trauailed, he met with people which did tell him of all that had happened, and all signes and tokens of the Knight that carried away his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and by them he did vnderstand that he was his enemye: then he left his owne armour, and armed himselfe with that which was <hi>Bramarants,</hi> and followed that way which was tolde him he went. The fame was such, that this <hi>Tinacrian</hi> left behinde him, that wheresoeuer he came, or wheresoeuer he went, he alwayes had newes which way he trauailed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that time, that he came &amp; found him in battel with that worthy QuÃ©ene, where he staid to behold a battaile so well fought. At length he knew him very well to be the Knight that brought him into so great extremitie: and looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him on them that were beholding the battaile, amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the rest he knewe his louing wife: and although his ioye was very great in sÃ©eing of her, yet the wrath and ire that he had against the Knight was so much, that without saying any word vnto the QuÃ©ene his wife, he went toward them that were in battaile, and with his sword drawen in his hand, he put himselfe before the QuÃ©ene and sayde. I doo desire thÃ©e gentle Knight that thou wouldest rest and take thine ease, and let me alone with my strong arme take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement of this knight, vsurper of my louing wife, and a robber of my fame and honour, and without any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, he went against him for to strike at him mortall blowes. But then that worthy Gentlewoman with great anger said.</p>
               <p>Stand away Knight, and let me make an ende of that I haue begun, and offer no wrong vnto them that doo knowe how to make their their demaund vnto thy cost: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she put her selfe before him. But this furious Pagan with the great desire he had to make his reuengement tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and put himselfe before the Queene striking at the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrian</hi> mightie &amp; strong blowes, who did not much maruell
<pb facs="tcp:13973:339"/>
neither at the one nor at the other, but assaulted the Pagan with a meruailous mightie blow. The Queene at that time did put her selfe before him againe, and vpon her was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted that blow vpon the left shoulder, which did grieue her very much, as it appeared by her outward countenaunce. At this time the Pagan put himselfe againe formost: then this furious Lady with her sword all aloft, said. Keepe thy selfe backe, thou vile Knight, and of base linage, and let me make an ende of this that I haue begun, before that the potencye of my arme, doo ouerthrow thy great pride. Stand thou back sayde the Pagan, for it is my right to take vengeaunce on this euill Knight, for that he doth carry my Lady robbed from me. In these words which was spoken, the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did know the other to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who brought him in so great extremitie at the beginning of his Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for the which he was very full of yre and wrath, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that a thicke smoke came forth at his beauer. At this time came vnto that place <hi>Don Claridiano</hi> of the speare, the light of all Knighthood, who was armed with his purple ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and as I haue told you, he departed out of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors pallaice in great secret. And when he saw the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that was betwixt those knights, being very desirous to know the occasion, he put himselfe betwÃ©ene them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them to leaue off that battell. The furious Pagan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: thou knight, put not thy self to vnderstand any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before thou art called: for if thou dost, possibly thou shalt beare part of that, which this vnfortunate knight dooth owe me. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> said: I know not wherein he should be indebted vnto thÃ©e, but rather I doo vnderstand that thou art he that hath least reason, for that the other knight of the branch, was the first that begun this battaile. First he did to me the griefe, sayd the Pagan, before the other. For that I gaue vnto him the order of knighthood, and after that I had giuen it him, he did defie me in mortall battaile: &amp; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hÃ©erwith, he hath robbed me of my Ladye which thou dost sÃ©e yonder. To these words the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> answered and said. Thou liest like an euill knight, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue not robbed
<pb facs="tcp:13973:339"/>
her, but I haue deliuered her from that place, from whence thou with all thy power wert not sufficient to deliuer her: &amp; for thy falshood, thou shalt not carrie her away without mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall battell. This furious pagan when he heard himself so ill spoken off, like a Lion he went against him: but that stoute Dame did put her selfe before him, and said. Stand back then Pagan &amp; importunate diuell, for first thou shalt haue to doo with me, or els thou shalt let me make an ende of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. This braue <hi>Tinacrian</hi> like a furious Lion, said vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> GrÃ©eke Prince: Curteous knight, I pray you to stand backe somewhat and let me alone with them both, for that I doe estÃ©eme both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> but a little. And with loude voice he said: Come, come against me thou Pagan king, &amp; of little valour, &amp; take in companie with thÃ©e that other arrogant foole as thou art, for that of both you together I do meane to set an agrÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength and force of my indomable arme. Then <hi>Claridiano</hi> sayd, it shall not be so, but first procure to clÃ©ere thy selfe of him with the branch, and I will set thÃ©e at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the pagan. And therewith he drew out his sword, and stroke him such a blow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him to tremble &amp; remain as one amazed: and sÃ©eing him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> case, he stroke him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blow vpon the beuer, that he made the pagan to grype fast about his horse neck to kÃ©epe himselfe from falling. But this Moore came quickly again to himselfe, and with a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courage he stroke him vpon the left sholder such a blow that it made the GrÃ©eke to shrinke in his body, and to stoope downe to his saddle bow, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great griefe that he felle, &amp; giuing a terrible grone, he lift vp his sword, &amp; stroke the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a blow vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helme, that the sparks of fire flewe into the aire, and almost without remembrance, he fell down vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his horse crupper. The pagan comming again vnto him selfe, puffed out at his beuer a thick smoke, &amp; threw his shÃ©eld at his back, and stroke the GrÃ©eke so terrible a blowe, that without all remembrance, he fell forwards vpon his horses eares, who carried him a while vp &amp; down y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field: but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently he came againe vnto himselfe, &amp; sÃ©eing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was so ill intreated, he tooke his sword in both his hands, &amp; set spurs to
<pb facs="tcp:13973:340"/>
his horse side, that he made him to run lyke vnto the winde, so that he was straight with the Pagan, and stroke him such a blow, that it semed a whole tower had falne vpon him, and hauing no power to the contrary, he fell vpon his horse neck without anye feeling: who being scarred with that terrible blow, with a swift course carried his master from his enimy. In all this time was not the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> nor that faire dame idle: but when they saw the battaile begun betwixt the two Knights, with great furie they returned vnto their battaile, and for that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was full of anger, he threwe his shÃ©eld at his backe, and stroke at the QuÃ©ene so mightie a blow &amp; with so great fury y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made her to fall downe vpon the buttock of her horse without any remembrance, who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her a while round about the field. The QuÃ©ene came quickly againe vnto her selfe, so wrathfull, that she had no other thought, but to take reuengement on her enimie, and throwing her shield to the grounde, she tooke her sworde in both her hands, &amp; stroke her horse with the spurres, that she made him run like vnto the winde, &amp; with a trice shÃ©e was with the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> and stroke him so vppon the healme that with the fire which slew out thereat, he lost his sight, &amp; this valiant young Knight fell backwardes vppon his horse crupper without any fÃ©elyng, who carried him vp and down the field, which when the Lady saw, she would haue finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the battaile, with another rigorous blow. At this time it so fell out that the horse of that valiaunt <hi>African</hi> with his master, did likewise runne about the field, the which was the occasion, that the GrÃ©eke might behold all that passed, and with a trice he was with them &amp; sayd. Withdraw thy selfe for that it is not the part of heroycall Knights to pursue and follow them that are without remembrance. The Lady who was very angry, gaue the GrÃ©eke for aunswere, a furious blow, but straight way she was paid again with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like: wher betwixt them began a new battaile. In the meane time the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> &amp; the Pagan were come againe vnto themselues, &amp; setled in their saddles, &amp; either of them looked about for his aduersary, whom they beheld in mortall battaile. And they
<pb facs="tcp:13973:340"/>
two being together, which did hate each other deadly, made no reckoning of their late enimies, but assalted one another very furiously and strongly. All this was great profit vnto the QuÃ©ene of <hi>Lira,</hi> for that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was so mightie &amp; furious, that she should haue bene in great perill. I cannot tell you who was more furious of these two warriors, but I can say this, that <hi>Claridiano</hi> was verye sore wounded and ouercome, as hÃ©ereafter shall be tolde you, in such sort, that no medicine might auaile to helpe him. Thus they indured foure houres without taking any rest, fighting more fiercely then at the beginning. And being in this controuersie, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the parts next the sea side, they saw comming <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer,</hi> and that stout <hi>Troyan,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> who sÃ©eing the battaile, did stay to behold them. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> knew straight wayes the armour of <hi>Bramarant,</hi> who seeing them in the power of another, was very full of wrath, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more tarrying, he put himselfe in the midst among them, and with a furious voyce he sayd. Tell me knight, who made thÃ©e so bold to take this armour, from the place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I put them for a <hi>Tropheo</hi> and remembraunce. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan aunswered him and said: Superbious and proud knight, art thou by fortune one of those GrÃ©eke Princes, who with great threatenings dost defende this armour. I am one of them said <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and he that will take away thy life for thy boldnesse, and therewith he drew out his sword for to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault him: but the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did put himselfe before him &amp; said with great curtesie as vnto his elder brother. Knight &amp; prince of <hi>Grecia,</hi> let not your highnes do me so much wrong, to hinder me from being reuenged on this Knight, let mee alone with him, for that I haue so much hope in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength of my arme, to giue a good accompt of him. Therefore I doo desire thÃ©e to stand a little a side. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> woulde haue aunswered him, but vpon a sodaine he saw comming from the parte of <hi>Pireo,</hi> a Knight; armed with russet armour, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with stripes and barres of golde, his shield was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Russet and there was painted on it, the God <hi>Cupide</hi> with two faces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13973:341"/>This was that valiant <hi>Eleno</hi> prince of <hi>Dacia,</hi> who sÃ©eing the controuersie betwixt those three knights, passed forwards on his way, saying vnto <hi>Rosicleer</hi> without looking vpon his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and deuice: Knight thou doost wrong to disturbe them them that first began the battell. But <hi>Rosicleer</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great anger and wrath he had to sÃ©e that armor in a strangers po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, did not beholde the deuice of his Cousin, and so being both blinde, without anie consideration, they assaulted one another in mortall battaile.
