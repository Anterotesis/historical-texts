         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
From a Gentleman in the City to

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE you will not admit of my excuſes,
I can no longer reſiſt the importunity you
expreſs, that I would give you my thoughts
about the preſent ſtate of Affairs, amongſt
the Miniſters of the Congregational perſwaſion:
more eſpecially of what relates to the <hi>Declaration</hi>
lately Publiſhed by ſome of them. You're not
inſenſible how dangerous a task it is to unravel
the myſteries of the <hi>Leaders of the People,</hi> without
drawing the Odium of a whole Party of upon
the bold undertaker, tho' the charge be never ſo
Juſt and Righteous: This is owing to a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Maxim inſtill'd into us from our infancy,
<hi>That to expoſe the Preachers is to ridicule and
banter Religion out of the World, to introduce
Atheiſm and all impiety,</hi> as if the virtues, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravities
of that ſort of Men did add or diminiſh,
from the vital Power and Energy of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which ſtands upon ſo ſure a Foundation,
<hi>that even the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</hi> But ſo far has this Poiſon diffus'd it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35191:3"/>
ſelf into the hearts of moſt Men, that the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
God hath made unto us in his Word how he
will be worſhiped, and what he expects from us,
are not fully believed, except they be confirm'd
by thoſe we commonly call <hi>Divines,</hi> whom to ſet
in a clear light before the Generality of People,
is to rob them of the better half of their worſhip;
who thereupon are apt to cry out, with <hi>Micah, ye
have taken away my Gods which I made, and the</hi>
Prieſt, <hi>and what have I more?</hi> And for my part
I muſt frankly own, that this Poiſon had ſo far
infected me, that all the Antidotes I ever took
could not effectually eradicate the malignity of it,
'till by continued obſervation I found our <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Donns</hi> ſo far from being elevated above
thoſe failings common to mankind, that in many
of them thoſe very corruptions diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more predominate than in others: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſtation wherein they are plac'd magnifies
every Peccadillo in them, or whether their dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
be really ſo great (with which ſubject I
may poſſibly hereafter entertain you) is not at
preſent my intention to enquire: But I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to lay before you my Thoughts upon a half
ſheet, a few Days ſince emitted into the World,
and affix'd to the <hi>Declaration</hi> you wot of, by
five Congregational Miniſters, as they ſtile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
And the matters of fact I ſhall faithfully
repreſent to you as they came to my knowledge,
to the relation of which you'll the more readily
give Credit, when you conſider, I can't Juſtly
be ſuppos'd to be byaſs'd in my Judgment to this
or the other Party, whether <hi>Presbyterian or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant,</hi>
having never actually joyned with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, and therefore am under no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35191:3"/>
to eſpouſe one cauſe more than another;
but as Friend to Truth, and in deteſtation of that
groſs <hi>Legerdemain</hi> lately impos'd upon the World,
I ſhall give you a ſhort Narrative of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
publiſh'd with the <hi>Second Edition</hi> (as
they call it) of their <hi>Declaration,</hi> and then ſum
up the whole in a ſuccinct deſcription of what
part each of the five Subſcribers acted in it.</p>
            <p>For their Advertiſement then, you ſhall know
that the firſt part of it runs in the following
ſtrain.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It having been reported and induſtriouſly ſpread
abroad, that the Declaration againſt Antinomian
Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not conſidered, and approved of
by the Congregational Miniſters in and about this
City. (Which is in manifeſt contradiction to the
title Page and Preface.)</p>
            </q>
            <p>I ſhall not examine the ingenious ſtile this
paſſage is couch'd in, nor take notice of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis,
aptly plac'd, as they may think, after
a full Period, the ſuppoſed Learning of the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſis
to that <hi>Reverend Society</hi> ſhrowding him
from cenſure of incorrectneſs: But I ſhall lead you
directly into the underſtanding of this intricate
matter.</p>
            <p>You muſt know, that ſome time ſince a party
of the <hi>Congregational</hi> Miniſters held a <hi>Conſiſtory</hi>
at the <hi>Amſterdam Coffee-houſe,</hi> and other places,
to draw up ſomething to ſatisfy the World that
they did not any way warp towards a hateful
buſieneſs call'd <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> and having their
fancies quickn'd by the name of the place they
were in, after many debates, they pick'd up ſome
Errors from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or hard by, held ſome
hundred years ago, and ſtrenuouſly confuted them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35191:4"/>
by Dr. <hi>Goodwyn,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſemblies
Catechiſm,</hi> with the help of Dr. <hi>South.</hi> This their
compoſition crept into the World in ſo clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
a manner, that many who were adherers to
them, and their intereſt, could ſcarcely be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to believe they were the Authors of that
<hi>Elaborate</hi> piece; which gave birth to an Anomy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Pamphlet, intitul'd <hi>Conſiderations upon the
Congregational Miniſters Declaration:</hi> this ſome
conceive to have been wrote by a <hi>Presbyterian;</hi>
therein he endeavours to demonſtrate by many
Arguments, that it was not probable the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
Miniſters were the Authors of that
<hi>Declaration,</hi> and in a ſevere paſſage towards the
Concluſion, ſeems to throw it upon the Celebrated
Lunatick, <hi>Trepidantium Malleus,</hi> who boaſts that
he has highly merited of the World by ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exploding Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Errors and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and who really engag'd in a work of the like
deſign with this <hi>Declaration</hi> ſome Months ago.
But whoever was the Author of that Pamphlet,
'tis certain it had this effect, that thoſe <hi>Reverend
Sirs,</hi> who before had foiſted into the World that,
ſuppos'd ſpurious, <hi>Declaration,</hi> being now toucht
to the quick, do boldly own it to be the legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
product of their ſtrict ſcrutiny into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the <hi>Dead,</hi> by prefixing five Names to
it, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Now upon this goodly Proceeding of theirs we
may juſtly make the following Reflexions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35191:4"/>
1. Hereby we ſee unto what miſerable Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges
Men are forc'd to betake, to palliate that Pride
and Arrogancy which their aſpiring after a Power
they had no right to, had involv'd them in. It is clear
to every one who knows any thing of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational
Principles, that, without the conſent of
their Churches, the Miniſters have no Authority to
engage in ſuch a Work, and in all Probability the
thoughts of this made them aſham'd at firſt to own
it for theirs. But as one Error is introductive of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
ſo thro' a fatal Miſtake (which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Demonſtration they were conſcious they had
tranſgreſſed, by publiſhing this <hi>Declaration</hi> upon
their own Heads) they have egregiouſly expos'd
one of the Brethren of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> tho' not of
the number of the five Subſcribers; who to palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
(according to Inſtruction no doubt) the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of their <hi>Firſt Edition,</hi> without their Names,
gave out that thoſe Errors were of ſuch Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that except they had more fully weighed
their Collection of Anſwers to them, their Deſign
would have prov'd abortive: And they muſt then
have inevitably expos'd that Learning and Zeal
(poor and blind as it is) wherewith they have for
ſome time amus'd ignorant, well diſpos'd People.
Add to this, another ſhort Remark, which will
yet expoſe their Combination ſomewhat more,
They call it a <hi>Second Edition,</hi> whereas, in Truth,
it is very much queſtioned, whether many of the
firſt Impreſſion found vent; and 'tis generally
thought, that the Advertiſement, to which theſe
five Names are affix'd, is ſtich'd by the Bookſeller
to their <hi>Declaration;</hi> which, with a new Title
Page, is all the Alteration it has undergone.</p>
            <p>2. We cannot but note, that they have hereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
the World with a taſte of that Learning, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35191:5"/>
they account ſufficient for themſelves, and their
Churches too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For being throughly convinc'd of
the Ignorance and Inability of their reſpective
Flocks to aſſert their own Principles (as the laſt
Subſcriber of the Five, very ſagaciouſly has aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
they, like true Champions, by their ſingle
<hi>Proweſs</hi> have defended that Cauſe which none op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and confuted thoſe Errors which no body
holds, or charges them with.</p>
            <p>3. Hereby they demonſtrate to the World, how
happy the preſent Conſtitution of their Churches is;
ſince the Paſtors can ſo eaſily raviſh from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that Authority, Order and Diſcipline, which
all of them, when firſt they were called to their
Charge, found them in, and place it <hi>alone</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
which makes me judge, without any breach
of Charity, that they have found their <hi>Lording</hi>
over God's Heritage ſo ſweet, and ſo profitable,
that they would not be very much averſe, upon
the firſt Overtures of a Treaty, to attempt to make
<hi>the two Sticks one again:</hi> And then they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<hi>Deſpotick Power</hi> without control, beating
their People with a heavy Hand.</p>
            <p>But 'tis high time to come to the other part of
their Advertiſement, which ſhuts up in theſe
goodly Phraſes.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>We,</hi> whoſe Names are hereunto ſubſcribed, to the
and the truth of Matter of Fact may appear, to the
Conviction of every Reader, do declare, that (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting

And here, Sir, for brevity ſake, I ſhall ſlightly
paſs over the awakard Style, this Sentence, (as well
as the former) is expreſs'd in. Have theſe great
<hi>would-be-Repreſentatives of all the Congregational
Churches in and about London,</hi> with all their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademick
Literature,</hi> attain'd to no more Judgment
in their Mother Tongue, than ſcarce to be able
to write true Engliſh? This indeed would be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Subject to paraphraſe upon, had I not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of greater Moment to communicate to you,
which will expoſe their <hi>Honeſty</hi> ſomewhat more
than their harſh Engliſh does their <hi>Accuracy.</hi> I will
not, in what I ſhall ſay, take the method moſt of
them do in their Pulpits, when they either force a
Text to ſpeak what it never intended, by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Gloſſes and Diſtinctions, or conſtrain it
to go with them much longer than the Subject will
bear; but I will give you, in ſhort, my Diviſion
of the above quoted Advertiſement, according to
the Genuine Interpretation of the Words, which
will unfold to us, what Doctrine is contain'd in
them.</p>
            <p>Then let us ſee how <hi>Magiſterially</hi> theſe <hi>Donns</hi>
open themſelves.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>We,</hi> whoſe Names are hereunto ſubſcribed, to the
end the Truth of matter of Fact may appear, to the
Conviction of every Reader, do declare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>It will not be impertinent to ſpend a few thoughts
upon the Conſideration of who theſe <hi>We</hi> are, that
ſo preſumptuouſly take upon them, to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Dictators; and from the vain ſuppoſition of
their own Merit and Renown, <hi>to convince every
Reader of the Truth of matter of Fact.</hi> Little Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
made into the Merit of theſe <hi>Rabbies,</hi> will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
ſhew how much Credit we ought to give to
what they aſſert, and what Influence it will have
upon all Men of Senſe.</p>

The <hi>Two</hi> firſt Subſcribers then, as we find them
rank'd in order, are <hi>G. G.</hi> and <hi>M. M.</hi> whom I put
together, not for any Reſemblance they bear to each
other, (for they are in ſome Reſpects as oppoſite
as the two Poles) but becauſe the <hi>firſt</hi> of them was,
by a piece of Policy natural (to the <hi>ſecond)</hi> decoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to affix his Name to this Narrative, tho' he has
ſince confeſs'd he did not underſtand the Intreague,
and therefore I ſhall have nothing more to ſay of
him: And the rather, becauſe I'm credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Mr. <hi>M.</hi> gave Directions, that unleſs Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
ſign'd the Paper firſt, his Hand ſhould be blotted
out; by which Stratagem, the good old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was enſnared, and the odium of his being found
in ſuch Company falls intirely upon his Betrayer;
whoſe deſign herein I ſhall not pretend to unriddle,
but leave it to be gueſs'd by you, and others, who
have a clear inſight into <hi>this Man of Deſign:</hi> only
I muſt add, that I'm apprehenſive his engaging
to ſupport himſelf and others, in Practices no way
warrantable, will revive a Report which has been
whiſper'd about the Town of a certain <hi>Houſe</hi> and
<hi>Garden</hi> ſurreptitiouſly obtain'd from the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors.</p>

               </hi> and <hi>Iohn Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi>
bring up the Rear, and are the Perſons whom
I ſhall next entertain you with. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> I muſt in
Juſtice defend from Cenſure, and acquit him from
any ſiniſter Dealings in this Affair, he being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
influenc'd by the Perſwaſions of Crafty Men,
to whoſe Wiles the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of his Temper leaves
him expos'd; to his own great Diſadvantage, and
the Encouragement of their Inſults.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L.</hi> you have heard much of in the laſt Reign,
and not a little in this, tho' upon other Accounts.
Then a Politian and a mighty Courtier, being a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretioribus</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:35191:6"/>
to the late Tyrant: Now a rough and
ſurly Divine, fighting his betters with his Pen; the
common Scribler of what the Synod, meeting at
<hi>Pinners Hall,</hi> alias <hi>Amſterdam Coffee-houſe,</hi> alias <hi>a
Houſe in Moor-Fields,</hi> pleaſe to employ him in:
One while drawing his Dagger in ſecret, another
while fighting the whole Synagogue at <hi>St. Hellen</hi>'s
with his Brandiſh'd Sword in publick. This Man
of Contention, with his Friend Mr. <hi>N.</hi> were the
great Promoters and Inditers of this Pamphlet, theſe
two are intimately acquainted with all the ſteps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to this quarrelſome <hi>Declaration.</hi> This poor
Wretch Mr. <hi>N.</hi> is leaſt of all to be excus'd, for that
he diſcovers his want of Common Civility, which
ſhould teach him to be thankful to a Nation, that
has put Money in his Pocket, and ſet the <hi>Beggar</hi>
on Horſe-back, who now in requital would ride o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Necks of his Benefactors; but poſſibly he
may have found ſome Encouragement for what he
has done, in one of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which he delights
ſo much to quote, tho' with as little Pertinency as
ever was ſung the Ballad of <hi>Chevy Chace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall not ſpend my time in diſcovering that
to you, concerning the <hi>two</hi> laſt mention'd, which
you are no Stranger to; ſince the Spirit with which
they were acted, will be beſt ſeen, when you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Methods they took, to perſwade the
World, that the publiſhing their <hi>Declaration</hi> was by
the unanimous Conſent of all the <hi>Congregational</hi>
Miniſters in and about this City. I will not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but the <hi>Conclave</hi> at <hi>Pinners Hall</hi> had ſounded
the Minds of their Brethren of the ſame <hi>Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as they call it, with themſelves, how far they
would join with them in the Publication of their
elaborate Piece; what Reſentment the Majority had
of it ſhall not now be told, tho' 'tis reported Dr.

               <hi>Chauncy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Neſs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Singleton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Short,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Harris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Meidell,</hi> &amp;c. car'd not to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in a Caſe that concern'd them not. This <hi>Laſt,</hi>
was formerly a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> but ſome Years agoe
brought over to the knowledge of the Truth, and
is now Paſtor to a <hi>Congregational</hi> Church, his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
therefore they moſt <hi>earneſtly</hi> deſir'd, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a faithful Confeſſor of Jeſus Chriſt, and a
great Sufferer for him; to obtain which, Mr. <hi>L.</hi>
the <hi>Scribe,</hi> by order of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> writes
him a Letter, which whether more full of Pride,
or Ignorance, is difficult to define, wherein he tells
him how <hi>Harmonious</hi> the Miniſters all were to
uſher the ſecond Edition of their <hi>Declaration</hi> into
the World, with an Atteſtatation to it under their
hands, that there was but <hi>One</hi> more beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
of whoſe Conſent they at all doubted, and
that <hi>One</hi> had been ſpoke to, and therefore in <hi>truſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

(as he ſays) requeſted him not to obſtruct ſo good
a Work, leſt they ſhould be oblig'd to let the
World know, by expoſing Mr. <hi>Meidell</hi>'s Name in
Print, that he was the only Man amongſt them,
who refus'd to join with them.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you are as tyred as I am, in tracing
the hidden By-ways of theſe aſſuming <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
I ſhall therefore ſum up all I am minded
at this time to communicate, in a few <hi>Queries,</hi>
which I leave to your ſerious Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query,</hi> 1. Whether by publiſhing, a ſhameleſs
half-ſide, to vindicate the Reputation of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>title Page and Preface,</hi> which, they ſay, met
with <hi>a manifeſt Contradiction;</hi> theſe men do not
at the ſame time diſcover an overweening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of their own <hi>title Page and Preface,</hi> and a
meaſure of Inſolence beyond what is common,
when they take it in ſuch Dudgeon, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35191:7"/>
of a nameleſs <hi>title Page and Preface</hi> is call'd
into Queſtion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que.</hi> 2. Whether theſe Men by inſinuating,
<hi>that all to whom they thought fit to communicate
their Declaration</hi> approv'd of it, become not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>at leaſt</hi> of a very groſs fallacy? ſince Mr. <hi>Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,</hi>
to whom they did think fit to communicate
it (if <hi>S. L—,</hi> and <hi>J. N—,</hi> may be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
openly declared his diſlike of it to them at
<hi>Pinners-Hall.</hi> Surely ſuch <hi>ſly</hi> and <hi>untrue Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi>
ill become Miniſters of Chriſt, who ſhould
renounce all hidden things of diſhoneſty, not
walking in craftineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que.</hi> 3. Whether by ſaying, that their <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
was approved by all the Congregational
Miniſters in and about <hi>London,</hi> but by <hi>two</hi> or
<hi>three,</hi> to whom they <hi>thought not fit to</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it, theſe Men do not manifeſtly contradict
what <hi>S. L.</hi> wrote Mr. <hi>C. M.</hi> when he tells him
that <hi>all</hi> had approved of it but <hi>One,</hi> and that <hi>One</hi>
had been ſpake to about it. How theſe things can
hang together they ſhould beſt tell, but 'till I
better underſtand their minds in this matter, I muſt
apply our old Proverb to them. <hi>Liars need good
Memories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que.</hi> 4. Whether <hi>S. L.</hi> when he wrote to Mr. <hi>C.
M.</hi> and aſſur'd him that what he did communicate
to him was <hi>in truſt</hi> (emplying his being intruſted by
all the Miniſters) when indeed but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi>
could be found to have ſet him on work, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
act the part <hi>of a truſty Scribe to his Maſters all,</hi>
or like an upright Chriſtian, and faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
fit to be put in truſt with the Goſpel? This
Query I leave with the Conſcience of that buſy
<hi>Emperick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:35191:8"/>
               <hi>Que.</hi> 5. Whether theſe Men have not evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
run beyond the tedder of <hi>Independent</hi> Principles,
in publiſhing this <hi>Declaration</hi> without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their reſpective Churches, and in unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
concerning themſelves with Paſtors of
other Churches? But alas! it is to be feared, many that
go under the name of <hi>Independents,</hi> affect and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
as much Tyranny and Uſurpation, over their
own Churches and fellow Servants, as any of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
denominations, that pretend to no ſuch puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
Witneſs their counterfeit Agreement, firſt
clandeſtinely patcht up by <hi>Clubbs</hi> of Preachers,
without the Knowledge of their Churches, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
as arbitrarily impoſed upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que.</hi> 6. Whether, by muſtering up a Cargo of
<hi>Antinomian</hi> Errors, eſpous'd by no Party of Men,
or ſingle Preacher in <hi>England</hi> at this day, theſe
Men have diſcover'd, moſt <hi>of a vain Itch of Pride</hi>
to ſhew their reading, or of an <hi>angry humour</hi> of
contention, to be quarrelling, tho' they know not
at what, or <hi>of a weak air of impertinence,</hi> to bring
ſomewhat on the Stage, nothing to the purpoſe,
or of a <hi>malicious Deſign</hi> againſt Souls, to infect our
air with <hi>ſome German Antinomianiſm,</hi> which they
have rak'd out of the Grave of Oblivion, where
they have lain now this hundred years, (as a Poet
of their own ſaid) and againſt the venom of which
their poor Antidotes, ſcrap'd from Dr. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
much too weak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que.</hi> 7. Whether the inſolent Methods theſe
Preachers have taken to terrify men more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
than themſelves, into a compliance with
their baſe proceedings, do not diſcover them to be
acted rather by the Spirit of <hi>Belial</hi> then of <hi>Jeſus?</hi>
Certainly it is not according to Chriſt's rule, to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35191:8"/>
Stigmatize others with the Title of <hi>Antinomians,</hi>
&amp;c. that cannot run our length, nor does it
ſavor of true Chriſtian humility for any to be perk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above their Brethren with ſuch a Phraſe of
contempt, as <hi>We thought them not fit.</hi> It is to be
feared, theſe Men that think others <hi>not fit</hi> for their
notice, in a way of reſpect, would think them
<hi>very fit</hi> to be degraded, and deliver'd over to the
Secular Power, why elſe ſhould one of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſay, <hi>we want a little more of the Magiſtrate
on our ſide.</hi> And what other meaning can be
given of that paſſage, wherein they tell us, they
Judge themſelves oblig'd, to bear with and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
compaſſion and tenderneſs to their fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
chiefly becauſe our Governors have by a
Law tollerated us, and partly becauſe the <hi>Savoy
Confeſſion</hi> hath taught them ſo to do. But for any
Scripture or Grace produc'd by them for Lenity,
<hi>Quere,</hi> Where it is?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. 8. Laſtly,</hi> Whether upon the whole (to
ſet the Saddle upon the right Horſe) this Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
was not contrived, and promoted principally
by <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> wily Men, that ſtand conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of
<hi>Demy Arminianiſm</hi> in Principle, and <hi>true Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm</hi>
and <hi>Intruſion</hi> in Practice, in order to
the raiſing a Duſt of forg'd <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> and
<hi>Intruſion</hi> on others, ſo to hinder the perſuit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
for their Scandalous Lives, Ignorance of
the Goſpel, Invaſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here, Sir, you
muſt needs take notice how craftily they labour,
to bring into black Suſpicion, by baſe Innuendoes,
the Perſons and Miniſtry of ſuch whom they
moſt dread, treating them in Print, as the <hi>Chieftain</hi>
at <hi>Stepney,</hi> formerly ſerv'd good old Mr. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
in the Pulpit; endeavouring to load them
with Calumnies ſufficient, that ſome may ſtick
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35191:9"/>
upon them, and themſelves may be <hi>accounte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A true Reſolution of this Query, would ſerve
at once to clear up the Reputation of ſeveral; that
in all appearance were decoy'd into this Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Craft of others, and that followed the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Steps, as the innocent Men did <hi>Abſolom in their
Simplicity,</hi> not knowing any thing; and at the
ſame time hereby we ſhould ſee, a little of that great
Guilt that lyes on ſome Men's Conſciences, who tho'
they would be thought Reverend Men, are ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of having themſelves laid open: But let ſuch
conſider that the Secrets of their Hearts will one
Day be diſcovered, then it will be known with what
Spirit and Aims this ſcandalous Pamphlet was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
In the mean time, I profeſs to you, Sir,
(and you that know my Diſpoſition, will believe
me, whatever others think) that nothing but the
higheſt concern for <hi>abuſed Truth,</hi> would have drawn
me to ſay all this, and thus to have expoſed Men
whom, but for the undeceiving of the World, I
would rather have been unconcern'd with, as well
knowing he that touches upon the failings of the
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> is like to have the barking of all the Dogs
in the Pariſh. But I muſt be of the ſame Mind
with <hi>Luther,</hi> quoted in their <hi>Preface,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">To think
Truth to be of ſo ineſtimable a Value, that it's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Heaven and Earth be blended together in Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
than that the leaſt Duſt thereof ſhould periſh.</q>
