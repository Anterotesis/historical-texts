            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ABout two or three months ago a Noble Lady gave me your Book with a Letter that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed it to me, wherein after some ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities I was desired to peruse the Book, and made hope I should reap great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from it; and indeed if I had not learned from the Inspired Preacher that <hi>there is nothing new under the Sun,</hi> or had been easily catched to believe Novelties, a Title and Preface that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised so much should have made me apprehend I had got sent me the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers stone in Divinity; and truly so short, so sure, so easie and so general a Method as you think you offer for curing and preventing all distempers about Religion, deserved to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with equal degrees of Joy and Astonishment. What a happiness were it to Mankind after all the expence
<pb facs="tcp:66350:3"/>
of Bloud, all the toyl and sweat of Care, all the Speculations and Labours of the Learned, and the Industry and endeavours of Statesmen for resolving the doubts and difficulties about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to find a shorter and a safer way to get out of that trouble? But as the high pretences and promises of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giricks make sober people afraid to meddle with them, and do oft bring disesteem and neglect on the Medicines, because they are overvalued: so I am afraid your Book shall have the same fate with clearer and unpossessed minds.</p>
            <p>And I must confess my self strongly prejudiced against these hudling Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, so that I always apprehend some Legerdemain from them. And the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of your Book did very naturally lead me to this thought, it being a form of Speech we in <hi>England</hi> call a <hi>Bull, A Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way to convince without any Dispute,</hi> for a Rational way of Conviction is when upon a full hearing and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all can be said on both sides of any debate, the evidence of Reason deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines our perswasion. And to form an
<pb facs="tcp:66350:3"/>
opinion after we have only considered the grounds of one side, is as unequal and unjust, as for a Judge to pass sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence when he has heard but one party. Now Disputing is only the considering with an even ballance what all parties say, and the suspending our Verdict till they have finished their Evidence. It is therefore no Rational way but a blind and unreasonable one that bars Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; nor can it be a Conviction, but only a prepossession when we are led into any Opinion, before all that can in reason be said hath been examined by us. But I suppose by Dispute you meant the eager and hot contests of wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Disputants, who espousing a party do with all the tricks and disingenuities of Sophistry and the petulant Incivilities of rude treatment, manage debates as persons more concerned for glory and victory than for truth; and rather than confess an escape and disclaim an error, will with all the trifling arts of their embased Logick, defend every thing which either they themselves have once said, or that party they adhere to has maintained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66350:4"/>But as I passed from your Title through your Preface to your Book, I must freely confess I did not find in it such fair and clear Reasoning as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; and I saw you had a great deal of reason to avoid Disputing: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a blind easie yielding to what you delivered could save your Book from being rejected. And this seemed to me so obvious, that I judged it needless to engage in any Answer to it, and so laid it aside. But a few days ago a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and learned friend of mine told me many wished some would be at the pains to Answer it, and desired me to do it; and when I told him how it was brought to my hands, he thought I was under some obligation to send you the reasons that lay in my way and kept me from yielding to this new Method of Conviction. I was the more easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, that my present circumstances did leave me at a greater freedom of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of my time than I have enjoyed for some years.</p>
            <p>The starched formality of Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is as much out of esteem with me, as out of date in this freer age; but it was
<pb facs="tcp:66350:4"/>
natural to address this to your self though utterly unknown to me, by any other Character than what your Book gives of you, and so I am in no hazard of making personal reflections. I shall first give you my sense of your Method in all the Six points you go through, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take any notice of what is in your Preface, which I shall consider last of all, and with the same breath shall offer a Rational way of managing all Disputes about Religion so, that after a full hearing of what may be said we may arrive at a clear and well grounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in matters of Religion. I hope you will consider what I go to lay before you with a mind calm and undisturbed, and believe that in this I am acting the part of one who is sincerely</p>

            <p>NOthing doth give both occasion and nourishment to Error and Mistake more than the being prevailed on by the heats of fancy without bringing them under the severer tryal of Reason; nor do our Imaginative powers in any case more certainly impose upon us, than when they present Notions to us which do at once surprise with their novelty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light with their apparent usefulness: and none are sooner catch'd with such a bait than men of Speculative heads, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to Disputes and to the little tricks of Logick; for they being habituated to so many Axioms which pass among them for sacred Truths, think, if they can found a discourse on some received Maxim, all is sure work, and have not distinguished aright betwixt the Colours of Truth which Wit, Eloquence and Sophistry can by a
<pb facs="tcp:66350:6"/>

               <hi>Plato</hi> thought the Study of Geometry a necessary preparation to
<pb facs="tcp:66350:6"/>
the understanding the higher Mysteries of his Philosophy: So I have often judged an acquaintance with Mathematical Arts and Sciences a fit and almost necessary preparation for a right understanding and managing Theological debates; since these teach us to distinguish Critically betwixt truth and falshood, and practise a man into an exact considering of every thing that is proposed to him.</p>
            <p>The want of this, or at least a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in it appears in <hi>J. K</hi>'s late Book, wherein he thinks he leads his Reader in a Mathematical method through a great many Propositions, every one of which he imagines he has proved, beginning from a very plain unquestioned one, That some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is True, and ending it in a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one, That every thing the <hi>Roman</hi> Church teaches as an Article of Faith must certainly be True. Undoubtedly if his method be good, that Church is infinitely beholding to him for its support, having offered an easier and clearer method for bringing the world under her Authority than any yet thought on. This he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes as firm and sure of all sides; and by
<pb facs="tcp:66350:7"/>
a clear way of Analyticks offers a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Theorem or Problem in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity even to the giving the Quadrature of that Circle their Church is forc'd to run round in, proving her own Authority from the Scriptures, and the Authority of the Scriptures from her own Testimony.</p>
            <p>I shall without any further Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enter into a survey of the Six Points proposed by <hi>J. K.</hi> to be proved, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the unwariness of his expressions in any of them; in which though he lies of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten open, yet it is of so little importance to quarrel about Words or forms of Speech, that I shall not stand upon them: being also careful to avoid the engaging in any debate that may be personal betwixt him and me, and therefore shall confine my discourse to the Six Points he has gone through.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>. K. thinks he hath proved the being of a God, by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of Reason, <hi>If some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be true, then this is true, That there is something better than another; which if any man deny he denies himself better than an Ass or a Block, and so is either a mad man or a fool. Now if something be better than other, then there is a best of all things; and every thing is better as it comes nearer that which is best, and this best of all things is God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Des Cartes</hi> is blamed by many for having left out all other Arguments for the proof of a Deity, setting up only One, which how strong soever it may be, it is a great injury to the Cause he maintains to seem to slight all other proofs may be brought for so sacred and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental a truth: Yet his establishing that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a good and solid Foundation doth very much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66350:8"/>
qualifie any guilt, which is rather to be imputed to the over-valuing his own Notions than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed betraying the Cause he undertook. But upon this occasion the Reader may be tempted to sever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>structure are so ill laid, and both the Antecedent and Consequent of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prove equally weak.</p>
            <p>And in the first place, how is it proved, that some things are better than other things? or does any imagine the Atheists will admit that? On the contrary they deny there is any thing morally good or evil, and ascribe all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of good and evil to Education, Custom, the several tempers and interests of men. And indeed did they acknowledge the Morality of Actions, they should yield the full half of the Debate, that men ought to be good; which would clearly make way for proving all the rest. And these men, will without any hesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acknowledge themselves no better than Beasts or Blocks, as to any moral goodness. They will not deny but Matter is more refined in a man, the Contexture better and the Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness greater than in other Animals: but as to any moral goodness they plainly disclaim it. As though Wood be never so neatly wrought in a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and useful Cabinet, yet is no better so than when it was an undressed Plank as to any moral goodness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66350:8"/>Thus it appears that <hi>I. K</hi>'s ignorance of men makes him stumble in his first attempt, nor is his next more successful; for though some things be better, it will not follow there is a best: for of every sort of Beings there are some Individuals better than other; but from that it does not follow there must be a best of that rank or order of Creatures: because one Horse is swifter, one Dog better scented, one Lyon stronger, therefore must there be a Horse swifter than all others, a Dog the best scented of any, and a Lyon stronger than any other Lyon? This may be applied to all the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Creatures: for all the goodness these people admit, being only a better temper of more nimbly agitated Matter, though one thing excel another, it is not because it comes nearer the best of all Beings, nor because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes further from the worst of all Beings, but because it is more wieldy, more apt to serve the several uses and interests of men; without rising higher to consider any Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gestion and the most constant health.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66350:9"/>Besides, though an Atheist did admit there were some beings Morally better and worse, this does not prove there must be a best of all Beings; for he may say that as naturally as Colours fit the eye and Sounds the ear, so some Notions of good are suitable to the minds of men, and their being better and worse is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their keeping more close to these No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, discerning them more truly and following them more constantly: so that as a man sees well when his eye does present objects to him in their due Colours and distances, yet this proves no Deity; in like manner a man is better or worse as he discerns and follows these common Notices more or less exactly.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have considered this Argument, and have found it so weak on all sides, that no weight is to be laid on it at all. But all this while I have been put to act a very unpleasant part, when I did but seem to defend Atheism from any objection is brought against it; but I know nothing that does more prejudice a good cause, than when it is maintained by arguments palpably weak and unconcluding; for it makes many overly considerers, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly those that are already byassed and partial, imagine it has no more strength in it than what it receives from the Arguments by which it was proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since no conclusion (as such) can have more truth in it than was in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises from which it was deduced. If therefore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66350:9"/>
the proving of a Deity be made good, by an Argument so fallacious that it must needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear such at first view, one that is wickedly partial may from that be sortified in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed hopes, that there is none, because he finds that so much feared truth is so weakly asserted. But that I do not leave the Atheists in a vain triumph, or seem to weaken so good a Cause, by blowing away any reasons brought for it without substituting other and better ones in their room, I shall here say a little for the conviction of an Atheist.</p>
            <p>First then, all men are desired to consider there is no Argument that can so much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove there is no God, or that a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme being infinitely perfect is impossible; for all the Atheists offer at, is only to weaken those Reasons from which the belief of a Deity is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: so that still it is possible there may be a God. And from this every man will see cause to retire his thoughts inwards to consider what danger he is in, if there be a God and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to deny and despise him; and if it be possible there be a God, for ought he knows there may be one, since he has no reason to be assured of the contrary.</p>
            <p>If upon this he yield so far as seriously and with even ballances to weigh what shall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him, he is next desired to consider if he find not within himself the secret appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66350:10"/>
of a Supreme invisible being, if the fears of offending him, the desire of his assistance, the joy in the opinion of being acceptable to him, do not often spring up in his mind, and this even after all attempts to stifle and repress them. Nor can this be only the effect of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for every man finds by experience that all other things which he sucked from his breeding can by a little care and attention be so quite forsaken, that no visage of the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression shall remain. Since therefore these thoughts stick closer, there must be somewhat more than Education in the case.</p>
            <p>But this will appear stronger if a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the thoughts and common sentiments of all Nations and Ages as far as either History or writings can lead us up, with these stirring within his own breast; where finding that all mankind have agreed in the belief of a Deity, he must needs be convinced there is some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt his Soul and these thoughts from which he is not to be shaken, though he meet with some few in this or former Ages who have denied or doubted this truth, for these can never be set up against such vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as have agreed in this belief, who have been always the most sober, most serious and considering persons, who have cultivated all Arts and Sciences, and advanced the good of Mankind more than the whole Tribe of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines and Ruffians, who having abandoned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66350:10"/>
themselves to their sensual appetites and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and neglected the improving their minds in any thing that is either Great or Good, are not to be put in the ballance with the Religious. What have they ever done to better Mankind? On the contrary their Maxims dissolve all the Nerves of Government, and all the duties we owe one another; and they being buried in their brutal lusts, have lost that clearness of discerning which men of more sober tempers have: nor do they ever converse with their own minds, but study to guard against serious Thoughts, as effects of the Spleen and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and the dissoluteness of their Lives as it depraves their Understandings, so it makes them partial to those Notions, that may give them ease and sleep in their licentious practises. And thus he that consults his own thoughts and the common verdict of all Mankind, will be made acknowledge a Deity.</p>
            <p>And if he open his eyes to look on the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world, this will furnish him with many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to believe an invisible power that made it. If we consider the Revolutions of the heavens, the interchanges of day and night, summer and winter, the figure of the earth, its division into Sea and Land, by which all Nations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate what they abound in to others, the inequalities of Hills and Valleys, the Lakes and Rivers that moisten the earth, and give drink to Anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>s of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66350:11"/>
the Earth, the great variety of Plants and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables with their several uses, besides the more inward riches of the Earth, Mines and Minerals: what man of common sense can ascribe all this to Fate or Chance? But the Structure of Animals, the Organs of Sense, the Vessels of Concoctions, the various Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the skilfully disposed Channels for conveying nourishment to all the parts of the Body, raises our wonder higher which, is at its full height when we examine the parts of mans Body, which amazed <hi>Galen,</hi> and made him sing a Hymn to his Maker, upon so astonishing a Meditation. If the Brain and seat of Memory and Imagination be considered, what a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing thing is it to find such a substance the Receptacle of so many various Impressions as make up all the words of every Language we speak, the figures of all persons, places and things we have seen or considered, and that all these be so well disposed that we can draw them out when we please in so ready and natural an order, and also that all words flow so easily through our Mouths?</p>
            <p>Now this must either be the effect of Fate, or Chance, or of an intelligent wise Being. Not of Fate, for beside that they cannot explain what that Fate should be, every thing that flows from a Natural Cause must always operate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> way; but the great diversities of mens Tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers, Apprehensions and Judgments, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66350:11"/>
difference of their Faces, Eyes, way of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Writing and Walking shew that they are not the effects of Fate. Nor can so much Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and parts so useful and well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>disposed, have run so together by Chance, which must needs be unequal and unconstant. So that mans Formation must owe its Original to a wise Being; and that this is not the wisdom of the Father and Mother, every one knows: therefore there must be some unseen wise Being that created the Universe, and did not only at first set the several parts of it in those Channels wherein they still run, but does continue to mould this Matter according to the designs of his Eternal mind.</p>
            <p>All this receives a further Confirmation from the many sudden changes of the Course of Nature at the command of some extraordinary persons who have forced her out of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Methods and Operations, which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstration there is somewhat Superior to Matter and Motion, which can over-rule and govern it. This having appeared often in the sight of many thousands of discerning and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial witnesses, who have both confessed and attested the truth of what they saw and heard, we have no reason to doubt the matter of Fact, and as little to question the being of a Deity who is Master of the world, and can do in it and with it what he will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66350:12"/>Thus far have I considered upon what true and solid grounds the belief of a Deity must rest, which are indeed such that we need not the help of any little piece of Sophistry to maintain them; they require only a serious and thinking temper to examine and weigh things in a fair and Rational way, without either the prejudices of Education or the partialities of lust and interest.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> It is considered, if <hi>J. K.</hi> proves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly that there must be some true Religion.</head>
            <p>THE next step <hi>I. K.</hi> makes, is to prove that there must be a true Religion, which he defines, <hi>A Doctrine that teaches men in what manner God will be worshipped by them, and in what matters he will be obeyed by them.</hi> Now he proves this, <hi>for if there be a true God, we ought to worship him in what manner he will be worshiped by, and obey him in what matters he will be obeyed by us, as subjects and servants reverence and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bey their Soveraigns and Masters. Therefore if God be the best and greatest of all things, we are his subjects and servants, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is</hi> the <hi>supreme Governour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;</hi> and this he thinks none <hi>who grant a true God can deny, and this way of Worship must be assigned by God and men must know it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the substance of what <hi>I. K.</hi> says on this head, which is so extremely weak and ill proved that I am amazed he did not see it. For he must remember he only pretended there was a Being best of all others. Now though that were true, it will not follow from that,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66350:13"/>
that I must Worship or Obey God, much less that I am his subject and servant: all that will follow being only, that I ought to esteem him the best of all Beings; but why Adore or Obey him, and why am I his servant or subject?</p>
            <p>Adoration and Obedience can only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted as acts either of Justice, Gratitude or Interest. If any have a right to my Worship or Obedience, they are due to him in Justice; or if he have put such Obligations on me that these are but a proportioned return and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of them, then they are due in Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; or if he be able to confer extraordinary favours, or inflict most severe punishments, then the avoiding his displeasure and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his favour are necessary on the account of my own Interest, and so I must study to please him by Worship and Obedience: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this will follow if it be only proved that there is a best of Beings, which is all <hi>I. K.</hi> attempted.</p>
            <p>And hence it was that though the <hi>Epicureans</hi> acknowledged such a Deity as he thinks he has proved, yet they denying both Creation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and another State, did throw off the care and thoughts of Religion as the effects of fear and superstition. And <hi>I. K.</hi> defining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be <hi>a Doctrine teaching us to worship and obey God so as he will have us do, goes to prove there must be a Religion, because if there be a</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:66350:13"/>
               <hi>God, he must be Worshipped and Obeyed so as pleases him.</hi> Now this being his definition of Religion, and by consequence all one with it, he proves that <hi>if there be a God, there must be a Religion,</hi> thus: <hi>if there be a true God, there must be a true Religion.</hi> And how Sophistical a way of procedure this is, common sense, not to say Logick, does make appear. And thus he is again unhappy in this his second step.</p>
            <p>But as in the former Section I judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary to substitute some better proofs of a Deity than he gave; so I shall now offer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome stronger Arguments to prove there must be a Religion. And first, if God be the Creator of all things and the Author of our beings, as was already proved; then we are his subjects by that right of Creation and owe our Nature, Reason and Life wholly to him. Therefore as in justice we ought to acknowledge this by our thankful Praises and Adorations; so we ought by the same justice to give our selves up to him, and do and suffer what he will have us do and suffer. And this is confirmed by those impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Awe and Reverence which, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved, the greatest and best, nay and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the worst part of Mankind feel on their hearts. Which with the checks and pangs of Conscience for sins, shews how Religion is natural to the Soul, and proportioned to our faculties. Again, if God created the world and all things in it, he must uphold, preserve
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66350:14"/>
and govern his own workmanship, which the regular course of Nature, with the dayly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of it, do demonstrate. And it is no less clear from the extraordinary and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous interruptions and changes, which by his great power are given to the common course of Second causes. Now if there be a supreme Providence that watcheth over all humane things, and from whose care all the blessings o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this life flow upon us; then we ought to make returns sutable to such favours, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise implore the continuance of them.</p>
            <p>Finally, if there be a God that made and governs all things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e must be both so good and so just as to protect and reward all who trust in him and serve him, this being the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural result of justice and goodness; and there must be some discrimination between those that worship and obey him, and those that do not so. Now this is not done in this life; for often those who Fear and Love him are in great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pains and Troubles, and live and die most uncomfortably, whereas those who disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and disobey him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are often in great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and esteem, and abound in all outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; nor is there any visible discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Life: yet that being inseparable from the notion of justice and goodness, it must certainly be done at some time or other. Since therefore it is not in this Life, it must be in another, therefore we must believe our Souls
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66350:14"/>
shall outlive this state. When likewise we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that Matter in all its subtilest refinings and nimblest motions gives no discoveries of Sense or Cogitation, and yet we feel a Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being within us, which we plainly perceive to be a Being different from Matter both in its actings and nature, we conclude there is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in us that must not necessarily die at the dissolution of this life. Which is confirmed from innumerable stories of the Apparitions of some Rational beings separated from Bodies which in all Ages and places of the world have aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and are as certainly attested as ever any matter of Fact hath been. Which shews, that there are Beings distinct from Matter; and that our Souls are such, their subtle reasonings both Metaphysical and Mathematical do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.</p>
            <p>Their surviving this Body is also gathered from their frequent ascent above material Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Phantasms in their Conceptions and Inferences; which shews, they do not so much depend on matter as not to outlive their union with it. In fine; The common apprehensions which all Thinking men, in all Ages, have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which appears in the greatest part of all both good and bad at their death, shews the belief of this is among those common Notices of truth which are born with the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:66350:15"/>From all which I may fairly assume, That there is another state in which our Souls sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving their union with our Bodies shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded or punished as they have deserved well or ill at the hands of the great Creator and Judge of all men. And therefore if our own interests touch us or prevail upon us, and the apprehensions of future rewards or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments work on our fears or hopes, we must carefully avoid all dishonouring, disobeying or offending this God; and with the same care we must study to acknowledge our beings are of him and for him, and that all the blessings of this Life are the effects of his Bounty, for which we must thank him; and adoring his blessed Attributes and Perfections we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our whole Lives to his service: that so we may still enjoy his favour here, and in the next life receive the rewards of good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful servants.</p>
            <p>And thus upon good and solid foundations I have built up this proposition, That there must be some true Religion.</p>

               <hi>CHAP III.</hi> It is considered if <hi>J. K.</hi> proves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly that there must be some true Revealed Religion.</head>
            <p>J. K. goes on to prove this Religion must be Revealed, which he performs thus: <hi>How can we know Gods will unless he Reveal it to us either immediately or mediately? For na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion teaches only in general that we ought to Worship and Obey God, but does not teach the particular manner or matters of this Worship and Obedience: therefore there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of this Revelation. Yea, if God had left this to the Choice of every one, yet at least that must be revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Reasoning <hi>I. K.</hi> hath forgot a very necessary distinction of Revelation, into that which is communicated naturally to the Soul, and that which is superadded by some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manifestation or inspiration. In the former sence it cannot be denyed, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary there be a Revelation of Religion: but that is not what <hi>I. K.</hi> drives at. Now he must be very ignorant if he does not know that the greatest part of the Philosophers believed there were on the Souls of all men such inscriptions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66350:16"/>
of Truth, that if all should purifie their minds from the defilements Lust superinduced upon them, they should then clearly discern every thing that the Deity enjoyned them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they looked upon Inspiration as a degree of madness, which was only incident to weaker minds, whose imaginative powers were too hard for their reasons. And indeed they knew so much of the juglings of their Oracles, that no wonder they studied to detract from their Authority all they could. Now I desire <hi>I. K.</hi> will review his discourse, and see what strong or good reasons it offers for the conviction of those of this perswasion. So that his Argument proving only that God must reveal how he will be Worshipped and Obeyed, if it be replyed that it is done to all men by those common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of Truth that are born with their Souls, he hath furnished us with nothing to prove a further Revelation necessary.</p>
            <p>To make good this therefore against the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, it is not to be denied but if man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had continued in the purity wherein God did create our Natures, their Reasons were strong, but they themselves complained of a great depravation of their Natures, which they found were much prevailed on by Senses and sensible objects, by Education, Custome, Corporeal pleasure, and the power of Fancy. And for clearing of this they apprehended an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Prior state wherein our Souls for some
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66350:16"/>
trespass had lost their wings and plumes, and so were degraded into Bodies. This shews they found some corruption on their Nature from which they studied to emerge; and did indeed attempt most gloriously the recovering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their first original. This being then confessed that our minds are much darkned, and that our bodies, appetites and fancies are too strong for them, it will thence very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow, that as our reasons cannot discover all things to us, so that our way of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of divine things may carry along with it much of a body and gross phantasms.</p>
            <p>This was evidently demonstrated in that numberless variety of Opinions into which all Nations were divided about Religion; a great mixture of bodily phantasms, and gross plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures appearing both in their opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises about Religion. Nor was this only the fate of the Rabble, but both <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Varro</hi> have given us an account of the great diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was among Philosophers about the very Notion and Nature of a Deity. And if they differed so much in their thoughts of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and first Truth, into how many divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may we imagine they must have run about the other Truths to be deduced from that?</p>
            <p>Since therefore men did so grope after all the disputes and speculations of Philosophers in which there was no certainty, nor had any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66350:17"/>
of them such plenary Authority as to oblige others to submit to their decision; thence I infer the necessity of some clear and certain way for satisfying all mankind in things of so great and universal concern. The Speculations of Philosophers were neither certain nor (such as they were) evident to men of weaker un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings; the only way therefore to avoid this, was either to make such plain and glorious Manifestations of God's presence and pleasure as the <hi>Iews</hi> had on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> and in their most holy place, or to authorize some men by divine Inspirations to reveal God's will to mankind Now there is no impossibility in the notion of an <hi>Inspiration.</hi> For if we make known our thoughts to one another, either by forming such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound, or writing such Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters as shall convey into the ears or eyes of others Corporeal Impressions from which they may judge of our thoughts, which is a great way about and much more unintelligible (though we are very sure it is true) then that a spirit shall communicate its thoughts to our understandings, which it may either do by such outward impressions on our senses as bring the thoughts of other men to our knowledge, or without these outward objects may make the same Impressions on our Brain. And like to this, are the impressions made on us in sleep, in which we imagine we converse with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of sense. Or finally, without the means of any Corporeal phantasms, a spirit, especia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66350:17"/>
the supreme and soveraign spirit, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately convey to our understanding its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as well as our understandings do receive hints from gross phantasms, which is a great deal harder to conceive than this.</p>
            <p>Thus the Atheist can propose nothing that will prove there can be no Inspiration: but there is great necessity of guarding this both from the juglings of Impostors and the more innocent though no less hurtful deceits of our heated fancies, which may obtrude their Notions on us as Divine; especially in some in whom the Spleen or hysterical distempers may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce strange effects: therefore this must be well proved, and warranted before others are bound to acknowledge or submit to it, nor must the great heats and divine Raptures of the inspired person ingage our belief. We know how the <hi>Sibylls</hi> were said to be inspired, and with what Bacchick fury many heathen Priests delivered some of their Impostures; and it is dayly seen what strange appearances of inspiration are in hysterical persons. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be accompanied with such other extraordinary Characters as can neither be the forgeries of Juglers nor the vapours of the Spleen or Mother; and these are Miracles or Prophecies which are certain indications of some extraordinary and supernatural presence with the inspired persons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:66350:18"/>And thus far I have helped <hi>I. K.</hi> to prove the necessity of Revelation for the ascertaining mankind of the Worship and Obedience that God requires, and have met with the great objections which Deists and other enemies to Revelation bring against it. But I now follow him to his fourth proposition about the truth of the Christian Religion.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> It is considered if <hi>J. K.</hi> hath proved convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly the truth of the Christian Religion.</head>
            <p>J. K. goes on in his Series of truths, and his next attempt is to prove the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. And indeed the Atheism that hath of late broke out in the world and in upon us, hath engaged so many excellent pens of all the parties and divisions of Christendom to stand up in vindication of our most holy Faith with so much closeness of Reason, that it may be justly a problem, whether that pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous contagion hath not occasioned as much good to Christian Religion, by the many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Treatises have been writ for it upon that account, as it hath done hurt by its own venome. But to see <hi>I. K.</hi> manage so glorious a Cause so poorly and so faintly, after all that light which these Books offer, does justly raise Indignation; and it is plain he was afraid to bring out the strongest proofs for it, lest it should appear there was much more to be said for the Verity of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than can be for the Roman: but <hi>I. K.</hi> being resolved to prove there was no more to be said for the one than for the other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would manage this Cause faintly, that he might maintain the other more strongly, and so it seems cares not with how slender Evidence

               </gap>e assert the truth of Christianity, so that the truth of the Roman Religion be but as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputed.</p>
            <p>His great Argument for its truth is, <hi>That it hath been miraculously propagated, which could not have been without true and real Miracles, and these are manifest proofs of that truth which they confirm. Now since Christian Religion, though it contains Mysteries far above the reach of humane reason, and severities contrary to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inclinations, yet has been propagated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Arms or humane enticements, by men of themselves unfit for so great a work, and hath overcome other Religions which were both well established and preached liberty and pleasures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then this was either done with Miracles or without them; if with them, it is confessed there were Miracles; if without them, such a propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation must be confessed to be a Miracle.</hi> This is the substance of what <hi>I. K.</hi> brings for the proof of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>But this alone cannot satisfie a considering mind. For it is acknowledged by all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Religion, that the power of evil spirits is very great, and far above ours; so that Miracles cannot determine my belief, since there must go somewhat previous to that. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> told the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> that though a Prophet<note place="margin">Deut. 13 1.</note>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:66350:19"/>
by a Sign or wonder did amuse them, and upon that perswaded them to go after other gods, they should not hearken to that Prophet, but put him to Death. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that if an Angel from<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8, 9.</note> heaven should preach another Gospel, he must be anathematized. So that Miracles or other extraordinary apparitions do not prove a Prophet.</p>
            <p>Therefore the first and great Argument for the proof of the Christian Religion is, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Doctrine, and the holiness of its precepts, which are all so congruous to the common Impressions of nature and reason; and this must prove, (as our Saviour himself taught us) that his Miracles were true ones, and not wrought by the Prince of Devils, since his Doctrine<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Mat. 12. 24, to 31.</note> is opposite and destructive of his Interest and Kingdom. And our Saviour also asserts the truth of what he said, most commonly from this Topick, that he came not to do his own will but the will of him that sent him, that he sought not himself nor his own honour, but his Father's.</p>
            <p>Again our Saviour asserts his authority from the Prophecies of <hi>Moses</hi> and the other inspired persons of that Dispensation, whose predictions of the <hi>Messias</hi> did all agree to him and receive completion in him. And from these our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66350:20"/>
often silenced the <hi>Iews;</hi> and this is to us still a strong Argument, that these Books which the enemies and blasphemers of our Religion have still kept as sacred, and had among them for some thousands of years, do give such clear and evident Characters of our Saviour as their <hi>Messias,</hi> as must needs convince every serious and sober enquirer.</p>
            <p>These are the chief and great proofs of the authority of our Saviour, by which we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that all the mighty works he did, were by the presence and wonderful assistance of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine spirit. And for the Miracles themselves <hi>I. K.</hi> would resolve all our certainty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into a miraculous propagation of Christianity. So that if there be no other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way to prove them, then if Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had not been so propagated as it was, it could not have been made out that it was true; and if so, what must have been the strong Arguments used for it before it was so propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated? Either these were convincing or not; if they were not convincing, then it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by weak and unconcluding Arguments, we cannot be bound to submit to it or believe it; if these Arguments were convincing, we either know them, or we know them not; if we know them not, how can we judge they were convincing? if we know them, then we may be as well convinced by them as those were to whom they were at first proposed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66350:20"/>The great Argument the Apostles offered was, that our Blessed Saviour wrought many Miracles in the sight of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that he being dead and laid in the grave was raised from the dead, and after a long stay with them on earth they saw him ascend with great glory to Heaven; of all which they were witnesses. Now these being matters of Fact so positively attested by so many eye-witnesses who were men of great probity, (that could not be cast on the pretence of their being hired or bribed, there being no interest could lead them to give that testimony but only truth, all other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations deterring them from it) there was good reason then, and remains so still to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this true, whether the world had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it or not. And I will ask <hi>I. K.</hi> what if the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had rejected their testimony as well as the <hi>Iews</hi> did? yet if these sacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings had been with a most Religious care con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed down to us, had we not been bound to believe the Gospel? certainly we had, for the Apostles were men, who upon the strictest tryal of Law must be admitted as competent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; they were well informed of what they heard, and saw for a tract of three or four years; they were plain simple men who could not in reason be suspect of deep designs or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances; they in the testimonies they gave do not only vouch private stories that were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in corners, but publick matters seen and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66350:21"/>
known of many hundreds; they all agreed in their testimony, so that the fumes of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly could not lead so many into such an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mistakes. Their testimonies if false might have been easily disproved, the chief power being in the hands of their enemies, who neither wanted power, cunning nor malice. And in fine, the truth of their testimony ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in their constant adhering to it, from which neither imprisonments, whippings, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, no not death it self could divert them.</p>
            <p>From all which it is as evident as is possible any matter of Fact can be, that their testimony was true, and this discourse must hold good whether the world had received and believed their report or not. Which was the more fully confirmed by the miraculous operations of the Apostles in the name of Christ, by which they did cast out Devils and cure all manner of diseases; and to this they appeal in their Epistles and Acts which were published at that time wherein had the matter of Fact not been true, they had been branded as bold and impudent Impostors.</p>
            <p>We have also a Series of Books in all Ages citing the Writings wherein these Testimonies are contained; by which we know they were written at that very time. And the Apologists for the Christian Faith in their Apologies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the wonders that were still wrought for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66350:21"/>
confirmation of the Faith; nor can we imagine, that men of common sense, not to say Modesty and Ingenuity, would have appealed to proofs that were slender and false in matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>Thus we see that great confirmation of our Saviour from his Miracles is made good by another way of proof than by the propagation of it, which I do not deny doth very strongly make out the truth of all, yet is rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent confirmation of what hath been said, than an antecedent argument for proving it. So though it be far from my thoughts to weaken this way of confirming Christian Religion, yet it is plain that an extraordinary propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not infer the truth of the Doctrine, though it be allowed it was done by Miracles; since we cannot be assured these Miracles are wrought by a good Spirit till we first consider the Doctrines they confirm, whether they be good or not. It doth also appear that the truth of these Miracles is made out abundantly to us, abstracting from the way of propagating them.</p>
            <p>But in end we must a little examine what this way of propagating them was, and we shall find that notwithstanding all the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and lesser persecutions of the <hi>Iews,</hi> of the derision of the Philosophers, of the prejudice carnal lusts and appetites laid in the way; and above all, of the violent oppositions given it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66350:22"/>
by the Roman Emperors who spared no cruelty for a Succession of three Ages and ten Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that hell or hellish men could devise for destroying it: yet it prevailed, and in a few years did spread to the astonishment of the world; and all other Religions were not only overthrown by the many Converts were daily flocking in to the Christian Church, but by the ruine of these very Religions. Judaism fell to the ground by the subversion of their Temple, and the total ruine and dispersion of their State begun by <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and compleated by <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Hadrian;</hi> nor could their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts though cherished by an apostate Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour succeed for the rebuilding their Temple, Heaven and Earth combining to break off the work. Heathenism did also receive a mortal blow, by the silencing the Oracles upon the beginnings of Christianity, which were the great supports of that Religion with the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. And the exemplary lives, the heavenly Doctrines, the mutual Charity, and the noble Constancy of the first Witnesses and Martyrs of the Christian Faith, wrought not a little on all that beheld th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, even on such as were very partial and byassed against them. And the Christian Religion being thus universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as it is a very full demonstration that these Miracles were no forgeries, but known and approved truths: So also it confirms in us a belief, that there was an extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God in these beginnings of Christianity,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66350:22"/>
assisting and animating those Converts of all Ages, Sexes and Qualities to adhere to it under all the discouragements and sufferings they were to pass through, whether occasioned by the irregular appetites of their own carnal lusts, or by the outward oppositions they met with.</p>
            <p>And thus far I have considered how the truth of Christian Religion can be made out against the opposition of Atheists, Infidels or Deists. Hitherto I have waited on <hi>I. K.</hi> in the survey of these Truths about which we are agreed, and I hope, upon a review of what we have both performed, he will not deny but I have strengthened his Positions with the accession of many more, and better Arguments than any he brought. So that if he be in earnest zealous for these four great Truths, he will rejoyce to see such a supplement, to what he had so scantly proposed. But I am afraid (and perhaps not without reason) that he knowing how weak his Arguments must needs be for the two posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that follow, and yet designing to impose on the Reader all the Six as equally certain, he would needs disguise the first Four, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them so weakly guarded, that the proofs of all the Six might be of a piece. But I have hitherto helped <hi>I. K.</hi> henceforth I quit that part, and go to enter in a down-right opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him in what remains.</p>

            <p>J. <hi>K.</hi> now comes to that which he drove at all along and proves it thus: <hi>If Christian Religion be true, then that Religion which has the same proofs that it hath, at least any of them that are solid, must needs be true. Since then the miraculous propagation of Christianity is a common, solid and evident proof of its truth, therefore the Roman Catholick Religion must be true since it is solidly proved by the like propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for though it contains very hard Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it above the reach of humane reason, as Transubstantiation, and some very hard Precepts and Counsells, as Vows, Fasts, Confession, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition for Priests to marry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet it hath been propagated over a great part of the world without the help of Arms or humane Enticements, by strangers who have converted Nations from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism to embrace the Christian Faith, as S.</hi> Austin <hi>the Monk did in</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> Xave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>in the</hi> Indies, <hi>and many others in other places, which can be manifestly proved from History, nor can any exception be made against it, which the enemies of Christianity may not make against the</hi>

                  </gap>f brought for the Christian Religion. And to use S.</hi> Austin's <hi>dilemma, This propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Roman Catholick Religion was either with or without Miracles: if with Miracles, it must be true, since confirmed by Miracles; if without them, then no Miracle is greater than this propagation. By which it appears, we have as good ground to be Roman Catholicks, as we have to be Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time I suppose it is clear enough why <hi>I. K.</hi> would bring no better proofs for the Truth of the Christian Religion; and now he thinks he has gained his design: but what I said in the former Section has undermined this Fabrick, since it is made out that the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous propagation is neither the only nor the chief proof of Christianity, but that before we believe even the Miracles of our Saviour to be of God, two things were to be made out; the one that his Doctrine was all holy and such as tended to the glory of God; the other was, that all he said and delivered agreed with the Prophecies had gone before. So by the same rule of proceeding we must first see that all the parts of the Roman Religion are holy and such as tend to the glory of God, and then, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Witness the present year with all the favours and Indulgences to such as go to the thresholds of the Apostles? What a patrociny to impenitence is their Opinion, of a simple Attrition being sufficient for the Sacrament? And the whole trade of their penances and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions looks like a design to quiet all mens Consciences, let them lead as bad lives as they will. Besides, who can believe that to be a true Religion, that has tolerated a great many Casuists who have found out distinctions to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse men from all the duties they owe God and their Neighbour? and have studied to satisfie men in the most impious and immoral practises? A woman that entertains common and avowed Prostitutes will never be thought an honest wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though none could prove her self guilty of any base act. So that Church that not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains but cherishes those who have studied to discharge mankind of all sense of Religion and Vertue, can never pass for a pure Church. Nor does the Doctrine of that Church tend wholly to the glory of God as our Saviours did; for what greater dishonour can be done him than to Worship him in a way which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66350:25"/>
has so often condemned, and never since allowed, by the representations of Pictures and Images? And that instead of addressing their Adorations and Prayers to him by his Son, have found out a great many other Mediators both Angels and Saints and the Blessed Virgin? Surely this is highly to the dishonour of God, when the Souls of people are turned off from their Faith, and dependence on him and his blessed Son into a trusting to and calling on Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and when instead of that plain simple and rational Worship that is sutable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature and pleasing to him, the mimical pageantry of a Thousand little apish practises and an unknown Worship are brought into his Church.</p>
            <p>If we likewise consider and measure the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion by the second great Topick by which our Saviour cleared himself, which was his appealing to the Scriptures, we will quickly find good reason to suspect them guilty there, since they study nothing more than the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing and concealing the Scripture, and by all means labour to prove it an incompetent rule to decide Controversies by: And yet I am sure, <hi>I. K.</hi> will give me no reason to prove the Scriptures an unproper rule for deciding Controversies, and that we must submit to the verdict and decree of the Church, that might not with more strength been made use of by the <hi>Iews</hi> against our Saviour. And if I carry
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66350:25"/>
this consideration as far as it will go, it must necessarily lead me to compare all the Doctrines of the Roman Religion with the Scriptures; And as if our Saviours Doctrine had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> there had been no reason to have believed him for all his mighty deeds, which in that case might justly have been imputed to evil spirits; so now should an Angel from heaven teach any thing contrary to this Doctrine and Gospel, he must be anathematized, even though he wrought mighty wonders. Therefore we are with the <hi>Bereans</hi> to examine all new Doctrines, by their conformity to the Scriptures, and till that appear, we are not to look on any thing they do as miraculous. And thus far, I hope, I have said enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>I. K.</hi> that though what he says of the miraculous propagation of the Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were true, it does not from that follow that the Religion it self must be true. But I go next to convince him how much he mistook himself in his account, when he asserted that the Christian and the Roman Religion were propagated in the same manner, and shall first examine his grounds.</p>
            <p>His first Branch of the Comparison is, that as the Christian Religion contains some high Mysteries in it above the reach of humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so does the Roman Religion in holding Transubstantiation. He did well to distinguish this from the Mysteries of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

for it is indeed none of them; nor is it above humane Reason as he calls it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it and not at all to be compared to the Mysteries of Christian Religion, as the Trinity, the Incarnation and the Resurrection. The last of these contains nothing in it that may not be Rationally enough conceived as very possible and easy to Divine Omnipotence; for the other Mysteries that concern God, it is no wonder those be above our understandings, since the divine Nature is so vastly exalted above all our depressed Notions of things, and therefore is not a proper object for our Faculties. So no wonder we cannot frame such clear conceptions of his Nature, as to give a distinct account of it to our Reasons. But a material object pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to our senses, is proportioned to our Faculties. And therefore we must either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the clear evidence our Faculties give us of the Bread and of the Wine, after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, or turn Scepticks for ever, since full evidence to our Faculties is all can possibly be offered for our conviction; and if that in any case fail, it is in no case certain. So that if our Senses fail in this, we have no reason to receive any thing upon their Testimony; for a noted Liar in one thing is to be believed in nothing, even though his lie had been discovered by a divine Revelation. Now if we weaken the evidence of Sense, all the authority of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion which it received from the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles will be weakned, for these were only known
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66350:26"/>
by the Senses of the spectators. And so far of the first branch of the parallel.</p>
            <p>The Second branch of the parallel is, that as the Christian Religion enjoyns diverse severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to embrace Crosses, to Love our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to Mortifie our passions; so also the Roman teaches very hard precepts and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, as Vows, Fasts, Confession, prohibition for Priests to Marry, to which <hi>I. K.</hi> adds an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Christian Religion does indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand diverse duties contrary to our natural appetites, but those are things of themselves Morally good and such as do highly perfect our Natures: But the Roman Religion has made a shift to find means for voiding all these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred obligations, and to set a great many little trifling performances instead of them which have no tendency to the purifying of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or the bettering of Mankind. How much they have detracted from the obligation to all the severer, and unalterably Moral Duties of Christianity hath been already (and shall be more fully) laid open, if it be called for, though that be needless, it being so clearly done by many better Pens; but for those they have substituted in their room, let us a little consider these <hi>I. K.</hi> mentions, and to begin with Vows.</p>
            <p>We do not deny that the first design of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries in the primitive Church was excellent,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66350:27"/>
but it quickly began to degenerate into idleness and superstition, which S. <hi>Ierome</hi> though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined enough to the severities of that course of Life, hath fully told us. But how they did afterwards sink into all the Corruptions imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, all Histories inform us. And whatever may be said for such Houses, as either Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries for the Church, or Sanctuaries for those that are no more able to labour in it; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the entanglements of Vows is a yoke which none can be assured he shall be able to bear. We ought to Vow and pay our Vows unto God, and therefore should be sure to Vow nothing but that whereof the execution is in our power. Now when we Vow to serve God, which we do in the Sacraments, we are assured of the aid of the Divine Grace to assist us in the performance. But to Vow things which we are not sure to perform, our tempers being so liable to Change, that what agrees with them at one time, becomes an intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and snare at another, is certainly to cast our selves headlong into many temptations. And what unnatural and brutal lusts have abounded in these Houses, we read a great deal more than I am willing to repeat. What a cheat is the pretence to poverty in those Orders which have got such vast Riches that they are become the envy of the world, as the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine,</hi> the <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Government to allow, much more to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage such swarms of idle fellows, who shall always go rambling and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging about, and do not work<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 11.</note> that they may eat. And for<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 10.</note> their obedience what a rack it may be under a Tyrannical Superiour, and what an engine it may prove for Sedition and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, I leave to all to judge.</p>
            <p>In a word, all such severities as tend to the subduing our lusts and passions are good and sutable to the spirit of Christianity; but for overcharging men with new burdens (which signifie nothing but to create a perpetual trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and constant scrupulosity) is to abridge them of their Christian liberty without cause, and tends to swell them up with pride, and a lofty opinion of their meriting by such practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and a contempt of others, who though they bear none of these voluntary assumed burdens, yet are more meek, more humble, and more charitable, and in all things more conformable to the life and doctrine of our Blessed Saviour. And if voluntary severities be a character of a true Religion, the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of <hi>Diana Taurica,</hi> the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> the <hi>Montanists,</hi> the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cratites,</hi> and many other heresies might have put in a fair claim since they abounded in them</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:66350:28"/>From your Vows I go to your Fasts. God forbid we should disclaim Fasting which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did so much recommend, both by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Commands: we acknowledge it a powerful mean, both for mortifying all bodily lusts, and for disposing the mind to prayer, and all other spiritual exercises; and therefore we do not allow these to the Roman Church as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them. And I do not believe any of them will justifie the corruptions they are pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably guilty of in the observance of their Fasts, which are generally only a change of diet, wherein no severity nor strictness is to be seen. Wine is liberally drunk, the most delicate Fishes with the most exquisite way of dressing them are sought for, and no other mixtures of higher Devotion appear on these weekly or annual returns.</p>
            <p>For Confession, I know no Christians that deny the usefulness of it; but the setting up the necessity of Auricular Confession, as it hath driven out of their Church the primitive and publick Confession with all the ancient disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which was indeed the great glory of those Ages, and the chief preservative of Piety, and good manners; so, as they have it among them, it hath been one of the greatest engines of Hell for driving out of the minds of men all sense of the duties of a holy and good life. I do not deny but some Priests among them make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66350:28"/>
good use of it; but those being very few, it does give but a small allay to the gross corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which even many grave and pious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their own Communion complain of and condemn. Shall I here mention the giving Absolution, and admitting to the Sacrament upon Confession before any part of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be performed, the trifling Penances are often enjoyned, the taking Confessions from persons unknown, the receiving it when it is apparent they are only reciting their sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Compunction? And for Contrition they confess it is not necessary. Now the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that Church being perswaded that if they Confess with a little Attrition, and be Absolved and receive the Sacrament, they stand clear and innocent in the presence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatever their former life have been, or their present temper may be; Is not here a very sure way to defeat the whole design of Religion and Holiness, when men are taught so ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie a way of getting into the favour of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of and forsaking their sins? And thus it appears that in the Roman Church Confession is no severity, but a thing very grateful to flesh and blood.</p>
            <p>The last particular <hi>I. K.</hi> instances, is the prohibition of Priests to Marry. Truly if to reckon that impure, which the holy Spirit of God hath declared honourable in all without exception, be a great sublimity, they may well
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66350:29"/>
glory in it. Our Saviour recommended Cell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate only to those who were able to receive it; but the Roman Church will force all in Orders to receive it whether they can or not. And though S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it one of the Characters of a person fit to be a Bishop, that he has been married and educated his children well (which I shall not stretch so far as either the <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Russian</hi> Churches do now) and does not at all command him to abandon her, and has elsewhere condemned that in all persons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, <hi>except it be for a time in order to fasting and prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 4, 5.</note> and conform to this the primitive Church did not require the Clergy to abandon their wives, but on the contrary did condemn such as did: yet the Roman Church has most tyrannically imposed this on all the Clergy. And although we read that God will judge Whoremongers and Adulterers, but no where that he will judge the Married; yet they have been very gentle to these crying scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals which continue to this day, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Concubinate when they condemned the Marriage of the Clergy. By which they shew they prefer the Traditions of men to the Command of God. And thus far I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined this Branch of the parallel <hi>I. K.</hi> makes between the Roman and the Christian Religion, wherein I have been longer than I intended, but as short as the particulars he named did allow. When he brings the rest of his <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66350:29"/>
doubt not it shall appear they are a sequel of such things which the same or the like conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations will clear.</p>
            <p>But I must follow his next step, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion hath been propagated over a great part of the world without the help of Arms or humane enticements, by strangers who converted many from Paganism (that allowed liberty) to their Religion, that teaches Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and Mortification.</p>
            <p>To all which I reply, That since the Roman Church is still Christian, I deny not but God may bless the honest endeavours of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that Communion, so that their labours may have great success on Infidels in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to Christianity; herein God blessing them as he did the Hebrew Midwives whose charitable tender hearts God rewarded, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Houses, passing over their lie. But <hi>I. K.</hi> must not insist on this as a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, otherways he will be driven into great absurdities.</p>
            <p>Did not the <hi>Arrians</hi> by <hi>Ulphilas</hi> his means who was a stranger to the <hi>Goths</hi> (that were a barbarous cruel and yet vastly numerous people) convert them both to Christianity and Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism at once? From whence we find the whole Roman Empire very soon overrun by Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism upon the Incursion of the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:66350:30"/>
and <hi>Longobards. Philostorgius</hi> does also inform us that <hi>Theophilus</hi> an <hi>Arrian</hi> converted the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> to the Christian Faith. Did not the Greek Church when it was broke from the Roman, convert many Nations, the <hi>Bulgars,</hi> the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and many other northern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms?</p>
            <p>In fine, what will <hi>I. K.</hi> answer according to his own Argument to the great progress of the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the opposition they met, and all the persecutions their followers suffered, yet did so strangely propagate their Doctrine, that before half an Age went about, the greater half of the Roman Church fell off from the Obedience of that See, to their Doctrine which holds all the Mysteries of the Christian Religion, and there was no need of more, and instead of all the Juglings the Roman Priests had brought in, teaching men an easie way to Heaven, did preach all the severities of a holy Life which our Saviour and his Apostles taught? And as they taught a severer course of Life to all Christians (I do not speak of the particular severities of some Orders in the Roman Church, but what must be the necessary conditions upon which all may hope for Salvation) so they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced this without Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and under great Persecutions. And here <hi>I. K.</hi> must think how he will answer his own Dilemma, That either this was done with Miracles, or without them:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66350:30"/>
if with them, the Doctrine must be true that was confirmed by Miracles; if without them, that propagation was a great Miracle: and thus <hi>I. K.</hi> will find it hard to avoid the dint of his own Argument.</p>
            <p>Besides when <hi>I. K.</hi> speaks of the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Religion, he must not prove that from the propagation of Christianity by persons of that Religion, though the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments might at the same time have engaged their new Converts to the particular conceits of that Church. For (as it was observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) God blessing the sincerity of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours so that they made Converts to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine, that has so much to be said for it that it is a wonder all the world did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, it was not strange if those so conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted seeing the foundation of the Divine Mission of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to be true, did either in humble gratitude to their charitable Instructors pay them all the returns of acknowledgment and Obedience, or being ignorant of that Doctrine which was wholly new to them, did easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and imbibe any particular Opinions they might infuse in them, and so at the same time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Votaries to <hi>Christ</hi> and to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if <hi>I. K.</hi> will deal fairly and satisfyingly, he must shew us how their Religion, as it is distinct from the commonly received truths of Christianity, was so miraculously propagated,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66350:31"/>
and that in the points which we chiefly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, as the Supremacy of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with his being the Universal Bishop of the Church, the forbidding the use of the Scripture to the Laicks, and the Worship in an unknown tongue, the use of Images in the Worship of God, the Invocating of Saints and Angels, the belief of Transubstantiation, the Sacrifice of the Mass and the taking the Chalice from the people, the belief of Purgatory, the Treasure of the Church and Indulgences, with a long <hi>&amp;c. I. K.</hi> knows well that many have given very particular and full Histories of the rise and progress of these abuses with which we charge the Roman Church, and for which she having obstinately refused to reform them, on the contrary binding them on the Consciences of all with new and heavier Anathema's, we have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated our selves from her Communion. That those are not in the Scripture it is plain enough, and we will not decline a tryal upon all hazards by the verdict of the first four Ages.</p>
            <p>It is true, in the fifth Century the Incursion of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> did very much change the face of things, and bring on a black night of ignorance on the greater part of Christendom, which made way for gross Superstition, and the bold pretences of the Bishops of <hi>Rome:</hi> And <hi>I. K.</hi> is very much out in his accounts, that says the propagation of the Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was without Arms. Was not that dearest
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66350:31"/>
part of it, the authority of the Popes, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of many long and bloody wars in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Italy?</hi> And for their conversion of Hereticks, the third Decree of the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and the practises of the Inquisitions were the surest means of effectuating it. And what humane enticements were wanting to draw men into their Religion? The cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Kings as were firm to them, and the making over to them the Rights of their Neighbouring <hi>Princes,</hi> were pretty enticing baits. Witness their getting <hi>Pipin</hi> into the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> their inviting him and his Son to the Conquest of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Instances. And was there ever found out such an enticement for men of carnal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, who yet retained some belief of Religion, as the power of pardoning, indulging and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of penances? So that this whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>I. K</hi>'s fails him when put to the issue of a severe tryal, though it looked pretty smooth and fair to an overly considerer. But in end I will add a few considerations of the methods of the first propagation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and from these it will appear how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent those were from any thing the Roman Church can pretend to.</p>
            <p>First, the Propagators of Christianity went witnessing the truth of what was publickly seen and known without any other design of their own, either to engross power or riches. Now
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66350:32"/>
whether this be the method of the Roman Church I refer it even to their own Histories, if their great care hath not always been to get Ambassadors sent to <hi>Rome</hi> with the offer of their obedience and great submissions, of which nothing appears in the first conversion of the world to Christianity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the first Converters of the world studied to draw Mankind to a great acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the inestimable Blessings we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and to the making sutable returns by addressing our selves to the Father by him and living according to his Gospel. Now the greatest care of most of the Apostles of the Roman Church was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagare the worship of Creatures, to give Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons to whole Nations, and teach them to build Churches to those, and above all to the blessed Virgin, of which no footsteps appear in the first Conversion to Christianity: And instead of the strictness of a holy life and an humble cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable temper, they have set up a vast multitude of little observances, which may be received, and yet the life of sin remain still strong and in vigour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the first Propagators of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity studied by all possible means to wean people from all kind of Idolatry, and to make the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> serve the living God, and worship him in Spirit and in Truth. Now how far the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66350:32"/>
Roman Church hath declined from this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and that they have studied rather to change than overthrow their Idolatry, giving them little Pictures, Medals and <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> and Reliques for their worship.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, those that laboured first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the world to the Christian Religion studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make all understand what they taught them, gave them the Scriptures in their own tongue, and forms of Worship which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and could well make use of: But the Emissaries of <hi>Rome</hi> deny their Converts these helps, and so would hood them into a blind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of all they shall propose to them, and keep them still under their Authority, and so teach them Prayers in a tongue they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, those that first converted the world did by many Miracles wrought in the sight of all convince and convert them to the Faith, and these Miracles were grave useful actions, as the curing of diseases, the casting out of devils, the procuring them good seasons and other temporal blessings, and all this was done in the name and to the honour of Jesus Christ. But the Roman Agents wanting these real Miracles have betaken themselves to the shameful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries of strange Visions and Apparitions, and of ridiculous Miracles, with so vast a superfeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, that few even of their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66350:33"/>
can read these Legends of their grand Apostles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ithout a just disdain at such pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> impostures.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>xthly, the first propagation of Christianity was when there was no Secular power to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it or those who laboured in it; so that they exposed themselves to all the dangers of hunger and cold, of scorn and reproach; being assured of no supply not assistance from men: and yet God appeared so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xtraordinarily with them, that their success was plainly the work of Heaven. But the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming great Princes, sent out Agents to make new Conquests well furnished and powerfully supported, so that they went like Ambassadors from one Prince to another to treat an Alliance, wherein there was little hazard and great hope of success by the advantageous terms were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both sides. And therefore after <hi>Charles</hi> the great had conquered <hi>Germany,</hi> and was become a terror to the Northern Kings, the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> sent their Agents to labour in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, which was an easie matter and had no difficulty in it.</p>
            <p>And Seventhly, the first Conversion of the world to Christianity was signally the finger of God; since though it met with the greatest Opposition from the Secular powers and was persecuted every where and for many Ages, yet it prevailed: and though the first Converts
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66350:33"/>
were poor mechanical and simple persons, yet great wisdom and constancy appeared in them, to the amazement of the Philosophers and other persons of Eminence and Authority. But this hath not been the method of the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions which begun in a kind of Alliance with the Prince, who being convinced of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the Change did upon that oblige his subjects to it, not without severely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sometimes such as refused it; so far were they from being persecuted for it. If any one were by a fury or tumult killed, that does not alter the case nor make it a persecution.</p>
            <p>And thus it is apparent that for all the noise the Roman Church makes of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, they have managed them in a method very different from the way of the primitive Christians. How basely and barbarously it hath been carried on in the West <hi>Indies</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Guatimala</hi> did inform the world; and the Bishop of <hi>Angelopolis</hi> did within these few years inform the Pope how wretchedly the Jesuits continue to manage it to this day. And though we have little reason to believe the accounts given us from the <hi>Indies,</hi> since we see those who publish them are guilty of such Impostures in things nearer us and easily discovered, that we have no reason to credit them in things at so great a distance where the forgeries of their account cannot be found out; yet even from these a great many of the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66350:34"/>
made upon the methods of the Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Roman Church may be proved.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk <hi>I. K.</hi> cannot sure be so ignorant as to think we owe our Conversion to him; for whatever truth may be in the story of <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> it is undoubted we received the Faith at farthest in the second Century; and that it did overrun our Island farther than the Roman Conquest <hi>Tertullian</hi> witnesses. The Rites of our observing <hi>Easter</hi> do also prove we had not the Christian Faith by any sent from <hi>Rome;</hi> so that long before the time of <hi>Avstin</hi> the Monk this Island was converted. And that famed story of the Monks of <hi>Bangor</hi> as it proves what footing Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had then, so it shews how proud and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently cruel that pretended Apostle was. And it is apparent he was a man of an Ambitious temper, his great design on those of <hi>Bangor</hi> being to engage them to a subjection to the Pope and to comply with their Rites in the observation of <hi>Easter.</hi> But if what is delivered by ancient Historians of his setting on the King of the <hi>Northumberlands</hi> to destroy these Monks be true, he is to be looked on as an Emissary of Hell rather than an Apostle of Christ. Besides, the King of <hi>Kent</hi> to whom he came was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Christian Faith, that as he had married a Christian Queen, so he allowed the Christians a Church near <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And so it is no wonder if a Prince so prepared was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66350:34"/>
soon prevailed on. But <hi>Austins</hi> first coming to him with all that pomp of Crosses carried before him, has nothing primitive in it, and the fabulous Legends of the Monks are little to be credited.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have examined <hi>I. K</hi>'s proofs for the truth of the Roman Religion; and I doubt not upon a sober review of what hath been said, he himself will acknowledge he must see for other and better Arguments, before he can oblige any to believe the Roman Religion to be the true Catholick and Apostolical Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

               <hi>CHAP VI.</hi> It is considered if <hi>J. K.</hi> proves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly that every thing the Roman Church teaches as an Article of Faith, must be true.</head>
            <p>J. <hi>K.</hi> advances to his last attempt which is the finishing of the whole contrivance to perswade the belief of every thing the Roman Church delivers as an Article of Faith; for <hi>if that Religion be a true Religion, then it is free from all fundamental errors, and does erre against no fundamental point of Religion: and if that be acknowledged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it does not erre against this point that God is not the Author of any error or corruption whatsoever, that being unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably a fundament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l point. Now if the Roman Religion does not e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re against this, it does not teach that God is the Author of any error or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and if it do not that, then it teaches nothing as an Article of Faith which is either error or corruption: for whatever it teaches as an Article of Faith, is teaches as that which hath been delivered by God. This then may be applied to every particular Article of Faith which the Roman Church teacheth; for if that be either error or corruption, it teaching God to be the Author of it, makes him to be the Author</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:66350:36"/>
               <hi>of error or corruption, which is to erre against a fundamental point, and by consequence that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion shall be no true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by true Religion <hi>I. K.</hi> understands a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that has no mixture of error or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, then it is needless to prove that if the Roman Religion be true it hath neither error or corruption in it; for the proving it a true Religion must carry the other along with it. But if by true Religion be only meant a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that holds all the fundamentals of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, so that Salvation may be had in its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; then it is a most wretched Inference that it must be true in all it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> definitions of Faith. And to confute this I shall for once turn the Tables on <hi>I. K.</hi> and become an Advocate for the Roman Church, to shew they may be still a true Church and a true Religion, though they have a large mixture of errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. And this I do not so much out of love to them, but from a general principle of charity to overthrow this unmerciful Opinion that damns all men, as erring fundamentally, for believing any error in a matter of Faith.</p>
            <p>And let me first ask <hi>I. K.</hi> whether he takes the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to have had a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it? This sure he cannot deny if he read but S. <hi>Pauls</hi> first salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and yet in that Church there were various parties, some for <hi>Cephas,</hi> some for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66350:36"/>
               <hi>Apollo,</hi> some for <hi>Paul</hi> and some for <hi>Christ,</hi> and great difference of opinion there was whether <hi>Moses</hi> Law did oblige or not. Now these questions concerning Circumcision and the Law were matters of Faith, and in all contradictory opinions one must be true, another false; those therefore that were of the false side must by <hi>I. K</hi>'s doctrine be all irrecoverably lost, as being in a fundamental error, for each side be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his Opinion was of God. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught another doctrine, that whoso builds on the foundation Jesus Christ, shall be saved, though he build upon it wood, hay and stubble. And the distinction he there makes between those who build Gold, Silver and precious stones, and wood, hay and stubble, can only relate to sound and unsound Doctors, the one building good and useful Superstructures upon the foundation, the other teaching trifling Doctrines that will not bear the Tryal; and yet that both may be saved, is a plain demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against <hi>I. K.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Apostle also tells us that neither Circumcision nor uncircumcision availed any thing, and that in the new Creature there was neither Circumcision nor uncircumcision but Christ was all in all, and that one God did both justifie the Circumcision by Faith and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision through Faith; from all which it is evident that those of the Circumcision might be saved, and by consequence that their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66350:37"/>
Religion was a true Religion; and yet that their doctrine of Circumcision was an error, can be disputed by none who read the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> And it is no less clear that they held it an Article of Faith delivered to <hi>Abraham</hi> by God. So here it is plain that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in one breath both condemns this Opinion as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and yet allows Salvation to such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it. With how many errors doth S. <hi>Iohn</hi> charge some of the seven Churches? yet they were still the Churches of Christ.</p>
            <p>The Church in the second Century did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believe the <hi>Millennium</hi> as a thing revealed by God, which the Roman Church now calls an error; yet I hope <hi>I. K.</hi> will not condemn that Church as holding a false Religion. The <hi>African</hi> Churches held it necessary for Infants to receive the Eucharist, from these words, <hi>Except you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of man, you have no life in you,</hi> and this was approved by P. <hi>Innocent,</hi> and was continued many Ages in the Roman Church, as appears from the <hi>Ordo Romanus,</hi> and yet that Church has declared that not to be necessary, by which the Opinion the former Ages had of its necessity is declared an error: But it were a strange thing from that to condemn these as holding a false Religion. The <hi>Franciscans,</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> had hot contests about the Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Blessed Virgin, and both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Divine authority and Revelations, so
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66350:37"/>
that one of those must have held an error. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Iansenists</hi> believe Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Grace efficacious of it self, this the <hi>Molinists</hi> deny; both vouch Scriptures and the definitions of the Church. The <hi>Canonists</hi> Courtiers of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> have asserted the Popes Infallibility from Scripture and Councils, the <hi>Sorbon</hi> hath always rejected this. Now of all these different Opinions the one must be true and the other false, since they stand in the terms of a contradiction; and they have all vouched God and Scriptures for them: therefore those who hold the false side of the contradiction according to <hi>I. K</hi>'s reasoning must be of a false Religion; which I believe when he considers more maturely, he will find he mistook his measures in this.</p>
            <p>And in fine, his Argument will also hold as strong to prove that every Individual of a true Religion must be exempt from all errors in every Opinion whereof he takes God to be the Author; For <hi>I. K</hi>'s Argument will be as strong for every thing whereof God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Author, as for Articles of Faith. So that every mistaken sense of Scripture will turn one to be of a false Religion, since every mistaken exposition is an error; and yet that being thought the meaning of the place, God is believed the author of that meaning, and by <hi>I. K</hi>'s consequence of the error it self. From all which I may (I hope even by <hi>I. K</hi>'s leave)
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66350:38"/>
infer the necessary distinction between things that are believed to be errors, and those that are believed to be Truths. For the former, to vouch God the Author of what we know to be an error and corruption, is certainly so crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal that none of the true Religion can be guilty of it. But there be many things which (though errors, yet) any one may very innocently mistake for truths. I do not say the mistake does quite excuse the error; if the error be fundamental the mistake must be so too: But if the error be in a lesser matter, it is a lesser error; and it will never be made out, That, if one apprehending an Opinion true, embrace it, as come from God, and as an Article of Faith, if he is mistaken, in that he strikes at the divine veracity: for among men, who thinks that any wronged his veracity if another mistook his meaning, and understood his words in a different sense from what he intended and expressed? Certainly he who so mistakes, after the true meaning is cleared, cannot be understood to have fastned any reproach upon the Candor of him whose words he mistook, all the blame being to be cast only on his want of right understanding. This were indeed a hard case if all our mistakings of divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations did infer a charging God with error or corruption. But the thing is so clear that I am afraid I have spent too many words about it, and this Argument of <hi>I. K</hi>'s cannot but upon first reading appear to all that are accustomed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66350:38"/>
to weigh and examine truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be a piece of crude ill digested and ill palliated Sophistry.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I followed <hi>I. K.</hi> through those six points he imagines he has demonstrated, and have shewed how true the first four were, but how little reason there was to account them such for any thing he said for their proof, and how false the other two are. And I suppose he will acknowledge that if what is already set down hold true and be founded on good reason, I need not follow him through the rest of his Book, it being only a direction to his gentle courteous Reader how to manage this method of arguing so as to convince all persons that dissent from the true Religion, which he thinks is a Mathematical and sure way of proceeding, and such as no man can decline or avoid, and in end must be either convinced by it, or be forced to confess himself no better than an Ass or a block, which concludes him a mad man. I will not follow this with a railery that is as obvious as severe; but I love not to mix matters of sport with such serious purposes: therefore I follow <hi>I. K.</hi> no more through the rest of his Book.</p>
            <p>But come next to consider the great support of that cause which he manages both in his Preface and through the rest of his Book, that there can be no certainty neither about the true books of Scripture, the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66350:39"/>
or writings of Fathers, without there be a true Church and Religion agreed on, which shall both declare to us what Books are true and what not, and shall deliver their true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us: otherwise endless confusions must follow, which plainly appears in the many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of the Protestants and the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they are in about all Controverted points. From which the necessity of a true Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, as much as in a well ordered State there is not only a necessity of clear and good Laws, but of Judges to expound them.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the supposed Inconveniencies <hi>J. K.</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines in the want of a true Church to Iudge Infallibly, and of the right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of finding Truth.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing about which those of the Roman Church make more noise than the necessity of an Infallible Judge, and of the great and visible inconveniencies that appear from the want of it in those Churches that have departed from the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I have not long ago proposed a great many Queries to one of <hi>I. K</hi>'s brethren, in which I have set before him, the many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they must needs be involved in by clearing who this Infallible Judge must be; and I shall here repeat nothing of what I said then, but shall go on to shew upon what clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain grounds we may rest our perswasions about Articles of Faith and divine Truths.</p>
            <p>All Arts and Sciences must be acquired by some rules and methods by which a progress may be made from plainer things to those that are more involved and difficult; and if any would desire to understand any Theorem or Problem in Geometry without beginning at
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66350:40"/>
the Elements and advancing by <hi>Euclid</hi> or some other such methods, he labours in vain: So also if any would without more ado study to know a secret in Chymistry having neither learned to know the terms of Art nor the course of a process, he shall not be the wiser though one deliver him their best secrets. In like manner if a man will enter into the knowledge of Divine truth without any of those prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are necessary, he is in a wrong way; and the further he engages, he is the more out of the way; nor can he be ever in the right way till he begin afresh.</p>
            <p>It may justly seem strange that Christian Religion was so plain a thing when the Apostles first delivered it; that mean simple people, poor women, and an illiterate company should have understood it, and that it subdued a great part of the Roman Empire, before men of great Learning were Converted to the belief of it: and all the knowledge they then had of it was by the Sermons and Epistles of the holy Apostles which remain to this day. And though at this distance from that time, we may have lost the true meaning of some phrases, and we have not so particular a History of the state of the first Churches as might help us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand many passages that seem very dark to us: yet for the main of those Books they seem very easie and plain. We have also still so perfect a knowledge of the Greek tongue as clearly to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66350:40"/>
understand them. But after all this, Christian Religion is now become such a strange kind of secret, that men with all their Learning and Study can scarce understand it. Certainly we must have either changed Religion from what it was at first, so that it hath now put on a new face; or we are much mistaken in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of enquiring into it, and examining what things are revealed to us by God.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>the Natural man receives not the things of God, neither indeed can be for they are spiritually discerned.</hi> From which it appears that a Renovation of the mind from its natural mould, and its being transformed into a spiritual temper are necessary, as well for the understanding and discerning, as the obeying the things of God. Now all natural men may be divided into three Classes; either they are so immersed in senses and sensible things, that all their apprehensions are tinctured with the figures and phantasms which their senses and imaginations present to them, or they rise a little above this, but are so governed by the heats of nature and passion, that either their minds are rendred quite incapable of all serious thoughts, or so distorted in them that they do not discern them truly. But the highest ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the natural man is Reason, which hath a fairer appearance, and if rightly managed would certainly advance him to a spiritual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but being fed only with dry Notions and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66350:41"/>
trying them by a false touchstone, does strenghthen our errors, fortifie our prejudices and swell us with pride, and fret us with the itch of an unsatisfiable and useless curiosity.</p>
            <p>Now it will not be ungrateful, it is hoped, to propose the great hinderances all these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Modifications of the Natural man have given to the right understanding Divine truths, and to begin with those of the lowest form.</p>
            <p>One whose mind is immersed in sense, either believes nothing but what his senses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to him, or at least tinctures all his Notions with sensible objects. Thus the Atheist believes no God, because he cannot see him; and those of the heathens over whom the power of their senses was strong, yet not such as to overcome the Impressions of a Deity left on their Souls, did believe the Sun, Moon and Stars were Gods, being both dazled with the brighter splendor of the day and delighted with the fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shinings of the night. And finding both the pleasant Lightsomness, the warm Benignity and fruitful usefulness of their Beams, they did adore them as gods, and seeing strange effects answering some of their positions and aspects, they came to imagine all humane things were governed by them, and so framed an entire Theory (if so ill grounded a thing can deserve that name) of Astrology. Others much taken with the greatness and glory of brave Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66350:41"/>
and Princes, and having some Notion of the Souls Immortality on their minds, did think that after their death they governed this inferiour world; and to those Heroes they assigned Stars to dwell in, and those gods they represented either by some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Symbols, the chief whereof was Fire, or by some Statues, Pillars or other pieces of Sculpture, which at least represented that Deity to their Senses, if it had not some strangely Magical and Divine influence united or affixed to it. They did also prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticate all future things either by the flight or feeding of Birds, or by the inwards of Animals.</p>
            <p>Here then a Religion entirely framed from the Conceptions of the Natural man, in its lowest depression; and their gross Notions of Religion made them both prejudiced against the <hi>Iews</hi> who worshipped nothing but a Celestial Deity, and more against the Christians whom they called Atheists because they had none of those sensible representations or ways of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but their Faith was plain and simple.</p>
            <p>But as the Natural man did thus corrupt the notices of natural Religion, it did no less em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base the Christian Religion. When many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men were engaged in the profession of it, either by <hi>Education,</hi> Custom or Interest, who loathing its simple purity did study so to dress it up that it might gratifie their natural minds by bringing in the worship of deceased men, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66350:42"/>
by worshipping them by Images, Pictures, Reliques, and at length making Pictures for the Deity it self, and by dressing up all the parts of Religious Worship so as to amuse and delight the senses, by affecting an outward gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur in Processions and other Festivals, and in the greatness of their Priests, chiefly of their high Priest: all which were visibly the effects of minds deeply engaged in sensible things, to whom nothing appeared sacred or solemn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it had been adorned with all the exquisite deckings of Art and Industry; and judging of piety by some heats which were raised in the fancy by outward objects presented to it, studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fill all the parts of Worship with such rites as might make either a glorious shew for amusing the worshippers, or some melting ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der impressions for cozening them into an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their being divinely elevated.</p>
            <p>But after that by the blessed providence of God Religion was in many parts of the world refined from that dross, yet the sensitive part of the natural man did not give over its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for embasing Religion; many still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to place all their Religion in forms, and bestowed that Zeal which should have gone to the advancing true piety, holiness of life and Brotherly Charity, to the adorning and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining those. Others thought they had pretty well escaped this whole danger, being got into an extream very opposite to it of vilifying all
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66350:42"/>
forms; but the Natural man did act in their sensitive powers though in another method: for though they had emerged out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or Influence of their outward senses in matters of Religion, yet their inward senses and imaginations, (which are the rebound of sensible impressions upon the understanding) prevailed much on them. These therefore came to think a voluble way of pouring out soft words with great heavings of the natural mind, was a mighty thing, and gave themselves wholly to this, so that the conceiving and hearing long Prayers and Sermons, especially if accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with tenderness in the thoughts and great meltings in the fancy, was thought the highest feat and elevation of Religion: though it plainly appears to a man of a severe and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Reason, that all this is but an illusion of the fancy heated by some fervours of the mind. And yet they upon these deceits of their fanciful thoughts have separated themselves from all regular forms of Worship, because that gratification of new words was necessary to feed their devotion.</p>
            <p>Another great mischief of this distemper is, that such persons judge that as long as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy these heats, all is as they would have it; and this will readily continue as long as they are put to do nothing displeasing to them: so that whatever they do, be it never so contrary to the Laws of Religion; yet if with that they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66350:43"/>
can but keep up these heats, they judge either that what they do, is not at all a sin, or at most such a sin as being a branch of necessary infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, may consist well enough with Grace, because it can live with those fervours; and if any thing quench them, (which it is like every thing that displeases them may do) then they throw it off as carnal. Thus they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure all things by these fluctuating and inconstant motions, and as that temper is volatile and of all others the most subject to change; so the inequalities they are in, are looked on as the flowings and ebbings of the divine Spirit; and the heats they feel sometimes being ascribed to the divine Spirit, every thought which drops into their minds when under these actuations is taken for a divine Revelation, and followed and given out for such; and the coldness and dulness which must of necessity follow these heats, is thought a withdrawing and desertion of the divine Spirit. Whence follow sad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and perplexing scrupulosities, which do often mightily afflict some devout but weak minds, and bring up an ill report on Religion, as if it were sullen and morose, and led men into dejection, and perpetual anxiety. And this humor as it swells up the mind into a mighty conceit of its own eminent and exalted piety and to a contempt of others, so it doth often carry on those who are imposed on by it, into strange conceits, making them apprehend they are obliged to nothing but as they are inwardly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66350:43"/>
moved to it. And thus they would supersede Reason and give themselves up to their fancies under a conceit that they are acted by a divine Spirit; whereas it is but an impulse of some vapours of the grosser and more terrene parts of the natural man rarified by the heats of the Brain, and the fumes of Melancholy into a thin and nimble agitation.</p>
            <p>The next power of the Natural man, is in his passions and appetites, which being suited to the contexture of his Bloud, Brain and Spirits, have a mighty influence on all his thoughts, and chiefly on those that relate to Religion. And first these carrying him with a strong impetus to many irregular desires to which Religion if believed must give a stop, he is from that made first to question, then to doubt, and at last to deny there is a God, because his appetites are too dear to forgoe them for the belief of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour power or the hopes of another state. And it is an easie thing for any man to bribe his Reason to believe what he has a great mind to perswade himself of, either by diverting his thoughts from seriously considering the thing proposed, or by looking only at the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be made to this belief without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining what may be said for it, and by living in a perpetual disorder, which both darkens the mind and keeps out all serious thoughts from it; upon all which there may by the just judgment of God follow a searing of the Conscience and a blinding of the mind</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:66350:44"/>But if the power of Religion and the witness God hath in our Breast, prove too hard for all this opposition, then the next attempt of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and lust is to misshape these notices of truth into such a figure as may best agree with their desires. And thus the Heathens corrupted all the evidences of natural Religion, and set up such Deities as were guilty of the most furious passions, and the most ungoverned lusts of all sorts; and this being once done, no wonder the worship of those gods was of a piece with the opinions they had of them, and that they devised such Sacrifices and services as might agree best with those Deities. It was also a very natural result of this opinion that they should conform their lives to their gods, and so they were secure of patrociny and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when they were to commit the basest villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And no wonder this prejudiced them at Christianity which they saw taught all its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to be severely vertuous and pious; and therefore they complained that Christians came to disgrace their gods, and to turn them from the Religion they had received from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>But afterwards when the world rushed into the Church, the passionate and lustful parts of the natural man finding nothing in that Faith for their shelter, yet studied to doe the best they could for their own preservation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66350:44"/>
insensibly men were turned from minding the great things for which Christ died, and rose again to place all their care on other thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which might well be maintained without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a passion or mortifying a lust. Some did set up highly for opinions, others for forms, and by a curious improving those hoped that their other faults should be more easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, both by God and man. Afterwards a great many notions were found out, if not for a direct defence of those disorders, yet for palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating them, and allaying the grief for them. A devotion to Saints was one great Engine; the opinion of many sins being expiated in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, together with the belief of the Popes power of Redeeming from it, was an universal Medicine for all diseases of Conscience. Then the dispensing with Vowes, Covenants, and most of all Duties was a great ease to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man. There were also some new coined duties of Religion which did agree well with their passions, such as fighting for Religion against Infidels, Hereticks and others that were excommunicated by the Pope, and a violent persecuting of all, who in any point departed from the received Opinions: And their Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confessions, easie Penances, and ready Absolutions were sure and Infallible means to reconcile them to Religion after it was so debased as to meet them more than half way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:66350:45"/>But when a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from those more apparent Impostures, the natural man did not for all that give over his practising upon Religion to frame it to his own taste; and a fondness on some reformed Opinions, with a Reverence for the Persons of the Teachers, came to be set up by many as all they drave at. But cunninger Arts were also found out and some sacred truths did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly become so abused as to be made the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses of sins, especially as they were stretched by the corruptions of men, which were much encouraged by many unwary expressions of some hot Divines, who in the eagerness of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute had said many things that were not to be justified. Hence it was that the Doctrine of Christs dying for sinners, and being their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, by which the guilt of their sins was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated and they reconciled to God, was used by many for a security for men to sin as pleased them, so they but trusted to Christ; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause perfection was not attained in this life, it was held unattainable and sin insuperable. Nor could men be much afflicted for sin nor guard diligently against it, who believed they were inevitably led and determined to it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when that was thought done by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and fighting for Religion against the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority was also by many made a great demonstration of their zeal for God and Religion, and a surious bitter zeal against all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66350:45"/>
who departed from their Opinions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the one hand or to the other, was looked on as a great evidence of Grace and Love to God. And it is plain in many persons Religion does not so much mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their passions and lusts as palliate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise them, or at most change their object but not their nature. Men of Cholerick disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions placing all Religion in an eager, violent, yea and if need be, a bloody maintaining all their Opinions about matters of Faith. The melancholy men put it all in abstraction and recluseness, valuing themselves much upon it, and undervaluing others that were not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired. Others of a more sanguine Complexion finding either great excuses for all their levities and follies, or if more serious, turning all their thoughts to the dressing up some pretty Notion. And thus men not forming their minds by the dictates and precepts of Religion, but framing it according to their own tempers, so as might best suit their inclinations, did hold the truth in unrighteousness. And thus again the natural man did adulterate the notions of Religion which are spiritually discerned.</p>
            <p>But the last and greatest (because both strongest and subtilest) assault that Nature made upon Religion was by the misguidings of ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and ill managed Reason. The former prejudices were more visible and could not be so well defended; but this was managed with a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66350:46"/>
deeper cunning. And first the great value that the Masters and pretenders to Learning and Reason had of themselves, made them scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reject all Instruction, stiffly maintain all they had once asserted, and despise every one that differed from them. Hence it was that the Philosophers broke into so many divisions, being as is apparent mightily swelled in self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, so that they scorned to yield to one another, but employed all their wit and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to justifie their own Notions, how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd soever. Now this is the temper in the world the most incapable of instruction; and this their pride they carried higher, laughing at all Inspiration as a kind of madness, which therefore they despised and thought that their Reason was able to penetrate into the deepest and secretest mysteries. And as this occasioned a numberless variety of opinions, so it made them despise the first preachings of Christianity, in which as there was none of their Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal canting; so poor illiterate men delivering it, they who valued themselves on their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and their noble generous tempers, rejected it with scorn, which was fed with the contempt they had for the first Converts, who were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such as they called Barbarians, or men of mean Education and Employments.</p>
            <p>But after an Age or two many of those were by the prevailing progress of Christianity Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Faith, and did for some Ages
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66350:46"/>
very good service to it. But diverse of their Successors retaining the old temper of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, the debates about Religion begun to be managed with an unyielding ambition, and Anathema's were the common sanctions with which they imposed their Opinions. And at length one of the Bishops assumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and Successors the absolute authority of judging and deciding all Controversies, which (though the most unreasonable opinion in the world, and that which destroys the free and right use of Reason: yet) was brought in on the highest pretences of Reason, as the only mean to end all disputes.</p>
            <p>And when a great many errors were visibly got into their Church, and some rose who with all the evidence of Reason imaginable laid open these and pressed them to disown and reform them, they continued in their stubborness, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied their Anathema's, and wreathed all their errors in one Chain, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> had done the Law of God, and imposed all without mercy. And for doing this they brought their Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries, whom they had educated in Nurseries at fencing, cudgelling, and the other discipline of Pen-slaughter and Ink-shed. These School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had been well trained to dispute about every thing, and stubbornly to maintain every position how trifling or how false soever with all confidence and earnestness, were brought to give Battel, and they as Mercenaries who
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66350:47"/>
expected good preferments did fight it out most obstinately; nothing was too disingenious for their confidence, no Author was so spurious but they would vouch his testimony, no place of Scripture sounded favourably to their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions but (though it had been never so plain that it was to be understood in a different sence) was brought as a certain proof, no maxim of the Schools, no old fustian distinction was left out to maintain the Fight; and as some after the greatest defeats have impudence enough to pretend a Victory, so that art was not omitted by them, but loud acclamations of Victory were made, when all free discerners saw they were quite routed; and the rudeness they had learned in their Cells was brought out with them, for they managed their disputes with all the roughness of expression, the most petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant insultings and the most barbarous railings.</p>
            <p>Nor does this charge fall only on one side of Christendom, though one Church be most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously guilty; but the Disputants of all sides have for the greatest part managed their debates with that acrimony of stile, those severe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives and the catching up some escapes of inconsiderate Pens, as if they were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for Glory than for Truth. Besides that every one swallows down an entire system of that party to which he hath offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and all must be defended without that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity which becomes inquirers into divine
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66350:47"/>
truth. Nor do most men take their opinions from the sacred Oracles, but from their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and the Catechisms and Confessions they have been accustomed to; and being thus prepossessed go to the Scriptures to seek proofs for their opinions, being resolved before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to defend them and to make the Scriptures serve their turns; which if they will not do easily, they will so stretch them upon the rack by their forced Criticisms or consequences, as to make them confess any thing though never so plainly contrary to the clear meaning of the words. And it is evident that men thus blown up with pride are resolved to justifie all they have ever said, though to the cost of throwing off all candid and fair dealing, saying things that no man of common sense would say if he were not strangely byassed. And indeed we dayly see things brought for the proof of many opinions which are so visibly weak and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that it is scarce possible to think those believed them that said them; but that being resolved to stand to what they once asserted, some mist must be raised for keeping up their reputation, and imposing on weaker and more credulous Disciples. And thus it must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as men are led by their pride to be stubborn in all their reasonings about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Another great abuse of Reason is a needless curiosity about things that either are of no
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66350:48"/>
great importance, or are wrapped in myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious darkness; into which if men will pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, their Conjectures and Discourses must turn to impertinent Cantings and Nonsense. Thus the Philosophers disputing about the nature of the Deity and of the Soul, do fall into unintelligible niceties and Cabalistical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of Numbers, of which no account can be given, but that they would seem to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what where they could say nothing. And this curious subtilising carried along another mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief with it, that they rejected every thing of which they could not give a distinct account, and therefore called S. <hi>Paul</hi> a babler when he told them of the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>But when some of the Philosophers became Converts to Christianity, both these effects of this curiosity did appear; some studying to make out the high Mysteries of the Faith from their Metaphysicks, and to reconcile them to the Platonical Notions, in which any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Reader will see a great deal of needless and very ill proved and worse applyed curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. This appearing both too curious and ill grounded to others, was no small occasion of their rejecting those Mysteries, or at least framing them so as to agree with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of things; and both seem to have had too la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a share of this oversearching humour, and of not believing any thing but what was made out to their Reasons: the one party
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66350:48"/>
pretending they did understand the Mysteries, and the other denying them because they could not understand them.</p>
            <p>What subtleties were used in explaining those incomprehensible doctrines any that hath conversed in those writings must needs know, and how they were opposed with the like subtleties. Whereas had all sides adored the divine Revelations without engaging into these discantings, they had held the simplicity of the Gospel, and acted more like true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Philosophers; since it agrees with the strictest reason to acknowledge our faculties are limited, and so not fit to comprehend the divine Nature, nor the operations or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of that Supream being; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must believe with all humility what himself hath been pleased to reveal to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself, without either doubting the truth because we understand not what is so far above us, or engaging into over curious searching into that which it appears from our limited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, and the general terms of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation God intended should be still a Mystery to us. But indeed the Schoolmen have thought it below the height of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouring minds and great Learnings to stick at the explaining all Mysteries, and as far as hard words and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable niceties will go, they have given us a very satisfying account of all Mysteries, by which we know neither more nor less than
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66350:49"/>
we do without them. Whether this may not have led many over curio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s enquirers into the contrary extream, I shall not determine, but this is plainly an abuse of Reason on both hands.</p>
            <p>The humour of enquiring into all subtleties did quickly bring into the Church a superfeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unconceivable Mysteries. For every bold conceit that any (who had so much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to be well followed) took up was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently given out for a Mystery, and then it was sacred and must not be touched; and if any did offer to examine it, he was scared with the bugbear of a Mystery. So that Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, the treasure of the Church, the way of the Popes Infallibility, together with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand devised Mysteries in all the pieces of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, were cramm'd down the throats of all Christians, and many being justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by these pretended Mysteries, and seeing the other great Mysteries made the engines of obtruding these on the world, were thereupon by an unjustifiable and an immoderate use of the Counterpoise led to the other extream of denying all</p>
            <p>And with how great nicety of Argument have even the Reformed managed many high mysterious points, as the derivation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, the Order o the Divine decrees, with the nature of the aids and assistances of Grace,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66350:49"/>
which have been canvassed with a very search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curiosity? and as dark as these must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to be, yet they are delivered with as much dictating and imperious authority, as if these Authors had been caught up to the third Heavens. Many other niceties are also found out to exercise their curiosity; yet if it rested there the hazard were not so great, but these are all made Articles of Faith, and all who are not satisfied about them, are barred the Communion of the Church, and so no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there be endless heats and debates.</p>
            <p>The occasion of this curiosity and itch of disputing may be perhaps not unjustly derived from the contentions and endless wranglings of the Schools in matters of Philosophy; in which men being accustomed to that game of disputing and subtilising about nothing, and going from those studies to Divinity, and carrying that same temper, and fiery edge along with them, they made all that work about it which hath now so long divided the world. They being also by a long practice habituated to many Maxims and Axioms which were laid down for rules not to be enquired into or denyed, came really to believe those were true, and to carry them along with them to all their Theological debates. All which will appear very evident to any that compares their Philosophical and Theological works, from which many of their strange inferences and positions did take their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66350:50"/>
rise, and I am afraid do still receive their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have discoursed of the several prejudices the powers of the natural man do lay in the way of our apprehending and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aright of Divine truths; and the common notions of the moral Philosophy will concur to teach all men that before their minds can be rightly qualified for the understanding any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual truth, but most chiefly Divine truth, we must abstract from all those figures of things, which our senses present to us, and rise above all grosser phantasms. It is no less necessary that our thoughts be serene, and free of passion, that we may freely and at leisure consider what lies before us, without the Byass of precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinions or interests. And it is equally rational with these that we have modest minds not vainly puffed up with an opinion of our own knowledge, but tractable and docile, such as will not stick after clear conviction, to confess and retract an error, and that we proceed in our reasonings closely and on sure grounds, not on vain conjectures and maxims taken up meerly on trust, but by a clear progress ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance from one truth to another as the Series of them shall lead.</p>
            <p>A man who is thus prepared must next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider all was said in the first four Sections, with a great deal more to the same purpose; That
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66350:50"/>
he be on good grounds perswaded there is a God; that there is a true revealed Religion, &amp; that the Christian Religion is the true Religion. These things being laid down he is in the first place by earnest Prayers to beg God's direction to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him in all his enquiries, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will not be wanting if he bring with him a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere &amp; well prepared mind, not byassed nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed; and of this we may be well assured both from the Divine goodness and veracity. For as he hath promised that whoso seek shall find; so it is a necessary consequent of infinite goodness to assist all that sincerely seek after life and happiness: but if any come to this study without he be duly prepared, he has himself to thank if he fall into errors and mistakes.</p>
            <p>The next thing an exact searcher into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion must labour in, is once to observe the nature of Christianity and the great designs of it; and in this he is not to follow the small game of some particular and obscure passages, but to observe through the whole New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what was the great end of all our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour spoke and did, and his disciples testified and wrote. If once we comprehend this a right, it will be a thread to carry us through particular disquisitions. For as there be many natural truths of which we are well assured, though Philosophy offers us some Arguments against them, in the answering which we are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66350:51"/>
not able to satisfie our Reasons; so there may be some divine truths very certainly made out to us, and yet there may be places of Scripture which seem so to contradict those truths that they cannot be well answered.</p>
            <p>Again, a serious Enquirer will see good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe the Scriptures must be plain, evident and clear, since they were at first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to men of very ordinary parts and of no profound understandings and learning; therefore he may well conclude those strange Superstructures some have reared up for amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the world, can be none of the Articles of Faith necessary to be believed.</p>
            <p>And as the first Converts were honest simple men, so our Saviour and the Apostles spoke in a plain easie stile, therefore all these forced Criticisms and Inferences by which some more ingenious than candid Writers would expound them in a sence favourable to their Opinions, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e not to be received, since these do often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the divine discourses rather like the little tricks of double-dealing and Sophistry for which an honest Tutor would severely chide his Pupil: words are to be understood in their plain meaning, and not as Logick or a nicety of Criticism may distort and throw them.</p>
            <p>If then a man will in this method (which no honest man can except against) go to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66350:51"/>
search of the Scriptures with a mind prepared, as hath been already said, he cannot fail of finding out all that is necessary for his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor is he to be doubtfully anxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true Books; for none denies but the Churches care in all Ages hath been the great conveyance of this; the many various Translations of all Ages and Languages (nay and different Religions) agreeing in all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial points, and the Citations out of those Books which we find in a Series of Authors who have lived in the several Ages since they were written agreeing likewise with the Books themselves, together with many ancient Manuscripts which do yet remain of a great many Languages, may abundantly satisfie even the most severe Inquirer, that these be the very Books which the Apostles delivered and were universally received by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
            <p>The matter of Fact being thus cleared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any necessity of running to the authority of the Church, all those scruples which <hi>I. K.</hi> with the rest of his Brethren would needs raise, do vanish, since they never distinguish exactly between a Witness and a Judge. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer nothing is required but honesty and good information, and we have the agreeing suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of many witnesses that do all agree in their Testimony of these Books, who though they differed very much in their Expositions
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66350:52"/>
of them, yet concurred in their verdict about the Books, and were checks on one another in the faithful preserving and transcribing them. In this sence we do receive the Churches Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as the necessary means of conveying these Books to us. But an Authority Sacred and Solemnly declared is required in a Judge, and this no Church can so much as pretend to but from the Scriptures. Therefore the Scriptures being received as Divine cannot depend on the sentence of the Church as a Judge, since all its Jurisdiction is derived from Scripture, which therefore must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged before it can be believed.</p>
            <p>But because there be persons of a meaner Condition and not Educated so as to make all the inquiry which is necessary in so important a Business, there is therefore a shorter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for such, which yet is as morally certain as any thing can be. Let then the simplest man in <hi>England</hi> provide himself of two New Testaments, one published by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> another by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as was that of <hi>Rheims:</hi> Now he knows well what animosities be betwixt the Divines of these Churches, and that they are engaged so hotly one against another, that they agree in nothing, but where the Evidence of truth especially in matters of Fact does bind them. And yet he comparing these New Testaments will find, that though the phrase, the position
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66350:52"/>
of words, and in some few places perhaps the sence varies, but upon a survey of the whole he finds that they do plainly agree in all matters of moment. So that from this he is perswaded that both have the same true Book which the Apostles did deliver to the Church; and the <hi>Iews</hi> agreeing with us as to the Old Testament, is the same Evidence to him that we have those very Books which were held Sacred by the <hi>Iews</hi> in our Saviour's time. And thus by <hi>I. K</hi>'s leave a man may be satisfied what be the true Books, without being assured which is the true Church or the true Religion.</p>
            <p>Being then assured about the Books and studying them in the method already set down, he shall be certainly directed by God to find out every thing necessary to Salvation; and this is far from setting up a private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to lead us Enthusiastically, but is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Reason and ingenuity that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men. For let me ask <hi>I. K.</hi> how the Decrees and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are to be understood? He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self says, the meaning of those is plainly and certainly to be known, yet every Reader must expound them to himself in that easie and clear sence which best agrees with the words. Is this therefore to set up a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate spirit to enterpret these Canons? I know he will say (and with good reason
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66350:53"/>
too) that it is far from it; and with the same warrant do I assert that the consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture according to the method proposed, is not to interpret it by a private Spirit, but by the clear conduct of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings directed by the divine Grace which is freely given to all that ask it.</p>
            <p>If after all this it be replyed, How is it then that there are such different Expositors and Expositions of Scripture? the Answer is plain, by sending back the Reader to what hath been said of the corruption of mens minds; and as long as men live so ill as they do, it is to no purpose to expect they shall think or understand aright. Besides, there be a great many things in the Scriptures which are not Articles of Faith, which every man is not bound to know and conceive aright under the hazard of Damnation, and about which there may be disputings and different Opinions without any hazard. If any set up particular Opinions in matters justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertible and of less moment, and impose these on all with severe Sanctions, and if he have Authority to cast all out of the Church Society that do not agree with him, or if he have not that Authority, if he do sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Communion of the Church because they will not receive or hearken to his conceits, he is a Schismatick; for a dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing and dictating spirit, if strengthned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66350:53"/>
with power, doth always lead to persecution, and if it want it, to separation.</p>
            <p>And thus I think enough is said for proving that the way to Salvation is not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain in our Church, since it is no other but that new and living way which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did Consecrate through his flesh. But in this we are strongly confirmed, when we find the ancient Martyrs, Fathers and Doctors of the Church going in the same Method, and by it Converting the Nations, enduring Martyrdome and giving glory to their most holy Faith and to its most holy Author, whose Decrees, when met in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and Doctrines delivered in their writings do so agree with Ours in all matters of Faith, that we decline not to put the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates between us and them to this Tryal. <hi>I. K.</hi> thinks we cannot know what Fathers or what Councils to receive, but by first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a true Church which must tell what Fathers and Councils to receive. But this being a matter of Fact, we are to judge of it as of all matters of Fact that were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted some Ages ago, and by the evidence of Testimonies are to find out the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Fathers and Councils, and their Writings and Decrees. We have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to decline the writers of the latter Ages, since we plainly see that upon the overthrow
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66350:54"/>
of the Western Empire by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> and other Northern Nations, and of the Eastern Empire by the <hi>Saracens</hi> and other <hi>Mahometans,</hi> Religion and Learning were quickly brought under sad and lasting decays, which is confest by writers on all sides.</p>
            <p>And what <hi>I. K.</hi> says, That we may as well expect the whole Gospel in the first Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as all Faith of the Church in the first four General Councils, is very impertinently alledged. Did we ask for all the definitions of the Church in the first Canon of <hi>Nice,</hi> his comparison might well take place; but it cannot be fitly used in our case who say we are the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Apostolick Christians, because we in all things agree with the Churches of God, as they were during their greatest purity both in the persecutions, and after those for two Ages. Certainly if we hold all that Faith they then held, and if they were saved, we may be so too; and you cannot pass a severe sentence on us which will not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise take hold of them. <hi>I. K.</hi> cannot deny but they stated the Christian Faith in very formal Creeds, and one of them expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed That no new addition should be made to the Creed; and so we who receive that Creed, though at all this distance from them, are really in Communion with them,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66350:54"/>
from which those have departed, who have made such vast additions to the Creed. And thus it appears we are in the same way which our Saviour first opened and in which that glorious cloud of witnesses followed him, and are still in Communion with <hi>Rome</hi> as she was when her Faith was spoken of through the whole world, and therefore we are in a safe way to Salvation.</p>
            <p>But because Christians must live together in Unity and Charity, and in order to that end must associate together in the Worship of God in mutual Councils and other necessary parts of Government and some External rites for maintaining the visible acknowledgment of the Faith, therefore we have rules given in Scripture no less express for obeying the Civil powers in all their Commands that are not plainly contrary either to Natural or revealed Religion, which is a clear and constant rule by which we may be satisfied if our minds be right prepared and qualified, as was before set down. And if by the disorder of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, through the corruptions of the natural man, we be brought under Errors, we have our selves to blame. Next to this we are to associate our selves with all who Worship God as long as there is not some great corruption in it, so that we can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continue in it without sin. If others be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66350:55"/>
formal or guilty in it, that is none of our fault, and can never warrant our departure from that Communion of Saints in worship. Therefore the particular Forms of Worship are to be agreed on by the Guides and Pastors of the Church, which must still be received by all till they put us to act or assist in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is evil, or be defective in some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary part of Divine worship. And the great rule by which the Guides of the Church ought to compose these Forms, is the constant and universal practice of the Churches of God in their best times; Calculating these as near as may be to the present Constitutions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of men, so as to avoid all unnecessary scandal, and to edifie the people by them.</p>
            <p>Therefore we dare appeal to all just and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judges, if our Church have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served this rule in all the parts of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to bring things as near as could be to the Primitive Forms; and if in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars we have departed from them, such as the not Commemorating expresly the dead, or receiving gifts in their Names in the holy Communion, the not using the Chrism in Confirmation, nor the sign of the Cross on all occasions, or if we kneel in Churches on Sundays, and betwixt Easter and Pentecost, which are the most considerable things that now occurr to me, in which we are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66350:55"/>
conform to the Primitive Church; these are both things of less importance, and by the following Superstition and other abuses were very much corrupted. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all things not Necessary when much abused, how innocent, nay how useful soever they may be, yet may very reasonably be left out and laid aside as the Pastors of the Church see cause. If after all this Evidence there be great divisions among us, we owe these, next to the corruption or manners, to the daily practises of such as <hi>I. K.</hi> who (as is offered to be made out by many) have under all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises laboured the renting us to pieces, and our sins are such that these wicked designs prove daily but too successful.</p>
            <p>But after all the mist and dust any may study to raise, I doubt not but to serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderers it will appear, that we of this Church are in a clear and safe way, and that our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is no other than what our Saviour and his Apostles delivered, and what the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and their Successors for many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and that we are in the same Method of finding out the true Faith which they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: all which I shall conclude with these excellent and divinely Charitable Versicles of our Litany:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it may please thee to give to all thy people increase of Grace, to hear meekly thy</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:66350:56"/>
               <hi>Word, and to receive it with pure affection, and to bring forth the fruits of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it may please thee to bring into the way of truth all such as have erred and are deceived, and that it may please thee to have mercy upon all men.</hi>
