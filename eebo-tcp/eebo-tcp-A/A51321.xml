            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honored Governour,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ſeen a Letter from your hand, directed to me, among many in this <hi>Province,</hi> which came by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Richard Dimond:</hi> It was in all reſpect welcome to me, and more particularly, for that you make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your coming to us again, with your Family; a thing ſo much deſired by all in theſe parts, and more particularly by my ſelf. But I fear that Madam <hi>Penn</hi> ſhould give too much credit to the evil Reports that I do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand are given out by many Enemies to this new Colony, <hi>As if we were ready to Famiſh, and that the Land is ſo barren, the Climet ſo hot, that Engliſh Grain, Roots and Herbs do not come to Maturity; and what grows, to be little worth.</hi> How untrue all theſe things are you well know; but we that have ſeen our handy Work, accompanied with Gods bleſſing upon it, ſince your departure from us, are able to ſay ſomething more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to return to us again. You know, that when you went for <hi>England,</hi> there was an indifferent plenty of moſt things, and that many hundred Families were clearing of Land to Sow and Plant, as I was alſo doing; ſince that, our Lands have been grateful to us, and have begun to reward our Labours by abounding Crops of <hi>Corn</hi> this Year. But to give you to underſtand the full of our Condition, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Proviſion</hi> in this Province; we had laſt Fall, and the Winter, abundance of good freſh <hi>Pork</hi> in our Market at two Pence half-penny <hi>per</hi> Pound, of this Country Money, which is an Engliſh two Pence; <hi>Beef</hi> at the ſame rate; the like is this Year; and <hi>Butter</hi> for ſix Pence <hi>per</hi> Pound; <hi>Wheat</hi> for four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Buſhel; <hi>Rye</hi> three Shillings; and now all this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100096:3"/>
Summer <hi>Wheat</hi> is at three Shillings, &amp; three Shillings 6 Pence; <hi>Rye</hi> at eight Groats, and half a Crown; <hi>Indian-Corn</hi> ſeven Groats, and two Shillings this Country Money ſtill; ſo that there is now ſome Corn Tranſported from this River. Doctor <hi>Butler</hi> has bought two hundred Buſhels of <hi>Wheat</hi> at three Shillings ſix Pence, to Tranſport, &amp; ſeveral others, ſo that ſome Thouſands of Buſhels are Tranſported this Seaſon, and when this Crop that now is gathered is Threſhed, it is ſuppoſed that it will be abundantly cheaper then now it is, for there has been abundance of Corn this Year in every Plantation.</p>
            <p>The laſt Year I did plant about twelve Acres of <hi>Indian Corn,</hi> and when it came off the Ground, I did only cauſe the Ground to be Harrowed, and upon that I did ſow both <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Rye,</hi> at which many Laughed, ſaying, <hi>That I could not expect any Corn from what I had ſowed, the Land wanting more Labour:</hi> yet I had this Year as good <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Rye</hi> upon it, as was to be found in any other place, and that very bright Corn. I have had a good Crop of <hi>Barley</hi> and <hi>Oats;</hi> and whereas my People did not uſe my <hi>Barley</hi> well, ſo that much was ſhed upon the Ground, I cauſed it immediately to be Plowed in, and is now growing, keeping a good Colour, and I am in hope of another Crop of <hi>Barley,</hi> having good Ears tho the Straw be ſhorter. I did plant an <hi>Hopp-Garden</hi> this Spring, which is now exceeding full of <hi>Hopps,</hi> at which all Engliſh People admire. <hi>Richard Colles</hi> and <hi>Samuel Carpenter,</hi> &amp;c. having had ſome Fields of <hi>Rye</hi> the laſt Summer, and plowed the Stuble in order to ſow other Corn, by ſome Caſualty could not ſow their Fields, yet have they had <hi>conſiderable Crops of Rye,</hi> in the ſaid Fields, by what had been ſhed on the Ground in Harveſt time. I have had <hi>ſeventy Ears of Rye</hi> upon <hi>one ſingle Root,</hi> proceeding from <hi>one ſingle Corn; forty five of Wheat; eighty of Oats;</hi>

Curioſity to tell one of the twelve Ears from one Grain, and there was in it forty five Grains on that Ear; above <hi>three Thouſand of Oats</hi> from <hi>one ſingle Corn,</hi> and ſome I had, that had much more, but it would ſeem a Romance rather then a Truth, if I ſhould ſpeak what I have ſeen in theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arnoldus de la Grange</hi> hath above a Thouſand Buſhels of <hi>Engliſh Grain</hi> this Year, there is indeed a great encreaſe every where. I had the laſt Year as good <hi>Turnops, Carrots</hi> and <hi>Parſnops</hi> as could be expected, and in no wiſe inferior to thoſe in <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Parſnops</hi> better, and of a great bigneſs; my Children have ſound out a way of Roſting them in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and are as good as <hi>Barbadoes Potatoes,</hi> inſomuch that it is now become a Diſh with us. We have had admirable <hi>Engliſh Peaſe</hi> this Summer; every one here is now perſwaded of the <hi>fertility</hi> of the Ground, and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the Climate, here being nothing wanting, with induſtry, that grows in <hi>England,</hi> and many delicious things, not attainable there; and we have this common advantage above <hi>England,</hi> that all things grow better, and with leſs Labour. I have planted this Spring a Quickſet, of above ſixſcore Foot long, which grows to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; we find as good <hi>Thorns</hi> as any in the World.</p>
            <p>We have had ſo great abundance of <hi>Pigeons</hi> this Summer, that we have fed all our Servants with them. A Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man near the City, which is come into this Province ſince you went for <hi>England,</hi> (Mrs <hi>Jeffs</hi> from <hi>Ireland) Cured Sturgion</hi> the laſt Year, and I have eaten ſome this Summer at her Houſe, as good as you can get in <hi>London:</hi> ſome <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> Merchants are treating with her for ſeveral Barrels for the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and will give her any thing for them. We are wanting of ſome more good Neighbours to fill up the Country. There is a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman who made the laſt Year ſome <hi>Wine</hi> of the <hi>wild Grapes,</hi> which proved <hi>admirable good, and far above the beſt Maderas that you ever taſted,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle higher colour'd. And one thing I muſt take notice of,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100096:4"/>
that we ſtrove to make <hi>Vinegar</hi> of it, but it is ſo full of Spirit that it will not eaſily turn to <hi>Vinegar;</hi> a certain evidence of its long keeping. Your <hi>Vigneron</hi> had made a Barrel of the ſame <hi>Wine,</hi> reſolving to keep it for your <hi>Entertainment:</hi> I being one day there, and ſpeaking of what I had taſted at <hi>Monſieur Peliſon's,</hi> he ſhewed me a Barrel, which he ſaid was of the ſame ſort that he had taken a great deal of care to ſecure from being meddled with, he tauhing the head, it ſounded empty, at which the man was ſo amazed, that he was ready to Faint; afterwards looking about, it had leaked underneath, to about two Quarts; I taſted it, and it was yet very good <hi>Wine,</hi> ſo I left the poor man much afflicted for his loſs. But I muſt acquaint you with one thing, that he having planted ſome <hi>French Vines,</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>March,</hi> the laſt Year, the ſame <hi>Vines</hi> have brought forth ſome <hi>Grapes</hi> this Year, and ſome of them were preſented to <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Lloyd</hi> the 28th of <hi>July,</hi> fully <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Ripe,</hi> which is a thing unheard of, or very extraordinary. I thought that this ſhort account of our preſent State and Condition, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement would not be ill News to you, conſidering that you know me not forward to put my hand to Paper ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; wherefore I hope that your Lady will not diſpiſe what I do here report, as being the very truth of things; and if I could contribute thereby to her full Satisfaction, I ſhould have my end, as being willing to ſee you and her in this place, where I ſhall not fear being rebuked for miſ-repreſenting things, I ſhall conclude,</p>

            <p>I Alſo adviſe, that, bleſſed be God, <hi>Corn</hi> is very cheap this Seaſon; <hi>Engliſh Wheat</hi> ſold here, to carry for <hi>New-England,</hi> at three Shillings ſix Pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, and much <hi>Wheat-Flower</hi> and <hi>Bisket</hi> for <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> Things proſper very well, and the Earth brings forth its encreaſe; God grant we may walk worthy of his Mercies. Of other Grains, plenty. As to the Town, Building goeth on. <hi>John Readman</hi> is building one Brick Houſe for <hi>Richard Whitpain,</hi> of ſixty Foot long, and fifty ſix Foot wide. For the Widow <hi>Farmer,</hi> another Brick Houſe. For <hi>Thomas Barker</hi> and <hi>Samuel Jobſon</hi> two Brick Cellers, and Chimnies for back Kitchings. <hi>Thomas Ducket</hi> is Building a Brick Houſe at the <hi>Skulkil,</hi> forty eight Foot long and three Stories high; there are two other Brick Houſes to be built this Summer—</p>

            <p>I Shall only add, that five Ships are come in ſince our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, one from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> with 100 Paſſengers; one from <hi>Hull,</hi>

with 160 Paſſengers; one from <hi>New-England</hi> for Corn, and two from <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> all of them, and ours (of above 300 Tun) had their loading here, ours for <hi>New-England,</hi> and the reſt for <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> and for all this, <hi>Wheat</hi> (as good, I think, as any in <hi>England)</hi> is ſold at three Shillings ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, this Country Money, and for three Shillings ready Money (which makes two Shillings five pence Engliſh Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) and if God continues his bleſſing to us, this Province will certainly be the Grainary of <hi>America.</hi> The Governours Vineyard goes on very well, the Grapes I have taſted of; which in fifteen Months are come to maturity—</p>

            <p>VVE have made three Purchaſes of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which, added unto the ſix former Sales they made us, will, I believe, be Land enough for Planters for this Age; they were at firſt High, and upon their Diſtances; but when we told them of the Kindneſs our Governour had always ſhown them; that the Price we offer'd far exceeded former Rates, and that they offered us the Land before we ſought them, they agreed to our laſt Offer, which is ſomething under three hundred Pounds ſterling. The Kings ſalute our Governour; they hardly ever ſee any of us, but they ask, with much affection, when he will come to them again; we are upon very good terms with them.

            <p>I Have never ſeen brighter and better Corn then in theſe parts, eſpecially in the County of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> Proviſions very cheap; <hi>Pork</hi> at two Pence, and good fat freſh <hi>Beef</hi> at three half-pence the Pound, in our Market. <hi>Fiſh</hi> is plentiful; <hi>Corn</hi> cheap; <hi>Wheat</hi> three and ſix pence a Buſhel; <hi>Rye</hi> half a Crown; <hi>Indian Corn</hi> two Shillings, of this Money: And it is without doubt that we ſhall have as good <hi>Wine</hi> as any <hi>France</hi> produces. Here is great appearance of a Trade, and if we had ſmall Money for Exchange, we ſhould not want Returns The <hi>Whale-Fiſhery</hi> is conſiderable; ſeveral Companies out to ketch them: There is one caught, that its thought will make ſeveral hundred Barrels of Oyle.
