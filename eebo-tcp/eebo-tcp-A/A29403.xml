            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief Account of the Evidence given on behalf of <hi>Edmund War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
at a Tryal had at the Bar <date>the 24th of <hi>November,</hi> 1693.</date> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Four Barons of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> relating to a Parcel of <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Clay,</hi> ſeized by the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Officers, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of it's being <hi>Fullers Earth.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>William Riddal</hi> SWore that he was Steward and Tenant to the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi> for above 20 Years, in all which time the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi> conſtantly ſold to the
Potters in <hi>London</hi> conſiderable quantities of the ſame ſort of Clay now in diſpute, for the making of White and Painted Earthen-Ware:
That he never knew or heard that the leaſt Parcel of it was ever ſold as Fullers-Earth, or put to any other Uſe than making Earthen-Ware,
excepting ſome ſmall quantities yearly in the Neighbourhood for daubing of Houſes, which may be alledged as a good Argument
that the ſaid Clay is not of the nature of Fullers-Earth; for, whereas this makes the beſt Clay Wall in <hi>England,</hi> if it were of the nature
of Fullers-Earth, upon the firſt wet Weather it would all fall to the Ground: He likewiſe farther depoſed, That the firſt time the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>
ſhipt the ſaid Clay for <hi>Holland,</hi> it was ſeized by the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> Officers as Fullers Earth; but upon Tryal of it, they were convinced of their
Error, and cleared the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Knight, Thomas Harper, Henry de Wilde, John Robins. Moſes Johnſon,</hi> Are all Potters in <hi>London,</hi> and ſwore that they had all ſeen the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay, which was ſeized, that it was really Potter's Clay, and of the
ſame ſort which they had conſtantly bought of him, ſome for above 25 Years, others ever ſince they were Traders, that it is of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
nature from Fullers Earth; for the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay tho' never ſo often diſſolved in Water, may be brought into a Body again, and
will work, like Wax, into any ſhape, whereas Fullers Earth being once diſſolved is never to be got into any Body, but when it is dry crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
like Sand, and all the art of Man can never make a Pot of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hen. de Wilde,</hi> one of the ſaid Potters farther depoſed, That about five Years ſince he ſhipt ſome of the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay for <hi>Penſilvania,</hi>
where his Son had ſet up a Pot-Houſe, that the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers did then likewiſe ſeize it as Fullers Earth, but upon Trial of it
found they were miſtaken, and cleared the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Benjamin Furly,</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> to whom the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi> conſigned his Clay. <hi>John Sonman,</hi> Servant to the ſaid <hi>Furly.</hi>
               </hi> Were, by virtue of a Commiſſion from the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> examined upon Oath, (by Commiſſioners appointed for that purpoſe) to
ſeveral Interrogatories, and their Depoſitions being read in Court, did plainly prove that all the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay which was ſent for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was really ſold to Potters for making of Earthen-Ware, That they never heard, nor do believe that any part of it was ever uſed for the
Fulling Trade, or is any way proper for it; that they ſold the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay from 25 to 30 Guilders a Laſt, when they could buy Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers-Earth
at 7 Guilders a Laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Adrian Van Arde,</hi> ſworn Meaſurer of all the Earth and Clay imported to <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
               </hi> Was examined by vertue of the ſaid Commiſſion, and Depoſed, That for many Years which he had been in that Office, he never knew or
heard of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fullers-Earth imported into <hi>Holland,</hi> that they were ſo plentifully ſupplied with that ſort of Earth from <hi>Flanders;</hi> that it
is commonly bought and ſold at Seven Guilders a Laſt, and had an Hundred Laſt by him to ſell at the ſame Rate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ten or Twelve Pot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </hi> Were likewiſe examined by virtue of the ſaid Commiſſion, and depoſed ſeverally, That they had bought conſiderable quantities of the
ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay of Mr. <hi>Benj. Furly,</hi> and paid for the ſame from 25 to 30 Guilders a Laſt; that they uſed the ſame in making Earthen-Ware<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but do not believe it any way uſeful for the Fulling Trade, nor never heard that any of it was ever ſold for that uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colonel <hi>Holt,</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament.</hi> Swore, That he (being very lately in <hi>Holland</hi>) made the ſtricteſt inquiry into the Truth of this Buſineſs, that he could, Firſt amongſt the Potters,
who all declared to the ſame Effect, as in their Depoſitions before mentioned, that he likewiſe took ſome of the ſaid <hi>Warners</hi> Clay, and got a
Fuller to try it,whether it were any way uſeful for their Trade, who anſwered it was not? nor could he uſe it if he might have it for Nothing;
after which the Colonel ask'd him, From whence they were ſupplied with Fullers-Earth, and at what Rates? The Fullers anſwered, generally from
<hi>Flanders</hi> at 6 ½, and 7 Guilders <hi>per</hi> Laſt; and ſometimes from <hi>Roſendale,</hi> in the <hi>States</hi> Dominions, at 10 Guilders <hi>per</hi> Laſt; that being much dryer, and
waſted leſs by lying; all which the Colonel (being unwilling to believe upon the Fuller's bare word) cauſed to be drawn up in the Form of
an Affidavit, and the Fuller before a Magiſtrate, ſwore to the Truth of it, which Affidavit the Colonel hath to produce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. <hi>Edward Paget,</hi> a Divine.</hi> Swore, That he being in <hi>Holland</hi> at the ſame time, made the like Enquiry amongſt the Fullers at <hi>Layden,</hi> the chief cloathing Town in <hi>Holland,</hi> who
all gave him the ſame Information, that the Fuller at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> had done the Colonel above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for his better ſatisfaction, Three of the
Chiefeſt went with him before a Magiſtrate, and ſwore to the Truth of what they Affirmed; after which he went to <hi>Delfe</hi> amongſt the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who all affirmed the ſame thing, that the Ten or Twelve had ſworn in their aforementioned Depoſitions, the Truth of which they atteſted
by a Certificate, under the Hands of above Twenty, which Affidavits, and Certificate, the ſaid <hi>Paget</hi> hath to produce.</p>

               <hi>Rich. Cutler, Matthew Hanſon, <hi>Ship-brokers.</hi> Will. Read,  Tho-Wood, John Saliby, <hi>Mariners.</hi>
               </hi> Swore, They had hired many Ships for the ſaid <hi>Warner,</hi> to load Clay for <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> and the general Price of the Fraight, and Primage
paid for the ſame, was 15 Guilders, 8 Stivers <hi>per</hi> Laſt; and ſometimes 17 Guilders, 12 Stivers <hi>per</hi> Laſt.</p>
            <p>Swore, They had the ſame Prices above mentioned, for ſeveral Fraights which they carried, and ſaw delivered to the Potters in <hi>Holland.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Hump. Bellomy, Richard Hopkins, Timothy Fowler,—Shepherd, <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
               </hi> Are all Buyers, and Sellers of Fullers-Earth, and ſwore they could well judge of the ſame, having dealt therein from Ten to above Twenty
five Years, that they all took Samples of the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay, out of the King's Celler, and tryed all the Experiments, to judge of it, that they
were capable of; and poſſitively affirmed that it was no Fullers-Earth; neither could they find any thing of the Nature of Fullers-Earth in it,
that for their Uſe they would not give a Shilling for 100 Laſt, for they ſhould never be able to ſell it.</p>

Barrs, John St. Berry.</hi> Are all Clothiers, Fullers, and Cloth-Workers; being the moſt Eminent in their ſeveral Places; as well for Honeſty, as great Traders, and good
Eſtates; they all ſwore they had made the moſt impartial Experiments they could of the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay, now in diſpute, being the ſame taken
out of the King's Celler, that they tried it upon ſeveral ſorts of Goods, as ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Cloth, Bays, Cloth-Serges,</hi> and <hi>Perpetuanaes,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one poſſitively affirmed that it was no Fuller's-Earth, but on the contrary, was an abſolute Enemy to the Woollen-Manufacture; for inſtead
of ſcowring, it fix'd the Greaſe in the Grownd of all the Goods, that were done with it; and inſtead of makeing them White, it abſolutely
ſtained them Yellow, all which was apparent to the moſt common Eye, in all the above ſaid ſeveral ſorts of Goods, produced in Court: They
likewiſe declared upon Oath, that they were all Strangers to the ſaid <hi>Warner;</hi> and that it was as prejudicial to their Intereſt, to have Fullers-Earth
Tranſported, as any mens, and therefore could have no Inducement to favour the ſaid <hi>Warner,</hi> beyond the Merits of his Cauſe, to the Violation
of their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>This is ſo juſt a Recital of the Evidence given on behalf of the ſaid <hi>Warner,</hi> that he challenges the greateſt of his Enemies to detect him of the leaſt Falſehood
therein; and if his Adverſaries had been as fair in repreſenting theirs, there would have been no need of this; for whereas in their printed Papers, they
make their Witneſſes to affirm the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay was tried in all Experiments, without any mixture, there was not above One or Two, but upon croſs Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
at the Tryal, owned they uſed either Segg and Hogs-dung, or Soap and Gauls with it, which would have ſcowered any Cloth better without the ſaid
Clay than with it.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs likewiſe to obſerve that for a whole Year in which the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Officers have been ſo very diligent in ſpreading the Fame of the ſaid
<hi>Warner</hi>'s Clay to be the beſt <hi>Fullers-Earth</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> he hath not been able to ſell the leaſt quantity of it as ſuch, tho' he has proffered it to all Men for a
very little more than one Third of what Fullers-Earth is generally ſold for.</p>
