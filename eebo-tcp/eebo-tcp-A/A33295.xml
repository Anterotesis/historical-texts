         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Who art thou, O great mountain before Zerubbabel, thou shal<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
become a plain, and he shall bring forth the head stone thereof 
with Shouting, Crying, Grace, Grace unto it.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Perceive that God will have his Temple built, which
had been long neglected, partly by the worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the people, who had greater Care of their
own houses then of the house of God, as appears by
the prophet, <hi>Haggai 1. v.</hi> 3, 4. He reproves them for
this fault, (That they cared more for their own houses
than for the house of God, partly, because of the great
impediments and difficulties they apprehended in the
work. Yet God, having a purpose to have it builded,
sends his Prophets to stir  them up to the building of it,
<hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 4. As for impediments, he promises to remove
them all, and assures them of this by <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah;</hi>
Yea he shews to <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and the people, that
although impediments were as mountains, yet they
should be removed.</p>
            <p>I need not stand upon Introductions and Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
this <hi>Verse</hi> I have read, shows the Scope of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
to wit, God will have his work going on, and
all Impediments removed. These Times require that
I should rather insist upon Application to the present
Work of Reformation in hand, then to stand upon the
Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which we know well enough was
a Type of Christs Kirk, which in this Land was once
built, but now hath been Defaced by the Enemies of
Christ; we have long neglected the Re-edifying of it,
partly, Men being given more to build their own
houses, nor the house of Christ; and partly, Because
of the great Impediments that have discouraged God's
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102711:2"/>
people to meddle with it: now it hath pleased God, to
stir up Prophets, Noblemen, and People of the Land,
to put to their Hands to this Work, and I think, God
saith to you in this Text, <hi>Who art thou,</hi> O <hi>great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thou shalt become a plain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two Parts in this Text, <hi>First.</hi> An Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
removed under the Name of a Mountain, <hi>Who
art thou,</hi> O <hi>great mountain before</hi> Zerubbabel, <hi>thou shalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a plain. 2ly,</hi> In the second Part of the Text, the
Work goeth up and is finished; the Impediment being
removed, <hi>He shall bring forth the head stone thereof with
Shouting, Crying, Grace, Grace be unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that ye may take up all that is to be said in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Method, there are six Steps in the Text, three
in the Mountain impeding the Work, and three in the
Work it self; the three in the Mountain are these, 1.
It is a Mountain seen, O <hi>great mountain.</hi> 2. A Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
reproved, <hi>Who art thou,</hi> O <hi>great mountain before</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel.
3. A Mountain removed, <hi>Thou shalt become
a plain.</hi> The three in the Work are, 1. A Work grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and going up. 2. A Work finished, <hi>He shall bring
forth the head stone thereof.</hi> 3. A Work praised, <hi>He shall
bring forth the head stone thereof with Shouting, Crying,
Grace, Grace be unto it:</hi> I shall speak of all these God
willing, and apply them to the time.</p>
            <p>As for the three in the Mountain. 1. It is a Mountain
seen, It is called a great Mountain, under this are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
all Impediments and Difficulties imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bullding, all being taken together, make
up a great Mountain which is un-passible, the Enemies
which impede this Work were this Mountain; look
<hi>Ezra</hi> 4. and ye will see the Adversaries of <hi>Iudah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a great Mountain in the Way of that Work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102711:3"/>
That ye may take up this Mountain the better, I find
that Kings are called Mountains in Scripture, and good
Kings are so called for these three, <hi>First,</hi> For their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity,
as Mountains are high above the Valleys, so are
Kings lifted up in Majesty above their Subjects: Some
apply that place to Kings, <hi>Micah 6. 2. Hear ye,</hi> O <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taens,
the Lords controversie, and ye strong foundations of the
earth.</hi> 2. They are called Mountains for their Strength
to Guard their People, <hi>Psal. 30. David</hi> saith, <hi>God hath
made my mountain strong.</hi> 3. Good Kings are called Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
by reason of the Influence of Peace to the People,
<hi>Psal. 72. v. 3. The mountains shall bring peace to the people,
and the little hills by righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find also, that the strong Enemies of the Church
are called Mountains, because of the great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Kirk's building that are made by them, as
ye may see in <hi>Ps.</hi> 144.</p>
            <p>This Mountain (that I may speak more plainly) is
<hi>Prelacie,</hi> which hath ever been in the Mountain, in the
way of our Reformation: It may be, some of you that
hears me, are not of my Judgment concerning. <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie;</hi>
for my Judgment, I ever condemned it, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Warrand for it to be in Christ House; Yet I am
sure, that all of you who are here this day, will agree
with me in this, that <hi>Prelacy</hi> being Antichrstian, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable,
but such is the <hi>Prelacy</hi> of this Kirk, it is
Antichristian, I may easily prove that, that amongst
many marks of Antichrist, thir two are most evident,
False Doctrine, and Tiranny in Government; where
Antichrist is, there is Tirannical Government, imposing
Laws upon the Consciences of Gods People, where
Antichrist is, there is Idolatry, Superstition, and Error,
these two are clearly seen in our Prelacy; their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102711:3"/>
Superstition, and Error, may be seen in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Book;
their Tyranny may be seen in their Book
of Canons: I think there are none here, but they may
see this Mountain; no greater Tyranny hath ever
been used by Antichrist than hath been used by our
Prelats, and exercised upon this Kirk.</p>
            <p>This Mountain being seen by you all, I would have
you taking a view of the Quality of it: I find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
That the Enemies of the Kirk being called Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
are so called, because of these three Qualities, the
first is in <hi>Ps.</hi> 76. 4. They are called <hi>Mountains of Prey,</hi> so
called, because from them the Robbers rush down to the
Valleys and Prey upon the Passengers. 2. The second is
in J<hi>er. 51. 25. Babylon,</hi> a great Enemy to Gods Kirk is
called a <hi>destroying Mountain;</hi> thee word in its own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
is called a <hi>Pestiferious</hi> Mountain, (so called) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Pest destroys. 3. The third is in <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 14.
They are called <hi>Mountains of Pride</hi> compared with the
12. <hi>Vers.</hi> and you will find these Mountains called
<hi>Mountains of Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Mountain of <hi>Prelacie</hi> hath all these Three bad
Qualities, first, it is a Mountain from which they have
like Robbers, made a Prey of the Kirk of Christ:
Tell me I pray you, and I appeal to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
who are my Brethren, if there be any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or liberty that ever Christ gave us, but they have
taken it from us, and made a Prey of it. 2. This Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is a pestiferous Mountain; it hath been the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that hath been as a Pest; to infect the Kirk of
Christ, with Superstition, Heresie and Error, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
it hath been a destroying Mountain, for they have
destroyed the fair carved work of our first Reformation
3. They are Mountains of Pride, for greater Pride
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102711:4"/>
cannot be, than there is upon this Mountain, they
rule as Tyrants over their Brethren, and as Lords o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
God's Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Ye that are Noblemen, are the Natural Mountains
of this Kingdom descended of Noble Predecessors,
who have been as Mountains indeed; defending both
Kirk and Common-wealth; these Men were but low
Valleys, and now are Artificial Mountains, made up
by the Art of Man; at first, as low as their Brethren
sitting there, but piece and piece they have Mounted
up at First Commissioners for the Kirk, and then Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Vote in Parliament, and then they usurped all
the liberties of the Kirk benefices, and then constant
Moderators to make up this Mountain, and at last, the
high Commission is given to make the Mountain
strong; it's like to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Tree. <hi>Dan. 4. 11. The Tree
grew and was strong.</hi> And from it, we that are the
Ministers of Christ have our Wrack,</p>
            <p>And let me speak it to you. Noblemen, these Artificial
and stooted Mountains, have overtoped you who are
the Natural Mountains, and if they have not done so,
what means the great-seal then; and if way could
have been made for it, they should have carryed the
white Wand and Privy-Seal also; and this is Just with
God that they have overtopped you: For every one of
you came with your own Shovelful to make up this
Mountain. It was thought expedient to rear up this
Mountain, to command and bear down poor Ministers:
Albeit, its true, we have been born down by them;
yet ye that are the high Mountains, have not been
free from their hurt; it is very like to <hi>Iotham</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<hi>Iudges, 9. 8. The Trees of the Forrest will have a
King over them; they come to the Olive Tree and say, be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102711:4"/>
thou King over us; the Olive saith, I will not leave my Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be King; they came to the Fig-Tree, and said, be thou
our King; the Fig-Tree saith, I will not leave my Sweetness
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> be King; they come likewise to the Vine, and say, be thou
our King; the Vine saith, I will not leave my Strength to be
King; they come to the Bramble, and said, be thou our King;
then said the Bramble to the Trees: If indeed ye Anoint me
King over you, then come and put your Trust under my Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;
and if not, let Fire come Forth of the Bramble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Tall Cedars of Lebanon.</hi> The Olive Trees of the
Ministrie would not leave the Fatness of GOD's Grace,
wherewith they were endued, to Rule over the Kirk;
The Fig-Trees of the Ministry would not leave the
Sweet Fruits of their Ministry to bear Rule in the Kirk;
The Vines of the Ministry would not leave the strong
Consolations of God, whereby many Souls were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
to bear Rule in the Kirk; yet the Brambles
have taken this, and ye helped to Exalt them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> upon
Condition to Trust under their Shaddow; and if Fire
hath not come forth from these Brambles, upon the
Tall Cedars of this Land, I leave to your own thoughts
to Judge: Alwise this is the Mountain which ye see
all reared up this day, and standing in the way of our
Reformation.</p>
            <p>2. The Second thing in this Mountain, is this, It is

ours, all that are joyned to this Work, for the building
of this Work, are to be accounted Workers, and for
them also is this Mountain Reprov'd. <hi>Who art thou</hi> O
<hi>great Mountain;</hi> who art thou who will impede this
work, or shall be able to impede it, seeing GOD will
have it foreward: It's impossible for thee to impede it
in these Three Respects. 1. In respect of the work it
self. 2. In Respect of the Workers. 3. In Respect
of the Impeders.</p>
            <p>1. First in respect of the Work it self, It is GOD's
Work, for the House is his, and he is in it, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 4.
The Lord saith, <hi>Be thou strong Zerubbabel and Ioshua, and
the remnant of the People and Work, for I am with you saith
the Lord of Hosts.</hi> If God be with a Work, who is he
that will lett or Impede it; God is with this Work of
Reformation, as ye your selves can Witness; and by
all our expectations this Mountain is shaken, and (God
be praised) are not so unpassible as they were.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly no Man is able to impede this work in
repesect of the workers. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 14. it is said, that
<hi>God stirred up the Spirit of</hi> Zerubbabel, <hi>and of</hi> Joshua
<hi>and of the People, and they came and wrought in the house of
the Lord.</hi> When God stirs up Men to do a good work,
nothing on Earth can stay it: I am sure if ever God
stirred up men to a good Work, he hath stirred us up to
this, both Noblemen, Ministers &amp; People. Wherefore,
who art thou O great Mountain before God's People,
that thinks to Impede such a Work,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in respect of the Impeders, what are they
but Men, and wicked men, as ye may see in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Who are they that Impede our
work? Even Men that seek Honour and Preferment
of this World, Enemies to Religion, Fighting against
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102711:5"/>
God, to whom I may say that word in <hi>Iob 9. 4. Who hath
hardned himself against God and prospered.</hi> With one word
more I will reprove this Mountain, and go forward:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who art thou, O great mountain!</hi> Wilt thou search thy
search who thou art; art thou of God's Building or
not? I trow thou art not <hi>Iuris Divini,</hi> but <hi>Humani</hi> God
nor Christ have never built thee; thou art only a Hill
of mans Erecting, knowest thou not that Zion, against
which thou art, is a Hill of Gods Building: I will say to
you then that word in <hi>Psal. 68. 15, 16. The hillof God is a
high hill, as the hill of Bashan; why leap ye hills? This is the
hill that God desireth to dwell in; yea, and will dwell in it for
ever.</hi> And think ye to prevail against the People of
<hi>Zion;</hi> she hath stronger Mountains to guard her than
ye have. <hi>Psal. 125. 2. As the mountains are round about
Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Third thing in this Mountain, is, it is a
Mountain removed, <hi>thou shalt become a Plain;</hi> that is,
God shall remove all Impediments before <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and
his People; God is able to remove all that Impedes his
Work: Even the Mightiest Enemies that oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the work of God, ye may observe a four fold
Power of God against these Mountains.</p>
            <p>First, A determining Power, whereby he sets such
bounds to the greatest Mountains, that ye see they fall
not upon the Valley's, albeit they overtop them; the
Lord hath set bounds to the great Kings in the World,
which they could not pass when they have set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the Lord's People; we may see an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this in Sennacherib. 2 <hi>Kings 19. 32. Therefore
thus saith the Lord concerning the King of Assyria; he shall
not come up to this City, nor shoot an Arrow against it nor
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102711:6"/>
come before it with Shield, nor cast a Bank against it:</hi> Ye
are afraid of the King that he come against you; fear
not, the Lord by his restraining Power is able to keep
him back, that he shall not shoot so much as a Bullet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this City.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God removes Impediments by his assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power, as he promised to do before Cyrus, <hi>Isa. 45.
2: I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight,
I will break in pieces the Gates of Brass, and cut in sunder
the iron Barrs;</hi> albeit for any thing we see, there be
Brazen Gates and Iron Barrs closing out a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet let not this discourage you, God is with you
by his assisting Power to go before you, to make all
crooked places straight, and to break the Brazen Gates,
and to out in sunder the Iron Barrs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God hath a changing Power; whereby he
makes Mountains plain; how easie is it with God, to
make the highest Mountain that Impedes his Work, a
Plain; <hi>Prov. 21. vers. 1 The Kings Heart is in the hand of
the Lord, as the Rivers of Waters, to turn it whither soever he
will:</hi> Lord make our Mountain thus plain.</p>
            <p>The fourth way how GOD removes Mountains, is
by an overthrowing power, if there be no change yet,
GOD will bring it down, <hi>Isa. 2. 12. Every one that is lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up shall be brought low.</hi> The like ye have in the 17. <hi>v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this which hath been said, ye may understand
how a Mountain may be made a Plain; GOD makes
Mountains Plains either in Mercy or in Wrath. 1. In
Mercy, when he takes a Grip of the Heart, &amp; of a proud
haughty Heart, makes it toward and plain, we have
seen such a Change by Experience.</p>
            <p>This Work had many Enemies at the Beginning, that
impeded it, whom GOD hath taken by the Heart, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102711:6"/>
made plain, yea hath made them Furtherers of the Work.</p>
            <p>2. There is another way of making Mountains plain,
to wit making plain in Wrath, when GOD overthrows
the Mountains that stand up impeding his Work; assure
your selves, if GOD bring not down this Mountain we
have to do with, in Mercy, he shall overthrow it in
Wrath, and make it waste.</p>
            <p>That I may make this Mountain more plain, ye shall
consider how it shall become a Plain, and how easily
it may be made a Plain.</p>
            <p>1. I see you looking up to the Height of it, and ye
are saying within your selves, how shall it come down,
ye must not think that it will come down of its own
accord, GOD useth Instruments to pull down, I find
that GOD hath made his own People Instruments to
pull down such Mountains, <hi>Isai. 41. v. 14, 15, 16. Fear
not Worm</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ye Men of</hi> Israel. <hi>I will help thee, saith
the Holy One and thy Redeemer, behold I will make thee a new
Threshing Instrument having Teeth, thou shalt thresh the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff
thou shalt fann them, and the wind shall carry them away, and
the whirl wind shall scatter them:</hi> Mark these Words, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Iacob</hi> be a Worm despised by the great ones of
the World, yet GOD will make him a Threshing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
to beat these Mountains in pieces. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of this Land are despised by the Mountains, yet
fear not, for the sharp Threshing Instrument is made,
I hope it shall beat the Mountains in pieces: we think
them very high, but if we had faith, that word would
be verified, <hi>Mat. 16. 20. Ye shall say to the mountain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
to yonder place, and it shall be removed, and nothing
shall be impossible unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But one is saying, I have not faith, that all that are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102711:7"/>
joyned this day against the Mountain shall continue; I
hope they shall continue, I hope they shall; but if they
do not; we trust not in men, that they shall bring down
this Mountain, but in God, who hath said in <hi>Ier. 51.
ver. 25. Behold I am against thee,</hi> O <hi>destroying mountain, I
will stretch out my hand upon thee, I will roll thee down from
the rocks, and make thee a burnt mountain, they shall not take
of thee a stone for a corner, nor a foundation, thou shalt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solat
for ever:</hi> This Mountain ye see so exalted, although
men would hold it up, yet GOD will bring it down,
and make it a burnt Mountain, even so O LORD do.</p>
            <p>2. In the second place, consider how this Mountain
may be made a Plain; I told you it was but an Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Mountain, a Stooted Mountain, standing upon
weak Pillars, if ye would take a look of the whole
Frame of the Mountain, it stands upon two main Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and upon the Top of this Mountain stands the
House of <hi>Dagon,</hi> an House of False Worship, and take
me the Pillars from <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and it shall fall, take <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy,</hi>
away, and the House of <hi>Dagon</hi> shall fall: the two
main Pillars that <hi>Prelacy</hi> stands on, are a Civil and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Arm, and an Ecclesiastical Tongue, so to speak.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> The Secular Arm is the Authority of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which hath ever upholden that Mountain, ye know
Secular Princes uphold Antichrist, and <hi>Prelacy</hi> in this
Land is upholden by the Secular Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The second Pillar I call Ecclesiastical, that
is, <hi>Prelacy</hi> in this Land hath been upholden by the
Tongues of Kirkmen, Preaching up this Mountain, or
by their Pens, Writing upon this Mountain, and these
are the two Pillars whereupon our Mountain of <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
is Stooted, the Secular Power and the Tongues of
Kirkmen, let the King withdraw his Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102711:7"/>
from the <hi>Prelats,</hi> and they shall fall suddenly in
Dross, let Kirkmen and Ministers withdraw their
Tongues and Pens from them, and our Mountain
ere ye look about you) shall become a Plain: As
these two Stoots up this Mountain, so upon this
Mountain all False Worship in the Kirk is built, even
<hi>Dagon</hi>'s House; lead me, says <hi>Samson,</hi> to the Pillars
that <hi>Dagon</hi>'s House stands on, that I may be avenged
for my two Eyes: the <hi>Philistines</hi> were never more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
to <hi>Samson</hi> in pulling out his Eyes, than our <hi>Prelats</hi>
would have been to us: they pressed to put out our
Eyes, and ere ever we were aware, they thought to lead
us to <hi>Dagon</hi>'s House, even to the Tents of Popery and
Idolatry; let us come to this main Pillar of <hi>Dagon's</hi>
House, and apply all our strength to pull it down, that
we may not only be avenged for our Eyes, which they
have thought to pull out, but also that the House of
False Worship, which is erected upon this Mountain,
may fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>I hear some saying, Minister, for all your saying, the
Mountain will not come down at this time, ye think
nothing but it will down; I assure you, I would have
it down, but ye must not think us that silly, as to think
that it will come down, because we have many for us,
we trust not in Men but in GOD, and if this be the
time that GOD will have it down, although ye should
lay all your hands about their head, they shall come
down; it appears they will come down, if there were
no more but their Pride, Avarice, Cruelty, and loose
Living to pull them down, especially when all these
are come to height, as they are come to in them, and
so much for the Mountain, ye see we have reproved it,
GOD remove it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102711:8"/>
I come now to the three in the Work (the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
being removed) 1. It is a Work growing and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up. <hi>He shall bring forth.</hi> 2. It is a Work finished,
<hi>He shall bring forth the head stone thereof.</hi> 3. It is a Work
praised, <hi>He shall bring forth the head stone thereof with Shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Crying, Grace, Grace be unto it;</hi> We shall speak of
all these three shortly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is a Work going up, it was impeded, but
now it's going up: There is something here very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
the Work goes not up, until the Mountain
be made a Plain. The Mountain must not be paired
or topped, but it must altogether become plain, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Work cannot go up; The Mountain of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi>
must not be paired nor topped, something taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but it must be brought down wholly, otherways
the Work of Reformation cannot go on, neither Christ's
House go up. It will be said, what ailes you, you shall
have your desires, but the Estate of Bishops must stand,
It is impossible to bring it down altogether, the King
may not want an Estate, (truly a good one both to
Kirk and Common Wealth) ye shall have them brought
within the old Bounds, and Caveats set down to them,
they shall not hurt the Kirk any more: the LORD
knows how loath I was to speak from this place, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
GOD hath thrust me out, I must speak the truth.</p>
            <p>I say to you, these Quarters are not to be taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Mountainis not of God's making, but of Man's,
and therefore make it what way ye will, God will be
displeased with it; yea, its impossible to set caveats to
keep them in. I appeal to all your Consciences; is it
possible to set Caveats to their Pride and Avarice; their
Pride and Avarice will break through Ten Thousand
Caveats: I will clear this impossibility by similitudes.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102711:8"/>
Tell, me, if a Fountain in the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were
poisoned; whether were it more safe to stop up the
Fountain, than to set a Guard to keep it, that none
draw out of it, for there is hope the Poison would do
no harm? There is no Man of a sound Judgment but
he will think it more safe to stop up the Fountain than
to guard it; this Prelacie is the Poisoned Fountain
wherefrom the Kirk of Christ hath been Poisoned with
the Poison of Error and Superstition. Now the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, whether it be safer to stop it up than to guard
it? Surely it is safer to stop it up; for all the Caveats
in the world, will not keep the Kirk unpoisoned, so long
as it remains. I will give you another similitude; If
the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were (as many Towns have
been and are) taken and Possest by cruel and obstinat
Enemies, who would take all your liberties from you,
would not suffer your Magistrates to judge, and would
spoil you of your Goods, and use all the cruelty that
could be devised against the Inhabitants, if God gave
you occasion to be free of such a cruel and obstinat E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie;
what would you do if this were proponed to
you; why may not you suffer the Enemie to abide
within the Town? We shall take all their Weapons
from them, they shall never hurt you any more:
Would ye not think it far better to put them out of the
Town altogether; both because the Inhabitants would
be in fear so long as they were in the Town, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Town would never be sure: For there might
be Traitors among your selves, who would Steal in
Weapons<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in their Hands; and so they would bring you
under the former Tyrannie; yea under a greater. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
so it is in this Case; The Cruelest and greatest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
that ever the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> saw, are those
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102711:9"/>
Prelats; they have spoiled us of all our Liberties, and
exercised intollerable Tyranny over us. Now the Lord
is shewing a way how to be quite of them; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Condition offered, what alls you? May
ye not let them abide within the Kirk, we shall take
all their Weapons from them, as admission of Ministers
Excommunication, and that terrible High-Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they shall never hurt you again; this is but the
Counsel of Man, the Counsel of GOD is, to put them
out of the Kirk altogether, otherways the Kirk can
never be secure, yea, I assure you, there are as many
Traitors among our selves, as would steal in the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
again in their Hands, then shall our latter Estate
be worse than our first; if our Yoke be heavy under
them now, it shall be heavier then; if they chastise us
now with Whips, they shall chastife us then with Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.
I think I hear Men speak like that Word, <hi>Danie<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

4. 14. Hew down the tree, cut down his branches, shake
off his leaves, scatter his fruits, nevertheless leave the stum
of his roots with a band of iron and brass;</hi> the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that part of the Vision is set down in the 26 verse
<hi>Thy Kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou hast known
that the Heavens bear rule:</hi> I hear Men say, hew down

till they knew GOD, it were something, but there is
no appearance of that) Consider, O Man, who saith

               </gap>

               </gap>
down the Stump of it with Iron Bands, we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102711:9"/>
fear the growth of it, nor the Fruit of it, but seing
they are only Bands to be laid on by Men; Albeit the
Tree were hewed down, it would grow again in all the
Branches of it, with all the Leaves of it's Dignity, and
we should taste of the bitter Fruit of it; Yet that are
Covenanters, be not deceived, if ye leave so much as
a Hillock of this Mountain, in despight of your hearts
It shall grow to a high Mountain, which shall fill both
Kirk and Common Wealth. If the Kirk would be
quite of the Troubles of it, and if ye would have this
Work of Reformation going up, this Mountain must
be made a Plain altogether, otherways the Spirit of
GOD saith, ye shall never prosper.</p>
            <p>The second thing in this Work, is a Work finished,
<hi>He shall bring forth the head stone thereof:</hi> When a head
stone is put on a House, the House is finished, ye who
are Reverend Fathers in the Kirk, who have seen the
Work of our first Reformation, ye saw it going up
and brought to such a Perfection, that the Cope-stone
was put on, Purity of Doctrine, and Administration
of Sacraments, and Sweetness of Government where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Kirk was ruled; but woe's us all, we see with
you now, the Roof taken off, the Glorious Work pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down, and lying desolat. Now, it hath pleased
GOD to turn again, and offer a Re-edifying of this
Work, as he did here to the People of this Temple; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore the LORD hath stirred up our Spirits to
crave a Re-edifying of Christ's Kirk, let us never take
our hands from it, till Christ have put the Cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
on it. I hear some say, Minister, there is more
ado yet ere that be done, ye sing the Triumph before
he Victory, ye will not see it go up at leasure. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ye are deceived, we sing not the Triumph before
the Victory, some of us are afraid that it go not up so
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102711:10"/>
suddenly: I must say to you, if it be GOD's Work (as
it is indeed) all the Powers of the World shall never
be able to hinder the putting on of the Cope-stone, ay,
but say ye, it will be hindered ere ye get the Work for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ye will find the Dint of the Fire and Sword; let
it be so, if GOD will have it so, that will not impede
the Work; if our Blood be spilt in this Cause, the
Cope-stone shall be put on with our Blood; for the
Kirk of GOD hath never prospered better, nor by the
Blood of Saints, fear not beloved, this Work; whether
it be done peaceably, or with Persecution, the Cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
shall be put on it: ye know, in the beginning of
the Reformation, there was small Likelyhood that the
Work should go up and be finished, because of the great
Power that was against it, yet the LORD brought
it forward against all Impediments, and put the Cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
it; that same GOD lives yet, and is as able to put
the Cope-stone on this Work as he was then, if ye believe.</p>
            <p>3. The third thing in this Work, is a Work praised, <hi>He
shall bring forth the head stone thereof with Shouting, Crying,
Grace, Grace unto it,</hi> all ye that builds and beholds the
Work, will love the Work, and will all wish it well.
He alludes by appearance, who, when the Foundation
of a Common Work is laid, rejoyces, and when it is
finished rejoyces, ye may see this clear in <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 11.
at the laying of the Foundation of this Temple, the
People shouted with a great Shout; if they did that at
the laying of the Foundation, much more shall they do
it at the bringing forth of the head stone thereof, as is
said here, the Words they cry, grace, grace the Phrase
comprehends under it these three things.</p>
            <p>1First, A Wish of the People of GOD, whereby
they wish Prosperity to the Work, ye may see it was a
common Wish,. <hi> Ier. 31. 23. Thus saith the LORD of Hosts,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102711:10"/>
yet they shall use use this Speech in the Land of </hi>Judah,<hi> and
Cities thereof, when I shall bring again their Captivity: The
LORD bless thee, O Habitation of Iustice, and Mountain of
Holiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> It comprehends under it a Thanksgiving, the
Workers give all Praise to the Work, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10. 11. When
the Builders laid the Foundation of the Temple, they set
the Priests with their Trumpets, and the <hi>Levites</hi> with
their Cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of <hi>David,</hi> They Sang by Course, Praising GOD,
and giving Thanks unto the LORD, because he is
good, and his Mercy endureth for ever.</p>
            <p>3. The third thing it comprehends under it, is a
faithful acknowledgment that the Work is built and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by no power and strength of Men, but by the
Grace of GOD, look the Verse preceeding the Text,
and ye will find it thus, not by might or by power, but
by my Spirit saith the LORD of hosts: ye may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this. Our Work that GOD is bringing up, and will
finish, should be a Praised Work, our Wishes should be
to it; <hi>The LORD bless thee, O Habitation of Iustice, and
Mountain of Holiness:</hi> our Song of Thanksgiving should
be in our Mouths, <hi>GOD is good, and his Mercy endureth
for ever:</hi> albeit it go up, let us not ascribe any thing to
our selves, but let us ascribe all to the Grace of GOD,
and this will stop all the Mouths of Disdainers, who say,
who are ye, who think to finish such a Work; we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
it will be finished not by might, or by strength
of Man, but by the Spirit of the LORD of Hosts.</p>
            <p>There are three sorts looking to this Work, and to
the going up of it, 1. Evil-Willers. 2. Well-Wishers. 3.
Neutrals, 1. The Evil-Willers are <hi>Edom,</hi> and he was
<hi>Iacob</hi>'s Brother, yet in <hi>Ps.</hi> 137. he cryes raze, raze
this Work to the Foundation. There is a number that is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102711:11"/>
crying, raze, raze this Work to the Foundation. 2.
There is a second sort that are Well-Wishers, crying
grace, grace be unto it: in those former Years, the
Shout of Raze, Raze, hath been louder than Grace,
Grace; but now, GOD be praised, the Shout of Grace,
Grace is louder than Raze, Raze. 3. There is a third sort
gazing upon this Work, that dare not cry raze, raze,
because they are born down with Grace, Grace, they
dare not cry Grace, Grace, for fear of Authority. What
shall I say to these Neutrals, they are so uncapable of
Admonition, that it will be a spending of time, to crave
their Concurrence to the Work; to whom shall I speak
then, my Text is an Apostrophe, if I may use one, that
which I shall use first<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is GODs own Words from <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
Isai. 1. 3. <hi>Hear O Heaven, Hearken O Earth, for the LORD
hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up Children, and
they have rebelled against me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will next turn me to Strangers and Forreigners, all
ye of Reformed Kirks (what, have I said Strangers, thir
Men who are are brought up in the Kirk, are Strangers
from the Womb, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 3. But) ye are joyned with
us in a Corporation, come therefore with your fellow
feeling, let us hear your Shouts and Cryes of Grace,
Grace be unto the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and let your Wishes
condemn thir ungrateful Neutrals, who professes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Children of this Kirk, and yet will not rejoice
with us for the Well of our Mother.</p>
            <p>Now ye have heard this Text in all thir six Steps. 1.
First a Mountain seen. 2. A Mountain reproved and

of all Well Willers wishing Grace unto the Work. And
seing I have ado with this great Mountain, both with
Mountains that impedes this Work, and all Ranks of

hardened your selves so against the Truth, that nothing
will prevail with you, except ye keep your Worldly
Monarchy, yet ye shall be forced to take up my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe,
<hi>O Mountains of</hi> Gilboa, <hi>on whom the Anointed of the
LORD, is fallen, neither come Dew nor Rain upon you;</hi> ye are
these Mountains, upon whom Christ and his Anointed
has been slain, the Dew nor Rain of GOD's Grace
are not on you, ye may well receive Fatness from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
to make you great in this World, but from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
ye are not Bedewed with the Grace of GOD,
without which, whatever your Bodies be, ye have lean
Souls; under this Course I leave you, and turns to
you, O great Mountains, great Men who are putting
your Shoulders to hold up this Mountain of Prelacy, I
beseech you, if ye have any Love to Christ, to take
your Shoulders and help from this Pestiferous Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Wrack of Christ's Kirk: and if Exhortance
will not prevail with you, I charge you in the Name
of the great GOD, and his Son Jesus Christ, to whom
one day ye must give your Account, that ye in noways
underprop this Mountain, the which if ye obey, I am
sure the LORD will bless you, and your Posterity;
but if ye will not, though ye were never so high a
Mountain in this Kingdom, ye shall become a Plain. I
hear one saying, Minister, I am not afraid for all thou
says, my Mountain is strong enough, and so said
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102711:12"/>
               <hi>David, Psal. 30. 6, 7. I said I shall never be moved, for thou
hast made my mountain strong, thou hides thy face, and I was
troubled.</hi> I will tell you, let your Mountain be never
so strong, if GOD hide his face once, he will make the
tallest Mountain of you tremble; and if that move you
not, he will at last lay you waste. I come to you whose
hearts GOD hath touched to promove this Work in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
Christ is saying to you that Word in <hi>Cant. 4. v. 8.
Come with me from</hi> Lebanon, <hi>my Spouse, come with me from</hi>

Thou hast ravished my heart, my Sister, my Spouse thou hast ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
my Heart with one of thy Eyes.</hi> Christ says this to
you, come from the Dens of Lions, and Mountains of
Leopards, Lions are cruel, and Leopards are crafty and
cruel; for it is reported of them, that they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the thick Branches, and spies the Passengers
coming by, and leaps between their Shoulders, and
kills them; ye have been over long among the Lions
Dens, and the Mountains of Leopards, and now ye are
coming away, this same look hath ravished the Heart of
Christ, ye have wounded him with this look ye have
given to the Cause, continue your help until the Spouse
of Christ be forced from the Lions Dens, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Leopards.</p>
            <p>In particular I speak to all Ranks of Persons, O Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who are the high Mountains of this Kingdom, bow
your Tops and look on the Kirk of Christ, lying in the
Valleys, sighing, groaning, swounding, and looking
towards you with pitiful looks, if the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
have shined on you, let her have a Shadow, as
ye would have GOD to be a Shadow to you in the
Day of your Distress.</p>
            <p>Barrons and Gentlemen, who are as the pleasant

Palms of your Hands reached to the Mountains, that
they and ye may be as a Shelter for the Kirk of Christ,
I pray you separat not your Hands from theirs, till
our Work be brought forth with Shouting.</p>
            <p>Burrows, who are as the Valleys whom GOD hath
blessed with the Fatness of the Earth, and the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise

to you, and ye to them, join your selves in an unsepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

            <p>Ministers and my Faithful Brethren in Christ, whose
Feet are beautiful upon the Mountains, say unto Zion,
behold thy GOD cometh: I tell you, within thir two
years an Honest Mans Feet were not beautiful upon
the Caulsey of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> we might have gone Home
to our Houses again, and shaken the Dust off our Feet
for a Conviction against this Unthankful Generation,
but now (GOD be praised) they are beautiful, and
we are comely in their Eyes, not for any thing in us,
(for we lay all down at the Feet of Christ) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

LORD's Messengers have cryed, behold thy GOD co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
I pray you, if ye have any Love to the Kirk of
Christ, withdraw both your Tongues and Pens from
this Mountain, and apply them against it, apply your
Wits, Engines, Spirits, and all your Strength to bear
down this Mountain, yea tread upon it, and use the
sharp Threshing Instruments which GOD hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

hath not been so great upon this Mountain, as to
make me overlook you, my good People, beloved in
Christ, have ye nothing to contribute for this Work
have ye not so much Power as the Mountains and
Hills have, or have ye not such Substance as the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
yet something ye have, give it, and it will be
acceptable, something against the Mountain, and
something for the Work, if ye have no more against
the Mountain, let me have your Tears, Prayers, and
strong Cryes, I am sure there is as great Value in them,
as in the Rams Horns that blew down <hi>Iericho,</hi> send up
your Prayers, and cry with the Psalmist in the 144
<hi>Psal. v. 5. Bow thy Heavens, O LORD, and come down,
touch the Mountains, and they shall smoak, cast fort Lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and scatter them, shoot out thine Arrows, and destroy
them, send thine Hand from above, and deliver me out of the
great Waters, from the hand of strange Children, whose Mouth
speaketh Vanity, their right Hand is a right Hand of
Falshood.</hi> As ye have your Tears and Prayers against
this Mountain, lend me also what ye have for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of this Work; if ye have no more, let us have
your Shouts and hearty Crying, Grace, Grace be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. Time will not suffer me to speak any more, yet
time shall never bereave you nor me neither of this: let
us all resolve, so long as our Life is in, even to the
last Gasp, as GOD will help us, that this shall be out
last Cry, Grace, Grace be unto this Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> To this Grace I recommend
you, and closes with that Wish of the Apostles in the New
Testament, <hi>The Grace of GOD be with you all.</hi> Amen.</p>
