            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Martyrs Or, The Bloody Aſſizes, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE moſt Illuſtrious Prince <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> is not, for the Illuſtriouſneſs of his Deſcent, inferiour unto any Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> being deſcended from the Loins of the moſt Renowned Monarch, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; and alſo his Eldeſt Son: By which Royal Extraction he is deſcended from the incomparably wiſe and vertuous Prince, the Royal Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt and his Illuſtrious Conſort <hi>Henrietta Maria de Bourbon</hi> Daughter of the Great King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France:</hi> From which two ancient and Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtocks, he was ingrafted into all the Royal Families of <hi>Europe,</hi> and hath concentred in his Princely Veins ſome of their Royal Blood; being thereby allied to all thoſe great Perſonages that are of the moſt high and Illuſtrious Quality in <hi>Europe; viz. James</hi> Duke of <hi>York, William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Lady <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> and her Siſter <hi>Madame de Valois,</hi> Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Oleance,</hi> and the late Princeſs <hi>Henrietta;</hi> alſo to <hi>Charles</hi> Prince Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhine:</hi> His Highneſs <hi>Rupert, Lewis</hi> the fourteenth King of <hi>France,</hi> now reigning; and many other Princes and Potentates of <hi>Europe;</hi> which is abundantly ſufficient to demonſtrate the Nobility of his Birth, and the Illuſtriouſneſs of his Extraction. But to render him yet more Eminent, it pleaſed his Royal Father to dignifie him with ſeverel Magnificient Titles, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon him the ſeveral Great Offices following, <hi>vz.</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Bucclugh,</hi> Earl of <hi>Doucaſter</hi> and <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> Lord <hi>Scott</hi> of <hi>Tindale, Whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> and <hi>Askdale,</hi> Lord Great Chamberlain of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of the Eaſt-Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> Governour of his Majeſties Town and Cittadel of <hi>Kingſtone</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> Chief Juſtice in <hi>Eyre,</hi> of all his Majeſties Forreſts, Chaces, Parks and Warrens on the South-ſide of the River of <hi>Trent.</hi> Lord General of all his Majeſties Land-forces, Captain of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Life-Guards of Horſe, Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe to his Majeſty, one of the Lords of his Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy-Council, and Knight of the moſt noble Oder of the Garter. All which Places he diſcharged with ſo much Honour and Fidelity, that the moſt inveterare and implacable of his Enemies not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their noiſe and clamour againſt him, were not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one ſingle inſtance wherein he acted otherwiſe. Beſides his honour at home, he had likewiſe been highly honoured abroad, by having the Honour to command an Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> as Lieutenant-General under the <hi>French</hi> King, whoſe continual ſucceſs and numerous Victories in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> may be chiefly attributed to the Conduct and Valour of the Great <hi>Monmouth.</hi> He was born at <hi>Rotterdam, April</hi> 9. in the year 1649. in the very heat of our unnatural Broils. About the year 1656. his Mother was ſent a Priſoner to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as appears by a Warrant from the Protector, <hi>July</hi> 12. 1656. to <hi>Barkſtead,</hi> then Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> whereby he diſcharged Mrs. <hi>Lucy Barlow</hi> from her Impriſonment.

to her for her Life, with an Aſſurance to better the ſame when it ſhould pleaſe God to reſtore him to his Kingdom, and it was ſubſcribed by his Majeſties command <hi>Edward Nicholas.</hi> During her abode about <hi>London,</hi> the Cavilears as the Loyaliſts were then call'd, carried themſelves towards her with a profound Reverence and awful Reſpect, treating her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> and both for privacy, Lodged at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Claes Ghyſen</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant living at <hi>Schiedam</hi> about a Mile from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> his Mother lodging at the ſame time at the Houſe of Mrs. <hi>Harvey,</hi> Mother to the famous Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi> and lived in abundance of Pomp and Splendor, having a Gentleman and other Servants to attend her. Some time after he had been there at Nurſe, his Mother being deſirous to ſee him, took her Gentleman with her, who at a place where ſhe called by the Way to, 
to pay a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, deſired to be excuſed for ſome ſmall time, from attending on her, till he had diſpatched ſome extraordinary Buſineſs which he pretended, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to return again immediately, and having obtained her Permiſſion, away he went; but like an ungrateful and treacherous Villain, repaired immediately to Mr. <hi>Ghyſens</hi> at <hi>Schiedam,</hi> where the Princely Babe was nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and pretending to be ſent for that purpoſe to his Mother, carried him and the Nurſe both away. His Lady waited his coming with abundance of patience, but at length Night drawing on, and no Gentleman appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe began to ſuſpect her ſelf to be abuſed, whereupon a Gentleman offering to wait on her thither, ſhe preſently poſted away, and being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and finding her Son gone, I want Words wherewith to expreſs her grief, and ſurprize; ſhe rent her Apparel, tore the Hair from off her Head, and with whole ſhowers of Tears bewailed the greatneſs of her Loſs, and the deplorableneſs of her Condition, yet ſuffered not Grief to prevail ſo far, as to make her uncapable of endeavouring to Right her ſelf; whereupon ſhe preſently gave order for the providing Horſes, which being ready, ſhe preſently poſted away to <hi>Maeſland-Sluce,</hi> riding all Night, ſhe ſuſpected that he was carried thither, in order to be tranſported to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there having been ſome inquiry made after him, ſhe arrived there early in the Morning, juſt as the <hi>Sieur Newport,</hi> one of the Lords of the State, and the <hi>Maeſland</hi> were taking Boat for the <hi>Hague,</hi> thoſe that were with her, adviſed her to make her Application to him as the likelieft Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to aſſiſt her, telling her that he could <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whereupon ſhe addreſſed her ſelf to him in that Languiſh, diſcovering to him the Condition of her ſelf and Son, and the Relation they ſtood in to the King of <hi>England,</hi> with the Circumſtances of his ſtealing away, and pulling out a handful of Gold, <hi>If Money will do it,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I will ſpare for no Charges;</hi> imploring his help and aſſiſtance for the recovery of that Royal Treaſure; this occaſioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of People flocking about them to learn the occaſion of her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, wherefore he adviſed her to go into ſome Houſe and make no noiſe about it, leſt ſhe thereby prevent the accompliſhing her deſire, which ſhe did, and he preſently ordered a general ſearch to be made, and that no Ships ſhould go off till they were ſearched, notwithſtanding which they could make no diſcovery of him till about 10 or 12 days after, when he was found at <hi>Loeſdymen,</hi> where he had been all that time concealed, and having to her inexpreſſible Joy recovered him, ſhe took a ſtately Houſe at <hi>Boſcal,</hi> where they reſided for ſome time.</p>
            <p>Upon his Majeſties going for <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>June</hi> 1650. he was committed by his Majeſty to the care of his Illuſtrious Grandmother, who lived then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36798:4"/>
at the <hi>Par-le-Roy</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and was by her committed to the care of one <hi>Goff</hi> belonging to her Majeſty, charging him to provide a good careful Nurſe for him, which he did accordingly, commending to her Majeſty one Mrs. <hi>Miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a Gentlewoman that belonged likewiſe to her Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Beauty and Make of his Perſon, and the Majeſty of his Port and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, even whilſt an Infant, plainly diſcover'd the Greatneſs of his Birth, and the largeneſs of his Soul, and every ſucceeding Year of his Childhood, and afforded new Promiſes and Hopes that he would prove an Illuſtrious Branch of growing Honour; making an Early Diſcovery even at that tender Age, not only of a Great and Princely Spirit but alſo of an extraordinary Goodneſs and Sweetneſs of Nature, ſeeming to have that even and well-biaſſed Temper of Mind radicated in his very Nature, which other Men with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Induſtry and help of Philoſophy and Religion hardly acquire, when arrived at Years of Maturity.</p>
            <p>Nor were his Inclinations to Vertue more admirable than the deſire he had to learn uſeful and ſolid Arts, his <hi>Genius</hi> rendring the Study and Exerciſes thereof, far more acceptable to him, than the Vanity of the moſt exquiſite Divertiſements. Wherefore when he was about 8 or 9 Years of Age, he was taken from <hi>Goff,</hi> and committed to the Care of Mr. <hi>Roſs,</hi> a Gentleman, who after His Majeſty's Reſtauration, went Secretary to the Honourable <hi>Henry Coventry</hi> Eſquire, (in his Embaſſy to <hi>Sweden)</hi> and ſent to <hi>Julen,</hi> a Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 7 Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> there to be accommodated with Learning, and fitted for thoſe great Employments which God and Nature as well as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had deſigned him for, in the future part of his Life. He went there by the Name of Mr. <hi>Croſſts</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after His Majeſty's happy Reſtauration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he commanded Mr. <hi>Roſs</hi> to turn away all his former Servants, and entertain new ones more ſuitable to his Quality; and to demonſtrate his Paternal Love, and to render his own Happineſs the more compleat, ordered him to be brought to Court, that ſo he might always have him in his Royal Preſence; whereupon he was provided with Gentlemen and Pages to wait on him, together with a rich Coach and 6 ſtately Horſes, a Coach-man, Poſtillion, Groom, and Foot-men in good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, wherewith he ſet forward towards <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About <hi>July,</hi> 1662. he came to <hi>Calis,</hi> where he imbarked for <hi>England;</hi> he Landed at <hi>Dover</hi> from whence he came by Land to <hi>London,</hi> and not finding his Majeſty there, he preſently repaired to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where His Mejeſty then reſided, by whom he was received and imbraced with all the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Joy imaginable; and about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he came with the Court to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where His Majeſty was pleaſed to appoint him his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Privy Gallery.</p>
            <p>Soon after His Majeſty was pleaſed to make him a Peer of this Realm, by Creating him Duke of <hi>Arkeny,</hi> which Title was after changed for that of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> and the Cap and Robes being preſented to him, in the enſuing Parliament he took his Seat in the Houſe of Peers.</p>

            <p>Soon after this, upon the Reſignation of the Lord <hi>Brandon Gerard,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Charles,</hi> created him Captain of his Life-Guard, and admitted one of his Majeſty's moſt Honourable Privy-Council. In the Year 1672. the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIVth. made great Preparations for a War againſt the <hi>Datch,</hi> in which King <hi>Charles</hi> engaging, the Duke was ſent to Command the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe Gallantry and Bravery was ſufficiently admir'd by all preſent, where was the <hi>French</hi> King himſelf.

            <p>About <hi>November</hi> following, having taken Leave of the King, he ſet out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for <hi>France,</hi> where he was received in a very ſplendid manner by the <hi>French</hi> King and the Nobility; and being arriv'd at <hi>Calais,</hi> Dec. 18<hi>th.</hi> he ſent an Expreſs to his Majeſty, to acquaint him that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was on the 15th ſat down with his Army before <hi>Char eroy,</hi> and that there was great Expectation in thoſe Parts, what would be the Iſſue of that Enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Duke was highly welcom'd in all the Places through which he paſs'd, and return'd to <hi>England</hi> again before the opening of the Campaign; at what time he attended the King of <hi>France</hi> into the Field, and is remarkably diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd in Hiſtory for his Conduct and Valour at the Siege of <hi>Maeſtrich,</hi> and came into <hi>England</hi> afterward with great Applauſe.

What happen'd otherwiſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, is hardly Material. He grew into Love and Favour with the People, which appear'd in the Buſineſs of the <hi>Waliſea</hi> Race, for which he was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cuſtody; he was alſo Baniſh'd; but we ſhall paſs over all theſe things, and come nearer to the Deſign in hand, which is the Buſineſs of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> in which we ſhall comprehend his Death.</p>

King <hi>James</hi> IId. being aſcended the Throne, and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> then abroad, and being ſufficiently ſtunn'd with the unexpected News of the Death of King <hi>Charles,</hi> having enter'd into a League with the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> putting great Confidence in his own Courage, and a vain Aſſurance of a Popular Affection and Aſſiſtance, bore up himſelf againſt all pretended Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and with three ſmall Ships, and between Threeſcore and Fourſcore Men, landed about the 12th of <hi>June</hi> at <hi>Lyme</hi> in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> while the Parliament was ſitting: A <hi>Romantick</hi> kind of <hi>Invaſion,</hi> and ſcarce paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd in Hiſtory; yet with this handful of Men, and afterward with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People that join'd him, without Arms, Proviſions, Martial Diſcipline, Money, or any one place to retire to in caſe of Accidents, did this Brave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Man bid fair for a Crown. He landed, as was ſaid before, at <hi>Lyme</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> where he increas'd his Number to One hundred and Fifty, from thence he march'd to <hi>Taunton,</hi> where he was Proclaim'd King, and Men flock'd to him, and Liſted under him as faſt, as if he had already been Maſter of the whole Country. After ſtaying there a while, he marched in ſome kind of Order to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> ſtill increaſing his Numbers; from thence to <hi>Bath,</hi> where he was denied Entrance, the Train'd-Bands ſtill flying two Days March before him, by Order from the Court, to give pretence to the King to raiſe more Forces. At <hi>Philips Norton,</hi> by a Surprize or Ambuſh, he cut off the beſt part of a Troop of Horſe, the Duke of <hi>Grafton</hi> narrowly eſcaping with his Life. With this Succeſs he marched within 2 Miles of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where a Conſult being held, he was adviſed not to enter that City, but to retreat back to <hi>Bridgwater;</hi> which was the firſt thing that diſhearten'd his Party, and hinder'd many from joining with him: Whereas if he had entred <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> where there was no Force to oppoſe him but the Train'd-Bands, and the generality of them for him, not only in their Hearts, but in open Diſcourſes and drinking his Health, he might have furniſh'd himſelf with Men, Arms and Money, to have enabl'd him to march into <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> among the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers, where great Numbers, and ſome of Quality, waited to join him, and by this means might have kept up the War till he had ſhak'd King <hi>James</hi>'s Throne, if not overturn'd it.</p>
            <p>In this time the King had ſent an Army into the <hi>Weſt</hi> againſt <hi>Monmouth,</hi> under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> as General, who incamp'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sedgmore,</hi> not far from <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and his Party were Quarter'd; and the Duke ſeeing his Men daily Deſert in great Numbers, it was agreed to make one Puſh for all, and to that purpoſe iſſu'd out of <hi>Bridgwater</hi> by Night; but his Guide miſtaking his way in the Dark, the Duke's <hi>Ill Fate</hi> lead him upon a Battallion of <hi>Dumbarton</hi>'s Regiment plac'd in his way; who encountering him, alarm'd King <hi>James</hi>'s whole Army, with whom engaging he was <hi>Routed;</hi> or in all probability he had ſurpriz'd the King's Army in their Camp, and perhaps at that ſingle Blow decided the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>England</hi> for once. Yet however, tho' he came too ſoon, before Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were Ripe, by King <hi>James</hi>'s ſetting up for the open Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> yet he may be ſaid to have pav'd the Way for a <hi>Nobler Change in the Throne,</hi> by leaving King <hi>James</hi> at Liberty through this ſucceſs, to act without Controul, which at length made him Abdicate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Monmouth</hi> paid the Price of his Rebellion with his Blood, being on the 15th of <hi>July,</hi> 1685. Beheaded on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> by vertue of an <hi>Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> paſs'd upon him in Parliament ſoon after his Landing.</p>

                        <p>THE Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> came from the <hi>Tower</hi> to the Scaffold, attended by the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Bath and Wells,</hi> Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hooper;</hi> which four the King ſent him, as his Aſſiſtants, to prepare him for Death: The Duke himſelf entreated all four of them to accompany him a the Place of Execution, and to cantinue with him to the laſt. The two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops going in the Lieutenant's Coach with him to the Bars, made Seaſonable and Devont Applications to him all the way; and one of them deſired him not to be ſurprized, if they to the very laſt upon the Scaffold, renewed thoſe Exhortations to a particular Repentance, which they had ſo often repeated before.</p>
                        <p>At his firſt coming upon the Scaffold, he looked for the Executioner; and ſeeing him, ſaid, Is this the Man to do the Buſineſs? Do your Work well.</p>

                  <p>YOUR Majeſty may think, it is the Misfortune I now lie under, makes me make this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to you; but I do aſſure your Majeſty it is the Remorſe I now have in me, of the Wrongs I have done you in ſeveral things, and now, in taking up Arms againſt you. For my taking up Arms, it never was in my Thoughts ſince the King died. The Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> will be Witneſs for me, of the Aſſurance I gave them, That I would never ſtir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

you; but my Misfortune was ſuch, as to meet with ſome Horrid People, that made me believe things of your Majeſty, and gave me ſo many falſe Arguments, that I was fully led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it was a Shame and a Sin before God not to do it. But, Sir, I will not trouble your Majeſty at preſent with many things that I could ſay for my ſelf, that I am ſure would move your Compaſſion; the chief end of this Letter, being only to beg of you, That I may have that Happineſs, as to ſpeak to your Majeſty: For I have that to ſay to you, Sir, that I hope may give you a long and happy Reign. I am ſure, Sir, when you hear me, you will be convinced of the Zeal I have for your Preſervation, and how heartily I repent of what I have done. I can ſay no more to your Majeſty now, being this Letter muſt be ſeen by thoſe that keep me. Therefore, Sir, I ſhall make an end, in begging of your Majeſty to believe ſo well of me, That I would rather die a thouſand Deaths, than excuſe any thing I have done, if I did not really think my ſelf the moſt in the wrong, that ever any Man was, and had not from the bottom of my Heart an abhorrence for thoſe that put him upon it, and for the Action it ſelf. I hope, Sir, God Almighty will ſtrike your Heart with Mercy and Compaſſion for me, as he has done mine with the Abhorrence of what I have done. Therefore I hope, Sir, I may live to ſhew you how Zealous I ſhall ever be for your Service; and could I ſay but one Word in this Letter, you would be convinced of it; but it is of that Conſequence, That I dare not do it. Therefore, Sir, I do beg of you once more, to let me ſpeak to you, for then you will be convinced how much I ſhall ever be Your Majeſty's moſt Humble and Dutiful.</p>

We ſhall now proceed to give an Account of the Perſons that ſuffer'd for the ſime Cauſe, ſome of the more principal of which (whoſe Eſſigies are hereunto affix'd) 'tis thought worth the while to Treat diſtinctly of; giving an Exact Liſt of the other, and the Places where they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd; and Firſt, of thoſe remarkable Brothers, Mr. <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Hewling;</hi> the Elder was a Captain of Horſe, and the Younger a Lieutenant of Foot in the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Service: They got on Ship-board after the Defeat at <hi>Sedgmore,</hi> but were Caſt away on the Coaſt again, and ſo taken: The laſt, <hi>William,</hi> was Executed at <hi>Lyme,</hi> where juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went to die, he ſaid to one of his Fellow-Sufferers, <hi>Here is a ſweet Promiſe for us; I will not leave you comfortleſs. I will come unto you.</hi> One taking Leave of him, he ſaid, <hi>Farewel till we meet in Heaven; preſently I ſhall be with Chriſt, O! I would not change Conditions with any that ſtay behind for ten thouſand Worlds: Pray remember my Dear Love to my Brother and Siſter, and tell them I deſire they would comfort themſelves that I am gone to Chriſt, and we ſhall quickly meet at the Glorious Mount</hi> Sion <hi>above.</hi> Afterwards he Prayed for near half an Hour with great Fervency, Bleſſing God earneſtly for the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Praying for the Peace of the Church of God, and of theſe Nations in particular. When he was going out of the World, with a Joyful Countenance he ſaid, <hi>Oh! now my Joy and Comfort is, that I have a Chriſt to go to;</hi> and ſo gently reſign'd his Spirit to God the 12th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1685.</p>
            <p>As to the Elder Brother, when he had receiv'd the News of his Brother's Death, and that he died with ſo much Comfort and Joy, he replied, <hi>We have no cauſe to fear Death, if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God be with us;</hi> and added, <hi>Perhaps my Friends may think this Summer the ſaddeſt Time of my Life; but, I Bleſs God, it has been the ſweeteſt and moſt happy time of all.</hi> Speaking of the Diſappointment of their Expectations in the Work they had undertaken, he ſaid, <hi>With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Glory of God, the Proſperity of the Goſpel, and the Delivery of the People of God, We have great cauſe to lament it, but for that outward Proſperity that have attended it, it's but of ſmall Moment, and Death would have ended i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Being come to the Place of Execution, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving embrac'd his Fellow-Sufferers, he deſir'd of the Sheriff that he might Pray particularly, but he could not grant it; only ask'd him, if he would Pray for the King?

            <p>The next was one <hi>William Jenkin,</hi> Condemn'd at the Bloody Aſſize at <hi>Dorcheſter, Sept.</hi> the 29th, at Night. After he had heard he muſt die the next Day, he was exceedingly compos'd and chearful, expreſſing his Satisfaction in the Will of God. He us'd many Excellent Speeches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and at his Death: Among the reſt he ſaid, <hi>This manner of Death hath been the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing in the World to my Thoughts, but I beſs God, now am I neither afraid nor aſham'd to die.</hi> When the Sheriff came to perform his Execution, he was ſtill as Compo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>NOT knowing whether I ſhould be ſuffered or able, becauſe of Weakneſſes that are upon me through my hard and cloſe Impriſonment, to ſpeak at the Place of Execution; I writ theſe few Lines to ſignifie, That I am well reconciled to the Way of my God towards me, though it be in Ways I looked not for; and by terrible Things, yet in Righteouſneſs; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given me Life, he ought to have the diſpoſing of it, when and how he pleaſes to call for it; and I deſire to offer up my All to him, it being but my reaſonable Service; and alſo the firſt Terms that Jeſus Chriſt offers, that he that will be his Diſciple, muſt forſake all and follow him; and therefore let none think hard, or be diſcouraged at what hath happened unto me; for he doth nothing without Cauſe, in all he hath done to us, he being holy in all his Ways, and righteous in all his Works; and 'tis but my Lot in common with poor deſolate <hi>Sion</hi> at this Day. Neither do I find in my Heart the leaſt Regret for what I have done in the Service of my Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, in ſuccouring and ſecuring any of his poor Sufferers, that have ſhewed Favour in his righteous Cauſe: Which Cauſe, though now it be fallen and trampled upon, as if it had not been anointed, yet it ſhall revive, and God will plead it at another Rate than ever he hath done yet, and reckon with all its Oppoſers and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36798:8"/>
malicious Haters; and therefore let all that love and fear him, not omit the leaſt Duty that comes to Hand, or lies before them, knowing that now it hath need of them, and expects they ſhall ſerve him. And I deſire to bleſs his holy Name, that he hath made me uſeful in my Generation to the Comfort and Relief of many Deſolate Ones, and the Bleſſing of thoſe that are ready to periſh has come upon me, and being helpt to make the Heart of the Widow to ſing. And I bleſs his holy Name, that in all this, together with what I was charged with, I can approve my Heart to him, that I have done his Will; tho' it does croſs Man's Will, and the Scriptures that ſatisfie me are, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>Hide the Outcaſts, bexray not him that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth.</hi> And <hi>Obad.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Thou ſhouldſt not have given up thoſe of his that eſcape in the Day of his Diſtreſs.</hi> But Man ſays, You ſhall give them up, or you ſhall dye for it. Now who to obey, judge ye. So that I have Cauſe to rejoyce and be exceeding glad, in that I ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake, and that I am accounted worthy to ſuffer for Well doing, and that God has accepted any Service from me, which has been done in Sincerity, tho' mixed with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Infirmities, which he hath been pleaſed for Chriſt's ſake to cover and forgive. And now as concerning my Fact, as it is called, alas it was but a little one, and might well become a Prince to forgive; but he that ſh ws no Mercy, ſhall find none: And I may ſay of it in the Language of <hi>Jonathan, I did but taſte a little Honey, and lo I muſt die for it.</hi> I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Well, I deſire in the Lamb-like Goſpel-Spirit to forgive all that are concerned, and to ſay, Lord, lay it not their Charge; but I fear he will not: Nay, I believe when he comes to make Inquiſition for Blood, it will be found at the Door of the furious Judge; who, becauſe I could not remember Things through my Dauntedneſs at <hi>Burton</hi>'s Wife's and Daughter's Vileneſs and my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, took Advantage thereat, and would not hear me, when I had called to mind that which I am ſure would have invalidated their Evidence; tho' he granted ſomething of the ſame Nature to another, yet denyed it to me. My Blood will alſo be found at the Door of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Jury, who found me Guilty upon the ſingle Oath of an out-lawed Man; for there was none but his Oath about the Money, who is no legal Witneſs, though he be pardoned, his Out-lawry cannot be recalled; and alſo the Law requires two Witneſſes in point of Life: And then about my going with him to the Place mentioned, 'twas by his own Words, before he was Out-lawed, for 'twas two Months after his abſconding; and tho' in a Proclamation, yet not High Treaſon, as I have heard; ſo that I am clearly murdered by you. And alſo Bloody Mr. <hi>A.</hi> who has ſo inſatiably hunted after my Life; and though it is no Profit tlo him, through the ill Will he bore me, left no Stone unturned, as I have ground to believe, till he brought it to this; and ſhewed favour to <hi>Burton,</hi> who ought to have dyed for his own Fault, and not bought his Life with mine; and Capt. R. who is cruel and ſevere to all under my Circumſtances, and did at that time, without all Mercy or Pity, haſten my Sentence, and held up my Hand, that it might be given, all which, together with the Great One of all, by whoſe Power all theſe, and a Multitude more of Cruelties are done, I do heartily and freely forgive, as againſt me; but as it is done in an implacable Mind agaigſt the Lord Chriſt, and his righteous Cauſe and Followers, I leave it to him who is the Avenger of all ſuch Wrongs, who will tread upon Princes as upon Mortar, and be terrible to the Kings of the Earth: And know this alſo, that though ye are ſeemingly fixt, and becauſe of the Power in your Hand, are writing out your Violence, and dealing with a deſpight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We are not to ſuffer our Spirits to be exaſperated againſt the Inſtruments of our Trouble; for the ſame Affliction may be an Effect of their Paſſion, and yet ſent to God to puniſh us for our Sin: Though 'tis a Comfort when we may ſay to them with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 59. 3. <hi>Not for my Tranſgreſſio, nor for my Sin, O Lord.</hi> Nor are we, by fraudulent, puſillanimous Compliances in wicked Courſes, to bring Sin upon our ſelves: Faint Hearts are ordinary falſe Hearts; chuſing Sin rather than Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and a ſhort Life with eternal Death, before temporal Death and a Crown of Glory.

That he would give them an Account of his firſt Undertaking in the Deſign, which was long before in <hi>London;</hi> for there he agreed to ſtand by, and aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> when Opportunity offered; in order to which, he went to <hi>Holland</hi> with him, and there continued until this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which God had thought fit to fruſtrate his and other good Mens Expectations: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Proteſtant Religion was bleeding, and in a Step towards Extirpation, and therefore he with theſe his Brethren that were to ſuffer with him, and thouſands more, had adventured their Lives and their All to ſave it; but God Almighty had not appointed 'em to be the Inſtruments in ſo glorious a Work; yet notwithſtanding he did verily believe, and doubted not, but that God would make uſe of others, that ſhould meet with better ſucceſs, though the Way or Means was not yet viſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of this he did not doubt: He alſo was ſatisfied of the Duke's Title, ſo that Matter did not afflict him on account of his engaging on his Score: And going on further with a Diſcourſe of this Nature, he was asked by a Perſon, <hi>Why he did not pray for the King?</hi> He with a ſmiling Countenance anſwered, <hi>I am ſorry you do not yet underſtand the Difference between ſpeaking and praying.</hi> And having ended his Diſcourſe, he then prepared himſelf by prayer for his Diſſolution, which was very devout and pious for half an hour.</p>

                        <p>I am now going into that World, where many dark Things ſhall be made perfectly manifeſt and clear, and many doubtful Things fully reſolved, and a plenary Satisfaction given concerning them; all Diſputes and Miſtakes concerning Treaſon, Rebellion, and Schiſm, ſhall be at an End, and ceaſe for ever: Many Things that are innocent, lawful, and laudable, which have ſoul Marks and black Characters ſtampt and fixe upon 'em here, they ſhall be perfectly purified, and fully cleanſed from there; where at one View more ſhall be known of them, than by all wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Debates and eager Diſputes, or by reading all Polemical Books concerning them here. I greatly deplore and bewail the greedy Appetite and inſatiable Thirſt, that profeſſing Proteſtants have after the Blood of their Brethren, and the high pleaſure they take in the Effuſion thereof. But what will not Men do, when they are either judicially blinded, or their ſecular worldly Intereſt inſenſibly inſinuates and winds it ſelf into their Religion, is ſo twiſted and incorporated with it, that it animates and acts it, is the Life and Soul, the vital Form and Power, and made wholly ſubſervient thereunto.</p>

At laſt came out a General Pardon, with Exceptions, very few, if any of thoſe

that were ſollicited for, not being excepted, were of Courſe pardoned; but however, divers Sums of Money having been paid, no Reſtitution to be had, for <hi>from Hell is no Redemption.</hi> A <hi>Weſtern</hi> Gentleman's Purchaſe came to fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſixteen hundred Guineas, which my Lord Chancellour had. Amongſt the Exceptions were a Parcel of <hi>Yaunton</hi> Girls, ſome of which were Children of eight or ten Years old; however ſomething was to be made of them, if theſe Ladies were judged guilty of Treaſon, for preſenting the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> with Colours, &amp;c. and for to preſerve theſe from Trial, they were given to Maids of Honour to make up their <hi>Chriſtmas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Box;</hi> ſo that an Agent of theirs was ſent down into the Country to compound with their Parents, to preſerve them from what might after follow, if taken; ſo that ſome, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Ability, gave 100 <hi>l.</hi> others 50 <hi>l.</hi> all which however did not anſwer the Ladies firſt Expectations; yet it did ſatisfie, and they were accordingly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Thus we have given you an Account of what hath happened on this Occaſion, being in every Point Truth: We might have farther enlarged, but that would have ſpoiled the Deſign, and ſwoln our Pocket-Companion to a Volume too big.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore next proceed to give you a true and exact Liſt of all them that were condemned, and ſuffered in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and the Year 1685. under the Sentence of my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> with the Names of the Towns where every Man was executed.</p>
