            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HIS
LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Salutem in Domino.</salute>
               <salute>My Reverend Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING to my great dissatisfaction
received advertisements that in most
Parishes of the Diocese, there is a
notorious Omission of publick Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising,
(though strictly enjoined by Authority
Civil and Ecclesiastical) whereby a Sluce hath
been opened to streams, to torrents of novelties
of Tenets; to impieties, enormities of Practices;
I apprehend it strictly incumbent on me, as my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35217:3"/>
Pastoral duty, to excite, to importune the speedy
redress of this scandalous neglect; to be like <hi>Origen,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that the younger sort whose precious
Souls you are accountable for (within your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Precincts) may not be like Clouds whiffled
about with every gust of Errour; and whilst
undisciplin'd, prostituted to the approaches, the
lures of all defilements, exposed to the taint, the
contagion of every modish Vice; but that they
may by your sedulous conscientious Care be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
season'd with a tincture of Grace, the more
firmly to retain the impression of it, that they
may be Orthodoxly principled in point of Piety
towards God, Loyalty to the Sovereign Powers, of
Temperance to themselves, of Justice and Charity
towards others.</p>
            <p>I presume you will alledg, that the Pulpit hath
herein abundantly supplied the defailance of the
Desk, of the Reading Pew; that your Sermons
have reiterated those Lectures, though not in the
formal Catechistical dress, and method. Whereas
when humane laws are not repugnant to Divine;
the solemn Maxime, Obedience is better than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
is a safe Rule, not onely in pious, but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
considerations; it being an influence of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35217:3"/>
Judgment to suspect our own Judgment, not to
overween our Intellectuals, but to allow that our
Governours in their well weighed Constitutions,
and Canons, may be as wise, as upright as our
selves.</p>
            <p>I shall not set sacred Ordinances to clash with
each other, which ought to be Buttresses for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
support; I shall not discountenance, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiate
the indispensably requisite Exercise of
Preaching; it being no panick terror of a dismal
menace, not appropriated to the Apostle himself
onely, but extended to the whole Priestly fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<q>
                  <hi>For necessity is laid upon me, yea woe unto
me if I preach not the Gospel</hi> 
                  <bibl>(1 Cor. 9. 16.)</bibl>
               </q> This
Woe is a gloomy doom of utter darkness,  (i<hi>ipsâ bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate
foecunda</hi>n <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s phrase) fraught with
fulness in conciseness: yet this duty of Preaching
is no <hi>supersedeas</hi> to the Catechism, one can give
no legal Bill of Divorce to the other, but ought
to be as a meet help in a conjugal link, the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage,
the disparagement of the one as unsinewed,
ungarnish'd, will add no force, no lustre to the
other; Preaching without the auxiliary Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
preparation may prove like to sounding Brass,
like a tinkling Cymbal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:35217:4"/>
This condescension of instruction by way of
Dialogue is more smoothly insinuating, more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
edifying; whereby the principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are more easily imbibed, less nauseated,
disrelish'd by Palates naturally corrupted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the first rudiments of Divinity are more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
chewed by Novices, by Babes in Christ,
whose Flock consists of Lambs to be fed, as
well as Sheep. <hi>Gerson</hi> the famous <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctor
Chancellour of <hi>Paris,</hi> being aspersed, as if being
a Catechist to Children, he had eclipsed his Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
sullied his Reputation in a derogatory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating
disguise of humility; with a judicious
candour he vindicated himself, not retaliating
any virulency, or acrimony of Censure; that he
might otherwise teach Disciples, <hi>pomposiùs,</hi> more
pompously, instruct more floridly, more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the continued harangue of a Sermon,
but not, <hi>fructuosiùs,</hi> more fruitfully, as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Understanding, as to the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
of the Heart, in greener years, though
less plausibly acceptable to the itch of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> curiosity
in the attention of the Ear, wherein by an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
integrity he design'd to advance Gods
Glory, whilst he despis'd his own. Amongst
my Brethren you, that are most eminently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35217:4"/>
for Arts, and Languages (Talents you are
intrusted with, that must be awfully reckon'd
for at the Audit of the last day) ought not to
disdain to stoop to the Catechistical task (solid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
perspicuously laying the foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity)
which requires a mature knowledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an
indefatigable diligence, a discreet regular Zeal.
<hi>Lewis</hi> the 9th of <hi>France</hi> did not apprehend it an
indignity derogatory from his Royal grandeur to
catechise a Scullion, upon the account of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Soul equally interested in the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of Christs ransom with his own.</p>
            <p>This Province however contemptible in the
common estimate in later corrupted times, (it
being with Seasons as with Vessels, the dregs draw
downwards) yet it hath not been spurn'd at,
not waved by the most renowned Fathers of the
Primitive Church, <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to insist on instances of a more transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Station, of an Evangelist of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
of an Apostle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
where his Planting hath been antiently expounded
Catechizing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:35217:5"/>
This hath been the prime ingredient for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
and propagating the stability of Truth
in Doctrine, of the beauty of holiness in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
in the best and purest Ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the signal observation of the most Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd
modern Prelate Bishop</hi> Andrews, When
Catechizing was left off in the Church, it soon became
darkned and overspread with Ignorance: the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
therefore acknowledg that all the advantages the
Protestants have gotten of them hath come by this
exercise, and it is to be feared that if ever they get
ground of us, it will be by their more exact and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
catechizing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>I may innocently though (I presume) not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensively)
with that the over-rise disuse of this
Ordinance be not rather varnish'd, than justified
by the subterfuge of an Apology, by the specious
excuse of some of my Brethren, in shifting the
Scene of guilt, entirely transferring it from their
own remissness, to the refractoriness of Parents, in
behalf of their Children, not to be cajold, by any
invitations, and overtures.</p>
            <p>Whereas no paint of Pretence, no artifice of pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35217:5"/>
can deceive the Scrutiny, can evade the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the All seeing revenging God.</p>
            <p>I must mournfully acknowledg, that many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are alienated from this Discipline, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
by the fascination of erroneous Sentiments,
or deluded by prejudice of Education, or divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by profane supine inadvertences; so that there
may seem requisite the Constitution and practice
of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Reformed Churches, establish'd
also in a <hi>Gallican</hi> Synod, that none be admitted to
a Matrimonial State till first qualified by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techistical
Discipline; yet before any such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
can be expected, I question not but by the
blessing of God on the Devout Addresses, the active
endeavours of my Brethren of the Clergy, by the
vicissitudes of publick and private lenitive persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Arguments (experimentally found successful)
some Parents even of obdurate tempers may be
softned to melting bowels, for the spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
no less than the temporal of their nearest
Relations, the transcripts of the Originals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
multiplied, set out in lesser Editions; left
otherwise they be branded in Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>'s
expression to be <hi>peremtores,</hi> not <hi>parentes.</hi> Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the minority of Age, the blossoms
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35217:6"/>
of years are not exempted from the blasts of Fate,
from the period of Death, according to the Jewish
Proverb, There are Sculls of all Sizes discernable in
Golgotha. It was their prudential cautionary Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the first Characters to be imprinted in the
minds of their Children should be religious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements,
whereby Nature it self might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
cultivated, transplanted to Grace, and pious
Acts without difficulty and anxiety improved to
Habits.</p>
            <p>It is the sage encouragement of a Sacred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<hi>Prov. 22. 6. Train up a Child in the way he
should go, and when he is old he will not depart
from it.</hi> The intellectual faculties are best recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
most retentive of the first Tincture of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature.
<q>Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem
Testa diu.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis also with Tenets as with Viands, an Errour
in the first degree of Concoction is not easily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in the second or third. The Babes of the
<hi>Israelites</hi> were Textuaries, vers'd in the Principles
of Divinity before they were instructed in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of Grammar. The Church of Christ in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35217:6"/>
the Primitive lustre did not degenerate from this
Mosaical Pattern. Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> asserts, that the
first word Children were prompted to assay to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was <hi>Halleluja</hi> composed of <hi>Halelu</hi> and <hi>jah.</hi>
Praise the Lord.</p>
            <p>As when in a lower in a lesser Orb, being for
many years confined to a Parochial distinct limit,
I could not with tranquillity of mind, with peace of
Conscience indulge my self to decline the Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
performance; so being placed (however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily)
in a higher Sphere for a more diffusive
inspection, (your selves the Shepherds, in a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Notion; being my Flock.) I cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
perfidiousness to my Pastoral Charge, connive
at any, who shall reject this Initiatory Exercise, not
recommended only as arbitrarily to be pursued, or
baulked, according to your own fancies, but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unavoidably to be observed, as necessary, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate
praecepti,</hi> though not <hi>medii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In discharging this Duty you are not left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
for option in choice of Novelties of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms
to gratifie your own selfish opinionative
Sentiments, or the different Shibboleth of others, as
if our Saviours Compass for Religion had as many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35217:7"/>
Points to vary as the Mariners for Navigation. The
<hi>Arrian</hi> Creed was tax'd by <hi>S. Hilary</hi> to be as change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as the Moon. In due submission to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the Catechism enjoyn'd in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ought to be expounded, not exploded. It is
highly approv'd by forein reform'd Divines. Mr.
<hi>Dally</hi> a bright Luminary in his Sphere (in the
<hi>Gallican</hi> Protestant Church) magnifies the Purity,
the brevity,<note place="margin">Dallaeus in l. 2. Confer.</note> the perspicuity of it, Orthodoxly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
from the Oracles of Scripture.</p>
            <p>I shall further implore your sedulous Care in
admonishing the Parents of Children Catechiz'd,
not to neglect the opportunities of Episcopal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
as soon as they are in a competent Age,
a degree of apprehension of understanding: not
barely capacitated by a promptness of memory, of
elocution, for recital, to be disciplin'd onely like
Parrots.</p>
            <p>Let not the disuse excite a disesteem of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
though not to be dignified to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
in the strictest notion, yet it is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
celebrated as a Sacred Ordinance, extending

double aspect, it looks backward, as additional
auxiliary to Baptism (inverting the Scene of the
Votaries of Christian Piety by Proxies, by Sureties,
to an immediate personal professional Obligation)
Confirmation also looks forward, as a proper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary
to the Eucharist precisely antecedently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for the practice, at least the desire of it in
the judgment of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
retain'd, solemnly observ'd in the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Churches in the venerable track of the purest Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive.</p>
            <p>Not to insist on the Canons, the Sanctions of
Councils: <hi>Beza</hi> in a higher Key of Advancement
exalts it to be an Apostolical Institution in the
phrase of Imposition of Hands (<hi>Heb. 6. 2.) Calvin</hi>
vindicates the antient exercise of Confirmation, not
tainted with the Lees of the Modern Romish Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
(as it is refin'd in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
deplores the omission; yerns, pleads for the
restitution of it, amplifies the emoluments of it
for preventing new-started Errours, for tuning the
jarring Strings of contentions to a melodious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
for an uniform Stability of religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and judicious Methods.</p>

Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> expresly acknowledges that the not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
of Confirmation hath brought us into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and that it must be the practising of it
that must restore our Church to order, and heal
most of our divisions.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> pathetically resented the defailance
of a strict inquiry in this concern, both in Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
and Archidiaconal Visitations. Not to dilate
an Epistle to a Volume, I shall conclude with a
paternal Monitory Advice, which being tender'd
with the right hand, (with a sincere respect) let
it not be receiv'd with the left, (with a sinister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.)</p>
            <p>Toward the younger Sort, Let not your grave
Discourse be destitute of the Efficacy, tho' it be
of the Formality of a Catechism; <hi>Maxima de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur
pueris Reverentia.</hi> Towards the Elder
Sort, Let your Conversation be a daily Sermon;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35217:8"/>
in a Pastoral precedence of Conduct, after the
mode of the Eastern Countries; to lead your
Parochial Flocks by a Constancy of Orthodox
Doctrine, (<hi>Fidei regula</hi> being <hi>irrefragabilis, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobilis,</hi>
saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) and by the integrity
of a regular Deportment; Not to be like the
Roman <hi>Cassius Severus, Maleficae vitae, sed oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
validus,</hi> (in the Historian's Character of him)
eloquently persuasive in Language, profanely
execrable in Life.</p>
            <p>This were to present the Devil in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s
Mantle, to cover the blackest, vilest deformity,
that of Wickedness, with a specious white Ephod.
The Infirmities of others are our Crimes, our
Crimes Enormities, Prodigies. In the Mosaical
Law as large a Sacrifice is requir'd for the Priest,
as for the whole Congregation.</p>
            <p>It besteads, beseems you in all the emergencies,
difficulties of the times, to acquit your selves wise
as Serpents (not to be deluded) harmless as Doves
(not to be deprav'd, not envenom'd, embitter'd)
The candor, moderation of <hi>Bucer,</hi> was too rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if not morosely charged to be his Crime,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35217:9"/>
even by some worthy reformed Divines his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries.</p>
            <p>The most sedate tempers, the most pacifique
Spirits are least impure whilst most offensive;
It being the Observation of <hi>Livy, Media via nec
parit amicos, nec tollit inimicos.</hi> Being unleaven'd
with Animosities in Controversies, in Debates
let your Prudence calmly guard your Innocence,
and your Innocence uprightly sanctifie your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
(If the salt be unsavoury wherewith
shall it be season'd?) Let it be an unsullied, unbiast,
unscanted Innocence. The Law of God is not
disjunctive, but copulative in the decision of the
Schoolmen.</p>
            <p>The desertion, the detestation of one Vice is
no warrant, no privilege for the pursuits, the
embraces, the caresses of another, tho' more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular,
set out in a more fashionable Dress, and
Varnish.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> complain'd of some Divines, whose
keen reproof had but one Edge, extended not to
both the extreams of iniquities; their Zeal being
like <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Cake, Dough unbaked of one side.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:35217:9"/>
Let not your Spiritual Interests in any trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
truckle to Temporal. let all recesses from
the deliberate conviction of Judgment, the clear
dictate of Conscience (tho' smoothly palliated)
be piously dreaded.</p>
            <p>It is the disconsolate Maxim of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
               <q>Qui agit contra Conscientiam aedificat ad Gehennam.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore follow not Examples against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancies
of Conscience, but listen to the Excellent
Admonition of the son of <hi>Sirach, Accept no Person
against thine own Soul, and let not the Reverence to any
man cause thee to fall. Ecclesiasticus</hi> 4. 22.</p>
            <p>I cordially, constantly recommend you to the
