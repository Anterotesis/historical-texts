         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>You long (I know) to heare the cause, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his death, whose life and doings were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous;
and many (I doubt not) will thinke, (and
probablie too) that it should bee in reason some
strange, and violent death, that is befalne him; that
was so monstrous and immoderate in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
and that either in the fire, water, or ayre,
that so troubled the earth while he liued vpon it.
The verie truth I will tell you (for pitie it were to
belie the dead) from point to point, without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:8731:18"/>
so much as a pinnes point, as neere as my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moric

(as commonly in such great accidents is accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
and all false. Some say hee was taken by the
Spaniards, and burnt in the <hi>Groyne,</hi> and they that
report so, say that hee brought the cause thereof
from hence with him, not for religion, but some
other causes that now I omit. Some, that he was
hanged by his owne companie at <hi>Lisbone</hi> for a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nie,
which was verie likelie to haue been true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that euer was giuen to factions and mutinies,
while he liued here. Some, that comming thence,
hauing before ouerdronke himselfe with the hot
wines of those Countries (which he could not but
loue wel, being so seldome sober for the most part
as he was) he died of a surfet, and was throwne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
boord, &amp; so was double drowned both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and without. Some, that riding in his visitation
his horse stumbled, and he brake his necke which
other some say, was in some other sort, as that hee
wandring to that purpose in the manner of a <hi>Gip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
for that he would not bee knowne, was taken,
and trust vp for a roge, and that onelie knowne to
his companions. Indeede, I denie not, anie one of
these happes were likelie enough to haue befalne
him, and not without his iust deserts: and most
men say, it was well enough, which way soeuer of
these hee ended, and worse (if worse might bee).
Howbeit, it was not that so well, as they do ween
<pb facs="tcp:8731:18"/>
for, (being perhappes reserued for his two sonnes
hereafter) but neither better nor worse than I will
tell you.</p>
