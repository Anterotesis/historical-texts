         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Do not deſign here to make an
elaborate Diſcourſe in the Praiſe of
the Knowledge of Medals; nor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
the great Advantages which may
be drawn from ſo Noble a Science.
This would be only a Repetition of
the Speeches which ſo many Writers,
and thoſe of the firſt Rank, have made
of this Matter in their Works. I will
therefore only ſay, that it meriteth
from Perſons of Ingenuity, the ſame
Eſteem and Application that they pay
to Hiſtory, which indeed hath no
Teſtimony more ſolid than that of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
to juſtifie the Truth of its Facts.
However, this Science which eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Certainty of Hiſtory, is not
without its Troubles and Difficulties;
and ſhe has alſo this Misfortune at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
her, that Men of Ability and
Skill make no better Uſe of the Light
they have acquired by her, than to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
the Credulity of Novices in this
Curioſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62934:3"/>
Such ſort of Men as theſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
real regard to any Honeſty, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all their little Tricks and Artifices
to deceive and over-reach them, and
by this Means make an honourable
as well as pleaſant Employment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a mighty Buſineſs of Intereſt and
Knavery. But I could not ſuffer ſuch
an Injury to be offer'd to this moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Curioſity: And ſeeing that in moſt
Books of Medals there is little to be
found, tending to the true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, I have therefore ſet
down here in this Treatiſe what I
have acquired by Experience and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
in Order to furniſh an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
for a compleat Knowledge
in this Subject. I have made it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
for the Service of thoſe that are
but Beginners. Here they will find
the Means to preſerve themſelves from
Impoſture, and alſo gain without
much Trouble both Judgment and
Inſight. This is the End for which I
compos'd theſe twelve Chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

Treatiſe, taken from the Tranſactions of
the LEARNED at Leipſick in the
Year 1694. for the Month of May.</head>
               <p>THis is both a very ingenious and polite
Treatiſe, containing all Matters that
are any ways fit for Perſons to be inſtructed in,
who will ſtudiouſly apply themſelves to the
Knowledge of <hi>Coins</hi> and <hi>Medals;</hi> and that
with ſuch a cloſe and learned Brevity that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this kind can be better perform'd. 'Tis
much to be lamented, this Author would not
favour us with the Knowledge of his Name,
that ſo we might return him the Thanks he
hath ſo worthily deſerv'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marius Gratidianus</hi> (as <hi>Cicero</hi> and
<hi>Pliny</hi> both affirm) when he had firſt
diſcover'd the Art of <hi>aſſaying</hi> Money, was
ſo highly honour'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> People, that
in all their Streets they erected Statues, and
at them offer'd up Incenſe and Tapers to him.
But the Cuſtom of our Times will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us to pay ſuch Obſervances; nor, if it did,
could we tell how to pay them to <hi>The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Man:</hi> All therefore that we can do,
is, to give this Treatiſe its due Value, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it always about us, <hi>even in our Boſome.</hi>

<hi>Villalpandus</hi> pretends, believing, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

               </p>
               <p>It is very probable that Commerce and
Society were carried on for ſeveral Ages
by the ſimple Commutation of thoſe things
which each one wanted; and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of coining Metals was the hindrance of
employing them in Money for a great
while; ſince even at this day we find
whole Nations that never uſed Metals
made into Money, and amongſt thoſe
that have, they went a long time by
weight, before they bethought themſelves
of giving them the ſhape of Money,
whoſe value has been fixt by the Will
of Man only, and by the convenience
which has been found in Pieces of a
ſmall ſize.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The uſe of Money.</note>Some have ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt
that ſtamped Money, and introduced
the Uſe of it. Others have pretended to
prove from that holy Lawgiver's own
words, that it was uſed in the Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, ſince in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the manner of his buying a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre

for his Wife, who dyed in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he ſpeaks of <hi>Currant Money,</hi> and uſes
the word <hi>Shekels:</hi> Which word has ſerved
ever ſince to expreſs certain Pieces of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
preſerved by the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> All this,
without doubt, is more curious than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the inſtruction of one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to love Medals, and ſearches no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to underſtand them.</p>
               <p>It ſuffices then, to inform him of the
Age of Medals we treat of, to let him
know they muſt be divided into two ſorts,
that is, into <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi> for this
is the firſt Notion of the Art, on which
depends their eſteem and value. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
are all thoſe that were coined within
the Third and Ninth Age of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>
the Modern which have been made within
theſe laſt Three hundred Years: For, as
for thoſe we have after <hi>Charlemagne</hi> till that
time, the Curious will not vouchſafe to
collect them, unleſs they be ſuch as end the
Succeſſion of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire; and of
which it may be ſaid, with one of our Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
That they form a baſe ſort betwixt the
Ancient and Modern, in which neither
the Eyes, nor the Mind are entertained
with any thing that ſatisfies, or is agreable;
ſo that to follow one's <hi>guſto,</hi> the Ancient
at fartheſt muſt be brought down but until
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> his time, which is the end of

the Ancienteſt, though they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

The <hi>Epocha's</hi> are ſeldom wanting;

ſubject to that deceit the Ancient impoſe
upon us, nothing being more eaſy than to

Not indeed ever ſince St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but
only from about 250 years ago; that is,
from <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth's time, about the year
of our Lord 1430. For from that time till

every Pope, either Caſt or Stamp'd, to
the number of between Five or Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
which is eaſily proved by Father

could meet with to be engraved there, with
a brief explanation of each of them.</p>
               <p>It is not without reaſon he maintains,
That, before the time by me aſſigned, there
is no Medal to be found coined during
their Pontificat, but are only reſtored; for
it is certain that the Dies or Stamps of
<hi>Martin</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi>'s Medals, and others
down to <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> were made
in the Pontificat of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Seventh,</hi>
by the care of the Abbot <hi>Bizot,</hi> ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

who would have cauſed a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Pope's Death had not ſpoiled the deſign
he had laid to have had the reſt engraved,
whoſe Heads he hoped to have got from
their Statues, Tombs, Seals, and other
Monuments of the <hi>Vatican.</hi> In lieu where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
this Series at preſent can only be made
out from the Leaden Seals of their Bulls,
where the Name of the Pope is only to

being then the Cuſtom to give you but

is the firſt that fets his Buſt upon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,

<hi>Theodoſius Imperator, &amp; Celeſtinus Pontifex,</hi>
the Reverſe is ſo defaced, that no more

For it often happens that a Gold

prized, when the ſame of Silver, or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſhall be but of ſmall account. As,
for inſtance; the Latin <hi>Otho</hi> of the large

Golden one is worth but Three or Four
Piſtoles more than its weight, which is
about Thirteen Livres. And the ſame <hi>Otho</hi>

to have ſome extraordinary Reverſe which

it muſt be obſerved, That that

as pure and fine as that in the time of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>

               <p>The Gold of the Old <hi>Greek</hi> Medals is
extreme pure, which may be judged of

               <p>The Gold of the Upper Empire is alſo
very fine, and of the ſame alloy with that

For our preſent Refiners prefer it to the

having melted down a Golden Veſpaſian,

               <p>It muſt be remembred alſo, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

what Experience has taught us, That after

more Numerous, having above Three

that of Copper, which yet goes farther;
for, comprehending the Three different

For my part, I doubt not, but by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating

from an <hi>Italian</hi> word ſhewing the
manner after which they are Coined; to wit,
with a certain depreſſion all about, which
forms a ring on each ſide, and with Figures
that have ſcarce any Relief in compariſon of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62934:18"/>
true <hi>Medaillons.</hi> I believe this ſort of work
had its beginning in <hi>Greece,</hi> where it was
chiefly uſed to honour great mens Memory,
and the Victors in their publick Exerciſes.
Such are thoſe that remain of <hi>Homer,

Antiquaries ſay, not till after <hi>Theodoſius;</hi>
yet the Work, and the Effigies of the
firſt Emperors ſtamped upon them, ſeem
to convince us, that they were made in
the Upper Empire. For there are ſome of
<hi>Nero, Trajan, Alexander Severus,</hi> and ſome
others, whoſe Memory it was no body's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to renew in the Lower Empire, and
under Chriſtian Princes. And this appears

impoſſible to collect any number of them:
It is ſufficient to place them in the Front
of a Gold or Silver ſeries of Medals to
grace the Cabinet. I have formerly ſeen
at Mr. <hi>Carcavi</hi>'s, who then was Keeper of
the Medals, two extraordinary fine ones of
<hi>Commodus</hi> in his Majeſty's Cabinet, ranked
with other <hi>Medaillons</hi> of a different Metal.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Medals of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſizes.</note>But 'tis not ſo with Medals of Copper:
For there is ſo large a quantity of them,
they are divided into three different big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
which form the three different ſeries's
that adorn Cabinets, the great, the
middle, and the little Copper. The
Rank that every one is to hold, is judged
of by its ſize, which comprehends the cloſe
neſs and extenſion of the Medal, the bulki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and relief of the head: So that that
Medal which has the thickneſs of the large
Copper, and but the head of the middle,
ſhall be of the ſecond ſize. Such another
that is but thin, if its head be large enough,
ſhall be ranked among thoſe of the firſt
magnitude. The inclination of the Curious
goes a great way in it; for thoſe that are
given to the great, admit of ſeveral Medals
into that order, when indeed they are but
of the middle Copper; and thoſe that love
the middle, rank ſome amongſt them that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62934:19"/>
belong to the large, eſpecially to ſupply
ſome heads that are hard to be found. Thus
<hi>Otho, Antonia, Druſus,</hi> and <hi>Germanicus</hi> of
the middle Copper, are placed among the
great; and thoſe of the little ſize with the
middle Copper.</p>
               <p>Each of theſe Degrees has its Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
the firſt, which is the great ſize
excels in neatneſs, ſtrong Relief, and the
fine Hiſtorical Monuments wherewith the
Reverſes are charged, and ſhine in all their
beauty. The ſecond, which is the middle
Copper, is conſiderable for its Multitude,
and rarity of its Reverſes, and particularly
by reaſon of the infinite number of Greek
and Latin Colonies which are ſcarce ever
found on the larger Copper. The third,
which is the ſmall Copper, is eſteemed from
the great neceſſity of it in the Lower Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
where the other two ſizes fail, and
whenever found are counted <hi>Medaillons.</hi>

               <p>IN all perfect Medals there are two
ſides to be conſidered, that contribute
to their Beauty and Rarity; that which is
called the <hi>Head,</hi> and the Other the <hi>Reverſe.</hi>
That of the Head determines the ſets, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a Head of a perſon; as a God's,
a King's, a Hero's, a Philoſopher's, a
Champion's, or any other thing taking up
that place, which is ſtill called the Head;
be it an Image, a Name, or any publick
Monument, whoſe Inſcription is on the
other ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Medals without Reverſes.</note>I have ſaid, that theſe two ſides are to be
found in imperfect Medals, becauſe there
are ſome that have no Reverſe at all; But
it is an infallible mark that thoſe are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
unleſs they were not ſtampt, as ſome
ſuch we meet with. Such is a <hi>Caeſario</hi>
which I have ſeen, the Son of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>
and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Such a certain <hi>Medaillon</hi> of
<hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> which I have alſo ſeen in the
chiefeſt place of a Cabinet, that ſhewed
the Maſter of it to be more Rich than he
was Skilful, and very fit to be made the
Property of ſome ſelfiſh Antiquary. There
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62934:22"/>
are ſome alſo that have no Head (that is
to ſay) of Perſons, which yet for all that
are very Good and Ancient. Such are thoſe
of the Mint maſters of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> where
there is nothing but his name, <hi>Auguſtus
Tribun. Pot.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> where
there is but of One ſide only, <hi>Fides exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi>
with two Hands joined; and on the

Figure in Reverſe, and the like.</p>
               <p>Of theſe ſeveral Heads are formed Five
Different Orders of Medals, whereof may
be compoſed very curious Series's. In the
firſt we may put the Series of Kings. In
the ſecond that of Cities, either <hi>Greek</hi> or
<hi>Latin,</hi> before or ſince the Foundation of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. In the third may be
ranged the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſular Families. In

to them. In the fifth the Deities, of which
we may have very agreable Series's, either
in ſimple Buſt, or elſe in their full propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and cloathed with all their qualities

I ſpeak of thoſe Cities to which the <hi>Romans</hi>
ſent their own Citizens, either to people
them by eaſing their Mother-City, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compencing

or elſe in building them a-new, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>The number of them would be yet more
conſiderable, if all the Cities that have coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Medals in their name were added to
theſe, without minding whether they were
Imperial or no; <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin:</hi> But then,
to ſatisfy one's Curioſity, the Reverſe of
the Imperial Medals muſt be the Head in

only conſidered as it were by Accident.</p>

ſeveral thouſands of them, which he touches
ſo ingeniouſly, that I cannot refuſe giving
him a Teſtimony, which mere truth extorts
from me; and that is, That there is not
one Page in his Treatiſe wherein we find
not Erudition, and ſome Curious matter
worthy to be learned, which is not eaſily

which gives occaſion to a great many fine

               <p>We muſt not forget to tell you, that the
Heads of Medals belonging to Cities, are
moſt commonly the Genius of the Place it

                  <note place="margin">3. Order. Families.</note>The Conſular Medals make a large Series
in the Third Order, and amount to twelve
or fifteen Hundred. There is little of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
in it, either for the Legend or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
unleſs in thoſe that were Coined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Declenſion of the Republick, which
naturally ought to begin the Imperial Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Before that time this ſort of Medals
was only Stampt with the Armed Head of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or with ſome Deity; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
was a Triumphal Chariot drawn by
two or four Horſes.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Heads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conſular Medals.</note>Indeed towards the Sixth Century of
<hi>Rome,</hi> Mint-maſters took the liberty to
place the Heads of Famous Perſons that
had been in their own Families upon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
either under their proper Figures,
or that of ſome Deity, to whoſe protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Family was committed. This they
did till the Fall of the Commonwealth, and
then they began to put on the Heads of
<hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> the Conſpirators that kill'd
him, the Triumvirs that invaded the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Power, and all thoſe that had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
any ſhare in the Government.
For till thoſe unhappy times no Man was
ſuffered to ſet his own Head upon the
Money, that privilege being accounted
an Attendant upon Royalty, which was
before that time, infinitely odious to
them.</p>
               <p>Therefore when you find upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular
Medals, the Heads of <hi>Romulus</hi> and
<hi>Remus,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Kings, thoſe
of <hi>Scipio, Metellus, Lucullus, Regulus, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
or the like, you muſt not conclude
that they were Coined in their Reigns;
ſince in the time of the Kings, for inſtance,
Silver Money was not in uſe; but ſome of
their Deſcendants, being in the Office of
Mint-maſters, cauſed them to be Coined in
honour to themſelves, and to be Eternal

You are further to be informed, before
we have done with Conſular Medals; that
although they are almoſt All of Silver, and
of the third Size, becauſe they were the
<hi>Roman</hi> Deniers, <hi>Quinarii</hi> or <hi>Seſterces;</hi> yet
there are ſome of all Metals, and Copper
ones of all the three Sizes; but with this
difference, that we ſcarce know above 50
or 60 in Gold, and about 250 in Copper,
whereas we have near 1000 in Silver. The
firſt Collection of which, <hi>Fulvius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi>
has engraven, and it has been conſiderably
increaſed by <hi>M. Patin;</hi> and ſince him a great

of them.</p>
               <p>All this preſuppoſed, the Series of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
may be made two ways. <note place="margin">The firſt way of forming the Series of Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note>The firſt,
ſo as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> has done it, by placing the
Names of the ſeveral Families found upon
Medals in Alphabetical Order; ſetting all
thoſe that ſeem to be of the ſame Houſe
together. This way indeed may not be
ſo pleaſing, but it is the real and true way.
<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way.</note> The ſecond, as <hi>Goltzius</hi> has done it, by the
<hi>Faſti</hi> of the Conſuls, placing under every

way is very handſome and learned;
but the misfortune is, it has nothing but
Shew and Appearance, and in truth can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be performed. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe we have
no Medals of the firſt Conſuls from the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62934:27"/>
Year 244 to 484. which forced <hi>Goltzius</hi>
to give you only their Names, as they are
found in the <hi>Faſti. Secondly,</hi> From that
time down to the Empire of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> thoſe
Medals that he has put, were never Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either by the Conſuls, or for thoſe
Conſuls whoſe Names they bear; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Mint-maſters, who being of the

becauſe the World begins to have a value
for the Series of them, by reaſon of the
great Satisfaction that is found in obſerving
their different Names, Symbols, Temples,

worſhipped. A good Copper Series may
be formed of them, by means of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Cities, which furniſh us with very
large quantities of them; but the nobleſt
and moſt pleaſing, is that of Silver, which
the Medals of Families ſupply us with;
and there are a great many of them in the
King's Cabinet. Now both Metals might
be carried on much further if we would
but borrow Imperial Reverſes, where the
Deities are much better repreſented than
on thoſe of Families, not only becauſe they
have their ſeveral Titles there, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are commonly repreſented at
their full Length, ſo that we may ſee their
Arms, Accoutrements, Symbols, and the
Cities where they have been more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

I had formerly begun, and had collected

ought to inſtruct a Perſon that is deſirous to
learn, he ought alſo to be told, That among
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and all over <hi>Italy,</hi> (for now
we only pretend to ſpeak of that Country)
their Medals, or rather their Moneys, were
a long time not only without Reverſes,<note place="margin">The firſt Medals how marked.</note> but
alſo without any mark at all; ſo that the
firſt Money uſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> was but of plain
Copper, and without any Impreſſion upon
it till the time of King <hi>Servius Tullus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Is primus ſignavit Aes. <hi>Plin.</hi>
                  </note> who
cauſed them firſt to be ſtamped with the

which time it began to be called <hi>Pecunia
à pecude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I don't deſign by this Diſcourſe to ſtrike
at the Ancient Tradition, which tells us,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62934:29"/>
That <hi>Janus</hi> reigning in <hi>Italy</hi> 700 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtamped the
firſt Money, putting upon it a Crown, a
Bridge, or a Boat; of which three he was
the Inventer, and introduced their uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Country. However I know very
well, that this Tradition is not abſolutely
certain, ſince ſeveral People in <hi>Europe</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
we are beholden to <hi>Saturn</hi> for the uſe
of Money, and that it was he who retiring
to <hi>Janus</hi> into <hi>Latium,</hi> taught him to put a
Stamp upon it, as alſo to Till the Ground;
and that in acknowledgment of this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<q>—Bona poſteritas puppim ſignavit in Aere,
Hoſpitis adventum teſtificata Dei.</q>
But however it happened, in theſe firſt
dark times, as there was no other Head
than that of <hi>Janus</hi> upon the <hi>Latin</hi> Money;
or as others ſay, That of <hi>Janus</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi>
joyned together by the hinder Parts; ſo
alſo was there no other Reverſe than the
Prow of a Ship. This continued till the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who had made themſelves Maſters
of all <hi>Italy,</hi> near five hundred Years after the
building of <hi>Rome,</hi> began to Coin Money
of Gold and Silver, under the Conſulate
of <hi>C. Fabius Pictor,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Ogulnius
Gallus,</hi> five years before the firſt <hi>Punick</hi>
War, and CDXXCIV from the building
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62934:30"/>
of the City. This is the firſt Year they
Coined Silver, for Gold they did not till
62 years after.</p>
               <p>In thoſe happy times when the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
flouriſhed, they began to beautify
and perfect their Medals, both as to the
Head and the Reverſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How mark'd in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls time.</note>The Head of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Deities ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

               <p>Soon after, the Mint-maſters, who by

inſomuch, that we find Medals
ſtuff'd with the marks of Magiſtracies,

<hi>Lepidus</hi> in a Conſular Habit, putting a

been at a ſtand at the ΚΕΒΟΗ ΔV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ΛΟϹΟV,
by being unacquainted with
the Inſcriptions we ſpeak of. Theſe ſorts
of Inſcriptions may be called Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the Emperor Life, Health, and Victory.
Such is that of <hi>Conſtantine, Plura Natali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia

               <p>I believe by this little I have here given

and Modern Medals may be well-enough
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62934:33"/>
diſcerned I mean, as to Inſcriptions.
The Ancients thought Medals were not
proper to bear Inſcriptions, unleſs they were
extremely Short and Expreſſive, reſerving
them that were long, for Publick Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
Columns, Triumphal Arches,
Tombs. Whereas, the modern Ones, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Reverſes of their Medals with
tedious Inſcriptions that have nothing of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Majeſty, Purity, or Brevity.</p>
               <p>Sometimes indeed the Names only of
Magiſtrates are to be found upon them, as
in the <hi>Julian, Q. Aemilius. Qu. Fabius
Bucca</hi> IIII. <hi>vir. A. A. A. F. F.</hi> And in
that of <hi>Agrippa, M. Agrippa Coſ. deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Names of Mint-maſters, of which
we have a great Number, are found upon
ſeveral Medals; to which may be added all
the Duumvirs of Colonies. The other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracies
are oftener upon the Conſular
Medals, than upon the Imperial.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Single Names only.</note>Sometimes there is only the Name of
ſome City or People, as <hi>Sego Briga. Caeſar

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Heads.</note>Theſe ſingle Figures we ſpeak of, are to be
diſtinguiſhed from Heads, whoſe Reverſes
are ſometimes crowded. For they being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the Heads either of Children, Wives,
Collegues of the Empire, or Confederate
Kings, 'tis a general Rule among all the
Skilful in this Science, that Medals with
two Heads are almoſt always Choice; as
for inſtance, that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> on the Reverſe
of <hi>Julius; Veſpaſian</hi> on the Reverſe of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;
Antoninus</hi> on the Reverſe of <hi>Fauſtina;
M. Aurelius</hi> on that of <hi>Lucius,</hi> &amp;c. From
whence it is eaſy to infer, that the more
Heads are on it, the more Choice is the
Medal. Such is a <hi>Nero</hi> on the Reverſe of a
<hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Octavia;</hi> ſuch a <hi>Severus</hi> on the
Reverſe of his two Sons, <hi>Geta</hi> and <hi>Caracalla;

and <hi>Hadrian</hi> on that of <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Plotina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is true, generally ſpeaking,
that the more Reverſes are charged with
Figures, the more they are to be valued,
eſpecially if they illuſtrate any Memorable
Action. To give you ſome Inſtances hereof,

more exact and curious. And this may
be done two ways, either by a ſimple Series,
which has no other Affinity than what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the ſame Emperor; or elſe by an
Hiſtorical Series, according to the Order of
Times and Years, which may be diſcovered
by the Conſulates, and the Power of the
Tribunes. This is the way which <hi>Occo</hi> and
<hi>Mezza Barba</hi> have taken in ranging the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals

which is diſagreable in this way, is, that
the ſame Reverſe muſt be very often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <p>There is another way more Learned, I

who without troubling himſelf about
placing them ſeparately, as they belonged
to every Emperor, only has taken care to
reunite every Reverſe to certain Pieces of
Curioſity, by which means we methodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learn whatſoever can be drawn from the
Knowledge of Medals. Thus has he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his Deſign, which ſeems to me to be

he has collected all the Reverſes that carried
any thing of Geography in them; that is

to the Deities of both Sexes, joining the
Vertues with them, which are as ſo many

               <p>Nor is it more reaſonable to ſay, that it is
the Mark of thoſe Medals the Senate cauſed
to be coined out of Reſpect and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment;

have ordered None but Copper to be made,

               <p>Monſ. <hi>Morell</hi> has told me, he had found

               <p>This is ſo clearly demonſtrated, that none

               <head type="sub">Of the Inſcriptions, called the Legend of

               <p>IT ſeems as if the Ancients had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make Images and Emblems of
their Medals; the One for the Common
People, and thoſe of duller Apprehenſions;
the Other for People of Quality, and the
more refined Wits. Images to repreſent
the Faces and Heads of Princes; Emblems,
their Virtues and Great Atchievements.
Thus the Legend is to be looked upon as the
Soul of the Medal, and the Figures as the
Body; and juſt ſo it is in the Emblem, where
the Device has the place of the Soul, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we could never underſtand what
the Figures were deſigned to teach us. As
for inſtance, we ſee on a Medal of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
two Hands joyned, claſping a <hi>Caduceus</hi>
betwixt two <hi>Cornucopia</hi>'s; this is the Body:
The word <hi>Pax</hi> there engraven, is to denote
the Peace which that Prince had given to
the State, by reconciling it to <hi>M. Antony,</hi>
which had reſtored Felicity and Plenty to
it. Whereas thoſe very two Hands on the
Medals of <hi>Balbinus</hi> and <hi>Pupienus</hi> have this
Legend, <hi>Amor mutuus Auguſtorum,</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thereby the good Underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the two Colleagues in governing the

<hi>Concordia Exercituum,</hi> the Hands are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſignify the Agreement of the Soldiers
for their New Prince.</p>
               <p>But for the more perfect Underſtanding
of this Myſtery, I think it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to recollect the difference we have made

Sir-names which their Virtues have
gained them. The ſecond is deſigned to
declare their Virtues, their Noble and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Actions, the Glorious Monuments
that ſerve to Eternize their Names, and
the Benefits the Empire hath received by
their means. Thus we find <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s
Medal bears on the Head-ſide, <hi>Antoninus
Auguſtus, Pius, Pater Patriae, Trib. Pot. Coſ.</hi>
IIII. theſe are his Names and Titles: On
the Reverſe are three Figures; One of the

Emperor ſeated on a Throne; the Second;
a Woman ſtanding with a Horn of Plenty,
and a Square Chart, with a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Points upon it. The Third is a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
preſenting it ſelf, and holding out
its Gown as to receive ſomething; which
is explained to us by the Legend, <hi>Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
quarta,</hi> telling us, That that Emperor
gave a fourth Donative to the People, by
diſtributing to them ſo many meaſures of
Corn, as every Family had need of.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, this is neither ſo Univerſal,
nor ſo indiſpenſable, but that the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Offices of Perſons may be impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſometimes, either in whole, or in part,
on the Reverſe-ſide, as well as on the Head,

we have ſaid already. We have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Examples of the dividing of Dignities,

               <p>On all others, the Noble Actions are
expreſſed upon the Reverſes, either Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
or by Symbols, which the Legend
explains. Naturally, as when <hi>Trajan</hi> is
repreſented crowning the <hi>Parthian</hi> King,
<hi>Rex Parthis datus.</hi> Symbolically, as when
the Victory of <hi>Julius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

him for their Reſtorer; and thoſe
that underſtand it not by the Symbols, may
learn it by the Legend; <hi>Reſtitutori Galliae,

Victories ſignified by Crowns, Palms, Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,
and the like Marks, that are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in themſelves, are determined by the
Legend. On one of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s is, <hi>Aſia

               <p>M. <hi>Du Cange</hi> has extreamly well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
whatever relates to Votive Medals,
as he calls them. He tells us, That when
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> (pretending to be willing to quit
the Empire) at the Requeſt of the Senate,
had twice conſented to continue his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
for Ten years, they began at
every ten years to make publick Prayers,
Sacrifices and Plays for the preſervation of
the Emperor. And, in the Lower Empire,
this was done every Five years; and from
thence it is, that after <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> we find
upon Medals, <hi>Votis</hi> V. XV. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this
Cuſtom laſted till <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> after whom
no ſuch <hi>Epocha</hi> is to be found. It ſeems
that Chriſtianity being then throughly
eſtabliſhed, Thoſe Ceremonies that retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing of Heatheniſm were not
thought fit to be allowed. So that the <hi>Votis

which Medals teach us by their Legends,
is, the Different Titles the Emperors aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

I only ſpeak of Magiſtracies; for as for Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
they became Arbitrary, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>Theſe ſame Legends alſo diſcover to us
how ſhort a time the Acknowledgments
of thoſe laſted, who having been adopted,
or whoſe Obligations for the Empire were
owing either to their Father or Mother,
after they had firſt taken upon them the
Quality of Sons, quitted that ſoon after
as well as the Name. <hi>Trajan</hi> at firſt took
upon him the Name of <hi>Nerva,</hi> who had
adopted him, which a little while after he
left off, and retained only that of <hi>Trajan.</hi>
So <hi>Hadrian</hi> did the like. Firſt it was <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
Trajanus Hadrianus;</hi> preſently after it
was only <hi>Hadrianus.</hi> So the good <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi>

Antoninus,</hi> but a little after chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it for <hi>Antoninus Auguſtus Pius;</hi> on the
contrary, their Vanity and Ambition made
them to keep up Names to which they
had no Right, either by Blood or Deſert.
Thus, for inſtance, that of <hi>Antoninus</hi> is
found joyned to Six Emperors, as low as
<hi>Caracalla</hi> and <hi>Elagabalus;</hi> that of <hi>Trajan</hi> to
<hi>Decius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe Proper Names being become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to a great many, have exceedingly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62934:59"/>
embroiled the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory of Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
becauſe the <hi>Latin</hi> Medals have no
<hi>Epocha</hi>'s, whereas the <hi>Greek</hi> Medals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much more exact in giving the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names,
and ſetting forth the Years, have
wonderfully facilitated the Knowledge
of certain Kings, which would otherwiſe
have been very perplex'd and intricate;
ſuch as the <hi>Antiochi, Ptolemy</hi>'s, and the

               <p>We muſt likewiſe not forget here to
take notice that the Name of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate

REST, which he will find upon ſeveral
Medals, and are the Mark of them that
Succeeding Emperors reſtored to revive
the Memory of their Predeceſſors. <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>

               <p>We will ſhut up this Inſtruction with
obſerving, that no certain Rule can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
how to place Legends upon Medals.
For although it be true, that the Legend
is the Soul of the Medal, yet there are ſome
Bodies to be found without a Soul; that is to
ſay, Some Medals without a Legend, either
on the Head, or Reverſe-ſide, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Conſular, but thoſe of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
alſo. As for inſtance, in the <hi>Julian</hi>
Family the Head of <hi>Julius</hi> is often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Legend; there are alſo Reverſes that
want Legends,<note place="margin">In the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of the Duke of <hi>Arſchot. Tab. 14. Urſin Fam. Caecilia.</hi>
                  </note> eſpecially in that ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
which has a Medal that bears on one
ſide the Head of Piety with a Stork; and
on the other, an <hi>Augur</hi>'s Staff encloſed in a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62934:60"/>
Crown, and a Veſſel for Sacrifices, without
any Legend.</p>
               <p>There are ſome that have but half a
Soul, if I may ſo ſay, becauſe one of their
ſides (ſometimes that of the Head, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that of the Reverſe) has no Legend.
We have ſeveral Heads of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Inſcription, as that whoſe Reverſe
bears the Equeſtral Statue decreed him by
the Senate, with the words, <hi>Caeſar Divi
Filius.</hi> There are a world of Reverſes
without Legends, and ſometimes too even
when they are conſiderable for the Body
of the Repreſentation, and Number of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
               <p>To theſe I think we may add thoſe that
have only the Name of the Mint-maſter,
or the bare S. C. ſince neither of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
any thing to the explaining the
Type. Such are Three or Four handſome
Medals of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that have very fine
Reverſes, and only the Name of <hi>M. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius
Sabinus Proquaeſtor.</hi> Two fine ones of
<hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> one whereof is charged with
a Globe, the Faſces, an Ax, a Caduceus,
and two Hands joyned together, has only
the Name, L. BVCA. the other carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

became a Dead Language by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, it was
ſtill preſerved for all publick Monuments,
and conſiderable Pieces of Moneys in all
States of the Chriſtian Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Greek.</note>
                  <hi>Greek</hi> is the other Learned Tongue u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
moſt univerſally for Medals; the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
having always a Reſpect for it, and
glorying in the Underſtanding, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it well. Wherefore they were not
diſpleaſed, that not only the Cities of the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> but even that all others, where there
lived any Number of <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſhou'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their Language upon their Medals.
So the Medals of <hi>Sicily</hi> and ſeveral Cities
in <hi>Italy,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Provence,</hi> and all the
Country called <hi>Magna Graecia,</hi> uſed the
Greek Tongue upon their Medals. Which
makes ſo conſiderable a Part in this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Antiquaries, that it is impoſſible
ever to be perfect in it, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the <hi>Greek</hi> as well as <hi>Latin,</hi> and the
Ancient Geography as well as the Modern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:62934:62"/>
But in Honour of Antiquity, before I
ſpeak for good and all of the <hi>Latin</hi> and
<hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, I intend to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> becauſe
we find Medals in both theſe Languages,
which may unluckily perplex a young En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer,
if he has not the neceſſary Light
beforehand to guide him therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hebrew.</note>As ſoon as ever he ſhall have reflected
on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, which, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all Occaſions of Idolatry, wou'd not
ſuffer any Image either Carved or Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
keeping moſt ſtrictly to that Precept
of the Decalogue; he will ſoon judge all
thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Medals that have the Heads of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> or any other Perſon upon them, to
be Counterfeit and Modern: Beſides he
will obſerve at firſt ſight that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all of them caſt.</p>
               <p>I wou'd have ſaid peremptorily that
not one has been ſtamped, but that I
know ſome body did think fit to ſtamp a
few in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that within this little
while; but a ſmall Skill will ſerve to
diſcover the Coin of them to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.
Thus the Medal of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
though perhaps made by ſome Converted
Jew, is one of theſe Medals done on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in theſe laſt Days; and therefore
the Curious ought to have no Value for
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:62934:63"/>
At that time when the <hi>Jews</hi> were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to uſe <hi>Roman</hi> Money, ſtamp'd with
the Prince's Image, their own Money was
never alter'd, nor did they ever coin the
Emperour's Head upon it.</p>
               <p>But this hinders not but that ſome true
Money of Silver and Braſs which was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
currant in <hi>Judea,</hi> may yet be left us,
whoſe Legends are either <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Samaritan.</note>
I ſay of Silver or Braſs, becauſe I
never ſaw any of Gold; and the Learned
tell us, the <hi>Jews</hi> never coined ſuch. Of
this ſort are the Shekles, Half-Shekles,
Quarter-Shekles, Double-Shekles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pieces, which they make ignorant
People believe, are ſome of the thirty Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that <hi>Judas</hi> received for betraying our
Saviour.</p>
               <p>I do not ſee why <hi>Hebrew</hi> Money ſhould
not be preſerv'd as well as <hi>Roman,</hi> that
fill our Cabinets. The Legend is the
ſame for all, great or ſmall; on one ſide,
<hi>Schekel Iſrael,</hi> the Shekle of Iſrael; on the
other <hi>Jerouſchalaim Hakedoſcha,</hi> Jeruſalem
the Holy. The Repreſentation indeed is
not always the ſame, yet however
it is commonly on one ſide a Branch of
a Tree ſpread, which is call'd <hi>Aaron</hi>'s
Rod; and on the Other a Veſſel to
burn Perfumes, out of which a Smoak
aſcends, and is called by ſome not over-skilful
in theſe Matters, the Pot that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62934:63"/>
the <hi>Manna</hi> in the Tabernacle, againſt
the apparent Teſtimony to the contrary
both of their own Eyes and Reaſon.
This is undoubtedly ſo as to thoſe from
which the Smoak comes out; But as to
thoſe that bear <hi>Samaritan</hi> Characters, and
are almoſt all of Braſs, no Judgment can
be made of them, but by Analogy, becauſe
the Veſſel is not altogether of the ſame
Form, neither does any Smoak come from
thence, but above it ſome Letters are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
to ſignify the Name of God, as <note n="*" place="margin">Upon <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalpandus</hi>
believes, who has moſt accurately
treated of this matter; and maintains
that there were never any Figures of Man
or Beaſt, but only of Shrubs and Palm-Trees,
or Bunches of Grapes upon the
Hebrew Money. He gives us alſo ſome, on
which is a kind of an Epocha, <hi>viz. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
Circumciſionis,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing,
which cauſes him to make Conjectures, that
I believe have more of Imagination than
Reality in them. The Characters of all
theſe are <hi>Samaritan,</hi> or (as others ſay) <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi>
and <hi>Chaldean. M. Morell</hi> tells us he
has ſeen ſome of them of the Times of the
<hi>Maccabees,</hi> with the Name of <hi>Simon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Taliſmans.</note>Theſe truly ancient Medals ought not to
be confounded with <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

and that their Myſteries may be the

properly, ſhould not come in with Medals,
but only have place with Curioſities ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the Acts of the Apoſtles; the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
whereof the Gentiles conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Natural Temper of Obliging all the

by an <hi>Arabian:</hi> both the one and
the other, are at preſent in his Majeſty's

or, as they call him, <hi>Salahoddin,</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's

The Legend is in Arabick, <hi>Joſeph Filius

               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Phoenician.</note>The Medals, whoſe Legend is in the

at leaſt the Character comes very
near to that of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Alphabet.</p>
               <p>I am not skilful enough to determine
whether the greateſt Part of them we call
<hi>Phoenician,</hi> are not purely <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> as <hi>Ant.
Auguſtinus</hi> thinks, who will have it to be
Latin expreſt by Characters formerly uſed
in that Country.</p>
               <p>There be ſome of 'em alſo in the Ancient

King <hi>Juba,</hi> the Legend of which on the
Head-ſide is in Latin, <hi>Rex Juba,</hi> and that on

Some have no Legends, Others have them
only upon one ſide in <hi>Phoenician</hi> Letters, as
that which is ſaid to bear the Head of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
and on the Reverſe a Horſe, or at leaſt
a Horſe's Head; and ſometimes a Palm-Tree.
The Fabrick is handſomer than
the <hi>Arabian,</hi> but of a leſs Size and Relief
than the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> 'Tis Pity we have loſt
this Alphabet; and we ſhould be very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
could we at length retrieve it, as the
Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers</hi> has given us Hopes of.
In examining thoſe that <hi>John Baptiſt Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
printed in 1545. I find that which he
calls the <hi>Saracen,</hi> to have a great deal of
affinity with the Character that is upon
theſe Medals, and by it formed ſome
Words that had a Senſe conformable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for Medals coined in a Country
where the <hi>Saracens</hi> were a long time
Maſters.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon, that makes me ſay theſe
Characters are not true <hi>Phoenician</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
is, becauſe they have not the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
they ought to have of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
as <hi>M. Bochart</hi> has proved in his <hi>Phaleg,</hi>
where he has very learnedly decypher'd
that Scene of <hi>Paenulus</hi> in <hi>Plautus,</hi> which hath

               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:62934:65"/>
It is in this Place that we muſt take in
all the reſt of the Barbarous Languages
found upon Medals, whoſe Fabrick is very
rude both in Figures and Legends. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enquirers call them <hi>Gothick;</hi> but
they abuſe the Name, and wrong the Kings
of the <hi>Goths,</hi> at leaſt ſome of them whoſe
Medals we have, that preſerve ſomething
both of the <hi>Roman</hi> Language and Majeſty.
Such are thoſe of <hi>Theodoric, Athanaric,
Theodatus, Baduela, Wittiges,</hi> and <hi>Teias,</hi>
whoſe Make is handſome, Relief conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and Character wholly <hi>Roman.</hi> Such
ſeem to be alſo thoſe of ſome <hi>Vandal</hi> and
<hi>Gothick</hi> Kings,<note place="margin">Dialog. 6. and 7.</note> that <hi>Ant. Auguſtinus</hi> gives
us, as of <hi>Gunthamundus</hi> the third King of
the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africa;</hi> of <hi>Chindaſwindus</hi>
King of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> of
<hi>Egica, Ervigius, Wittizanes;</hi> ſuch are thoſe
of <hi>Reccaredus, Witteric, Swinthila, Recceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuinthus</hi>
and <hi>Wamba,</hi> that reigned in <hi>Spain,</hi>
whoſe Medals the ſame Author gives us.
On the contrary, thoſe Medals we call <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick,</hi>
either Gold, Silver or Braſs, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pitiful, the Heads having ſcarcely a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

Legends being abſolutely unknown; ſuch
is that which carries the Name of <hi>Ateyla,</hi>
and ſome others that were probably of

               </p>
               <p>Let us now ſpeak of the two miſtreſs-Tongues
that compoſed the Legends and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62934:66"/>
Inſcriptions of Medals, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> and

but alſo becauſe, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
before the Foudation of <hi>Rome,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of Medals, burſt by the Force of the
Coin, is not a Fault that diminiſhes their
Value ſo long as the Figures are not hurt.
On the other hand it is one of the moſt
certain Signs that the Medals is not caſt,
but undoubtedly Ancient. Yet even
this Sign is ſometimes equivocal, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to thoſe that have been ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Ancient Medals, as we ſhall
ſhew in the following Inſtruction: For this
will not prove either the Head or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
to be Counterfeit, or of a Modern
Coin, or perhaps either.</p>
               <p>You alſo muſt take care not to reject
Silver Medals, whoſe Edges are inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and are called <hi>Numiſmata ſerrata;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numiſmata ſerrata.</note>
for that is alſo a Proof of their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Antiquity. They are common
among the Conſular till the time of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
but after then I never ſaw any.
There are ſome ſuch of Copper belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Syrian</hi> Kings, but there it ſeems
to be only for Ornament, and not from any
Neceſſity, as in the Silver ones, where
the Knavery of falſe Coiners obliged
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62934:71"/>
them to uſe this Precaution in the time
of the Common-Wealth: For in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
the Coins of the Mint-maſters,
they re-melted the Money, and only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Copper with a thin Leaf of
Silver, ſtamped it again with much Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which is called by the Curious <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Medals,</hi> as we have ſaid already.</p>
               <p>Therefore to remedy this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and diſcover the Cheat, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
this way of Indenting Medals, and
decryed all thoſe Coins which they
found Plated; from whence enſue
theſe two things at preſent: The Firſt is,
that Plated Medals are undoubtedly
Ancient and Stamp'd, it being no Profit
for any one to Counterfeit Money that
was cryed down, and out of Uſe; the
Second is, that when Plated Medals have
a curious Head or Reverſe, they are moſt
commonly very rare and of a greater Price
than thoſe of a good Alloy; becauſe
their Stamps having been broken, and
the Sort decryed, their Number muſt
certainly be much leſs. The Relief and
Thickneſs giving Occaſion to theſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Medals, they took Care in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Empire to make them ſo thin, that
it was impoſſible to plate them; and this
ſecond Way ſeems more effectual than
the former, to hinder the Cheats of falſe
Coiners.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Divers ſorts of Broken Medals.</note>There are other Imperfections in the
Preſerving of Medals, which proceed
from the Careleſneſs of the Minters.
For Example; when two Heads, two
Rings, or Engrailments, or two Legends
are formed inſtead of one, by the ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the Dye or Stamp; when the
Letters of the Legend are mixed, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
or miſplaced, as ſeveral are on the

Tyrants. Thoſe are Monſters of
which we muſt not make Miracles, nor
build any thing upon; For tho' that's
no Hindrance, but that the Medal may
be Ancient, yet it greatly diminiſhes its
Value. As for thoſe that have the Head
of an Emperour, with ſome Fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Reverſes, or elſe not belonging to him
whoſe Head they bear, they ought not to
be regarded, being only the Effect of the
Knavery, or Ignorance of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiter.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Medals half ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</note>Laſtly, it happens ſometimes that the
Minter has forgot to uſe both Dyes, ſo
that the Medal wants a Reverſe: This is
very common on the Modern Medals after
<hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fowler. There are ſome
of theſe found among the ancient Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,

inſtead of a Reverſe, they have only

the ſame Figure as is on the Head-Side,
ſtamped as it were to make a Mould.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs I could hardly ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

to feign other Reaſons to my ſelf, till
I learnt from one who underſtands Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the beſt in all <hi>France,</hi> that this fell
out from the Minter's over-Haſte, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had taken the Medal out, that he
had already ſtamped, put a new Piece
in, which having on one ſide the Dye,
and on the other the foregoing Medal,
was marked on both ſides with the ſame
Head on one in Relief, on the other
in hollow, but always more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
the Effort being weaker on the
ſide of the Medal than on that of the

We find Figures without Arms and
Legs, which we call <hi>Termes;</hi> and if
we will believe <hi>Polybius,</hi> this Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
came from the Quarrels People had
about their Bounds; which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd,

Sometimes Money is repreſented

Furnace at its Feet for Gold, Silver, and
Braſs; which are the Metals Money is
made of.</p>
               <p>The Word OMONOIA betwixt two

               <p>Two Figures with a Wheel at their

<hi>Nemeſis,</hi> that avenge Crimes. The

               <p>Four little Figures ſignifie the Four
Seaſons of the Year. But only one of them

Autumn has a Hare, becauſe that is the

a Basket of Flowers. The Summer a
Sickle for Harveſt.</p>
               <p>A ſort of great Stone like a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

               <p>The Riſing Sun is repreſented by a

                  <note place="margin">Medals made by Fancy, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were.</note> 
                  <hi>Virgil,</hi> the <hi>Grecian Sages</hi> and other
Famous Perſons, of whom the <hi>Parmeſan</hi>
and other modern Workmen have made
Coins purpoſely to deceive the young Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners
when they take a Fancy to have
ſingular Medals.</p>
               <p>'Tis with the ſame Knavery and Intereſt
that ſome extraordinary Reverſes, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62934:91"/>
thoſe which are capable of raiſing a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,
have been formed. For Inſtance;
a <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> with <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici,</hi> upon
the Reverſe; a Reverſe of <hi>Auguſtus, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina
lentè,</hi> which indeed was one of his
good Sayings; but he never thought of
preſerving its Memory upon the Metal.</p>
               <p>This Cheat is eaſily perceiv'd by all that
are not Novices in the Knowledge of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets;
for the infallible mark is, that all
theſe Medals are caſt or ſtamp'd with a Coin
and a Metal which preſently appears what
they are, that is to ſay modern, they
having neither the Boldneſs nor the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of the Ancient.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Caſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</note>The Second Cheat is of moulding An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Medals, or caſting them in Sand,
and afterwards repairing them ſo neatly
that they appear to be ſtamp'd. They may
be diſcover'd either by the Grains of Sand
which always leave their Impreſſions in
ſuch a manner as may be perceiv'd upon the
Field of the Medal; or elſe by certain
little Hollows, or by the Edges, that are
not ſmooth, round, or ſo border'd as
when ſtamp'd; or by the Characters
which are not free, but thick and broad;
or by the Strokes that are neither ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nor ſo deep; They are alſo known by
their Weight, which is always leſs; becauſe
Metal melted by Fire rarifies: When on
the contrary, that which is beaten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62934:92"/>
and conſequently becomes heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Laſtly, when a Medal is caſt in a
Mould, the mark of the Place where it
ran in commonly remains, and cannot
cleverly be taken off with a File, the Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that muſt be rounded, retaining the
marks of the File, which is an Eſſential
Proof of its Falſeneſs.</p>
               <p>As People grow every Day more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,
ſome in cheating, others in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cheats, ſo there is a means found
out to hinder the perceiving in the Field of
the Medal the Hollows, that the Grains of
Sand leave there by their Inequality, which
is unavoidable. 'Tis by covering them
with a certain dark Varniſh, which fills
the little Hollows, and they rub the Edges
to make them rough. If they can poliſh
the Field with a Graver without Varniſh,
the Cheat is then too cunning. Therefore
to diſcover them, the Varniſh muſt be
ſcratch'd if there be any upon them, and
it will be found much ſofter than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
But if there be none, you muſt
ſtudy the Medal with Attention, and the
Field will infallibly appear more depreſs'd,
and by a Touch that is ſomething delicate
the Metal will be diſcover'd to be too much
poliſh'd, whereas the Ancient hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is ſtronger and rougher. Thoſe
that underſtand not this Nicety and the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the Weight we have already
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62934:92"/>
mentioned, admire how ſuch counterfeit
Medals are diſcovered by the bare handling
them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs we muſt not be deceived
by ſome Medals that have their Edges fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
being ſet in Metal, Horn, or Wood;
they being forc'd to round them that way:
For that hinders not their being good and
Ancient: For this reaſon, thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them, commonly ſay, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
the Edges juſtifie the Field of the
Medal and that the Field alſo ſometimes
witneſſes for the Edges, which by Chance
have received ſome Damage.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Repaired Medals.</note>The Third Cheat is of repairing neatly
Ancient Medals, ſo that tho' they are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and defaced, they ſhall appear hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and legible. I know ſome that do
this in Perfection, and are able with a
Graver to take off the Ruſt, renew
the Letters, poliſh the Field, and revive
the Figures that ſcarcely before appeared.</p>
               <p>When the Figures are in part eaten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
they fix a ſort of Maſtick or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the Metal, which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
carve very properly, and being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Varniſh, make the Figures
appear entire and well preſerv'd.</p>
               <p>To diſcover this Cheat, you muſt take
a Graver, to ſcratch ſome little Places;
and if you perceive it to ſtick more upon
one Place than another, it is a Proof that
that Piece is added.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:62934:93"/>
In the mean while, when the Eye is uſed
to it, you will find ſome Strokes of the
Graver going too deep, the Edges too
much raiſed, and the Lineaments too
rough, and ill poliſh'd, by which it may
be gueſt they have been re-handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Medals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Stamps.</note>The Fourth Cheat is, (becauſe caſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
are eaſily known) to make Dyes or
Stamps, purpoſely of the rareſt and
moſt Ancient Medals, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
a-new, and make to paſs for Genuine
with ſo much the more Probability, as it
is evident they are neither caſt nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled.</p>
               <p>It was in this the <hi>Paduan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Giov. Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſan. Carteron.</note> 
                  <hi>Parmeſan,</hi>
and <hi>Hollander</hi> ſo well ſucceeded, that their
Counterfeit Medals are become a Piece of
Curioſity. The <hi>Paduan</hi> has more of ſtrength,
the <hi>Parmeſan</hi> more of Sweetneſs. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Part of the former Stamps are fallen
into the Hands of Father <hi>Moulinet,</hi> and
are kept in the Cabinet of St. <hi>Genivieve.</hi>
It is certain no Man can come nearer the
Ancient than theſe two have done: And
yet for all this their fineſt and moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Manner cannot compare with the
bold Air of the Ancient, which has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of much more Greatneſs in't. They are
known alſo by their too great Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which renders them ſuſpected, by the
Colour of the Metal, and chiefly by
their Weight, which is leſs than that of
the old Metal.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Medals ſtamped upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ones.</note>The Fifth Cheat conſiſts in ſtamping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in uſing Modern Coins, and taking An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Medals, which they reform with a
Hammer, that ſo they may give them a new
Impreſſion, almoſt after the ſame way as
we do our Money.</p>
               <p>Altho' this is hard to be diſcover'd by a
Young Beginner, becauſe he hath none of
the Common Indications; yet if he will but
carefully mind the Relief, he ſhall generally
find it either too ſtrong or too weak; the
Cutting too clean and new, and the Edges
not preſerv'd equally with the Field and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>

by razing a Common, to put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

augments the Price of the Medal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably.

the Reverſe of a <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> This way one

by putting an Allocution of eight

by graving upon it an Inſcription <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana

                  <note place="margin">Reverſes inſerted or clap'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>They have gone yet farther: For that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

two Medals, and afterwards with a certain
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62934:94"/>
Maſtick have ſolder'd the Reverſe of one
Prince to the Head of another, to make
ſingle Medals and ſuch as were never ſeen.
They are ſo cunning in repairing the
Edges, that thoſe who are not very Nice
indeed are commonly deceived by them.</p>
               <p>I ſaw ſomething more Artificial in M. <hi>de
Seves</hi>'s Cabinet, which had impoſed upon
a great many Inquiſitive Perſons: It was a
<hi>Domitian</hi> of the large Copper excellently
preſerv'd; its Reverſe was eraſed, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
into its Place the noble Amphitheatre,
which was alſo taken from a Medal of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi>
This was ſo admirably fix'd under the
Engrailment, that it was imperceptible, till
an Ingenious Gentleman got leave to put
the Point of a Graver to it, which made it
fly off.</p>
               <p>Theſe falſe Reverſes are known, either
by the difference that is found in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
of an Ancient Head, and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Reverſe, be it made never ſo exactly;
or elſe when they are clap'd together; and
they are diſcover'd by examining the Edges
which are never ſo perfectly united, but
ſomething may be diſcerned, of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joyned by the two Marks.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Legends alter'd and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited,</note>The Seventh Cheat is in the Legends, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the Head ſide or Reverſe; but it is
moſt commonly attempted upon the Head
ſide, from their Intereſt in finding Heads
that are Rare, and thoſe that are commonly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62934:94"/>
wanting in Series's: And this is done
in artificially ſubſtituting one Name for
another, eſpecially when there are but
few Letters to be changed or added. I
have a <hi>Lucilia</hi> thus changed into <hi>Domitia,</hi>

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>This Deceit is diſcovered by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of the Faces, which is never
exact enough; but better yet, by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Characters, that are either leſs

                  <note place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</note>The Eighth Cheat is Counterfeiting the
Ancient Varniſh, which ſerves to prevent
caſt Medals from being detected, and to
hide the Faults of the Edges and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.
There are ſome that put their Medals
under Ground to make them contract, if
not a Varniſh, yet at leaſt a certain Ruſt, that
impoſes upon them that underſtand it not,
very well. Others uſe <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> mixed
with Vinegar, Others only burnt Paper,
which is the eaſieſt way of all.</p>
               <p>This Deceit is the ſooneſt avoided, becauſe
neither the Colour, the Luſtre, nor Gloſs of
the Ancient Varniſh, which depends upon
the Earth, can be given the Modern. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
none can have the Patience to leave
a Medal in the Earth long enough to take
that beautiful Ruſt which is eſteem'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62934:95"/>
the richeſt Metal. Laſtly, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

when on the contrary the Ancient is as
hard as the Metal it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Crack'd Medals.</note>The Ninth Cheat ariſes from an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that ſometimes befals ſtamped Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
and which has made Antiquaries ſay,
that every Medal with burſt Edges, is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
ſtamped: For thoſe that make falſe
Medals the better to paſs them off, and
raiſe their Credit to their own Advantage,
endeavour to burſt them on purpoſe,
when they ſtamp them; or elſe to crack
them deſignedly when they are well caſt.</p>
               <p>But that you may not be over-reach'd,
you muſt examine theſe Cracks with ſome
particular Care; for when they are not
deep enough, or the breaking of them is
not free, or that they end not with almoſt
imperceptible Filaments, it is a great Proof
that it happen'd not by the Force of the
Stamp, but by Artifice.</p>
               <p>Let us conclude with two Principles that
are laid down whereby to know Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Medals. The firſt is almoſt general with
all Antiquaries,<note place="margin">If every Medal had a different <hi>Matrix.</hi>
                  </note> who unanimouſly ſay, that
when we meet with two Medals of the ſame
Coin, without any difference, it is a certain
Sign that one of them is falſe, if not both.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs that this ſtartles me
much, becauſe it is to maintain that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Medal had a different Matrix, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62934:95"/>
different Stamps, which ſeems neither
probable, nor practicable. I am very
glad M. <hi>Baudelot</hi> has began to declare
himſelf againſt this Opinion, which ſeems
only grounded upon a pretended Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that is not yet fully agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and which he encounters with good
reaſons in his Work concerning the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Travel,<note place="margin">Monſieur Baudelot'<hi>s Treatiſe.</hi>
                  </note> at the end of which he
has given us a very fine Diſſertation
upon Medals: The curious Learning he
makes to ſhine in all matters he handles
in that Book, with a Warmth and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which is the Character of his Style,
as the good Humour, Civility, and Wit
is of his Converſation; I ſay, that Warmth
and Beauty makes him extremely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Nevertheleſs he ſeems ſo much
devoted to his own happy Genius, that
he heeds not how he deſtroys by his
Example, what he wou'd prove in the
beginning of his Book; for having in
his firſt Diſſertation undertaken to prove,
That long Voyages give the greateſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
he juſtifies, before he is aware,
that without ever going out of his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
a Perſon may come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of whatever is attainable, by great
and long Travels into foreign Countries:
And that therefore Travel is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to a Man of Parts, who
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62934:96"/>
has the skill, like him, to apprehend in
his Cloſet that which leſſer Genius's
would never meet with, let them run
out of one World into the other, all the
Days of their Lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">If all baſe Gold, is modern.</note>The ſecond Principle is laid down by
M. <hi>Patin,</hi> whoſe bare Authority, in the
Republick of Medals, goes farther than
a probable Opinion. He ſays, That all
<hi>Roman</hi> Medals of baſe Gold, are Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.
If he means all Imperial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
that are of a baſer Gold than the
fine, ought to be ſuſpected of Falſhood,
I am of his Opinion; ſince even in the
Lower Empire it is very rare to find
Ancient ones whoſe Gold is adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
tho' after the time of <hi>Alexander
Severus,</hi> it was permitted to be Alloyed.
However, it might be wiſh'd that M. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
had explain'd himſelf a little more
diſtinctly; for this ſeems to me as if it
were to be underſtood of the <hi>Greek</hi> as
well as of the <hi>Roman,</hi> which are all
truly of Ducat-Gold. As for the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick</hi>
and <hi>Phoenician,</hi> I have ſome that
are certainly Ancient, whoſe Gold, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
is very baſe, and mixed with

               <p>It cannot alſo be deny'd, but that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> Medals of a baſe

the ſame thing in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Arts. Arts are not perfected without
ſeveral Obſervations raiſed by thoſe that
know how to make an Advantage of
what Uſe had taught them. And the
Reflections of the Curious have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
divers Notions, which we muſt
not pretend to ſubject either to Reaſon
or Parity, but muſt be receiv'd with
Submiſſion and Faith: I mean ſuch Faith
as reaſonable Perſons owe to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which <hi>Theodoret</hi> calls the Entrance

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:62934:97"/>
Yet we would not require a blind
Submiſſion from People upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Medals. It is lawful in this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for every one ſometimes to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his own Sentiments, even againſt
thoſe of the moſt Skilful: For as yet
the moſt Curious have not agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an infallible Judge in their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies;
and the moſt knowing are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
almoſt every Day to ſubmit at the
ſight of certain Medals which they knew
not before, and which deſtroy upon the firſt
view, thoſe Principles they had formerly ſo
advanc'd as indiſputable. Thus the belief
of the laſt Age, that there were no true
<hi>Otho</hi>'s of Copper, is at preſent quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by the number of them that
come to us from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and appear

               <p>Wherefore nothing muſt be eſteem'd

the bare ſhewing of ſome Medals that
Chance may have put into their Hands.</p>
               <p>When therefore I ſpeak of fixed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
I do not mean an infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
but only a Common one, which

and we may believe, and affirm
upon their Word, without being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

Such are a great many Maxims

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of MEDALS in general.</head>
                  <p>1. It is neither the Metal nor the Size
that renders Medals valuable, but the
Rarity either of the Head, Reverſe, or
Legend. A Medal that is common in
Gold ſhall be ſcarce in Copper: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall be very rare in Silver that is
common in Copper and Gold.</p>
                  <p>Such a Reverſe ſhall be common, when
its Head is put alone; ſuch a Head com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
when its Reverſe being very Rare,
ſhall give the Medal a vaſt Price. It is
not needful to give Examples of it in
this Place. M. <hi>Vaillant</hi> in his laſt Work
has given ſo exact an Account of them,
that nothing more can be deſired for
the perfect Inſtruction of the Curious.</p>
                  <p>2. Some Medals are only Rare in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Series's, and very common in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Some very ſcarce in all; ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
common in all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62934:98"/>
Laſtly, ſome are found in certain Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries's
only, and never in others. For
Example, no <hi>Antonia</hi> is found for the Series
of large Copper, and therefore that of the
middle, muſt of neceſſity ſupply its Place.
On the contrary, there is no <hi>Agrippina</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> in the middle
Copper, but only in the Great. <hi>Otho</hi>
is Rare in all Copper Series's, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in Silver: <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is common in
all. There is neither an <hi>Orbiana, Paulina,
Tranquillina, Mariniana,</hi> nor <hi>Corn. Supera</hi>
for the Series in Gold, yet they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in Copper and Silver: Colonies are
found in the middle Copper, ſcarce in the
large. All this is learn'd from M. <hi>Vaillant,</hi>
who has given himſelf the trouble to
mark it upon the particular Medals.</p>
                  <p>3. It is with Medals as with Pictures,
Diamonds and the like Curioſities: when
they exceed ſuch a certain Price, they
have no Other to be put upon them
than what the Deſire and Ability of the
Purchaſer gives them: So when a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
exceeds ten or twelve Piſtols, 'tis worth
whatſoever you pleaſe: By this means
the <hi>Otho's</hi> of large Copper, are raiſed to
an Extravagant Rate. Thoſe of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Copper are not thought too dear;
when they coſt 30 or 40 Piſtols. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the ſame Value is ſet upon

the Greek <hi>Gordians</hi> of <hi>Africk</hi> (tho' they
be of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Make) becauſe there
is none of this ſort but in the middle
Copper.</p>
                  <p>4. Single Medals can never be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
enough: Thoſe are called ſingle
which Antiquaries have never ſeen in the
Cabinets, even of Princes; and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of the firſt Rank, tho' perhaps they
may be in ſome private unknown Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets,
where Chance has only plac'd
them. So the <hi>Otho</hi> of the true large
Copper which M. <hi>Vaillant</hi> ſaw in <hi>Italy,</hi>
is what we call a ſingle Medal. The
Greek <hi>Medaillon</hi> in Silver of <hi>Peſcennius,</hi>
which the ſame M. <hi>Vaillant</hi> diſcovered
in <hi>England</hi> in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi>
and which is at preſent in the King's
Cabinet. The <hi>Herodes Antipas</hi> fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hands of M. <hi>Rigord,</hi> upon which
he has made a learned Diſſertation: The
<hi>Agrippa Caeſar,</hi> third Son of <hi>M. Agrippa,</hi>
and <hi>Julia,</hi> adopted by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> together
with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which is in M. <hi>Seignelay</hi>'s
Cabinet, is a ſingle Medal, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worth whatſoever he pleaſes: There is a
Greek one to be ſeen in the King's Cabinet.</p>
                  <p>5. Altho' Medals are continually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
that were unknown before, and
at firſt paſs for ſingle ones; yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrictly, thoſe Medals whoſe Figures
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62934:99"/>
are extraordinary; and which Antiquaries
have never talk'd of, may be ſuſpected, and
the rather, ſince it cannot be preſum'd
they could have lain ſo long hid from
the Knowledge of Antiquaries: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Metal and Fabrick ought to
be carefully examin'd, that ſo you may
not fall eaſily into the Snare which
thoſe that trade in Medals know how
to lay for Young Beginners.</p>
                  <p>6. The manner of ordering Cabinets
depends upon the Fanſie as well as upon
the Number of Medals, which every perſon
poſſeſſes: Princes only can have compleat
Cabinets; that is to ſay, which contain
all the different Series's we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the firſt and third Inſtructions:
Therefore you ought to confine your ſelf
to ſome one of them, and eſpecially to
take care neither to mix Metals nor
Sizes.</p>

                  <p>1. It is agreed on all hands, that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daillons</hi>
never ſerv'd for Money, the Work
being too exquiſite, and the Buſineſs too
cumberſome: Therefore what <hi>Suetonius</hi>

this ſort of Medals; who during the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnalia</hi>
was pleaſed to make Preſents to

                  <p>2. It is pretended that the Senate till

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Medaillons of Copper, as well as Money;
and for that reaſon till then we ſee <hi>S. C.</hi>
upon them: But <hi>Hadrian</hi> being curious
in theſe ſorts of Monuments, attributed to
himſelf the ſole power of coining them,
to make them the more conſiderable;
and to maintain this Opinion which is
oppoſed by certain Medaillons, that ſince
<hi>hadrian</hi>'s time bear the <hi>S C.</hi> as that of
<hi>M. Aurelius</hi> mentioned by M. <hi>Vaillant;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">T. 204.</note>
and thoſe of <hi>Decius,</hi> known to all the
World; we muſt tell you that theſe
are but Medals of the large Copper, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
bigger than the common ones;
and that <hi>Decius</hi> having been ſo kind as
to reſtore to the Senate the Tribunitial
Power, that of <hi>Cenſor, Proconſul,</hi> and
ſome Others which the Emperours had
united in their own Perſons, might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
alſo allow it the Privilege of coining
Medaillons, which <hi>Hadrian</hi> had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it of. But this unluckily preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62934:100"/>
as an indiſputable Principle, that the
Emperours had left to the Senate the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of coining all the Copper Money, and
only reſerved that of Gold and Silver
to themſelves. Now the Difficulties that
muſt be ſolved to make good this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
ſhew how dangerous it is, as we
have ſaid, to advance general Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in this Matter; for beſides what we
have ſaid in the fifth Inſtruction, which
I will not repeat here, if it were true,
that the Senate cauſed all the Copper
Money to be coin'd, and mark'd with
<hi>S. C.</hi> how comes it to paſs that the little
Copper for the moſt part wants this Mark?
There is no good Reaſon can be given for
it: For it will always conclude either too
much, or too little: Too much, if we
would infer from thence that the <hi>S. C.</hi>
ought to be upon all; and too little, if we
would thence conclude, that it ought to
be upon none. And what can be ſaid
of the Title that the Mint-maſters took,
<hi>Auro, Argento, Aere, FF.</hi> Thoſe of the
Senate, nor even thoſe of the Emperors,
durſt aſſume it: It ought therefore to be
ſhewn, that they did actually change their
Stile, and to be able to ſet down diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the time and reaſon thereof, is what,
I'm afraid will not be very eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>

3. Medaillons are known by their
Size, I mean by their Thickneſs, Extent,
Relief and Largeneſs of the Head; ſo that
if any of theſe Qualities be wanting, it
will only be a Medal of the large Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
This is to be underſtood of the
Higher Empire: For in the Lower, when
the Medal has either more Breadth, or
more Relief than the common middle
Copper, it is made to paſs for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daillon.</p>
                  <p>4. Very few Medaillons of Silver are
found coin'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> that weigh four
Drachms. None but the <hi>Greeks,</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeaking, have given us Medaillons of
that Bigneſs, be they either of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Kings or Emperors. M. <hi>Vaillant</hi> in
his laſt Work tells us of an <hi>Hadrian,</hi> of
this ſame Weight. We have <hi>Veſpaſian's</hi>
with the Epocha, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: and M.
<hi>Patin</hi> gives us Medaillons of <hi>Conſtantius</hi>
and <hi>Conſtans,</hi> of a much larger Size, tho'
of a far leſs Thickneſs. In our King's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
is a very fine <hi>Verus</hi> of Silver.</p>
                  <p>5. We do not find that the Colonies
ever coined Medaillons: And it is alſo
very rare to find any of their large Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
till the Reign of <hi>Septimius Severus;</hi>
but an Infinite Number of the middle
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62934:101"/>
and little Copper are found, which make
up the Beauty of thoſe Series's.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Medals of Colonies.</head>
                  <p>1. All Colonies are Rare in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of ordinary Medals, tho' ſome of
them are much more ſo than others,
both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Beauty conſiſts either in their
Figures, when they are Hiſtorical and
Extraordinary; or in the Country, when
they are of ſome Cities that are but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
known, and by which ſome Piece
of the Ancient Geography may be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
or elſe when the Dignities and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of them that coined them are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>2. When there's but one Oxe or two
Oxen, on the Reverſe, with a Prieſt guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Plough, or only Military En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
the Medal paſſes for common.
However, thoſe that founded the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
may be known by it: For if there
be but a Plough, then 'tis a Sign that
only ſome of the People were ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
If only Enſigns, it ſhews that it
was Peopl'd by Veteran Soldiers: If
both Enſigns and Oxen are found toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then 'tis as much as to ſay, both
Soldiers and People were ſent thither.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62934:101"/>
The Difference of the Standards alſo
teaches us whether they were Horſe or
Foot; and ſometimes even the Legion
to which they belonged, is known by the
Name found wrote thereon. Examples
may be ſeen at the firſt opening of M.
<hi>Vaillant</hi>'s Book of Colonies.</p>
                  <p>3. Colonies do moſt an end bear the
Name of him that founded them; and of
him alſo that either fortify'd, or re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
them. All that were called <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae,</hi>
were founded by <hi>Julius Caeſar, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
Julia Berytus:</hi> Thoſe that are named
<hi>Auguſtae</hi> by <hi>Auguſtus, Municipium Auguſta
Bilbilis:</hi> When they take both theſe
Names together, <hi>Julius</hi> founded them,
and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> either reinforced or repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with new Recruits, <hi>Colonia Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
Auguſta Detroſa:</hi> When the Name of
<hi>Auguſta</hi> is before That of <hi>Julia,</hi> then it is
a ſign that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> repaired that Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
when it was in an ill State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yet this muſt not be underſtood
ſo, unleſs when the two Names follow
one another immediately: For when any
other Word comes between, it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing. This is one of the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Art that we learn from M.
<hi>Vaillant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tom. 2. p. 24.</note> when he explains <hi>Colonia Julia
Concordia, Auguſta Apamaea.</hi> We farther
learn from him, that the Colonies ſent

abroad in the times of the Conſuls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sovereign Power fell into the
Hands of the Emperours, were called Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
witneſs <hi>Sinope</hi> in <hi>Pontus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
that coined a Medal to <hi>Gordian</hi> the
younger with theſe Letters C. R. I. F. S.
<hi>Colonia Romana Julia, Foelix Sinope, Anno</hi>
CCCVIII. The Epocha marks the time
when <hi>Lucullus,</hi> after he had beaten <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
gave that City its Liberty, and
made it a Colony, which <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>
afterwards conſiderably augmented.</p>
                  <p>4. Altho' there were Colonies in <hi>Italy,</hi>
yet not one of them ever ſet the Prince's
Head upon their Medals. I have heard
talk indeed of the Medal of <hi>Beneventum</hi>
with the Emperor's Head upon it, but
never ſaw it. Beſides, it ſeems to be
an Honour reſerved to Cities that had
a Right to coin Money, and which the
Emperors would never grant to any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this Country. This Privilege of
coining Money was granted either by a
Permiſſion from the Senate alone, or elſe
by the Senate and People together, or by
the Emperours. When it was obtained
from the Emperours, they ſet upon their
Medals, <hi>Permiſſu Caeſaris.</hi> After this manner
<hi>Sevill</hi> and <hi>Corduba</hi> teſtify'd the Favour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
had done them, <hi>Colonia Romulea
permiſſu Divi Auguſti: Colonia Patricia
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62934:102"/>
permiſſu Auguſti.</hi> Several others have
done the like. When it was only from
the Senate, they put <hi>S. C.</hi> even upon
Greek ones: And when it was from the
<hi>Roman</hi> People, they alſo put Δ. Ε. This
is the Opinion of M. <hi>Vaillant:</hi> He adds,
that <hi>S. R.</hi> found upon ſome Medals of
<hi>Antiochia</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> ſignifies the ſame
as <hi>S. C.</hi> In effect, <hi>Senatus Reſcripto</hi> meant
the ſame thing; or ſimply, <hi>Senatus Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
However, it is to be wiſh'd we had
ſome Examples for our entire Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for what F. <hi>Hardouin</hi> has ſaid in his
Diſcourſe called <hi>Antirrhetique,</hi> to oppoſe
this Opinion, ſeems to me to carry great
Weight: Nevertheleſs theſe Singularities
are not without Examples: for without
going from <hi>Antioch</hi> we mentioned, that
is, the only City of that Name (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſixteen others) which hath always af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to uſe a Latin Legend. <hi>Colonia
Caeſarea Antiochenſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. It is a common thing to find upon
Greek Medals the Names of Cities that
entred into Alliance one with another,
and marked their Confederacy with the
Word OMONOIA, as <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus;
Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Pergamus; Perga</hi> and
<hi>Sida</hi> in <hi>Pamphylia.</hi> This is not met with
in other Nations; at leaſt we ſee none
of their Medals.</p>

                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:62934:103"/>
6. Among the Colonies thoſe may be
diſtinguiſh'd that had the Right of <hi>Roman</hi>
Citizens from thoſe that only had the right
of <hi>Latium,</hi> as all <hi>Italy.</hi> The Right of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
amongſt other things, conſiſted in
a Capacity to ſtand for Offices of the
State, and to hold them as <hi>Roman</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.
The Right of <hi>Latium</hi> conſiſted
in paying no Tribute, and a Power to
ſerve in the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that coined <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Medals, ſucking the Wolf, had
always the Right of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens,
and were called <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies. Thoſe
that had only the Right of <hi>Latium,</hi> durſt
not make uſe of this Type. F. <hi>Hardoü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
to whom we owe this learned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
will have it, that they took the
Sow and thirty little Pigs, mentioned
by <hi>Virgil,</hi> which indeed ſerved for an
Enſign to thoſe of the <hi>Latin</hi> Country;
but I know not whether Examples of
it can be found upon Medals.</p>
                  <p>7. After <hi>Caligula,</hi> not one Medal coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonies is to be found,
but there we have great Quantities of
them under <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius.</hi> It is
ſaid that That Emperour took away
their Privilege, out of ſpite, becauſe they
had coined ſome in Honour to <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:62934:103"/>
his Grandfather, whoſe Grandſon he was
pleaſed they ſhould remember him to be,
thinking it a Diſgrace to him. This is
what <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports.</p>
                  <p>8. After <hi>Galienus</hi> we ſcarcely find any
more Medals of the Emperours coined
either in the Greek Cities or Colonies,
it may be thought that in the Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Empire, ſcarcely knowing to
what Maſter they belonged, they took
little care to coin Medals of any; or elſe
that the Privilege was taken away either
by <hi>Galienus</hi> himſelf, or <hi>Claudius Gothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
or <hi>Aurelian.</hi> But it is certain we have
not one after <hi>Aurelian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. Not only particular Cities coined
Medals in their own Names, to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
but Provinces did the like:
So we ſee <hi>Syria</hi> has coined ſome to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan;
Dacia</hi> to <hi>Philip;</hi> to whom ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
ſhe owed her Liberty.
<hi>Provincia Dacia Anno 1. A.</hi> 11. bearing
a Standard, mark'd with the Title D. F.
<hi>Dacia Felix.</hi>

                  <head>Of particular Medals.</head>
                  <p>1. It muſt not be taken for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Maxim, that only rare and very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
Medals are counterfeited, as thoſe
whoſe Stamps the <hi>Paduan</hi> has taken the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62934:104"/>
pains to make. Several that are very
common, are nevertheleſs falſe, eſpecially
Caſt ones.</p>
                  <p>2. The Quality of the Metal, and Size,
is enough ſometimes for the Skilful to
judge particular Medals by: So the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<hi>Gordian</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> the <hi>Peſcennius,</hi> or
the <hi>Maximus,</hi> are never regarded, becauſe
it is known there are no old ones of that
Metal; thoſe that are found thereof being
made by the above-mentioned <hi>Carteron.</hi>
A <hi>Plotina</hi> of the middle Copper will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
as well as a <hi>Marciana, Matidia,</hi> and
<hi>Didia Clara,</hi> becauſe it is known that
none of them are found of that Size:
Thoſe with the Mint-maſter's Mark of the
middle Copper, ſhall be look'd upon as
common; and thoſe of the large Copper
may paſs for rare ones.</p>
                  <p>3. Some Medals are very ſcarce in one
Country, that are common in another.
Such are thoſe of the <hi>Poſthumi,</hi> of which
<hi>France</hi> is full; but very few are to be
found in <hi>Italy:</hi> Such are the <hi>Aelii</hi> of the
large Copper, that are reckoned ſcarce
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and yet abound in <hi>France.</hi> The
Knowledge of this is neceſſary in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
advantageous Changes.</p>

4. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was certainly the firſt
that obtained the Privilege of ſetting
his Head upon Money, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſhould have been the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of ſo doing: Nevertheleſs his Head
is not once found upon any large Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Medal. Thoſe whereon it is found
with the Head of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> upon the
Reverſe, were coined ſince his Death:
Therefore all thoſe that are of that Size
ought to be look'd on as Counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>5. There is only one Medal of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>
coined during his Life, by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Senate, expreſt by the <hi>S. C.</hi>
whilſt yet he had neither the Title of
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> nor that of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> For that
of <hi>Druſus Nero,</hi> the Son of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
was not coined till after his Death, by
Order of his Son <hi>Claudius,</hi> and again
reſtored by <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. We muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to
be deceived by certain Reverſes of the
middle Copper, ſometimes diſguiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an <hi>Otho,</hi> by which ſeveral have been
abuſed: Neither muſt we regard the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwig
that appears ſo neatly upon the
Silver and Golden Ones, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
all Medals that want it for falſe:
For though it be not found upon the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62934:105"/>
Medals coin'd out of <hi>Italy,</hi> however
they are not the leſs Genuine; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Paduan</hi> has taken Pains to
make it very exact upon the large Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
yet they are not the leſs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
                  <p>7. M. <hi>Vaillant</hi> maintains, that <hi>Lucilla</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Aelius</hi> never had any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
nor was ſhe ever called <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta.
Angeloni</hi> and others hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
They ground their Opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, that <hi>Lucilla</hi> the Wife of <hi>Verus</hi>
had never any Children; whereas three
are found upon the Medals of <hi>Lucilla</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Aelius;</hi> and yet theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
bear <hi>Foecundit. Aug.</hi> Moreover it
appears, that the ſecond <hi>Lucilla</hi> had the
Title of <hi>Lucilla Antonini Auguſti F.</hi> to
diſtinguiſh her from the former, which
is never found upon thoſe Medals that
have the Children. But to decide this
Difference, we ſtand in need of a good
Author, who ſays, that <hi>Lucilla</hi> the Wife

the Legend of the Head, putting
AFR in the Place of PIUS, and
making a little Beard upon his Chin:
So that ſome have taken Occaſion from

the other Two: But one may eaſily be

undeceiv'd by remembring that all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes

there is only the Word <hi>Valerianus,</hi> it is
very hard to know them, but when
there is either a <hi>Cor,</hi> a <hi>Sal,</hi> or <hi>Divus,</hi>
or a Conſecration, 'tis moſt certainly
the Son of <hi>Salonina;</hi> becauſe the Son
of <hi>Mariniana</hi> was never admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Number of the Gods. On the

found to diſguiſe the <hi>Philips,</hi> whoſe

               <p>The Northern Crowns come next,
<hi>England, Swedeland, Denmark, Poland,</hi>
whoſe Medals for the moſt part, are
but of our Age. <hi>Italy</hi> has the ſixth
Place: The moſt Ancient are thoſe of
<hi>Sicily, Milan</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> and are all
caſt. Such are the Medals of <hi>Rena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> Kings of <hi>Sicily;</hi> of
<hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan;</hi> and
of the Great <hi>Coſmo de Medicis:</hi> There
be alſo ſome of <hi>Venice, Genoua</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
States.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Holland</hi> deſerves, by the great
Number of Medals ſhe has coined, to
make one Alone of the Seven Parts,
which compoſe Cabinets: She begins
with the famous Medal, coined in 1566,
whereon the Chief of the Revolters

                  <hi>Gueux,</hi> given
them in Scorn, and which they affected
to preſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Books that treat of modern Medals.</note>Hitherto we have very few Books
that treat of the modern, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not ſo much Occaſion for theſe,
as for the Ancient, becauſe they are
eaſily to be learn'd, by a ſmall Inſight
into their Hiſtories. However, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them, one may make uſe of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius,
Typotius</hi> and <hi>la France Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi>
with the Precautions we have
already mentioned, becauſe moſt of theſe
Medals, are made, as we ſay, <hi>à Plaſir</hi>
of <hi>F. du Moulinet</hi> for the Popes; and
the Abbot <hi>Bizot</hi> for <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Inſtructions which ſeem
moſt neceſſary, to acquire in a ſhort
time the Knowledge of Medals, to teach
him the Tricks and Artifices of thoſe
that ſell them, and to put him into a
way of making a Cabinet: But this
Science is of Extent enough to furniſh
matter ſtill for ſeveral uſeful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Obſervations; but my Deſign
was only to lay down the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of it, which, if they were not ſhort
and eaſie, would diſcourage young Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners.
Their Succeſs cannot but be
happy, becauſe they neither clog the
Underſtanding nor the Memory; and
if they cannot gain the Eſteem that great

Works draw to themſelves, they may
yet be read over, without Weariſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p>I dare even hope I ſhall have ſome
Thanks for having firſt publiſh'd theſe
