            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In that Parliament of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> the first, the Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> sent to the Parliament, <hi>Henry de Pynkney</hi> parson of <hi>Houghton</hi> as his <hi>Proxie.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> sent <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Charleton,</hi> a Canon of his Church, and in like fort other of the spiritualty of that time.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the 17th. yeare of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, the Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> made <hi>Richard Corqueanx</hi> being then Deane of the <hi>Arches, Thomas Hederset</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of <hi>Sudbury,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Thorpe</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Epingham,</hi> his <hi>Proxies</hi> by the name

of <hi>Procuratores sive nuntij.</hi> And in the same time the Bishop of <hi>Durhams proxies</hi> were <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Burton</hi> Canon of <hi>Bewdley,</hi> and Master of the Rolls, and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Wendling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> Canon of <hi>London,</hi> and other like are of the same time. By which also that of the Preamble of the Statute of <hi>Praemuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> is understood, where it is said that the advice of the Lords spirituall being present and of the <hi>procuratores</hi> of them that were absent, was demanded. The like under <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and <hi>Henry</hi> the fift are found in the Rolls. And under <hi>Henry</hi> the fift the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> gives the <hi>proxie</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>; and to two other Clerkes of his Province. And it is observable that in the making of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xies</hi> by the whole number of Bishops in case of Attainders upon Appeale, their course was sometime to make a Gentleman beneath the degree of a <hi>Baron,</hi> their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xie</hi> as under <hi>Richard</hi> the second, first they made their <hi>proxie</hi> for assenting in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but afterwards the Earle of <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> had that place in the same Parliament. But this of making others then <hi>Barons</hi> of Parliament, <hi>proxies</hi> is carefully found in the cases of the Lords spirituall.</p>
                  <p>One speciall case of it is under <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, in that of <hi>Thomas de la Ware,</hi> who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61826:7"/>
being a Clergie man had his <hi>Barony</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended unto him, and is stiled in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons alwayes <hi>Magister Thomas de la Ware,</hi> and not <hi>Dominus,</hi> hee gave his Letters to, <hi>John Franke</hi> and <hi>Richard Hulme</hi> Clerkes but the <hi>proxie</hi> Rolls for the Temporall Lords are for the most part lost. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Times especially ever since the first memorie extant of the Iournalls of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per House;<note place="margin">U. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And under Queen <hi>Mary, Francis</hi> Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> made <hi>Anthony</hi> Viscount <hi>Mountague,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> his <hi>proxies.</hi> And in the beginning of Queene <hi>Mary Stephen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> was joyned in letters of <hi>proxie</hi> sometimes with a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lord. But the Lords spirituall have so much mistataken (of late) the Lawes of this Kingdome, the Kings prerogative given by the Law, and what and whence was

the Originall of the Honours, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had obtained: and have beene ready to inlarge the Dominions of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and to induce an arbitrary government by their writings, and other apparent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in so much as now they have lost both Priviledge and Vote in Parliament.</p>

                  <p>And as to the remnant of the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now made, the said Chancellor sweareth by the SACRAMENT of IESVS CHRIST that hee is utterly innocent, and more thereof did never come into his Cognizance, but in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as hee hath said which is thus and saith, that of late hee had speech with the Officers of his house to know the Estate thereof, and for ordinary pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those to whom for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of his said House hee was a debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and there first of all, and before his Officers hee demanded how such a quantity of Herring, and Sturgeon was brought into his said house, and not by way of bargained-for provision, and in what manner the same was spent in his house, whereat he marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led because he knew not the said Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, and there withall he reckoned

with his said Officers how such an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was also made by the said Fishmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who had a generall suit depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and as soone as the heads of this matter was understood by him, hee was much grieved, and in passion did curse and sweare to his said Officers, that hee would not eat nor drinke within his said house, untill the said Fishmonger was payed for that which he had sent into his house afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and the Obligation was utterly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled and defaced, and thereupon presently was the said Fishmonger at his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement caused to come in presence of the said <hi>Chancellor</hi> in the Chappell within his house, where hee stayed for the present time when he was in <hi>London,</hi> in the same Chappell where our Lord Iesus Christs Sacrament was continually, he swore by the same Sacrament in presence of his said Clerk, &amp; of the said Fishmonger that he was never bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to do that which his said Clerk had undertaken, &amp; that he touched nothing of the said Commodities before reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor had knowledge thereof in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or in publick, but by relation of those other Officers in manner aforesaid, and that hee was never a partner to the said Covenant made thereof in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor caused the said Clerk to take

And for that the said Fishmonger disclaimeth in part, his said Accusation, and so denieth by his owne mouth that hee had not any bargaine with the person of the said <hi>Chancellor</hi> but with his said Clerk.</p>
                  <p>And also for that as well the said Clerk as the said Fishmonger thereupon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, acknowledged that the aforesaid

                  <hi>Capias</hi> in such Cases, goes out only upon <hi>nihil habet,</hi> retorned by the Sheriffe which could not be for a Baron who was ever to be supposed to be seised of his Barony, by which he might be distrained and lose issues. Although the reason failes now in those that have not more than the names alone of their Baronies, yet the same Law still remaines, but this limited to actions between party and party, and party for in cases of rescues, felonies, or the like, where the offence is immediatly to the King, A <hi>Capias</hi> lies against a Baron of the Parl.</p>
               <p>And it is as other priviledges which are legal in <hi>England,</hi> limited also to the Barons of the <hi>Parl.</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for it appeares un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>R.</hi> 2. that in an action of debt, a <hi>Capias</hi> was awarded against the Countesse of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> being one <hi>Irish</hi> Baronesse, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating of her husbands dignities as our Ladies in <hi>Eng.</hi> neither can a Baron of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be tried here by the Peeres of <hi>Eng.</hi> for they are not his Peers, no more than the L. <hi>Zanchar</hi> might being a Baron of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was indicted and arraigned only by the name of <hi>Rob. Creighton</hi> Esquier and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reason, that he was no Baron of <hi>Parl.</hi> tried by a common Iury. Thence it is also that an Earle, Baron, or Duke of <hi>France</hi> comming into <hi>Engl.</hi> by the Kings

safe conduct shall not in any legall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings be stiled so, as appeares in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 1. in the case of the E. of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> being then Duke of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and in the case of Sir <hi>John Douglasse</hi> under <hi>Edw.</hi> the 4. And the reason why S. <hi>Gilbert Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fravill,</hi>

               <p>And this difference it seemes hath beene here between Temporall dignities, and Spirituall, that in regard the temporall State of <hi>England</hi> was ever held as severed and distant from other States, not at all communicating with them in civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Therefore forraigne dignities which are of the Civill part of States, had no respect given them as appeares in the examples already brought.</p>
               <p>But on the other side in dignities Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, because there was anciently through Christendome supposed an unity in the Church.
