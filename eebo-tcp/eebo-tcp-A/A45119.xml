            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doe humbly intreat to know why your Lordships doe slight me, as if I were a foole or an Asse: I tell you truely I have been abused to your Lordships by some base fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; but if I did know them, I would make them repent it, were they never so great men in your sight; for I can doe the Kings Majesty and my
<pb facs="tcp:66252:3"/>
Countrey better service then the best Souldier or Colonel in this Land, or in all Christendom, which now it is a great wonder unto me, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships doe suffer so many unskilfull Souldiers to goe over for Ireland, to doe the Kings Majesties service, that are not able to lead a Company, neither doe they know what belongs to a Souldier; and yet for all this, your Lordships leave me out, that am able to doe the Kings Majesty better service then all the Souldiers that are now to be sent over for Ireland: So that if your Lordships please to pay for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a hundred or sixe score Instruments of war, which I am to have along with me, if you please to send me for Ireland, and make me Commander of all those men that are now to goe over for Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I will undertake to get in all Ireland in three or foure Months at the farthest, or else if I doe it not, I will give them leave to take off my head, if my Commanders will bee as forward as my selfe, and yet I will doe all things with great discretion. And I doe here protest, I will doe my King and my Countrey most true and faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and give the first onset upon the Rebells in Ireland, to the honour of all England: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you will not beleeve me, it is none of my fault, when I speake the truth: But if you will not give me the command of all the souldiers that goe for Ireland at this time, I will not goe for Ireland, but I will goe for another Countrey, where I will have a greater command then all this which I have desired from your Lordships. But I yet live in hope
<pb facs="tcp:66252:3"/>
that you will be pleased to beleeve me, and helpe me that live in great misery, by reason that I have maintained a thousand Souldiers in this City to do the King service in Ireland, and this I have done seven weekes together, which hath made me very poore, so that I have pawned all my best cloathes, and have now no good garment to weare.</p>
            <p>And therefore I humbly beseech you all Noble Lords, that you will not suffer me to perish for want of food, for I have not one penny to helpe me at this time to buy me bread, so that I am like to be starved for want of meat and drinke, and did walke into the fields very lately to gather Snailes in the nettles, and brought a bagge of them home to eat, and doe now feed on them for want of other meate, to the great shame of this land, and those that doe not helpe me, but rather command their servants to keepe me out of their gates, and that is the Lord of Essex, and the Lord of Devonshire; but I thanke the good Lord of Pembrooke, and the Lord Keeper, and the Earle of Hartford, and my Lord Major, and some other Knights, as Sir <hi>Iohn Worstenholm</hi> &amp; others do help me sometimes with a meales meat, but not alwayes, for I eat Snailes and browne bread, and drinke small Beere, and some times water, and this I have thought good to make knowne unto your Lordships, hoping that your Honours will helpe me now with some reliefe, or else I shall be forced presently to runne out of the land to serve another King, and doe him all the great service, which I would rather doe unto my
<pb facs="tcp:66252:4"/>
owne most gracious King, who would not suffer me to want, if I had money to bring me unto his Majesty, for I would doe him true and faithfull service in Ireland, and can doe him very great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; if his Majesty want money, I will undertake to fetch his Majesty home twenty millions of gold and silver in ready coine in the space of twelve or fourteene weecks: If this service bee not worthy of meat and drink, judge you that are grave &amp; wise Lords of the Parliament, for I will make no more Petitions unto your Lordships, for I have made many, but have not got any answer of them, and therefore if your Lordships will neither entertaine me, nor give me money to buy me meat and drinke, I will goe with as much speed as I can into other Countries, rather then I will be starved here. For I protest I cannot endure this misery any longer, for it is worse to mee then when I did eat horse flesh, and bread made of the barke of trees, mingled with hay dust, and this was in Parno in List-land, when we were beleagured by the Polonians: but now to proceed further, I have offered to shew your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships my instruments of war, and many other things which I can do fit for the wars, and yet other base fellowes are set forward before me that cannot do the Kings Majesty that great service which I can do him, and therefore I say it is a great shame to al this land, the Lord of Pembrooke, the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> and many other Lords and Knights and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men both in this Country and other Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb facs="tcp:66252:4"/>
the seas, as <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi> the Marquesse of Brunningburgh, and lastly the King of Swethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they all know that I am an old experienced Souldier, and have done great service in other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Countries, as when I was in Russia, I did put thirty thousand to flight, and killed six or seven thousand Polonians by the art of my instruments of warre when I first invented them, and did that great service for the Emperor of Russia; I do hereby tel you truly I am able to do my King and Country the best service of any man in Christendome, and I will maintaine it with my art and skill, and with my sword in the face of all my enemies that do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse me to the Lords of the Parliament and others, and if I did know them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would fight with them where they dare, and also disgrace them, I speake this, because I doe hear that some of them have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced me unto some of the great Lords of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Let those souldiers argue with me, and I will make fooles of them all for matter of warre, although they have perswaded the Lords to slight me, and therefore I say againe, they are not able to doe the King that good service which I can doe him, both by sea and land.</p>
            <p>And so I humbly take my leave of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, being very desirous to speake with all the Lords of the Parliament, if they will vouchsafe to speake with me before I goe out of this Land, for I am not able to endure this misery any longer, for
<pb facs="tcp:66252:5"/>
I want money, meate and drinke and cloaths, and therefore I pray your Lordships to pardon my boldnesse, and helpe me with some reliefe if you please, or else I must of necessity goe into other Countries presently, and so I most humbly take my leave for this time, and rest</p>
