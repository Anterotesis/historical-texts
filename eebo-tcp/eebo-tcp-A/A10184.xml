            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now this drinking of Healthes, is expressely, and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
within the verge and compasse of all these inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
precepts, and iniunctions. For it is an appearance
and spice of euill, and an occasion of much euill, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,

Vaine, Prophane, and Heath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Rudiment, and Tradition, and a thing, and rite that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
much (nay wholely) of Gentilisme, Paganisme, and
Heathenish Idolatrie, and Superstition: it is a concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
cause, and adiunct of Riot, and Drunkennesse; a
fleshly and carnall lust, and a part and relique of the old
Man, which makes prouision onely for the flesh, to fulfill
the lusts thereof. It is a scandalous, and offensiue thing,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15892:31"/>
which beseemes not the Gospel of Christ, which giues
offence to the Saints, and Church of God, and is not
honest and laudable in the sight of all men: It is within the
compasse of carrouzing, and drinking Wine in Bowles:
within the verge, of Reuelling, Banqueting, and excesse
of Wine, and Riot, according to the will and lusts of
men, and the custome and practise of the Gentiles: and
those who vse and practise it, are such who giue their
neighbours drinke, and put their bottle to their mouthes,
that they may make them drunke, and see their nakednesse:
they are such as draw on others to drinke more largely
then they would, or should doe, for which there is an
heauy and bitter <hi>Woe</hi> attending on them: Therefore this
drinking of Healthes is in substance, punctually, fully, and
particularly (though not expressely, and by name) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and disapproued by the Scriptures; So that it must
needes be Sinfull and vtterly Vnlawfull, as well as Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

<q>Grecians in his age: Informes vs;<note n="f" place="margin">De Ebrieate et Luxu. Serm &amp; com. in cap. 5 Esaiae.</note> That they had
Maisters, Stewards, and Ouerseers of drinking in their
Feastes and meetings, to see that men should take vp their
liquor: &amp; that there was a certaine order &amp; method ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in their disorderly course of drinking. (And is not
this the course, &amp; practise of our Drunkards now?) When
as a man (saith he) would thinke that they had well drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
then they begin to drinke: and they drinke like
beastes, giuing equall cups vnto the guesse as out of an
inexhaust fountaine: The drinking thus proceeding, a
young man comes foorth with a Flagon of coole Wine
on his shoulders: hee comming in the Butlers place, and
standing in the middest, doeth distribute an equall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of drunkennesse to all the guesse through crooked
pipes: This is a new kinde of measure, where there is
no manner of measure, that so by the equallity of the cups
there may be no murmuring, nor exceptions taken, and
that one may not circumuent, nor defraud another in
drinking: Euery one now takes the cup that is set before
him, that so like an Oxe out of a Cisterne, he may striue
to drink at one draught without any respitation, as much
as that great Flagon will supply through the Siluer pipe:
Consider the greatnesse, the belly and measure of the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon

proceedes in condemning of these Healthes, which are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15892:32"/>
the same with ours now, or at least but little different
from them. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> in expresse tearmes condemnes
this drinking of Healthes:<note n="h" place="margin">De Elia &amp; Ietun. cap. 17. 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <q>What (saith he) shall I
speake of the obtestations of Drunkardes? and what
shall I commemorate their sacraments, or ceremonies,
which they esteeme a kinde of impietie for to violate?
Let vs drinke, say they, the Emperours Health: and hee
that will not pledge it, is made guiltie of indeuotion and
disrespect: for hee seemeth not to loue the Emperour,
who will not drinke his Health: and is not this the
speach and custome of our times? O the obedience (saith
hee) of this Pious deuotion. Let vs drinke say they, for
the safetie of our Armies, for the Prowesse of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts,
for the Health of our Children: They thinke that
these their well-wishing Healthes doe ascend vp euen to
God himselfe. O the folly of men, who deeme drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to bee a kinde of sacrifice: who thinke that those
Martyres will be appeased by drinking of their Healthes,
who haue learned to indure affliction through fasting, &amp;c.
In their Feastes (saith hee in another Chapter) thou shalt
see their Gold and Siluer cups to bee marshalled, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
like an Armie, to prouoke men for to drinke, (Lo here
the very method and patterne of our drunken age:) First,
they begin to drinke and Skirmish with the lesser cups,
then with the greater: Next the cups begin to striue with
the Firkins, they being oft times doubled betweene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes.
Afterwards proceeding on to drinke, they begin
to striue who shall drinke most. If any man desire to bee
excused from drinking, hee is hardly taxed for it. When
the Feast is ended, they begin to drinke a fresh: and when
as a man would thinke they had ended, then they begin
their drinking; and then the greatest Bowles, like so
many warlike instruments, begin to walke; here they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the combate: the Butlers and Seruants begin to
grow weary of filling, and yet they are not weary of
drinking: Onely these combates are without excuse. In
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15892:32"/>
Warre, if any man finde himselfe to weake, hee may lay
downe his Armes, and receiue a pardon: here if any man
sets downe the cup, he is vrged to drinke. In wrestling,
if any man foyle thee, thou losest the victory, but yet thou
art free from wrong: in Feastes, if any man refuse to
take the cup into his hand, it is foorthwith powred into
his mouth by force. Thus they continue till all of them
are drunken, as well the Conquerers, as the Conquered.
What a sorrowfull and miserable spectacle is this to
Christians? Neither are they excused, who thus inuite

               <hi>Deare brethren</hi> (saith hee) <hi>albeit I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that you feare drunkennesse as much as Hell it selfe, yet I
exhort you neither to drinke more your selues, neither to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
others to drinke more then they ought. For many oft times
doe drinke by measure, without measure: they prouide great
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15892:33"/>
cups, and drinke by a certaine Law and Rule: hee that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
deserues the praise by this sinne of his. Now those who
are such, endeauour to excuse themselues, saying,</hi> (as our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Drunkards vsually doe:) <hi>Wee should vse our Friendes
discourteously, if we should not giue them as much as they will
drinke, when as wee inuite them to our Feastes. But how are
they your friendes, who would make God your Enemie, who
is a friend to both? Wherefore it is better to part with such
friendes, then to part with God: and if they will needs drinke,
let them drinke, and perish alone: better it is that one should
perish, then many. But O the vnhappinesse of man kinde:
how many are there, who will force Drunkards to drinke more
then they ought, when as they will hardly part with a cup of
drinke, to a poore needy Christian who begges it at their doores;
notwithstanding, that in this case it bee giuen to Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe!

               <hi>compell, and allure others to drinke more then they
ought. But now I intreate this one thing of you, aboue all the
rest, and I adiure you by the dreadfull day of Iudgement, that
as oft as you Feast one another, you would vtterly banish from
your Feastes, that filthy and vnhappy custome of drinking
Healthes, three by three in a large measure, without measure,
either willingly, or against your wills: as being the poyson of
the Diuell, and an vnhappy relique, and custome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.
And whosoeuer shall consent, that this forme of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall bee vsed, either in his owne, or other mens Feastes:
let him not doubt, but that hee hath Sacrificed to the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
himselfe: by which forme of drinking, his Soule is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
slaine, but his body likewise is infeebled. But now what a
thing is this, that these vnhappy Drunkards when as they
drinke till they glut themselues with ouer much Wine, should
deride and scoffe at those, who will drinke no more then will
suffice them? saying vnto them, be ashamed, and blush: why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
you drinke so much as we?</hi> (Which <hi>is the ordinary speach,
and phrase of Drunkards now): They tell them that they are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15892:33"/>
no men, because they will not drinke: They stile themselues the
men, when as they lye prostrate in the Iakes of drunkennesse:
and they say that others who can stand vp Honestly, and Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are no men: They lye prostrate, and yet are men: others
stand vpright, and yet they are no men: The Conquerour of
Drunkennesse is dispraised, and he that is Conquered of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse
is applauded: The Sober man, who can gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and others, is derided: and the Drunkard, who can neither
know himselfe, nor others: is not derided, yea not bewailed.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Marke this Obiection, &amp; the reply vnto it.</note> 
               <hi>But
now Drunkards doe alledge this excuse for themselues. That a
great Man did compell them to drinke more then they would,
and in the Feast of the King I could not doe otherwise. This is
nothing else but a meere pretence to excuse our sinnes: and that
which we will not, we say we cannot fulfill: our will is the fault,
though our inabililie be pretended: But admit that thou were
so put vnto it, that there it should bee said vnto thee; either
drinke or dye: It is better that they Sober flesh should bee slaine,
then that thy Soule should dye for Drunkennesse. Howeuer the
obiection is false: for Godly, Sober, and Religious Kings and
Potentates, though they may chance to bee angry with thee for
an houre, or two, because thou refr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sest to drinke out of a loue to
God: yet they will afterwards admire thee, and respect thee so
much the more for this thy refusing, by how much the more
earnestly they did desire, perswade, and presse thee for to pledge
them. And now, what a things is this, that after the Feast
concluded, when as men haue quenched their thirst: when as
they cannot, neither ought they to drinke more, that then they
should begin to drinke afresh (as if they were but newly come)
vnder diuers names, not onely of liuing Men, but likewise of
Angels, and other ancient Saint: thinking that they doe them
the greatest honour, if they doe euen bury themselues with too
much Drunkennesse, in the commemoration of their names, and
healthes: not knowing, that none are so iniurious to holy Angels,
or holy Men, as those who slay their Soules through too much
Drunkennesse, in drinking off their Healthes. Remember
therefore, that hee who drinkes too much to his friend, is made
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15892:34"/>
an Enemie to his Soule: that hee doeth debilitate his body, and
murther his Soule.</hi> And thus hee proceedes against Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
and drinking Healthes, as you may more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reade in the Workes themselues. You see now by these
seuerall Testimonies, and Recordes: that the Ancient <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>

the rest one <hi>Islebius,</hi> for whose sake this Feast was
principally prouided. Dinner being ended, and all of
them being somewhat merry: <hi>Luther</hi> after the German
custome, commanded a great Glasse, diuided with three
kinde of circles to bee brought vnto him: and out of it he
drunke an Health in order to all his guesse: When all of
them had drunke, the Health came at last to <hi>Islebius: Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
then in the presence and view of all the rest, takes

vnto thee, which containes the renne Commandements
to the first circle: the Apostles Creed to the second, the

When he had thus spoken, he drinkes of the whole
Glasse at a draught: which being replenished with wine,
he deliuers it to <hi>Islebius,</hi> that hee might pledge him all at
a breath: who takes the Glasse, and drunke it off onely
to the first circle, which did containe the Decalogue, it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15892:35"/>
being impossible, for him to drinke any deeper, and then
sets downe the Glasse on the Table, which hee could not

            <p>Hauing thus (as I suppose) sufficiently euidenced and
euinced the sinfulnesse, and vnlawfulnesse of Drinking
Healthes, by these fore-cited arguments, and Authors: I
will here in the next place, answere all those ordinary and
common obiections, excuses, and pretences, which men
make, either in the defence and iustification, or in excuse,
or extenuation of Drinking, or pledging Healthes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
a meere Naturall, or Heathen man, might iustly
wonder, (but a Christian, much more then they:) that
there should bee any men (but especially such as professe

               </note> Incongruous, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,

Indeed if Infidels and Pagans, who did vsually drinke the
Healthes of their Deuill-gods, in token of praise and
thankesgiuing to them, should produce this Scripture to
iustifie these their Healthes, it might yeeld them some
colour for them, if their Gods were true: But for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to peruert and abuse this sacred Text, <hi>of taking the Cup

inuocation, or commemoration of any mans (but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>2. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Others there are of a more moderate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
who obiect in defence of Healthes. That they serue

               </gap> Friendes, and such
whose Healthes they Drinke: therefore they are, and may
be lawfull.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Answer.</hi> To this I answere first: that wee are to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
none but in that way, and course which God himselfe
hath limmited and prescribed to vs: but God himselfe did
neuer teach vs, (no nor any of his Saints, or Children) to
honour men in Drinking of their Healthes: therefore wee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15892:40"/>
are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for to honour them in this kinde, or nature. If this
reason which is obiected could passe as currant; the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
and Ioseph,</hi> might iustifie<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 42. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>their swearing by the life of</hi>
Pharaoh: because they did it for his honour: Yea, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites,
and flatterers of</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great,</hi> might by this
meanes iustifie and defend their<note n="o" place="margin">Plutarch. Alexan. &amp; de Adulat. &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micitia Lib. Quint. Curtius Lib. 8. Sect. 5.</note> 
               <hi>adoration of him for a
God:</hi> because it made for his greater honour, in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme.
Wherefore if we will honour Kings, and others,
wee must not doe it in Drinking and Quaffing off their
Healthes, but in that course and way which God himselfe
prescribeth vnto vs; euen in giuing them that outward
reuerence, obedience, seruice, and respect, and that due,
and iust applause, which their places, their worth, their
vertues, and their graces doe deserue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I answere: that God neuer appointed Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
for any other end, but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

vse of the Creatures, and Liquors that wee drinke: to
the end, that wee might bee more cheerefull, quicke, and
forwards in his seruice. If therefore the Healthes we drinke
tend to no other end, but to honour Kings, and Princes,
and those whose Healthes wee drinke, as this obiection
doeth pretend: they doe but<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>we must not doe Euill</hi> in any kinde, <hi>that so good may
come of it:</hi> so we must not abuse our drinking, nor Gods
good creatures in our Healthes: that so some vaine, and
triuiall honour, may redound to others by it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I answere: that the drinking, or pledging of
mens Healthes, is so farre from being an honour, benefit,
or aduantage to them, as vaine, and ebrious persons doe
surmise; that it is the<note n="a" place="margin">See Master <hi>Harris</hi> his Drunkards Cup. p. 20, 28, 29.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15892:40"/>
inuolues them not onely in the guilt, but likewise in the
Temporall, and Eternall punishment of their Sinnes. To
expostulate, and argue this a little farther. Can it so much
as euer enter into any Christians thought, that the Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or pledging of any mans Health, should bee a grace,
or honour to him? Can it bee any honour to a Christian
King, or Prince or Potentate, or any other person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
to be honoured with Gods, dishonour? To bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with excessiue roundes, and drunken Healthes,
wherein Gods creatures are abused, his Commandements

his Image, and violate his Lawes: and what infinite and

with speed and resolution.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Obiect.</hi> The third and best obiection, and pretence for
the lawfulnesse of Drinking Healthes, is this: That the
drinking of an health, is no more then the ordinary remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
of, or the Drinking to an absent Friend: now it is
vsuall and lawfull, to drinke to an absent friend: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the selfe same reason, to drinke an Health.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I answere, that the Maior is false: for
there is a vast and large difference, betweene the drinking
of an Health, and the ordinary manner of our Drinking to
some absent Friend. First, they differ in this: that men in
their ordinary Drinking, remember none for the most part
but their Friendes and equalls, to whom they haue some
ingagements, and that onely to put themselues in minde of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15892:44"/>
them, and to expresse their loues vnto them: but in Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Healthes, men commonly remember their Superiours,
or at least their Friendes and equalls, with an intent to
grace them, or to doe some good vnto them: as if the
Drinking of their Healthes<note n="i" place="margin">

               <hi>did them some reall good:</hi> as
if it did procure, or preserue his Health: the former of
which is commendable, but the latter not. Secondly, they
differ in this: that when as men remember their absent
Friendes in Drinking to them, they doe it onely out of
courtesie: but they drinke and pledge mens Healthes in
nature of a duetie, as if they were ingaged for to doe it, and
and could not well omit it. Thirdly, they vary in this:
those who drinke to their absent Friendes, doe seldome, or
neuer make the remembrance of these Friendes, a ground
or cause, but onely a consequent, or concomitant of their
Drinking: they drinke not because they would remember
their Friendes, but because they are thirstie, making their
thirst, not their Friendes, the occasion of their Drinking:
But in Drinking, or pledging of Healthes; men make not
their Healthes a consequent, or concomitant of their thirst,
but their thirst, and Drinking a consequent, or adiunct
of their Healthes:<note n="k" place="margin">Sapientes bibunt, vt ne bibant: nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lones bibunt, vt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Gods good creatures, which cannot but be euill. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those who drinke to absent Friendes, or Kinred, as they
alwayes drinke onely to one, and not to all the company, so
they put no law nor necessitie of pledging on those to
whom they drinke, but they alwayes leaue them at their
liberty to pledge them, when, and what, and how they
will themselues. But those who begin and Health, doe put

               <hi>kinde of Law, necessitie and force of pledging; not onely

pallates, bellies, thirst, and dispositions by their owne,
and forcing them to drinke oft times against their wills
and stomackes, when as they are not thirstie: therefore,
this drinking of Healthes must needes bee euill, though
the other bee not so. Fiftly, in our ordinary Drinking to
absent Friendes, there are no such idle vaine, scrupulous,
and superstitious ceremonies, rites, or rules obserued as
there are in Healthes: wherein our most serious and sacred
gestures are abused so; and in our Drinking, which is
naturall, is made but artificiall: our Healthes therefore are
vnlawfull, though our ordinary Drinking to our Friendes,
bee not vnlawfull.

               <hi>ordinary
Drinking to absent, or present Friendes, is seldome, or neuer an
occasion of Drunkennesse, or Excesse, where it is lawfully vsed:</hi>
it neuer breedes any Duells, Quarrells, Murthers, Stabbes,
Murmurings, Raylings, Debates, or Discontents, or any
such dangerous, or bitter fruites, as the Drinking of
Healthes doeth: because it neuer ingageth men to pledge
the parties so remembred: besides it giues no scandall, nor
offence to any: it confirmes none in their Drunkennesse,
or in the excesse of Healthing: it brings no Slanders, no
Censures, nor reproaches vpon any, as Healthes, for the
most part doe: yea it had not its rise and pedegree from
Deuills, Pagans, and Idolatrie, as Health-drinking had:
Wherefore though our ordinary and common (not our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue,
or irregular) Drinking to absent Friendes be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and commendable, yet the Drinking or pledging of
Healthes, which differs so farre from it in all these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
cannot be so.</p>
            <p>From these Iustifications, and Apologies which men
make in defence of Healthes, I will now descend to those
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15892:45"/>
extenuations, and excuses
that are pleaded for them,
which are incident to two
sorts of men:

Healthes.</item>
                  <item>2. To such as pledge
them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Those who begin these
Healthes, haue there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses,
or causions:
<list>
                  <item>1. That they intend no
harme,<note place="margin">Excuses for the beginning of Healthes answered.</note> nor euill in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
Healthes.</item>
                  <item>2. That their Healthes are
but very small.</item>

for to pledge them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the first of these: That they intend no harme, nor
euill in beginning Healthes. I answere first, that they can
intend no good at all: for what good can men intend to
God, themselues, or others in beginning Healthes? Vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
none that I can dreame of. If then they intend no good
at all: they must needes intend either nothing at all, or
some thing that is euill: because<note n="n" place="margin">

               <hi>in Morrall actions
there is no medium:</hi> If they intend nothing at all; then as
their Healthing is vnreasonable and vnnaturall, so it must
needes bee euill, because it is vaine and idle, and hath no
end at all; and because for euery idle action that men shall
doe, they shall giue an account at the day of Iudgement, as
<note n="o" place="margin">Math. 12. 36. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Well as for euery idle word, which they shall speake:</hi> If they
intend any thing that is euill, (as men for the most part
doe, because they begin their Healthes to draw on others to
Drunkennesse and excesse, or to carnall Mirth and Iollitie)
then their intent must needes be euill: and so the excuse is
false, and idle. Secondly, I answere: that what euer they
pretend to colour this their Healthing, yet their intent is
euill: for as there is no necessary, no lawfull, nor commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
occasion, end, or motiue, to prouoke, or stirre them
vp to begin an Health, so their intent and end in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, must needes be euill: For it is certaine, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15892:46"/>
all others that are present, to drinke and pledge it in the
very selfe-same Liquor, quantitie, and ceremonie, and to
the selfe-same persons as hee himselfe began it: bee they
thirstie, or not thirstie, willing, or vnwilling, able, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
for to plodge it: this is euery mans end that begins
an Health, and therefore hee expects, and lookes precisely
that euery man should pledge it. Now this intent to draw
on others to drinke in method, order, course, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
in art and measure, be they willing, or vnwilling, able,
or vnable, thirstie, or not thirstie, must needes bee euill:
because it is an allurement, and prouocation to excesse:
therefore the intent of those who begin these Healthes,
must needes bee euill. Lastly, I answere: that most men
who are giuen to begin these Healthes, doe purposely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
them to draw on others to Drunkennesse and excesse,
and to ingurgitate, and quaffe downe more then else they
would, or should doe: they vse these Healthes, but as so

               <hi>baites, occasions, and pretences, to allure, and prouoke
their Guesse, their Friendes, and Consorts, to the very Act and
Sinne of Drunkennesse,</hi> and to no other purpose: this their
owne Hearts, and Consciences, can testifie vnto them in
the sight of God: therefore their intents must needes bee
sinfull, what euer they pretend: and so this euasion will
not helpe them, especially, when as they are to pleade
with God himselfe, who knowes their hearts and thoughts,
farre better then themselues.</p>
            <p>To the second excuse: That the Healthes which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
are very small: I answere first: That the smalnesse of
the Cup, or Glasse, is commonly made vp with the strength
and vigor of the Wine, or Liquor: so that these small
Healthes, will sooner intoxicate, and inebriate men, then
greater Healthes, in cheaper, or smaller Liquor: the lesse
the Healthes are, the more strong the Wine: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the worser. Secondly, where the Healthes are small
and little, in quantitie, and measure, they are commonly,
the<note n="r" place="margin">Primum v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, gemino mox calice, inde tribus, Pocula siccantur. <hi>Obsopaeus de Arte Bib. l. 2.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>more in number:</hi> the lesse the Healthes, the more
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15892:46"/>
dense and frequent are they: so that the littlenesse of the
Healthes, is made vp and recompenced with the multitude,
and number of them, (one small and little Health begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and alwayes drawing on another:) so that if all these
little Healthes were put together, they would seeme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great. Thirdly, though the Healthes that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
at first are small, yet they<note n="s" place="margin">Cito ad m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>alwayes draw on great
ones at the last:</hi> little Healthes, as well as greater wedges,
make way for great ones: this the<note n="t" place="margin">See <hi>Basil. de Ebrietate Ser.</hi> Ambr. de Elia &amp; Ieiun. c. 11. <hi>Aug. de Temp. Sermo.</hi> 231. 232. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</note> 
               <hi>Fathers,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
testifie: therefore, the littlenesse of them is no
excuse. Fourthly, the Drinking and beginning of small
Healthes, doeth either draw on others to begin<note n="u" place="margin">Solent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima paula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim despecta in malum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> greater
or else confirme them in the vse of greater: he that beholds
a good, or great man Drinking a small, or little Health,
will presently conclude, that he may drinke a great one: so
that the example and president of drinking small Healthes,
is as pernicious, and hurtfull, as the beginning, or Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of greater Healthes. Fif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, the Healthes that most
men doe begin (as experience can testifie) are oft times
very great: if their first Healthes are not so, yet their last
Healthes are, which make amends, and recompence for all
the rest. Sixtly, admit, that the Healthes which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
were small and few, yet since you haue no occasion, no
necessary, or lawfull cause at all, to mooue you to them:
since they are scandalous, offensiue, and misbeseeming
Christians, and confirme others in their excessiue Healths;
were it not farre better, and lesse offensiue, to begin no
Healthes at all, then to begin or pledge these small ones?
there is, there can be, no hurt nor inconuenience at all, in
abstaining from the smallest Healthes: there may bee,
nay, there is much hurt in vsing them, both in respect
of others, and such as doe begin them: better therefore
is it to abandon all these Healthes, then to admit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue,
or vse the smallest of them. Lastly, if Healthes be
sinfull and vnlawfull, it matters not whether the Healthes
wee doe begin, bee great, or small: both of them are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
odious, and damnable, in the sight of God, and will
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15892:47"/>
plunge the Soules of those who vse them, deepe in Hell,
with out redemption, vnlesse they shun them, and repent
them of them. Wherefore the exiguitie, or smalnesse of
these Healthes, is no excuse, it is no Apologie, no Plea at
all in the Court of Heauen, or at the Barre of Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall,
(to which all Healthers shall bee summoned ere be
long:) the least Healthes, if they are sinfull, damne mens
Soules, as well as the greatest: therefore, wee must auoid
them both alike.</p>
            <p>To the third excuse: That they force none for to pledge
them: I answere first, that the very beginning of an Health,
is a kinde of inforcement, and ingagement vnto others for
to pledge it: and most men take it to be so; because long
custome, and the pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itie, and wickednesse of men, hath
made it a kinde of <hi>Affront, Indignitie, Discourtesie, and
Wrong, both to him that beginnes the Health, to those that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
it, and to the person that is remembred in it, to refuse, or
passe it by, and not to pledge it: as</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose, Heirome,
Augustine, Baro, Iohn Fredericke, and Guagninus,</hi> testifie
in their fore-quoted Testimonies, and as our owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
cannot but witnesse. Secondly, though some are so
Wise, Discreete, and Ciuill, as not to force men for to
drinke, or to pledge them against their wills, yet<note n="x" place="margin">See Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Obsopeus de Arte Biben. di. lib. 3.</note> 
               <hi>many,</hi>

and quarrell of their Countrey, or of the chiefest Article of

affected, that they are more impatient, and angry with
men for refusing, or crossing them in their Healthes, then
for hindring them in Gods seruice, or thwarting them in

               <hi>dashing</hi> of the cup against his head, doe sufficiently testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie:
Yea, I may boldly say, that most of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Health-drinkers,
would hate men more for refusing, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of their Healthes, then for abiuring of their Faith,
their God, or their Religion: Yea, they would rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
their <hi>blood in the Field,</hi> vpon the refusall of an
health, then for the mainest Article, or ground of Faith:
Most healthers therefore, cannot truely say, they force no
healthes, because their very practise prooues the contrary.
Thirdly, though some are so ingenuous, as not to offer any
open force or violence to any, to force them for to pledge
their healthes; yet they will intreate, and perswade them
by all the Art, and Rhetoricke that they can vse, to pledge
and second them in their healthes; and if they still refuse
them, they are alwayes apt to thinke the worser of them,
to censure them secretly in their thoughts, and to beare
them a secret spleene, and grudge within their hearts, if
not, to slander, and reuile them with their tongues. Now
these intreaties, and perswasions (especially of<note n="e" place="margin">

of Kinred, of those who are the Maisters of the Feast, of

such whose loue and good esteeme we are loath to lose) are
as so <hi>many iniunctions, enforcements, and commands:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this obiection is but false. Lastly, if you intend to
force none for to drinke, or pledge you, why then doe you
begin these healthes? why doe you not wholy extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15892:48"/>
and banish them from their Tables, since they carry a
kinde of force, command and threatning with them? if
then you will force none for to drinke against their wills,
then banish and disclaime these Healthes, to which long
custome, and the common vsage, haue added a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsorie
necessitie, and binding law to pledge them, else
you cannot but bee guiltie in the sight of God, of forcing,
and inuiting men to drinke against their wills.</p>
            <p>These former pretences,<note place="margin">Excuses for pledging of Healthes answered.</note> and excuses of those who begin
these Healthes to others, being thus cleared and answered:
I come now to answere those pretences, extenuations, and
excuses, which men alleage for pledging Healthes; which
are farre more tollerable, then those for Drinking, and
beginning Healths: because there are some colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and ingagements for to pledge an Health, that is
once begun, though there be no colour, nor ground at all to
begin an Health.</p>
            <p>The first excuse, and pretence for pledging Healthes, is
this: That it is an ordinary, and common<note n="a" place="margin">Inter causes malorum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strorum est, quod viutmus ad exempla: nec ratione co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to pledge an Health: and there are few who doe refuse it:
therefore, since most men, (nay, great men, and learned
men) drinke, and pledge these Healthes, we may lawfully,
and safely doe it, as well as they.</p>
            <p>To this I answere; first, that Christians must liue by

pledge these Healthes: therefore, we must not pledge, nor

Christ, who is our Patterne, and our Guide. Thirdly, wee

what the best, and holiest, of Gods Saints, and Children
doe: imitating, and following them, as farre as they doe
imitate, and follow Christ: Now, though the most, the
worst, and greatest part of men,<note n="h" place="margin">

               <hi>Whose multitude, can

<hi>Healthes;</hi> yet the best, and holiest of Gods Saints, doe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refuse, and reiect them, vnlesse it bee, when as they
are ouercome, of too much pusillanimitie, and slauish
feare: therefore, we must imitate and follow them, though
they are the smaller number, and not the most, and worst.
Fourthly, we must not so much consider, nor examine what
mens wayes, and actions, as what their iudgements, and
the Testimonies of their Consciences are; because mens
Actions, doe oft times vary from their Iudgements, and
Consciences; Witnesse, the ordinary Practise, and Liues
of many, who liue in grosse, and knowne sinnes, against
their Iudgements, and their Consciences. Now most of
those who drinke, or pledge these Healthes (especially,
such who haue any grace, or ciuility in them) doe secretly
condemne them in their Iudgements: their Hearts, and
Consciences, doe secretly distaste them, and they doe euen
condemne, and iudge themselues, when as they drinke, or
pledge them: Wherefore, wee should here abondon, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15892:49"/>
disclaime the very drinking, and pledging of these healths,
because the Iudgements, and Consciences of those that
pledge them, doe oft times checke them, and condemne
them for it. Lastly, I would demand, but this question of
those who make this Plea: Whether they are perswaded in
their Heartes, their Soules, and Consciences, that those
who drinke, and pledge these Healthes, doe well, or no?
If their owne Heartes, vpon good deliberation, examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and aduise, shall testifie, that they doe but honestly
and Christianly in it, when as not onely the Fathers, and
Saints in former ages, but euen the very Pagans, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
them: they may haue then some ground and colour
for to imitate them: but if their owne Hearts, and Soules,
shall secretly vpon full deliberation condemne, and taxe
them for it, as I make no question but they will doe: then
let them neuer imitate that, which their owne Hearts,
and Consciences doe condemne in others: for feare lest
<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 14. 22.</note> 
               <hi>they condemne themselues in the things which they allow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second excuse and pretence for pledging Healthes,
is this. That it is an vnciuill, vnmannerly, discourteous,
and iniurious part, both to the author, and owner of the
Health, not to pledge it: therefore I know not how I may
well refuse it.</p>
            <p>To this I answere first; that if there be any discourtesie,
or vnmannerlinesse in refusing of an Health, it lies on his
part, that would allure, or force thee to it, against thy sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make,
or thy conscience, and not on thine who doest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it. It is an iniurious, and discon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Now Healthes as I haue prooued, are vnreasonable,
hurtfull, sinfull, and vnlawfull things, which oft times goe
against mens Natures, Iudgements, Hearts, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15892:49"/>

therefore is it, to be vnmannerly, and iniurious towards
men, then towards God himselfe. Thirdly, it is farre better
for thee to incurre the ignorant, rash, scandalous, false and
iniudicious censure of others, in refusing Healthes, then to
encourage animate, or confirme them in the abuse, and
practise of these Healthes, through thine ill example: thy
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15892:50"/>
refusall of Healthes, vpon good grounds and reasons, may
be a meanes to worke some good on others, and to reclaime
them from this Idolatrous, Heathenish, and Sinfull practise;
which will bee the greatest courtesie, and kindnesse, that
thou canst doe vnto their Soules: Whereas thy ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in pledging them, will prooue a great discourtesie,
wrong, and dammage to them, in hardning, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them in this Abominable, and Sinfull Ceremonie:
Wherefore it is no discourteous, vnciuill, nor iniurious
part, to refuse these Healthes, as this carnall, vaine, and
false deceit, obiection, and delusion doeth pretend. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is no breach of Allegeance, no point of discourtesie,
or disrespect to any, for to refuse their Healthes: because
there is no Law of God, of Man, or Nature, that inioynes
them. God, and Christian amitie, command vs onely<note n="r" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>to
Pray for,</hi> it is the<note n="s" place="margin">See Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 14.</note> 
               <hi>Deuill onely, and his Ministers, that
prescribes vs, for to drinke the Healthes of men:</hi> which oft
times Damne their Soules. It is therefore, the greatest
courtesie, that we can doe to any, to refuse their Healthes,
because the pledging of them with their assent, or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
doeth surely hurt, if not condemne their Soules.</p>
            <p>The third obiection, and excuse for pledging Healthes,
is this: I was commanded, forced, and intreated, by some
friend, or great one, for <hi>to pledge these Healthes;</hi> and I had
incurred much wrong, and violence, much hatred and
<note n="t" place="margin">Mala hine oriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur omnia quod non De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um sed homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes reueremur. <hi>Chrysost, Ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 12. in 1 Cor. 4.</hi>
               </note> displeasure, had I but once withstood them.</p>
            <p>To this, I answere first; That there is no Good, no
Gracious, nor Holy man, in all the World, that dares to
force thee for to pledge him: and as for wicked, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
men: if thou wouldest but with Modestie, Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Courage, and Discretion, stand it out, they would
not be so hardy, as to force thee for to pledge them, what
words so euer they giue out; because the <hi>Image of God,</hi>
and practicall <hi>powre of Grace,</hi> which shines foorth in thee,
being backed, and seconded by God himselfe, would euen
terrifie, and<note n="u" place="margin">Mark. 6. 21. Iohn 18. 5. 6. Acts 6. 10. 15.</note> 
               <hi>daunt their Hearts.</hi> Wherefore, to say that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15892:50"/>
these would force thee for to pledge them, before thou
hast put it to the triall, is but a vaine excuse, and meere
pretence, to shroud thy cowardize, or excesse in Drinking;
which will not auaile thee in the day of Iudgement. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
admit, thou were put to this extremitie, that thou
must drinke excessiuely against thy stomake, or thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or else, thou must die for it. I answere with Saint
<hi>Augustine,</hi> in the selfe same case:<note n="a" place="margin">Melius er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               <hi>that it were farre better

               <hi>since the necessitie of Saluation, is the greatest necessitie of
all others:</hi> to die of the menacing, and iniurious Sword,
which can but kill the body: then of this mortall, and Soule-slaying
sinne, which kills both Soule, and Body too, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, and that for euer. Thirdly, though thou
hast men to menace thee for refusing Healthes, yet thou
hast God himselfe to stand by thee, and incourage thee; If
thou doe it out of Loue, Obedience, and Conscience vnto
God; hee will protect, and shelter thee from all the euill,
and danger, that can befall thee, for his sake, or turne it to
thy greater good, and glory:<note n="c" place="margin">Acts 4. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Better</hi> therefore is it for
thee, to depend on God, in Fearing, Pleasing, and <hi>Obeying
him:</hi> then to Distrust, Offend, or Disobey him, for Feare,
or Loue of men. If thou incurre the displeasure, or wrath
of men in refusing Healthes, yet thou shalt win the Grace,
the Loue, the Fauour, and the Praise of God, which are
farre better. Fourthly, if this excuse would serue the
turne, then a man might runne into any sinne, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and colour, that hee was forced to it, which would
wholly euacuate, and make void the Law of God, and man:
this therefore, we must know, that we must rather<note n="d" place="margin">Luke 14, 26 Math. 16. 25.</note>

which men produce, or make for pledging Healthes, is this.
That it is but a slight, and triuiall matter, for to pledge an
Health: it is but a kinde of precisenesse, and it sauours of
a Puritanical<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> &amp; factious humour to refuse it: whence, those
who make a Conscience, and scruple of it, are commonly
derided, scorned, censured, and condemned, as humorous,
precise, and factious persons: as men more scrupilous, then
wise. Wherefore, to auoid all inconueniences of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
it is the best, the wisest, and the safest course, to
make no bones of pledging Healthes.</p>
            <p>To this, I answere; That I haue already manifested this
Drinking and pledging of Healthes, to bee a Sinfull, and

that this censure, and condemnation, which is,

from a Gracious, Holy, and sincere Heart, from a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

God: he hearing this, drinkes a Carrouse, or Health to God:

thou likest best: this Wine is good enough, and to good for thee:

death, whiles the Health, and Cup, are at our mouthes, or
whiles wee are wallowing in our Swinish Drunkennesse:
what hopes of Mercy, or Saluation could we haue? God
hath dealt thus with many others, as the fore-recited, and
