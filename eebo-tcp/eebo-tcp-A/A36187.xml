            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the third Moneth, 1670. being the
DAY of ELECTION
THERE.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Samuel Danforth,</hi> Paſtor of the Church of
Chriſt in <hi>Roxbury</hi> in <hi>N. E.</hi>
            </p>
            <bibl>Jer. 2. 2.</bibl>
            <q>
               <p>Go, and cry in the ears of Jeruſalem, ſaying. Thus ſaith the Lord, I
remember thee, the kindneſs of thy youth, the love of thine eſpouſals,
when thou wenteſt after me in the Wilderneſs, in a Land that was not
ſown.</p>
               <p>3. Iſrael was Holineſs unto the Lord, and the firſt-fruits of his increaſe—</p>
               <p>5. Thus ſaith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that
they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vain?</p>

               <hi>A Word ſpoken in due ſeaſon</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) how
good is it?</hi> Prov. 15. 23. And again, <hi>A word fitey
ſpoken is like Apples of gold in pictures of ſilver,</hi>
Chap. 25. 11. Such were the words of our Lord Jeſus,
who (accommodating himſelf to the way of Doctrine uſed by thoſe
Eaſtern Nations) did by Parabolical diſcourſes delight to breathe
forth the deep Myſteries of divine and heavenly Wiſdome: And
how plain, but pungent, his Sermons were, how perſpicuous, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably
profound were thoſe Oracles which flowed out of his lips
of grace, none are ignorant, who are not unacquainted with what
the holy Evangeliſts do harmoniouſly relate concerning him. No
more excellent Patern then the Lord Jeſus for the Miniſtry of the
New Teſtament to imitate: And of all the words of the Sacred
Scripture (though all are of equal Authority, as being of the
Canon, yet) none ſeem to have a more eminent immediation of
Heart-commanding virtue, then thoſe which proceeded directly out
of the mouth of the Lord himſelf; whereof this Text is one, upon
which the following Sermon is ſpent. And how much of the Spirit
of our Saviour appears therein, I need not ſay, and which perhaps
will not, at the firſt daſh, be diſcerned by the ordinary or curſory
Reader; but <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her children.</hi> The ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs,
and ſuitableneſs of this Work which is now in thine hand,
unto our preſent Wilderneſs-ſtate, will commend it ſelf unto the
judicious Chriſtian, whoſe heart doth indeed travel with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Intereſt of the Kingdome of our Lord Jeſus in theſe Ends
of the Earth: The Text carrying with it ſo much heavenly argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
being ſo <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for
Correction, for Inſtruction in righteouſneſs,</hi> as though intended
by our Lord Jeſus for ſuch a Day as that, whereon this Sermon
was Preached, (and alſo before ſuch an Auditory). Whoſe applauds
the former, will not diſapprove the latter; the Reverend Author
<pb facs="tcp:41539:3"/>
thereof obſerving therein the Saying of that Apoſtolick Man of
God (and very judicious in his Advice to younger Miniſters about
ſuch matters) his moſt Reverend Father of bleſſed Memory, Mr.
<hi>Wilſon,</hi> viz. <hi>That he delighted in ſuch a Sermon wherein the
Preacher kept cloſe unto his Text, and the proper ſcope thereof,
and wandered not from it by needleſs excurſions, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
enlargements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The loſs of <hi>firſt love,</hi> firſt to Chriſt, and ſo to the Subjects, and
Order of his Kingdome, being a Radical Diſeaſe too tremendouſly
growing upon ſo great a part of the Body of Profeſſors in this
Land, unto a <hi>Laodicean lukewarmneſs</hi> in the matters of God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the ſignal, and unparallel Experiences of the bleſſing
of God upon this people, a people ſo often ſaved by the Lord
in the way of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s meeting, and kiſſing one another
in the Mount of God; and the obſervation of that Declenſion
juſtly calling for ſo meet an Antidote and faithful Caution, as is
the enſuing Sermon (<gap reason="foreign">

and fervour thereof, by a thorough-Reformation of things in
the Matters of his Worſhip, being a ſpecial duty in this hour of
Temptation incumbent, as on the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> in their Sphere, ſo on
the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in theirs, whereby they may declare themſelves loyal to
Chriſt in their <hi>Generation-work,</hi> hath no doubt inclined the heart
of this Servant of his, to yield unto the Perſwaſions of divers,
that theſe his Meditations might be publiſhed, and ſo (through the
bleſſing of God) advance that deſired Reformation. It is not a
<hi>looſe Toleration,</hi> nor a <hi>rigid Independent-Separation,</hi> but an
<hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>brotherly Reformation</hi> which all ſhould in ſuch an
hour be endeavouring. And how perillous a Sceptical Indifferency,
or a Reed like Vacillation, much more wilful Oppoſition to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Way of the firſt Fathers and Founders of this Colony
in Matters of Religion, would be, were it onely in thoſe two Points
about <hi>the Magiſtrates Coercive Power in Matters of Religion,</hi>
(contrary to that Toleration aforeſaid) and about <hi>Communion of
Churches in Synods,</hi> &amp;c. deſcribed alſo by them, from the Word
<pb facs="tcp:41539:3"/>
of God, in the <hi>Platform of Diſcipline</hi> (contrary to that Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent-Separation

It is ſaid I remember (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 31.) that <hi>Iſrael ſerved
the Lord all the dayes of Joſhua, and all the dayes of the Elders
that out-lived Joſhua, and which had known all the works of the
Lord that he had done for Iſrael:</hi> It is much to <hi>Iſraels</hi> advantage
in the ſervice of God, when the Lord graciouſly continues thoſe, who
are acquainted with the <hi>Firſt Wayes</hi> of ſuch a people, as hath been
<hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> and with the <hi>Firſt Works</hi> of the Lord in
his laying the Foundation of that Glory which might dwell in their
Land. And it is recorded (<hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 8.) as an inlet to <hi>Iſraels</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitious

and bleſſed them, that <hi>there aro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e up a New King which knew not
Joſeph.</hi> When <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or <hi>Joſhua</hi> are unknown, or forgotten, and
the Work and Way of God in leading his people by the hand of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in their primitive Glory not underſtood, or not
minded by theſe or thoſe, how fearfully ominous to <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt it
needs be! and how neceſſitating the affectionate repetition, again,
and again, of that expoſtulatory, ſad Interrogation of our Saviour,
<hi>But what went ye out into the Wilderneſs to ſee?</hi> and ſhould
there ariſe ſuch another Generation (as is mentioned <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 11.)
after our Fathers are removed to reſt from the Warfare of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Tabernacle of God in their Generation, as ſhould <hi>not
know the Lord, nor regard the works which he hath done</hi> for
our Iſrael, what may be expected, but that (as the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
ſhews) <hi>the anger of the Lord ſhould wax hot againſt
Iſrael, and that he deliver us alſo into the hand of ſpoilers?</hi> &amp;c.
Strangers to the <hi>FIRST</hi> Intention of the people of God in their
planting in this Wilderneſs, and ſo to the Doctrine of Faith and
Order left in Print behinde them (more ſure and credible then ſome

            <p>It was the commendation of <hi>Timothy</hi> by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 10, 11.

Encomium of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt. John</hi> began
his Miniſtry, not in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor in any famous
City of <hi>Judea,</hi> but in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> i. e. in a
woody, retired and ſolitary place, thereby withdrawing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the envy and prepoſterous zeal of ſuch as were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to their old Traditions, and alſo taking the people aſide,
from the noiſe and tumult of their ſecular occaſions and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
which might have obſtructed their ready and cheerful
attendance unto his Doctrine. The Miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> at firſt

out to him Jeruſalem and all Judea, and all the region round about
Jordan,</hi> Mat. 3. 5. but after awhile, the people's fervour abated,

Wherefore our Saviour, taking occaſion from <hi>Johns</hi> Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
coming to him, after their departure, gives an excellent
<hi>Elogie</hi> and Commendation of <hi>John,</hi> to the intent that He might
ratifie and confirm his Doctrine and Adminiſtration, and revive
his Authority and Eſtimation in the hearts and conſciences of
the people.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Elogie</hi> our Saviour begins with an elegant <hi>Dialogiſm,</hi>
which the Rhetorician calleth <hi>Communication:</hi> gravely delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
with his Hearers, and ſeriouſly enquiring to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they went out into the Wilderneſs, and what expectation
drew them thither. Wherein we have, 1. <hi>The general Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and main ſubject of his Inquiſition. 2. The particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.
3. The Determination of the Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general Queſtion is, <hi>What went ye out into the Wilderneſs
to ſee?</hi> He ſaith not, Whom went ye out to <hi>hear,</hi> but what
went ye out to <hi>ſee?</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The phraſe agrees of Shows
and Stage-playes; plainly arguing that many of thoſe, who
ſeemed well-affected to <hi>John,</hi> and flock'd after him, were <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical</hi>
Hearers, <hi>Spectators</hi> rather then <hi>Auditors;</hi> they went not
to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear,</hi> but to <hi>ſee;</hi> they went to gaze upon a new and ſtrange
Spectacle.</p>
            <p>This general Queſtion being propounded, the firſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Enquiry is, whether they went to ſee <hi>A reed ſhaken with the
wind?</hi> The expreſſion is Metaphorical and Proverbial. A reed
when the ſeaſon is calm, lifts up it ſelf and ſtands upright, but
no ſooner doth the wind blow upon it, but it ſhakes and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
bends and bows down, and then gets up again: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
it yields and bows, and then lifts up it ſelf again. A notable
<hi>Emblem</hi> of light, empty and inconſtant perſons, who in times
of peace and tranquillity, give a fair and plauſible Teſtimony to
the Truth; but no ſooner do the winds of Temptation blow
upon them, and the waves of Troubles roll over them, but
they incline and yield to the prevailing Party: but when the
Tempeſt is over, they recover themſelves and aſſert the Truth
again. The meaning then of this firſt Enquiry is, Went ye out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41539:6"/>
into the Wilderneſs to ſee a light, vain and inconſtant man, one
that could confeſs and deny, and deny and confeſs the ſame
Truth? This Interrogation is to be underſtood negatively and
ironically; <hi>q. d.</hi> Surely ye went not into the deſert to behold
ſuch a ludicrous and ridiculous ſight, <hi>A man like unto a reed
ſhaken with the wind.</hi> Under the negation of the contrary le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
our Saviour ſets forth one of <hi>John</hi>'s excellencies, <hi>viz.</hi> his
eminent <hi>Conſtancy</hi> in aſſerting the Truth. The winds of various
temptations both on the right hand and on the left, blew upon
him, yet he wavered not in his teſtimony concerning Chriſt, <hi>He
confeſſed and denied not, but confeſſed</hi> the truth.</p>
            <p>Then the general Queſtion is repeated, <hi>But what went ye out
for to ſee?</hi> and a ſecond particular Enquiry made, Was it to
ſee <hi>a man clothed in ſoft raiment?</hi> This Interrogation hath
alſo the force of a negation, <hi>q. d.</hi> Surely ye went not into the
Wilderneſs to ſee a man clothed in ſilken and coſtly Apparel.
The reaſon of this is added, <hi>Behold, they that wear ſoft clothing,
are in Kings houſes.</hi> Delicate and coſtly Apparel is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ces Courts, and not in wilde Woods and Forreſts.
Under the negation of <hi>John</hi>'s affectation of Courtly delicacy,
our Saviour ſets forth another of <hi>John</hi>'s excellencies, <hi>viz.</hi> his
ſingular <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>ſobriety,</hi> who wore rough garments, and
lived on courſe and mean fare, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 4. which auſtere kinde of
life was accommodated to the place and work of his Miniſtry.
<hi>John</hi> Preached in the Wilderneſs, which was no fit place for
ſilken and ſoft raiment. His work was to prepare a people for
the Lord, by calling them off from worldly pomp and vanities,
unto repentance and mourning for ſin. His peculiar habit and
diet was ſuch as became a penitentiary Preacher.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the generall Queſtion is reiterated, <hi>But what
went ye out for to ſee?</hi> and a third particular Enquiry made,
Was it to ſee <hi>a Prophet?</hi> This Interrogation is to be underſtood
affirmatively, <hi>q. d.</hi> no doubt but it was to ſee a <hi>Prophet.</hi> Had
not <hi>John</hi> been a rare and excellent Miniſter of God, you would
never have gone out of your Cities into the deſert to have ſeen
him. Thus our Saviour ſets forth another of <hi>John</hi>'s admirable
excellencies, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office and Function. <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41539:7"/>
was not an ordinary Interpreter of the Law, much leſs a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of Jewiſh Traditions, but <hi>a Prophet,</hi> one who by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, made known the
Myſteries of Salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 76, 77.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, our Saviour determines and concludes the Queſtion,
He, whom ye went out to ſee was <hi>more then a Prophet,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, much more,</hi> or <hi>abundantly more then a Prophet.</hi>
This he confirms by his wonted Aſſeveration, <hi>Yea, I ſay unto
you,</hi> and much more then a Prophet. How was <hi>John</hi> much
more then a Prophet? <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Chriſts Herauld</hi> ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before his face, to proclaim his Coming and Kingdome,
and prepare the people for the reception of him by the Baptiſm
of Repentance, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Hence it follows <hi>ver. 11. Among all
that are born of women, there hath not riſen a greater Prophet then
John. John</hi> was greater then any of the Prophets that were
before him, not in reſpect of his perſonal graces and virtues,
(for who ſhall perſwade us that he excelled <hi>Abraham</hi> in the
grace of <hi>Faith,</hi> who was the father of the faithful, or <hi>Moſes</hi>
in <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> who was the meekeſt man on earth, or <hi>David</hi> in
<hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> who was a man after Gods own heart, or <hi>Solomon</hi>
in <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> who was the wiſeſt man that ever was or ſhall be?)
but in reſpect of the manner of his diſpenſation. All the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
foretold Chriſts Coming, his Sufferings and Glory, but
the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was his <hi>Harbinger</hi> and <hi>Forerunner,</hi> that bare the
Sword before him, Proclaimed his Preſence, and made room
for him in the hearts of the people. All the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſaw Chriſt
afar off, but the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſaw him preſent, baptized him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Types to him perſonally. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God. He
ſaw and bare record that this is the Son of God.</hi> Joh. 1. 29, 34. <hi>But
he that is leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven, is greater then John.</hi>
The leaſt Prophet in the Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> the leaſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of the Goſpel ſince Chriſt's Aſcenſion, is greater then
<hi>John;</hi> not in reſpect of the meaſure of his perſonal gifts, nor
in reſpect of the manner of his Calling, but in reſpect of the
<hi>Object</hi> of his Miniſtry, <hi>Chriſt on the Throne,</hi> having finiſhed the
work of our Redemption, and in reſpect of the <hi>degree</hi> of the
revelation of Chriſt, which is far more clear and full. <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41539:7"/>
ſhewed Chriſt in the fleſh, and pointed to him with his finger,
but the Miniſters of the Goſpel declare that he hath done and
ſuffered all things neceſſary to our Salvation, and is riſen again
and ſet down at the right hand of God.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Such as have ſometime left their pleaſant Cities and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
to enjoy the pure Worſhip of God in a Wilderneſs, are
apt in time to abate and cool in their affection thereunto: but
then the Lord calls upon them ſeriouſly and throughly to examine
themſelves, what it was that drew them into the Wilderneſs,
and to conſider that it was not the expectation of ludicrous le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
nor of Courtly pomp and delicacy, but of the free and
clear diſpenſation of the Goſpel and Kingdome of God.</q>
            <p>This Doctrine conſiſts of two diſtinct Branches; let me
open them ſeverally.</p>
            <p>Branch 1. <hi>Such as have ſometime left their pleaſant Cities and
Habitations, to enjoy the pure Worſhip of God in a Wilderneſs, are
apt in time to abate and cool in their affection thereunto.</hi> To what
purpoſe did the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> leave their Cities and Houſes
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and go forth into the Wilderneſs? was it not to <hi>hold
a Feaſt to the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>ſacrifice to the God of their fathers?</hi>
That was the onely reaſon, which they gave of their motion to
<hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 5. 1, 3. but how ſoon did they forget their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
into the Wilderneſs, and corrupt themſelves in their own
Inventions? within a few moneths after their coming out of
<hi>Egypt, they make a Calf in Horeb, and worſhip the molten Image,
and change their glory into the ſimilitude of an Ox that eateth graſs,
Pſal. 106. 19, 20. Exod.</hi> 32. 7, 8. yea for the ſpace of forty years
in the Wilderneſs, while they pretended to Sacrifice to the Lord,
they indeed worſhipped the Stars and the Hoſt of Heaven, and
together with the Lords Tabernacle, carried about with them
the Tabernacle of <hi>Moloch, Amos 5. 25, 26. Acts</hi> 7. 42, 43. And
how did they ſpend their time in the Wilderneſs, but in tempting
God, and in murmuring againſt their godly and faithful Teachers
and Rulers, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron?</hi> Pſal. 95 8. To what purpoſe
did the Children of the Captivity upon <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Proclamation,
leave their Houſes which they had built, and their Vineyards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41539:8"/>
and Oliveyards which they had planted in the Province of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and return to <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which were now become
a Wilderneſs? was it not that they might build the Houſe of
God at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſet up the Temple-worſhip? But how
ſhamefully did they neglect that great and honourable Work for
the ſpace of above forty years? They pretended that Gods
time was not come to build his Houſe, becauſe of the rubs and
obſtructions which they met with; whereas all their difficulties
and diſcouragements hindred not their building of ſtately houſes
for themſelves, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. To what purpoſe did <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> &amp;
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ll <hi>Judea,</hi> &amp; all the region round about <hi>Jordan,</hi> leave their ſeveral
Cities and Habitations, and flock into the <hi>Wilderneſs of Judea?</hi>
was it not to ſee that <hi>burning and ſhining light,</hi> which God had
raiſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> up? To hear his heavenly Doctrine, and partake of that
new Sacrament, which he adminiſtred? O how they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with his rare and excellent gifts! with his clear, lively
and powerful Miniſtry! <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven preſſed in</hi> upon
them <hi>with</hi> a holy <hi>violence, and the violent,</hi> the zealous and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
hearers of the Goſpel, <hi>took it by force,</hi> Mat. 11. 12.
Luk. 16. 16. They leapt over all diſcouragements and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whether outward, as Legal Rites and Ceremonies, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the ſenſe of their own ſin and unworthineſs, and preſſed
into the Kingdome of God, as men ruſh into a Theatre to ſee a
pleaſant Sight, or as Souldiers run into a beſieged City, to take
the Spoil thereof: but their hot fit is ſoon over, their affection
laſted but for an <hi>hour,</hi> i. e. a ſhort ſeaſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the <hi>affection</hi> of many to the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel and the pure Worſhip of God, is built upon <hi>temporary</hi>
and <hi>tranſitory</hi> grounds, as the <hi>novelty</hi> and <hi>ſtrangeneſs of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the rarerneſs and excellency of Miniſterial Gifts, the voice of
the people, the countenance of great men, and the hope of worldly
advantage.</hi> The Jews had lien in ignorance and darkneſs a long
time, being trained up under the ſuperſtitious obſervances of
their old Praditions, which were vain, empty and unprofitable
Cuſtomes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Church wanted the gift of Prophecy about
four hundred years, and therefore when <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> aroſe
like a bright and burning light, ſhining amongſt them with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41539:8"/>
gifts of the Spirit, and extraordinary ſeverity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of manners, proclaiming the Coming and Kingdome of
the Meſſias, (which had been oft promiſed and long expected)
and preſſing the people to Repentance and good works; O
how they admire and reverence him? eſpecially, when grown
popular, and countenanced by <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch.</hi> What
ſweet affections are kindled! what great expectations are
raiſed! what raviſhing joy is conceived! Hoping (as its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
to make uſe of his Authority to caſt off the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke,
and recover their Civil Liberties, Riches and Honours. But
after a little acquaintance with <hi>John,</hi> (for he was a publick
Preacher but a year and half) his Doctrine, Adminiſtrations
and Prophetical Gifts, grew common and ſtale things, and of
little eſteem with them; eſpecially, when they ſaw their carnal
hopes fruſtrated, the Rulers diſaffected, and <hi>Herods</hi> countenance
and carriage toward him changed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe <hi>Prejudices</hi> and <hi>Offences</hi> are apt to ariſe in
the hearts of many againſt the <hi>faithful Diſpenſers</hi> of the Goſpel.
The <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> came among others to the Baptiſm
of <hi>John,</hi> but when they hear his ſharp reprehenſions of their
<hi>Viperous</hi> Opinions and Practices, they nauſeate his Doctrine,
repudiate his Baptiſm, calumniate his Converſation, <hi>Luke 7. 30.
Herodiaes</hi> hath an inward grudge and a quarrel againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he found fault with her inceſtuous Marriage, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 19.
Yea, that very Age and Generation of the Jews, were like to a
company of ſurly, ſullen and froward children, whom no Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
can pleaſe, they neither dance after the Pipe, nor make la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
after the mourner. They inveigh againſt <hi>John's</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
ſaying that he was tranſported with diabolical fury, and
was an enemy to humane ſociety: and they do as much diſtaſte
and abhor <hi>Chriſt's</hi> gentleneſs and familiarity, traducing him, as
being a ſenſual and voluptuous perſon, given to intemperance
and luxury, and a Patron and Abettor of looſeneſs and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 16—19. Thus doth the frowardneſs and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs
of man, reſiſt and oppoſe the wiſdome and goodneſs
of God, who uſeth various waves and inſtruments to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
poor ſinners, but they throught their folly and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41539:9"/>
fruſtrate, diſanul and abrogate the counſel of God againſt
themſelves. The evil ſpirit that troubled <hi>Saul,</hi> was quieted
and allayed by the ſweet Melody of <hi>David</hi>'s Harp: but the
mad and outragious fury that tranſports men againſt the Truth
and the Miniſtry thereof, cannot be quieted and allayed by the
voice of the Charmers, charm they never ſo wiſely.</p>
            <p>Branch II. <hi>When men abate and cool in their affection to the
pure Worſhip of God, which they went into the Wilderneſs to enjoy,
the Lord calls upon them ſeriouſly and throughly to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
what it was that drew them into the Wilderneſs, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that it was not the expectation of ludicrous levity, nor of
Courtly pomp and delicacy, but of the free and clear diſpenſation
of the Goſpel and Kingdome of God.</hi> Our Saviour knowing that
the people had loſt their firſt love and ſingular affection to the
revelation of his grace by the Miniſtry of his Herauld <hi>John,</hi>
He is very intenſe in examining them, what expectation drew
them into the Wilderneſs: He doth not once nor twice, but
thrice propound that Queſtion, <hi>What went ye out into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
to ſee?</hi> Yea, in particular he enquires whether it were
to ſee a man that was like to <hi>a Reed ſhaken with the wind?</hi> or
whether it were to ſee <hi>a man clothed like a Courtier,</hi> or whether
it were to ſee a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and then determines the Queſtion,
concluding that it was to ſee a great and excellent Prophet, and
that had not they ſeen rare and admirable things in him, they
would never have gone out into the Wilderneſs unto him.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon is, Becauſe the ſerious conſideration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
grace and mercy of God in the free and clear diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the Goſpel and Kingdome of God, is a ſpecial means
to convince men of their folly and perverſeneſs in undervaluing
the ſame, and a ſanctified remedy to recover their affections
thereunto. The Lord foreſeeing the defection of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after
<hi>Moſes</hi> his death, commands him to write that Prophetical
Song, recorded in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. as a Teſtimony againſt them:
wherein the chief remedy, which he preſcribes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and healing of their Apoſtacy, is their calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
Gods great and ſignal love in manifeſting himſelf
to them in the Wilderneſs, in conducting them ſafely and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41539:9"/>
and giving them poſſeſſion of their promiſed Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>ver.</hi> 7—14. And when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was apoſtatized and
fallen, the Lord to convince them of their ingratitude and
folly, brings to their remembrance his deliverance of them out
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his leading them through the Wilderneſs for the
ſpace of forty years, and not onely giving them poſſeſſion of
their Enemies Land, but alſo raiſing up, even of their own
Sons, <hi>Prophets,</hi> faithful and eminent Miniſters, and of their
young men <hi>Nazarites,</hi> who being ſeparated from worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and encumbrances, were Paterns of Purity and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
all which were great and obliging mercies. Yea, the
Lord appeals to their own Conſciences, whether theſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
were not real and ſignal, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 10, 11. The Prophet
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that he might reduce the people from their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings,
cries in the ears of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with earneſtneſs and
boldneſs declaring unto them, that the Lord remembred how
well they ſtood affected towards him, when he firſt choſe them
to be his people and eſpouſed them to himſelf, how they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him in the Wilderneſs, and kept cloſe to him in their
long and weariſome paſſage through the uncultured Deſert;
how they were then conſecrated to God, and ſet apart for his
Worſhip and Service; as the firſt-fruits are wont to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred
and devoted to God: and thereupon expoſtulates
with them for their forſaking the Lord, and following after
their Idols, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 5, 6. Surely our Saviour's <hi>Dialogiſm</hi>
with his Hearers in my Text, is not a meer Rhetorical Elegancy
to adorn his Teſtimony concerning <hi>John,</hi> but a clear and ſtrong
conviction of their folly in ſlighting and deſpiſing that which
they ſometime ſo highly pretended unto, and a wholeſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
and direction how to recover their primitive affection
to his Doctrine and Adminiſtration.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> I. Of ſolemn and ſerious Enquiry to us all in this
general Aſſembly, Whether we have not in a great meaſure
forgotten our Errand into the Wilderneſs. You have ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profeſſed before God, Angels and Men, that the Cauſe of
your leaving your Country, Kindred and Fathers houſes,
and tranſporting your ſelves with your Wives, Little Ones
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41539:10"/>
and Subſtance over the vaſt Ocean into this waſte and howling
Wilderneſs, was <hi>your Liberty to walk in the Faith of the Goſpel
with all good Conſcience according to the Order of the Goſpel, and
your enjoyment of the pure Worſhip of God according to his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
without humane Mixtures and Impoſitions.</hi> Now let us
ſadly conſider whether our ancient and primitive affections to
the Lord Jeſus, his glorious Goſpel, his pure and Spiritual
Worſhip and the Order of his Houſe, remain, abide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
firm, conſtant, entire and inviolate. Our Saviour's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iteration
of this Queſtion, <hi>What went ye out into the Wilderneſs
to ſee?</hi> is no idle repetition, but a ſad conviction of our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and backwardneſs to this great duty, and a clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the weight and neceſſity thereof. It may be a grief
to us to be put upon ſuch an Inquiſition; as it is ſaid of <hi>Peter,</hi>
Joh. 21. 17. <hi>Peter was grieved, becauſe he ſaid unto him the third
time, Loveſt thou me?</hi> but the Lord knoweth that a ſtrict and
rigid examination of our hearts in this point, is no more then
neceſſary. Wherefore let us call to remembrance the former
dayes, and conſider whether <hi>it was not then better with us, then
it is now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our firſt and beſt times the Kingdome of Heaven brake in
upon us with a holy violence, and every man preſſed into it.
What mighty efficacy and power had the clear and faithful
diſpenſation of the Goſpel upon your hearts? how affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in the field of Gods Ordinances, even among the Sheaves, and
gathering up handfuls, which the Lord let fall of purpoſe for
you, and at night going home and beating out what you had
gleaned, by Meditation, Repetition, Conference, and therewith
feeding your ſelves and your families. How painful were you
in recollecting, repeating and diſcourſing of what you heard,
whetting the Word of God upon the hearts of your Children,
Servants and Neighbours? How fervent in Prayer to Almighty
God for his divine Bleſſing upon the Seed ſown, that it might
take root and fructifie? O what a reverent eſteem had you
in thoſe dayes of Chriſt's faithful Ambaſſadors, that declared
unto you the Word of Reconciliation! <hi>How beautiful</hi> were <hi>the
feet of them, that preached the Goſpel of peace, and brought the glad
tidings of Salvation!</hi> you <hi>eſteemed them highly in love for their

in your eyes; you counted your ſelves bleſſed in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of a Pious, Learned and Orthodox Miniſtry: and
though you are the bread of adverſity and drank the water of
affliction, yet you rejoyced in this, that your eyes ſaw your
Teachers, they were not removed into corners, and your ears
heard a word behinde you, ſaying, This is the way, walk ye
in it, when you turned to the right hand and when you turned
to the left, <hi>Iſa</hi> 30. 20, 21. What earneſt and ardent deſires
had you in thoſe dayes after Communion with Chriſt in the holy
Sacraments? <hi>With deſire you deſired</hi> to partake of the Seals of
the Covenant. You thought your Evidences for Heaven not
ſure not authentick, unleſs the Broad-Seals of the Kingdome
were annexed. What ſolicitude was there in thoſe dayes to
<hi>ſeek the Lord after the right Order?</hi> What ſearching of the holy
Scriptures, what Collations among your Leaders, both in their
private Meetings and publick Councils and Synods, to finde
out the Order, which Chriſt hath conſtituted and eſtabliſhed
in his Houſe? What fervent zeal was there then againſt Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Hereticks, and all manner of Heterodoxies? <hi>You could
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41539:11"/>
not bear them that were evil,</hi> but tried them that pretended to
New Light and Revelations, and found them <hi>liars.</hi> What pious
<hi>Care</hi> was there of <hi>Siſter-Churches,</hi> that thoſe that wanted
<hi>Breaſts,</hi> might be ſupplied, and that thoſe that wanted <hi>Peace,</hi>
their Diſſentions might be healed? What readineſs was there
in thoſe dayes to call for the help of Neighbour-Elders and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
in caſe of any Difference or Diviſion that could not be
healed at home? What reverence was there then of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Council, as being <hi>deciſive</hi> and iſſuing the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie?
According to that ancient Proverbial Saying, <hi>They ſhall
ſurely ask counſel at Abel, and ſo they ended the matter,</hi> 2 Sam.
20. 18. What holy Endeavours were there in thoſe dayes to
<hi>propagate</hi> Religion to your Children and Poſterity, training
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, keeping
them under the awe of government, reſtraining their enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and extravagancies; charging them to know the God of
their fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and willing
minde; and publickly aſſerting and maintaining their intereſt
in the Lord and in his holy Covenant, and zealouſly oppoſing
thoſe that denied the ſame?</p>
            <p>And then had the Churches <hi>reſt</hi> throughout the ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
and were <hi>edified: and walking in the fear of the Lord,
and in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, were multiplied.</hi> O how your
<hi>Faith</hi> grew exceedingly! you proceeded from faith to faith,
from a leſs to a greater degree and meaſure, growing up in
Him, who is our Head, and receiving abundance of grace and
of the gift of righteouſneſs, that you might reign in life by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. O how your <hi>Love and Charity</hi> towards each other
abounded! O what comfort of Love! what bowels and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies!
what affectionate care was there one of another! what a
holy Sympathy in Croſſes and Comforts, weeping with thoſe
that wept, and rejoycing with thoſe that rejoyced!</p>
            <p>But who is there left among you, that ſaw theſe Churches <hi>in
their firſt glory,</hi> and how do you ſee them <hi>now?</hi> Are they not
in your eyes in compariſon thereof, <hi>as nothing? How is the
gold become dim! how is the moſt fine gold changed!</hi> Is not the
Temper, Complexion and Countenance of the Churches
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41539:11"/>
ſtrangely altered? Doth not a careleſs, remiſs, flat, dry, cold,
dead frame of ſpirit, grow in upon us ſecretly, ſtrongly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly?
They that have Ordinances, are as though they had
none; and they that hear the Word, as though they heard it
not; and they that pray, as though they prayed not; and they
that receive Sacraments, as though they received them not;
and they that are exerciſed in the holy things, uſing them by the
by, as matters of cuſtome and ceremony, ſo as not to hinder
their eager proſecution of other things which their hearts are
ſet upon. Yea and in ſome particular Congregations amongſt
us, is there not <hi>in ſtead of a ſweet ſmell, a ſtink? and in ſtead
of a girdle, a rent? and in ſtead of a ſtomacher, a girding with
ſackcloth? and burning in ſtead of beauty?</hi> yea <hi>the Vineyard is
all overgrown with thorns, and nettles cover the face thereof, and
the ſtone wall thereof is broken down,</hi> Prov. 24 31. yea, and that
which is the moſt ſad and certain ſign of calamity approaching,
<hi>Iniquity aboundeth, and the love of many waxeth cold,</hi> Mat. 24 12.
Pride, Contention, Worldineſs, Covetouſneſs, Luxury, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
and Uncleanneſs break in like a flood upon us, and good
men grow cold in their love to God and to one another. If a
man be cold in his bed, let them lay on the more clothes, that he
may get heat: but we are like to <hi>David</hi> in his old age, <hi>they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him with clothes, but he gat no heat,</hi> 2 Sam. 1. 1. The Lord
heaps mercies, favours, bleſſings upon us, and loads us daily
with his benefits, but all his love and bounty cannot heat and
warm our hearts and affections. Well, the furnace is able to
heat and melt the coldeſt Iron: but how oft hath the Lord caſt
us into the hot furnace of Affliction and Tribulation, and we
have been ſcorched and burnt, yet not melted, but hardened
thereby, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 17. How long hath God kept us in the furnace
day after day, moneth after moneth, year after year? but all
our Afflictions, Croſſes, Trials have not been able to keep our
hearts in a warm temper.</p>
            <p>Now let me freely deliberate with you, what may be the
<hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Grounds of ſuch decayes and languiſhings</hi> in our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to, and eſtimation of that which we came into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
to enjoy? Is it becauſe <hi>there is no bread, neither is there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41539:12"/>
any water, and our ſoul loatheth this light bread?</hi> Numb. 21. 5.
<hi>Our ſoul is dried away, and there is nothing at all, beſides this
Manna, before our eyes,</hi> Numb. 11. 6. What, is Manna no
bread? Is this Angelical food, light bread, which cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie,
but ſtarves the Soul? Doth our Soul loath the bread of
Heaven? The Lord be merciful to us: The full ſoul loatheth
the honey-comb, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What then is the cauſe of our decayes and languiſhings?</hi> Is it
becauſe the Spirit of the Lord is ſtraitned and limited in the
diſpenſers of the Goſpel, and hence our joyes and comforts are
leſſened and ſhortned? <hi>O thou that art named the houſe of Jacob,
is the Spirit of the Lord ſtraitned? are thoſe his doings? Do not
my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</hi> Mic. 2. 7. Surely
it is not for want of fulneſs in the Spirit of God, that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
comforts and bleſſings from any; neither doth he delight
in threatnings and judgements, but his words both promiſe and
perform that which is good and comfortable to them that walk
uprightly. The Spirit is able to enlarge it ſelf unto the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and cheering of every man's heart; and that ſhould we
experience, did not our iniquity put a barre. 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 11, 12. O
ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged:
Ye are not ſtraitned in us, but ye are ſtraitned in your own bowels.</hi>
The Spirit of God dilateth and enlargeth the heart of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Miniſtry for the good of the people; but many times the
people are ſtraitned in their own bowels, and cannot receive
ſuch a large portion, as the Lord hath provided for them.
<hi>What then is the cauſe of our coolings, faintings and languiſhings?</hi>
The ground and principal cauſe is our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief:</hi> We believe not
the Grace and Power of God in Chriſt. Where is that lively
exerciſe of faith, which ought to be, in our attendance upon
the Lord in his holy Ordinances? Chriſt came to <hi>Nazareth</hi>
with his heart full of love and compaſſion, and his hands full
of bleſſings to beſtow upon his old Acquaintance and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
among whom he had been brought up, but their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief</hi>
reſtrained his tender mercies, and bound his Omnipotent
hands, that he could not do any great or illuſtrious Miracle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. <hi>Mat. 13. 58. Mark 6. 5, 6. He could do there no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41539:12"/>
mighty work—and he marvelled becauſe of their unbelief.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
ſtraitens the grace and power of Chriſt, and hinders the
communication of divine favours and ſpecial mercies. The
word preached profits not, when it is not mixed with faith in
them that hear it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. We may pray earneſtly, but if we
ask not in faith, how can we expect to receive any thing of the
Lord? <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>But though Unbelief be the principal, yet it is not the ſole
cauſe of our decayes and languiſhings: <hi>Inordinate worldly
Cares, predominant Luſts, and malignant Paſſions and Diſtempers</hi>
ſtifle and choak the Word, and quench our affections to the
Kingdome of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 14. The Manna was gathered early
in the morning, when the Sun waxed hot, it melted, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.
21. It was a fearful Judgement on <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that
the earth opened its mouth and ſwallowed them up. How many
Profeſſors of Religion, are ſwallowed up alive by earthly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?
Such as eſcape the <hi>Lime-pit of Phariſaical Hypocriſie,</hi>
fall into the <hi>Coal-pit of Sadducean Atheiſm and Epicuriſm.</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaiſm
and Sadduceiſm do almoſt divide the Profeſſing World
between them. Some ſplit upon the <hi>Rock</hi> of affected oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſingular Piety and Holineſs, and others are drawn
into the <hi>Whirpool,</hi> and periſh in the <hi>Gulf</hi> of Senſuality and
Luxury.</p>
            <p>If any queſtion how ſeaſonable ſuch a Diſcourſe may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch a Day, as this; let him conſider, <hi>Hag. 2. 10—14.
In the four and twentieth day of the ninth moneth, in the ſecond
year of Darius, came the word of the Lord by Haggai the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Ask now the Prieſts
concerning the law, ſaying, If one bear holy fleſh in the skirt of
his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine,
or oyl, or any meat, ſhall it be holy? And the Prieſts anſwered and
ſaid, No. Then ſaid Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead
body, touch any of theſe, ſhall it be unclean? And the Prieſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
and ſaid, It ſhall be unclean. Then anſwered Haggai and
ſaid, So is this people, and ſo is this nation before me, ſaith the
Lord; and ſo is every work of their hands, and that which they
offer there is unclean.</hi> It was an high and great day, wherein
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41539:13"/>
the Prophet ſpake theſe words, and an holy and honourable
Work, which the people were employed in. For this day they
laid the Foundation of the Lords Temple, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
the Lord ſaw it neceſſary this very day to repreſent and
declare unto them, the pollution and uncleanneſs both of their
perſons and of their holy Services, that they might be deeply
humbled before God, and carry on their preſent Work more
holily and purely. What was their uncleanneſs? Their eager
purſuit of their private Intereſts, took off their hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
from the affairs of the Houſe of God. It ſeems they
pleaſed themſelves with this, that the Altar ſtood upon its Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and Sacrifices were daily offered thereon, and the building
of the Temple was onely deferred untill a fit opportunity were
afforded, free from diſturbance and oppoſition; and having
now gained ſuch a ſeaſon, they are ready to build the Temple:
but the Lord convinceth them out of the Law, that their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
negligence was not expiated by their daily Sacrifices, but
the guilt thereof rendred both the <hi>Nation</hi> and this <hi>holy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Work,</hi> which they were about, <hi>vile and unclean</hi> in the
ſight of God. And having thus ſhewn them their ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
he encourageth them to go on with the work in hand,
the building of the Temple, promiſing them from <hi>this day</hi> to
bleſs them, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.</p>

knew what to believe. <hi>Whom ſay ye that I am? Thou art
Chriſt, the Son of the living God,</hi> Mat. 16. 15, 16. The various
heterodox Opinions of the people, ſerve as a <hi>foil</hi> or tinctured

make ſtraight paths for our feet, leſt that which is lame be

            </p>
            <p>Alas, we are feeble and impotent; our hands are withered, and

How could he ſtretch forth his hand, when it was withered,
the Blood and Spirits dried up, and the Nerves and Sinews
ſhrunk up? The Almighty Power of Chriſt accompanying his
Command, enabled the man to ſtretch forth his withered
hand, and in ſtretching it forth, reſtored it whole, like as the
other. Where the Soveraignty of Chriſt's Command takes
place in the Conſcience, there is effectual grace accompanying
it to the healing of our Spiritual Feebleneſs and Impotency,
and the enabling of us to perform the duty incumbent on
us. Though we have no might, no ſtrength, yet at Chriſt's
Command, make an eſſay. Where the word of a King is, there
is power.</p>
            <p>But alas, our Bruiſe is incurable and our Wound grievous,
there is none to repair the Breach, there is no healing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus, the great Phyſician of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the Cure. <hi>I will reſtore health unto thee, and I will heal
thee of thy wounds, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 30. 17. No caſe is to

hand. If he undertake to heal <hi>Jairus</hi> his daughter, he will
have her <hi>death</hi> eſteemed but <hi>a ſleep,</hi> in reference to his power.
<hi>She is not dead, but ſleepeth,</hi> Mat. 9. 24. When Chriſt came
to <hi>Lazarus</hi> his grave, and bade them take away the ſtone,
<hi>Martha</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord, by this time he ſtinketh; for he hath been
dead four dayes:</hi> But Chriſt anſwereth, <hi>Said I not unto thee,
that if thou wouldeſt believe, thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glory of God?
Joh.</hi> 11. 40. Let us give glory to God by believing his word, and
we ſhall have real and experimental manifeſtations of his <hi>glory</hi>
for our good and comfort.</p>
            <p>But alas, our hearts are ſadly prejudiced againſt the Means
and Inſtruments, by which we might expect that Chriſt ſhould
cure and heal us.</p>
            <p>Were not the hearts of <hi>John's Diſciples</hi> leavened with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
emulation and prejudices againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf? They
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41539:15"/>
would not own him to be the Meſſias, nor believe their
Maſter's Teſtimony concerning him: inſomuch that the Lord
ſaw it neceſſary that <hi>John</hi> ſhould decreaſe and be abaſed,
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might encreaſe and be exalted: and therefore
ſuffered <hi>Herod</hi> to ſhut up <hi>John</hi> in Priſon, and keep him in
durance about twelve moneths, and at length to cut off his
head, <hi>that ſo theſe fondlings might be weaned from their Nurſe;</hi>
and when <hi>John</hi> was dead, his Diſciples reſort to Jeſus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the calamity that befell them, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
reconciled to him, paſſing into his School, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 12.</p>
            <p>But alas, the Times are difficult and perillous; the Wind is
ſtormy, and the Sea tempeſtuous; the Veſſel heaves and ſets, and
tumbles up and down in the rough and boiſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rous waters, and is in
danger to be ſwallowed up.</p>
            <p>Well, remember that <hi>the Lord ſitteth upon the flood, yea
the Lord ſitteth King for ever,</hi> Pſal. 29. 10. <hi>His way is in
the ſea, and his path in the great waters, and his footſteps are
not known,</hi> Pſal. 77. 19. <hi>He ſtilleth the noiſe of the ſeas, the
noiſe of their waves, and the tumult of the people,</hi> Pſal. 65. 7.
He ſaith to the raging Sea, <hi>Peace, be ſtill: and the wind
ceaſeth, and there is a great calm,</hi> Mark 4. 39. Yea, he can
enable his people to tread and walk upon the waters. To
ſail and ſwim in the waters, is an eaſie matter; but to
walk upon the waters, as upon a pavement, is an act of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<hi>Peter</hi> at Chriſt's call <hi>came down out of the ſhip <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
walked on the water to go to Jeſus,</hi> Matth. 14. 29. and as
long as his Faith held, it upheld him from ſinking; when
his Faith failed, his body ſunk: but he <hi>cried to the Lord,
and he ſtretched forth his hand and caught him, and ſaid unto
him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall we do for bread? The encreaſe of the field and
the labour of the Husbandman fails.</p>
            <p>Hear Chriſt's anſwer to his Diſciples, when they were
troubled, becauſe there was but one Loaf in the ſhip. <hi>O
ye of little faith, why reaſon ye, becauſe you have no bread?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41539:16"/>
perceive ye not yet, neither underſtand? have ye your heart
yet hardened? having eyes, ſee ye not? and having ears, hear
ye not, and do ye not remember?</hi> Mark 8. 17, 18.—Mat. 16. 8, 9.
Thoſe which have had large and plentiful experience of the
grace and power of Chriſt in providing for their outward
Suſtenance, and relieving of their Neceſſities, when ordinary
and uſual Means have failed, are worthy to be ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
if afterward they grow anxiouſly careful and
ſolicitous, becauſe of the defect of outward ſupplies. In
the whole Evangelicall Hiſtory, I finde not that ever the
Lord Jeſus did ſo ſharply rebuke his Diſciples for any thing,
as for that fit and pang of Worldly care and ſolicitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Bread. Attend we our Errand, upon which Chriſt
ſent us into the Wilderneſs, and he will provide Bread
for us. Matth. 6. 33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdome of God,
and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we have many Adverſaries, and they have their ſubtile
Machinations and Contrivances, and how ſoon we may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
we know not.</p>
            <p>Our diligent Attention to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, is
a ſpecial means to check and reſtrain the rage and fury of
Adverſaries. The people's aſſiduity in attendance upon
Chriſt's Miniſtry, was the great obſtacle that hindred the
execution of the bloody Counſels of the Phariſees. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.
47, 48. <hi>He taught daily in the Temple, but the chief Prieſts
and the Scribes, and the chief of the people, ſought to deſtroy
him, and could not finde what they might do: for all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were very attentive to hear him.</hi> If the people cleave to
the Lord, to his Prophets, and to his Ordinances, it will
ſtrike ſuch a fear into the hearts of enemies, that they will
be at their wits ends, and not know what to do. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
In this way we have the promiſe of divine Protection
and Preſervation. <hi>Revel. 3. 10. Becauſe thou haſt kept the
word of my Patience, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of
Temptation, which ſhall come upon all the world, to try them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41539:16"/>
that dwell upon the earth.</hi> Let us with <hi>Mary</hi> chooſe this
for our Portion, <hi>To ſit at Chriſt's feet and hear his word;</hi>
and whoſoever complain againſt us, the Lord Jeſus will plead
for us, as he did for her, and ſay, They <hi>have choſen that
good part, which ſhall not be taken away from</hi> them, <hi>Luk. 10. 42.
AMEN.</hi>
