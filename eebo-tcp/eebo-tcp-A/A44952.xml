            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

encouraging his Abbot <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and his Monks and Clergy in the hard ſervice of this uncouth Plantation; for the advancing whereof he freely beſtirred his brain and his pen, writing to no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then fifteen or ſixteen ſeveral Biſhops and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their ayd in ſo holy a work; and affording his grave directions to his new-created Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan of <hi>England,</hi> who was zealouſly and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I know not whether more to advance the faith of Chriſt, or the honor, government, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Roman See. In the mean while the Brittiſh Biſhops ſtill held their own, not lying open to any taxation or blame but their refuſall of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Roman authority, mantaining their conſtant adherence to their own Archbiſhop, till after the Norman Conqueſt; when <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt ſubduing the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> forced them to ſtoop unto his <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much then we and our fore fathers are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to <hi>Rome</hi> we ſee, and ſhall be to blame if we acknowledge not; And why is not this abundantly enough reaſon to enſlave our faith ever ſince, to their inerrable judgment, and to pin our ſoules upon their ſleeves for ever?

of the ſuſpicion of being Antichriſt. My firſt task then is done; onely two rules lie in my way, which if I cannot remove, ſome ſtronger hand may.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58734:66"/>
life; now the State thinks it may juſtly ſay to them, <hi>Perditio tua ex te,</hi> Thy deſtruction is from thy ſelfe: but let every tub ſtand on his own bottome: As for our holy mother, grant that ſhe hath been the death of ſo many heretiques, yet this is to be ſaid for her, that ſhe hath killed them in love: love to her ſelfe, that ſhe may not be troubled with them; love to the Church, that it may not be embroyled by them; love to the world, that it may not be infected by them; love to their ſoules, that their ſufferings in the other world may be the leſſe, by how much the time of their ſinning is ſhorter. And who then can blame her for her ſo holy intention? As it is wont to be ſaid, that not the death, but the cauſe, makes the martyr; ſo the ſame rate holds in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of death; the meere killing is not that which deſerves either blame or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; all is in the cauſe that merits it, and the mind that inflicts it. <hi>Levi</hi> loſt the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the ſword, and by the ſword reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a greater bleſſing; <hi>Phineas</hi> his bloody zeale won both forbearance to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> favour to his perſon, and honour to his poſterity. In ſome caſes there goes but a paire of ſheares betwixt juſtice and rigour: And mercy and ſeverity may well lodge under the roofe of one breaſt.</p>
               <p>For example: St. <hi>Francis</hi> was a man to whom we may well attribute the title of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his time <hi>(mitiſſimus ſuper terram)</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:58734:66"/>
the mildeſt man on the earth, as might be proved by many inſtances; now this holy man was in hand to preach to a great audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory aſſembled for that purpoſe, and offering to leane his back againſt an oke to that end, he eſpied a number of Ants or Piſmires cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereabouts, in compaſſion of whom, he ſpake to the people to give way to his ſiſters the Ants a while, that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in ſafety; as he charged them alſo to do they obeyed, and he ſtrait fell to his work; but whiles he was zealouſly preaching, there comes a woman with a Cymball in her hand, ringing it ſo loud that the voice could not but be drowned with the ſound, St. <hi>Francis</hi> being much troubled with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, charged her to hold her hand, &amp; keep ſilence, ſhe ſtill goes on with her unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Muſick, he charged her the ſecond time to hold ſtill, ſhe ſtill perſiſts, the third time he required her ſilence; when that would not prevayle, he ſtraight ſayes, <hi>Tolle Diabole quod tuum eſt,</hi> Divell take thy own; Up goes the woman inſtantly, being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſnatcht into the ayre, &amp; for ought we know carryed quick to hell; Now you will perhaps think it ſtrange that ſo much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Ants ſhould ſtand together with ſo much cruelty to the woman, and will be ready to ſay <hi>Tantaene &amp;c.</hi> Is there ſo fierce choler in a Saint?

herein (they ſay) is the difference; The Romaniſts have had the care and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to quench that fire in the gleeds, which our neglect or other diverſions of authority, hath ſufferd to grow into a flame.
