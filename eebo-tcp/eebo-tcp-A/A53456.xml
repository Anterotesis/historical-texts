            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The whole Kingdom, at so brave a Prince's being their Head and Example, began to assume a new Face; and from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63273:3"/>
that affected Gravity which the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry had put on, to please the deceased King; they dedicated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to that way of Life, which was more sutable to their own <hi>Genius,</hi> as well as to their Monarch's: And by their so warmly embracing the Change, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested it was the product of their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry,</hi> for some Reasons of State, (with none of which I resolve to meddle) was married to the Widow of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arthur,</hi> whose Virtue being greater than her Beauty, had a much larger share in his Esteem, than in his Love. For that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>assion will receive no Laws but what it freely gives unto it self; and is a King over Kings, nay, some presume to say, has been even a Pope over Popes.</p>
               <p>While the Complements of Sorrow, were paying to <hi>Henry</hi> VII. our young King, attended by <hi>Howard,</hi> who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> went pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in disguise, to divert himself a Hunting in the Forest near <hi>Greenwich</hi>; but his own Apartments at <hi>Baynards</hi> Castle, were lock'd up, as if he himself had been a close Mourner in them; which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63273:3"/>
the unknowing and good natur'd of the Court, ascrib'd to an excess of Grief; for when 'tis real, it hates to have Lookers on. And believing this themselves, easily and gladly infused it into others. So that the first five years of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, gave not greater hopes to the <hi>Romans,</hi> than this supposed Mourning did to the <hi>English</hi>; so apt are good Subjects to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve well of their Princes, when they have but the least Rise to do it.</p>
               <p>But while the Ignorant were entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves, with the prospect of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities to come, our <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Howard,</hi> were entertaining themselves with the Recreations of the Countrey, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how to employ their Youth, in those enjoyments, which are most relished by it.</p>
               <p>They went to a Keepers Lodge in the Forest, who knew not who they were; but finding them Liberal to the height, they were proportionably served.</p>
               <p>The morning being fair, it invited them to hunt a Stag; the Chace was long, and the Hounds often changing; the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was dispers'd: whereby the King was as much alone in the Forest, as he was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63273:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thought to be in the Court. When he had even tyred himself with hard Riding, and by the heat of the day, came to a large Tree which oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed a Brook; the shade and the murmur, invited him to alight, and to cast himself on the Grass, where he soon fell asleep.</p>
               <p>By accident a young Gentleman, whose name was <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from his Travels, and from the High-way, hearing the Cry of the Hounds, spur'd his Horse into the Forest, to share in the Sport which Fortune seem'd to Present him. He therefore leaving himself absolutely to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, laid the Reins on the Horses neck at the meeting of three paths, that he might take his choice; the Horse took the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemost, which he had not walked in a Furlong, but his Rider saw in the same path, a young Gentleman, handsom to admiration, coming towards him, with his Arm interwoven, in that of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans, whose Beauty, Stature, Shape, and Motion, struck him with new asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
               <p>And to speak the Truth, never any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63273:4"/>
Mans admiration was paid with greater justice, than his was to that adorable Stranger; her Natural Perfections, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly owed something to the Dress she was then in, which resembled that of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> in the Chace; and the Habit of a Nymph which she then wore, discover'd so many Charms to <hi>Brandon,</hi> that his Eyes saw more captivating shapes than his Fancy could have imagin'd.</p>
               <p>While he was entertaining himself in Raptures, at the sight of so much Beauty; and with Envy, at the person who seem'd to be the Monarch of it; he saw the hunted Stag, all imbos'd, brush into the path these Lovers were in; who were so intent, in what they said and did, that they neither saw <hi>Brandon,</hi> who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; nor heard the Stag, who was galloping after them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Brandon</hi> being sensible of their danger, cryed out to them aloud twice or thrice to look to themselves; for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Beast was burnished, and it was near Rutting-time: had he been certain the fury of the Stag would have been onely employed against the Gentleman, possibly he had not given the warning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63273:5"/>
which he then did; since to have been freed from such an Enemy, by such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, was more desirable, than to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess him of such a Mistriss was hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or so much as promising.</p>
               <p>The two Lovers, at the repeated cryes of the Stranger, turned their eyes towards him, and observing he pointed earnestly at something behind them, they instantly looked that way; but the notice his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and care had given, was so far from being beneficial to them, the danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so near, as the Gentleman, to avoid it, flung himself into the Wood; and the Lady having three times shreek'd, fell all along, having no more the courage to stir out of the place, than her Lover had to stay in it.</p>
               <p>The Stag immediately began to run at her, with his Antlers; but before he did her any hurt, though he twice pierc'd her cloaths, <hi>Brandon</hi> had leap'd off of his Horse, drew his Sword, and had made the furious Beast quit the assault of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Enemy, to mind the attack of an assaulting one.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Brandon</hi> had got between the Lady and the Stag, both his and her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63273:5"/>
greatest apprehensions were past; and though she got up, with all the agility which Fear does usually inspire, yet she could not abandon her generous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; and being unable, but by her Prayers for his safety, to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, she was making those for him on her knees, and with too much ardency, to be singly the Product of Gratitude.</p>
               <p>For the service he then did her, could not be greater than her sense of it, or the merit and good meen of the person who paid it; since, in one word, he was in our Sex, what the Lady was in hers.</p>
               <p>The place in which this Accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was so near to that where our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch lay asleep, as the cryes and shreeks had awak'd him; and by their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, being guided to the place from whence they came, he saw what put him in mind of that Hero, the Noble Order of whose Knighthood, he himself was the Head; whether this remembrance, or his admiration of the beauty of the Nymph, which his heart, by some secret emotions, told him was, or sooner would be his Conqueror, did awhile make him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue moveless, I cannot tell; but as soon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63273:6"/>
as he had seen the danger her Protector was in, (for his Cloaths were all bloody) or rather to participate in the Duty and Honour of her deliverance, his Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or growing Flame, made him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately draw his Sword, and by a mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Cry, compell'd the Stag to turn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and then to run so fiercely at him; that by his too intent gazing on his new Mistriss, he had like to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the irritated Beast more fatal wounds, than had been yet given him by the Beauty he was serving.</p>
               <p>How many glorious Successes had our Nation been rob'd of, and how many stupendious Vicissitudes had the World avoided, if the fury of the Stag had not been diverted by the destiny of the King; but though the mournfullest ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, were hinder'd by his Agility, yet he could not avoid the shock, but was by the impetuosity of it, cast upon the ground, with such violence, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd him for a moment of the use of his senses.</p>
               <p>The Stag had so overshot himself, by missing what he meant should only have stopped his career, that before he could
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63273:6"/>
turn about to finish what he had in part failed of, our Monarch had recover'd spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits enough to see his danger, but not to revenge or prevent it; and just as the Stag was running at him the second time, at which the Nymph made a great shreek, <hi>Brandon</hi> generously bestrid the Kings body, and with undaunted courage, and great dexterity, defended it long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough for our Prince to get up, and with his Sword in his hand to contribute to the death of that Enemy, which had been so near acting his.</p>
               <p>The Stag was no sooner fallen, but our Monarch and <hi>Brandon</hi> forgetting to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to one another, the mutual obligations they had so recently given, and received, went hastily as it had been by Concert, to offer their Services to the Beauty to whom they had paid such sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ones, who received them both, with the Retributions which their good Meens and their Actions so abundantly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Her fear being vanished, which had too much conquer'd the vermillion of her Face, the lovely red re-assumed the Throne again, with so much lustre, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63273:7"/>
never two hearts at once, were vanquish'd with so much celerity, and so little resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as our <hi>Henry's</hi> and <hi>Brandon's</hi> were.</p>
               <p>But when together with her exterior Charms, those of her Discourses had uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves, neither of our Gallants could tell by which of the Senses, Love made the shortest approach to their Hearts.</p>
               <p>She saluted them both, with a grace peculiar to herself, and with words as inchanting as her eyes so that they both began to believe that what Poets fancied, was to them a reality, and that this was the Goddess of the Forest.</p>
               <p>But as soon as she perceiv'd <hi>Brandon</hi>'s cloaths all wet with his blood, and that some still trickled from a wound he had in the Neck; his could not run faster from the Hurt, than hers did from her Face; so that taking hastily an Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Skarf, which was cast about her shoulder, she went with it trembling and blushing to her new Adorer, and desired his permission with her hand to stop that blood, which had been so obligingly shed in her service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:63273:7"/>
                  <hi>Brandon</hi> received the charming favor on his knees, and told her, trembling and blushing more than she, <hi>I thought, Madam, the delight of being wounded in the honour of your service, was incapable of any acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but this unmeritable condescention of yours, has convinced me of that error; and nothing could diminish my joy, but that 'tis rais'd by your trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, Madam,</hi> (he continued) <hi>how could the person, whom you blest with such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of your favor, before your danger, abandon you in it? Ah! how unworthy was he of those felicities I saw you confer on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These last words he accompanied with a sigh, and she heard them with a smile; which our young Lover knew not how to interpret.</p>
               <p>But our Monarch more sensibly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by this kindness of his new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queress to his Rival, than he had been by the Stag, leaning against a Tree, and fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arms one within another, by some sighs, which reached the Ladies ear, made her turn hastily towards him, and then to ask him, <hi>Whether he had also received any wound, which needed her assistance?</hi>

                  <hi>Brandon</hi> immediately paid him those respects which his being of the Royal Blood, were justly due unto him; and with all the civility imaginable, beg'd his

pardon, for what his ignorance of his quality had made him guilty of, and could only apologize for; protesting he so highly reverenced every one of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred blood of his Prince, that his own to the last drop of it, should be joyfully shed in the duty of their service.</p>
               <p>Our Prince repaid his Civility with fresh Embraces, and there began that friendship which our most celebrated Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians have Recorded, and with Justice too, since it never ended but with their Lives.</p>

                     <hi>Izabella,</hi> and our Monarch, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd what he asked, he thus continued:</p>
                  <p>My Father having spent much of his time and blood in our late sad and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Wars, abhorring the necessary cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties in them, and loathing the vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of a Court-life, retired for ever to a Castle of his own in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> where he determined to bury himself alive. But one day being drawn to a Kinsmans Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by the importunity of a bosome friend, he saw at it, a Gentlewoman, so handsom, that what all the beauties of <hi>England</hi> (which doubtless is their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Sphere) could not perform on him in twenty years, she did in a moment; for, <hi>Madam,</hi> 'tis the fate of some Families, to fall in Love at first sight.</p>
                  <p>My Father passionately inquired of his Friend if he knew her, and being assured he did, and that if she were not his nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63273:11"/>
he knew no person in the World, whose virtue and softness of humor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded hers; but withall told him, the calamities of the Civil Wars had so ruin'd her Parents fortune, as they were unable to give her a Portion, in the least answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her birth and merit.</p>
                  <p>My Father, who knew that happiness has its solid Throne only in the mind, and that wealth is an excess, which may often be more dangerous than useful, courted this Lady, and having found the character his Friend had given him of her, exactly true, at last married her, from that Union, my elder Brother and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, whose Educations were such, that if we were no great Proficients in our Studies and Exercises, it was our own faults: possibly never any Friendship was greater, than that, between my Brother and I; we seem'd to have but one Soul, which actuated both our Bodies; and we were dearer to each other, by the tyes of Friendship, than by those of Blood.</p>
                  <p>We were never admitted to see a Court or an Army; and my Father who had taken a Surfet of both, gave our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier years such ill impressions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63273:12"/>
that we joyfully dedicated the hours of our vacancy to no other pleasures, but those of Hunting and Hawking, and such harmless divertisements of a Countrey life.</p>
                  <p>In these innocent employments, my Brother attain'd to his twentieth, and I to my nineteenth year; but as if Fortune had envied us this little tranquility, a near Friend of my Mothers dyed, and left to her care her onely Daughter, which Legacy she sent her at the last gasp, with the little she had saved out of the general shipwrack, occasion'd by the bloody contentions of the two Roses.</p>
                  <p>My Mother manifested the esteem she had of the dead, by her care of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor could that generosity be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

so soon vanquish'd: for I thought then, nothing could be so perfect; and should have still continued in that belief, had not my sight this day convinc'd me of my Error.</p>
                  <p>My Brother never told me of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, neither did I acquaint him with mine; which was the first and onely Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret we kept in reserve from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>I will not, <hi>Madam,</hi> so much misimploy your patience, as to tell you all the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I paid the charming <hi>Victoria</hi>; nor all the arts and assiduities I used to make them acceptable to her; neither will I particularize my Brothers part, in the like design. 'Tis enough you know, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter above one years languishing, I had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this ill-natur'd consolation, that I judged my Brother was as unsuccessful as I; so that the reservedness, and severity of <hi>Victoria</hi>'s carriage, made me often in despair and anger, resolve to abandon so hopeless a Love; nay, I was in my heart almost despising my Brother, for his not assuming the like resolution.</p>
                  <p>But alas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I so strongly renew'd my Chains, as a Pennance, for having intended to break them, that I had merited <hi>Victoria</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, had she but known I lov'd her so much then, and had lov'd her no more formerly.</p>
                  <p>But as my passion increast, I thought her coldness did; and in all her deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both to my Brother and me, she manifested such an indifferency, that I could not be more troubled at it, than I was pleas'd to observe my Friend wore the same Livery.</p>
                  <p>While things were in this posture, one morning he went out very early a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my Page, who was fond of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, very officiously waked me, to give me notice of it; hoping I would be a sharer in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently he, who usually attended me.</p>
                  <p>This being the first time he had design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to separate me from any of his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as businesses (except that great one of his Love) I resolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and learn the cause, but after having for some hours fruitlesly inquired after him, and neither hearing of him, nor the cry of the Hounds, I returned home

melancholy, and weary; and the Servant which waited on me in my Chamber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the way, I cast my self on a Bed with a Canopy which was in a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set within the drawing Room, endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by a little sleep to abate my being ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in body, and troubled in mind.</p>
                  <p>I had not slept half an hour, but I was awakened by the noise of one walking in the same Room. The curtains of the Canopy being not close shut, I saw through the opening, that it was the fair <hi>Victoria.</hi>

                  <p>My Brother promis't her hastily an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act obedience; then having again kist and embrac'd her, went into the outward Chamber, from whence he aloud order'd the Servant to call his Page to him; and as soon as the Coast was clear, <hi>Victoria</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so went hastily away.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Madam,</hi> I humbly beg you, (continued <hi>Brandon</hi>) what my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, at what I had heard and seen; for I confess I am not able to relate it: Amazement, Jealousie, and Anger, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fury, did so torment me by turns, nay, sometimes all at once, that I knew as little what was fit to do, as what was fit not to be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63273:16"/>Sometimes I resolved to make Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Nature yield to my resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in a Duel killing my Brother, convince <hi>Victoria,</hi> she had made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just choice; but soon that angry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve resign'd it self to the Sacred names of Brother and Friend.</p>
                  <p>Neither could I in calmer thoughts with any shadow of Justice condemn him for having done to me, but what I doubt I should have done to him, had my success been equal to his.</p>
                  <p>My Rage finding no fit object on my Brother to discharge it self, I determin'd to be revenged on her, and by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately detecting her sin to my Mother, get her banisht with ignominy out of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, where her too much kindness to one of it, was an affront to all the rest.</p>
                  <p>But then my Love, or rather Pity, to ruine what I had so lately ador'd, shook that resolution, and in a few moments afterwards intirely conquer'd it. So that finding no single object on which to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In these Disorders, <unclear>locking</unclear> up the Chamber door, and walking many turns in it, I began to grow more moderate, and then my evil <hi>Genius</hi> did let me see, that what I had consider'd as my highest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, was what I might more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly esteem the contrary; since if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my Brother in the assignation agreed on between <hi>Victoria</hi> and him, which was no difficult work to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, I should both satisfie my Revenge, and my Love.</p>
                  <p>When this fatal Project was admitted, Alas! with what Raptures was it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; and all the dictates of Remorse, for betraying my Mistriss, my Friend, and my Brother, how chearfully were they sacrific'd to the imagined felicities which were to attend the Action.</p>

                  <p>At last she appeared, but as soon as she saw him, her face was cover'd with blushes; but his, at the sight of her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came pale as Death; and such a shaking seized on all his limbs, as it too evidently discover'd the storm in his Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Victoria,</hi> either ashamed to look on him, who she believ'd that night had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled her greatest treasure; or else mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her steps, looked not on him, till she was within seven or eight of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; but then casting a look towards him as full of modesty as fire, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none could hear her, she told him, <hi>I hope, Sir, you are now satisfied</hi>—He, without giving her leave to finish what she had begun, reply'd, in a furious tone, <hi>Yes, I am satisfied;—But 'tis, That you are the falsest of Women; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63273:18"/>The poor <hi>Victoria,</hi> at so amazing an usage, became white as Innocence, and gave no sign that she was alive, but by an universal trembling.</p>
                  <p>The fright I was in, lest she should fall down those steps, on which her astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had seized her, made me run out of my concealment, and so timely, that I catch'd her in my Arms just as her Senses had forsaken her; whereby I prevented that Death by her fall on the pavement, which her grief made her desire.</p>
                  <p>All the Servants in the Family, who were not then employ'd in the necessary functions of it, were gone to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and so were my Father and Mother, whereby missing of all help, I carried <hi>Victoria</hi> into my Chamber, and there by bowing her body, rubbing her temples, and casting water on her face, I brought her at last out of her fainting, and then conjur'd her to tell me the cause of it.</p>
                  <p>She onely answer'd me with a deep sigh; at which I smil'd, and acquainted her I had heard all that had past between her and my Brother.</p>
                  <p>She knew I had too much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for her, not to be sensible of her
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63273:19"/>
then condition, and therefore having awhile reflected on my smiling, on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the cast her eyes towards me, and fixing them stedfastly on me, she told me; <hi>I conjure you,</hi> Brandon, <hi>to tell me, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, where you lay last night.</hi> I instantly answer'd, <hi>With the greatest Beauty of the World</hi>; and then told her, how I came to over-hear her Assignation with my Brother, and had by my Art, repair'd the misery of her unkindness.</p>
                  <p>All the while I was making that short Narrative, I saw her colour come and go, her heart ready to force a passage through her breast, and in so many other Agonies, that had she actually made me as unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as she once intended, the sight of her then suffering would have been too severe a revenge: But alas! when I came to the end of my information, she fetch'd a hideous skreem, and fell dead on the Bed, to which at first I had carried her.</p>
                  <p>I cannot tell you, <hi>Madam,</hi> which of my Griefs were greater; to see her in that condition, or to find her having made me happy against her will, had reduced her to it: however, I endeavour'd all I could to restore her to her Senses, which at
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63273:19"/>
length I effected; but she had no sooner open'd her eyes, and saw her self in my Arms, then she relaps'd, and so long, and so dangerously, that when I fear'd I could not recover her from Death, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to accompany her in it.</p>
                  <p>But when I began to despair of her return, she came to herself again, and while I was on my knees celebrating my joyes for it, and renewing my passionate request, to know what was the occasion of that sorrow, which was so dangerous to her and me; she strove to go away, but not being strong enough to do it, she fell again upon the Bed, and told me, in an Accent too moving to be imitated, <hi>Ah</hi> Brandon, <hi>you have ruin'd your Brother, and me, and your self, if at least the friendship you have hitherto paid him, be not a fiction; for I am your Brothers wife, and this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>—.</p>
                  <p>A crowd of sighs, and a torrent of tears, stop'd the passage of her words; but alas! what she had said, reduced me to a condition as worthy of pity as hers was; which as soon as she observ'd, it heightned her own afflictions, so that she employ'd a quarter of an hour, and with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63273:20"/>
interrupted words, in telling me, <hi>That my Brothers Hunting the day before, was but a pretence to go the earlier abroad, to meet her with a Priest, by appointment in a Grove, where they had been married.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the end of this Relation, her Woman, who had mist her at the Chappel, and had in vain sought her over all the House, came to inquire of me, if I could tell her where she was; there finding her in a fainting condition, by her help, we brought <hi>Victoria</hi> to her own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and her Distemper every moment increasing; she took her Bed, and I reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>My Father and Mother having miss'd her at their Devotions, concluded some indisposition was the cause of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to visit her, and finding she was in a high Fever, they went hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Closets, to write for two of the eminentest Physitians in the Countrey. I took that opportunity to steal into her Chamber, kneel'd by her Beds-side and in more tears and sighs, than words, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her of the vastness of my grief, and then advised her to send immediately for my Brother, and to tell him, <hi>She had lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63273:20"/>
him out of her Chamber one night, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to try his temper; but since she found he resented that seeming unkindness so highly, she beg'd his pardon for it, was really sorry she had committed that fault, and would endeavour to repair it by all the actions of her Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the best counsel I could then present her; and asking her, <hi>Whether she approved it, and if it were her pleasure I should send my Brother to wait on her?</hi> She onely told me with a sigh, <hi>Do what you will.</hi> Then turning from me, she fell a weeping in such excess, that I thought she would be drown'd in her own tears.</p>
                  <p>As soon as I heard my Mother coming in at one door, I slip'd out at the other, and went to seek my Brother; for I was confident if he went not to visit her, it would both increase her danger, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly discover the cause of it.</p>
                  <p>At last I found him in a Grove of the Park, lying his full length, near a Brook, and in troubles almost as great as mine. I told him <hi>Victoria</hi> was fallen into a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fever; and by the fierceness of the beginning, my Mother more than feared the End would be fatal, and therefore
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63273:21"/>
had sent two Expresses for the Doctors. That I came then from waiting on her, but I had found her so alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r'd, as the change had amazed me; since I thought I saw the image of Death in that face, which till then, had been all life. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in a whisper, she had desired me to send him speedily to her, and that I would so order it, as to entertain my Mother, while she herself was speaking alone to him; since she had something on her heart to say, that till she had told him and received his answer on it, she should be in torments.</p>
                  <p>At first my Brother seem'd unmov'd at her danger, and request; but I, at length, prevail'd with him to go, where we found my Mother all in tears, the violence of <hi>Victoria</hi>'s Fever, so greedily increasing on her.</p>
                  <p>The vastness of my Mothers affliction, was no ill preparative, to melt my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers heart; when he came to <hi>Victoria</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, she resign'd to him her place, and I, to allow them the freer liberty to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, drew her to a Window under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of seeing from thence, if either of the Doctors were coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:63273:21"/>I never could learn what in particular past between them, but I saw him at last kneel down by her, (for my eyes were still turned that way) and laying his lips to her burning hand, seem'd thereby to seal her Pardon.</p>
                  <p>But my Mother, who apprehended such Visits might be hurtful to the fair Patient, ordered us both to retire.</p>
                  <p>I cannot better parallel his Grief, than by telling you, <hi>Madam,</hi> it was equal to his late Fury; and as we walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the Park, he discovered to me, how the day before he was secretly married to <hi>Victoria</hi>; for he knew he could never have obtain'd my Fathers consent to do it, since her Beauty and Virtue was all her Portion. He further told me with groans, that he trembled to think, 'twas his Brutishness, had reduc'd her to the deplorable state she was then in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me afterwards of their Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, her failing, and his resentments at it, (a Relation which alas I knew better than himself;) That though he more than feared, 'twas his outragious Passion, had flung her into the Fever; yet she could not be brought to acknowledge to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63273:22"/>
him, it had done so: But she had beg'd his forgiveness for deluding him, in such moving Words, Actions and Tears, as those confest to him that Truth, which he could not extort from her Mouth; That he had beg'd her Pardon on his knees, for his Crime, which she had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with a tenderness so charming, that her forgiving him in such a manner, had wounded him as deeply, as his Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had her.</p>
                  <p>This Account he gave me, in so much affliction and disorder that it brought on accession to my griefs, which, till then, I believ'd were uncapable of any.</p>
                  <p>The share which he thought I bore in his misery, heightned his friendship, and made him beg of me a thousand Pardons, that he had till then concealed his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage from me, which was the first, and should be the last offence he would be guilty of, but that now my lively sense of his grief had extorted from him, that Confession which else he would not have made: for he fear'd when ever his father knew it, if he should also learn I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, 'twould involve me in his disgrace, the apprehension of which

                  <p>Soon after, we saw one of the Doctor Gallop by us; we hastily followed him to learn his judgment of <hi>Victoria</hi>'s con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In brief, <hi>Madam,</hi> the Physitian awhile felt her Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> (<hi>Brandon</hi> continued) I perceive your Generosity and Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, has made you too large a sharer in poor <hi>Victoria</hi>'s sufferings; I shall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore augment it, by particularizing all the fatal passages of this Story.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63273:23"/>
Kindness and Assiduities, all my Brothers Pardons and Tears, and all my Groans and Submissions, could not in the least prevail with <hi>Victoria</hi> to live; her scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Virtue, made her judge my Clinic was her own; and having lay'n one night in my Arms, she concluded herself unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ever after to lie in my Brothers; and that she was only fit for those of death: To which she hastened with such earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and resolution, that those who knew not the cause, admired at the action; and I who knew it, deplored it with such excess, that the effect of my sin, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved singly the product of my good Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Ninth day of her Sickness, was the last of her Life; and had like to have been of my Brothers and mine: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she locked herself up with her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, and after she had taken an eternal Farewell of my unconsolable Father and Mother, she gave one half hour of her hasty time to me, and one full hour to my poor Brother; but what she said to him to mitigate his sorrows, heighten'd them, since to lose for ever so much Beauty, Virtue, and Goodness, was above the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63273:23"/>
power of Consolation; and from the hour of her death, he courted his own.</p>
                  <p>What she said to me, was consonant to her admirable Virtue; and made me more in love with her Mind, than I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The excellency of her Admonitions, the Generosity with which she pardon'd me, the unexpressible sorrow for her death, and my own fatal guilt which had caused it, so powerfully operated on me, that retiring from her more dead than alive, I went trembling to my own Chamber, where having spent an hour in all the Agonies which those Reflections could cast a despairing Soul into, I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to forsake for ever my Fathers house, and immediately with some Jewels which my Father had given my Mother, and she had given me, (for I was her Favorite) I stole the back way to the Stables, took one of my best Horses, and Rid towards <hi>Dover</hi>; but so overwhelm'd with grief and trouble, as I knew not what I did.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Dover</hi> I past the Channel into <hi>France,</hi> and for two years last past, I served sometimes in the Armies of King

                     <hi>Francis</hi> the Fifth, and sometimes in those of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, where being careless of my life, or rather weary of it, and desirous to lose it, I perform'd some such bold Actions, as I wanted not the offers of great Preferments from those famous Princes. But my unconsolable griefs, which made me do what they thought merited their Favors, made me also decline all those their Generosities offer'd me. And I had still liv'd that wretched and vagabond life, had not a young Gentleman of <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> who had been my Neighbor there, arrived three weeks since at the <hi>French</hi> Army, to learn the Art of War, by whom I was assured, That the day of my flight from my Fathers, the fair <hi>Victoria</hi> dyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That my Brother having rather languished, than outlived her ten days followed her; And that by his repeated desires, he was buried in the same Grave with her, for at his death, he had acknowledged she had been his Wife; That my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the loss of her, him, and in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if not in effect, of me also, so lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished away, that they were likewise buried together in one Monument; so that

by this Gentlemans importunities, and his telling me, that one, afar off related to our Family, was suing for my Estate, and was like to carry it, I was persuaded to return though without the least hope of relishing Life.

                  <p>The King and <hi>Izabella</hi> blush at these last words, and partly to divert <hi>Brandon</hi> from considering it, and also to pay the just debt of Sorrow and Pity due to his Story, by turns acknowledg'd he had but too much made good what at first he had said of the greatness of his Misfortune.</p>

                     <hi>Howard</hi> had no sooner cast his eyes on the fair <hi>Izabella,</hi> and on <hi>Brandon,</hi> but he admired them both; and they made him their returns in the same Coin for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less never four persons were more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Name of Perfect than those were, whom Fortune had by Accident brought together that morning.</p>
                  <p>Soon after they perceiv'd a Chariot coming hastily towards them, attended by six Pages and Footmen, in magnificent Liveries; and in it, only one Lady, whose eyes had attacked our three new Lovers hearts, had not <hi>Izabella</hi> prepossest the places.</p>
                  <p>This Beauty, as soon as she came to them, alighted out of her Chariot, and without so much as taking notice of our three Gallants, ran with open Arms to embrace and kiss <hi>Izabella,</hi> which she did a hundred times; and <hi>Izabella</hi> did the like to her: And then told her Charming Friend, the great obligation she had to her two Deliverers; who immediately in words and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as it renewed their former imaginations, of the Forest being inhabited by <hi>Diana,</hi> and her Nymphs.</p>
                  <p>The Lady newly arrived, whose name was <hi>Vtresia,</hi> came to seek <hi>Izabella</hi> in a Chariot, the heat of the day, having tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned walking into a trouble; to whom she whisper'd something, at which they both smil'd, and then continued their walk towards <hi>Charleton,</hi> which was not a Furlong off.</p>
                  <p>The Chariot being too little to carry all five, the three Captives often beg'd of the Ladies that they would go into it, and allow them the honour to walk by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the heat began to grow importunate, which yet the Ladies chose to suffer, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be guilty of such incivility.</p>
                  <p>They therefore all five walked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till they came to the Gate, where such a crowd of Beauties came to meet <hi>Izabella,</hi> and to congratulate her Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, (which one of the Pages had run to inform them of) that our Monarch was ravished, to see he had so many char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Beauties his Subjects, and deplor'd the severities of his Fathers Reign, which had hinder'd them from frequenting his Court.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:63273:26"/>They all invited our Prince, <hi>Howard,</hi> and <hi>Brandon,</hi> to refresh themselves in the Palace; but our <hi>Henry</hi> apprehending to be discover'd, despairing also before so many Witnesses, to entertain <hi>Izabella</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and longing to entertain his own thoughts, he took his leave of them, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and obtaining their permissions to wait on them again: when on a sudden, <hi>Brandon</hi> turned pale, and fell into a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fit, but so happily for him, that <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> who first perceiv'd it, to prevent his falling on the Pavement, supported him in her Arms, till others ran to his assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; so that even his seeming want of Life, flung him into one of the happiest postures of it. Our King, instead of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying, envied him, and began to dread a Rival, whose Misfortunes contributed to his Felicity.</p>
                  <p>The obliging <hi>Izabella,</hi> being sensible that his loss of blood, and his attending on her a-foot, in the great heat, had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to that condition, judged her self tyed to repair the Ill which she had been the occasion of, and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and obtained of the fair <hi>Vtresi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the mean while the King having his Horse brought him by <hi>Howard</hi>'s Groom, did with his Master Gallop to the Lodge, entertaining himself with the various Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that morning had produc'd, and at least beginning to find, though he were the Monarch of <hi>England,</hi> yet he carried in his heart a greater Sovereign than himself.</p>

               <p>As soon as his Physitian had told the company he might be seen, he received the Visits of all those Beauties; and she in whose service he was hurt, was the most assiduous about him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but though her being so, proceeded chiefly from her gratitude, and good nature, yet he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

'twas from a more obliging cause; so apt are Lovers to entertain what they most desire.</p>
               <p>Yet the great Familiarities he had seen betwixt <hi>Izabella,</hi> and the handsom Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman she was walking with, before her late Adventure, gave him no little alarm; which was much heightened, by his never being able to learn from her, what, or who he was though he often and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly prest it: yet still <hi>Brandon</hi> flatter'd himself with a belief, that so mean an action of his Rivals, would ruine him in his Mistrisses favour; and when he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the remembrance how partial Love is, and how it will overlook all faults in those to whom it is once given, yet he would again console himself with the belief, that who was kind to a Coward, might be soon induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so, to a Man of Valor.</p>
               <p>While he recover'd, by the help of such pleasing hopes, the Comedy was Acted, and soon after most of the Assembly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed themselves; but <hi>Izabella</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with <hi>Vtresia,</hi> who was newly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Lord so young, as he was sent to Travel; and had committed the care of

his House, his Lady, and his Estate, to his Sister, some seven years elder than he, her Name was <hi>Maria</hi>: and though she was handsom, yet not so to the degree she desired; whereby not being overlikely to be cryed up for a Beauty, she resolv'd to be esteem'd for her Judgment and Discretion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maria</hi> therefore to make her Sister-in-law pass the time of her young Brothers absence the least unpleasantly that she could, had got all the good company of the Neighborhood to that meeting, and by many other divertisements, endeavor'd to do therein what she had design'd.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And though <hi>Brandon</hi> chiefly made his Addresses to <hi>Izabella,</hi> yet he could not but observe in <hi>Vtresia</hi>'s looks, something which seem'd to tell him, she was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than civil.</p>
               <p>Nay, at last, <hi>Maria</hi> herself became so diligent about him, as it appear'd rather the effect of Kindness, than Care, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Brandon</hi> found he had most favour

               <p>He thought this was a fit opportunity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to learn from her, what <hi>Izabella</hi> had still deny'd him, and therefore earnestly beg'd her, <hi>to know who the Gentleman was, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At the close of this warning, <hi>Izabella</hi> and <hi>Maria</hi> having ended their Walk, came to visit our Gallant; and <hi>Vtresia</hi> perceiving they were surpriz'd, to find her alone with him, told them in some confusion how it had hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>While our <hi>Henry</hi> was thus eternally deprived of what some squeemish Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are fondest of, he was so happy as to be ignorant of his misfortune, and was with <hi>Howard</hi> in the Lodge, hourly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting how to obtain, what actually he had lost; but he had made a Confident of his Rival: for our young <hi>Norfolk,</hi> was shot as deeply as his Prince; and was as intently concerned to Cure his own wound, as his Monarch to Cure his. Yet

he had the Art to disguise his own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to appear so warmly concern'd for his Masters, as it planted him in a higher station in his favor.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Nor could he forget the Caresses he saw her bestow on her Gallant in the Forest, whose Name it was impossible for him to learn, from whence he judg'd her Constancy was not as great as her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that meerly her Duty to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having made her marry another, she would satisfie herself, after she had pleas'd him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brandon</hi> also was not so much a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his own merit, as to despair that she who could be anothers besides her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, might be prevail'd with to love a third; for in such cases, the appetite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases with the eating.</p>
               <p>While he fed his Hopes with this Diet, he mended so visibly, as his two Lovers concluded, his resentments had presented him with his Cure; whereby believing

               <p>She also was loth to lose our young <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s frequent Presents, which were considerable as being at a Kings expence, and distributed by a prosperous Lover; and she would often also mind herself, that Nature had not given her two Hands, to become rich but with one.</p>
               <p>To give her her due, she was more troubled with the fear, that <hi>Howard</hi> should find she did betray him, than she was to do it.</p>
               <p>Nor did <hi>Leticia</hi> find this so difficult an undertaking, as her first had been, since to seduce a chaste Wife, for a Subject, was a more hard task, than after she had made her flexible to the Duke, to make her become the like to his King.</p>
               <p>Towards the better effecting thereof, she artificially contrived opportunities for our Monarch to see her a walking; but

               <p>The name of being a Mistress (and the first) to a brave and young Monarch; the safety, as well as benefit of such a Lover; the felicity of a change from a lower Gallant to the highest, were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly the Matinades and Vespers, of the Confident, to her Lady, as <hi>Howard</hi> seem'd at last, to have no Title but possession; which though it be much in War, yet is little in Love, where the whole tenure is at will and pleasure; whereby the way was so well smoothed for our <hi>Henry,</hi> as the greatest difficulty was to find a fit opportunity, that what had been conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon by Mediators, might be ratifi'd by the Principals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leticia,</hi> at length, lighted on this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Birth-day being

               <p>The King, impatient to gaze on that Beauty he was so soon to possess, danced awhile among the Masqueraders, while <hi>Denny</hi> stood in a retir'd place, where the Butlers furnisht, those of them with Wine who were thirsty with the Exercise.

               <p>
                  <hi>Leticia</hi> had agreed, when the King (who passed for one of the ordinary Masqueraders) should step aside, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to drink, <hi>Denny</hi> should cast on him his Cloak, and leap into his place of the

               <p>Our Monarch having therefore awhile danced, the sooner to view his Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress, and fancying he might more solidly please himself with the felicities to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, suddenly leap'd to the retired place where <hi>Denny</hi> stood, who immediately casting his long Cloak on the King, jumpt himself in among the Dancers, and our <hi>Henry,</hi> by the ready guidance of <hi>Leticia,</hi> was brought by a Back-stairs into her Chamber, and from thence into her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, where all the preparatives for his reception, were most tempting and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Izabella</hi>'s flames being rais'd to the last degree, by these Actions, told him, with all the softnesses of yielding Love, <hi>Alas</hi> Horatio, <hi>do not I venture more than you in the discovery; I shall lose not only my life, but what is of much more value, the unrival'd kindness of my King, while you hazard you know not what; but by not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing, you certainly lose the opportunity of making your life happy and considerable: For I who ingross a Monarchs Love, can make him heap on you, all those other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, which I cannot present you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>But,</hi> said <hi>Izabella,</hi> interrupting herself, <hi>Why do I in the Cause of Love, mention any thing but Love? And he who needs being Courted to accept of mine, is but too unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But yet</hi> Horatio, <hi>let not the apprehension of danger deter you; for if your flame equals mine, I can contrive, at once, your happiness, and your security: for the King of late, but rarely, stayes with me all the night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> Horatio reply'd, <hi>yet should he visit you any of those nights you destine to my felicity</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Never apprehend it,</hi> said <hi>Izabella</hi> hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I need but let him know I am indispos'd, and therefore would take some rest; and he is grown too respectful to deny it me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then, Madam,</hi> said <hi>Horatio,</hi> making hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

King, what could onely make me happy; I resolv'd therefore to mourn away my Life, and the sooner and the more pleasingly to end it, I elected daily to gaze on those Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which could onely present me that cure: for I could not so much as hope that you, who so deservedly possess a mighty Monarchs heart, could vouchsafe to think of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh</hi> Horatio, said <hi>Izabella, how little art thou vers'd in the mighty authority of Love; King and Subject, are but Names of Art, but Love is the character of Nature, and therefore is indelible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All our Sex are generally condemn'd to Ambition, but they are inspir'd with Love; I therefore sacrifice to both those Deities: the King has the oblations, extorted to the first; but 'tis</hi> Horatio <hi>has those, which I willingly pay to the last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The disguis'd Page, seemingly ravish'd with these charming expressions, fell on his knees, as some evidence of it; and having embraced hers, and kist her feet, sealed the Contract, which <hi>Izabella</hi> hasten'd to conclude, seeing <hi>Leticia</hi> from the Window Landing at the Water stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:63273:54"/>They therefore agreed that the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Night should compleat their joyes; and having appointed the precise Hour, that <hi>Horatio</hi> should steal into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Izabella</hi> undertook to order the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair so, as by pretending a great Pain in her Head, she would early take leave of our Monarch, and be no more in the Evening interrupted with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Izabella,</hi> by her fresh embraces and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and by a Present of Jewels, gave him new earnest of her performance, then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist him, and fell a reading a Romance, in which employment the deluded <hi>Leti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> found her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horatio</hi> the same moment ran to <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> and informed him of his Victory; the Assignation, and all the particulars of both; who being transported, with the joy of it, went immediately to the King, whom he found alone in his Cabinet, and in whose sight he assumed so much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, as our <hi>Henry</hi> both took notice of it, and prest him to tell and cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howard</hi> only sigh'd, and cast down his eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:63273:55"/>This Procedure augmented the Kings curiosity, and the stricter silence his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite kept, the more his Master urg'd him to break it.</p>
               <p>At length, seeming vanquisht by his reiterated commands, he told him, <hi>Sir, I owe all I have, and all I hope, to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; and to merit that blessing, is what I am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition as much as to possess it: I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had a fierce Conflict within my self, for I fear I am reduced to the miserable choice, of either continuing in your esteem by what will even in my own judgment ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me unworthy of it, or to lose it, by what would give me some title to continue it: But since you so positively command me to speak, I have elected the latter; For 'tis more consonant to my duty, as well as incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be ruin'd rather, than merit to be so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, at this Introduction, was startled; but impatient, to know what was the cause of it, he listen'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interrupting him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howard</hi> having paus'd awhile, to make the Discovery appear the more natural and effectual too, thus continued:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:63273:55"/>
                  <hi>I believe, Sir, you may not have forgot how on several occasions I presum'd to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close some apprehensions I had, that the fair</hi> Izabella, <hi>was more conquer'd by your Title, than by the Passion she ought to have paid you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was not so unwise or rude, as to speak on so unwelcome a Subject, without some belief I had ground for it; since I knew nothing was more tender to a magnanimous Prince, than not to have a perfect return of Love from her, whom he had honour'd with his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But withall I was not ignorant, nothing could be more sensible to a good Subject, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to one whom his King had blest with the highest characters of his Favor, than to see him, pardon the expression, Sir, prostitute his affection to a Mistriss, who received not the happiness with all the impressions of joy, gratitude and sincerity, which her Soul was capable of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I must therefore now by hazarding your Favour, Sir, which is much more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me than Life, acquaint you, my fears were not without reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I made them my Torment, by con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ining them to my Breast, till I could make the cause
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63273:56"/>
of them as visible to you, as their effects were sensible to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Monarch here, interrupted his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, by saying, <hi>Take heed,</hi> Howard, <hi>what you do; if you proceed no farther, I will attempt to persuade my self to pardon all you have spoke, by attributing it to your zeal for my service, which may incline you to act, though mistakenly, as you have done. But if you persevere after this Caution and Forgiveness, you necessitate me either to ruine my Mistriss, or you: And nothing less than a Demonstration she is false, can make me believe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howard</hi> unmov'd, (which the King too sensibly observ'd) reply'd:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know my danger is great, but, Sir, my duty is greater; yet I cannot say positively, your Majesty shall by a Demonstration be convinced she is false; but you shall be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied she would be so, and that it is her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble she cannot be so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, at this assurance, only nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Head, and commanded him to proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howard</hi> then told his Prince, <hi>I shall now relate to you, Sir, a story, which I know will surprize you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:63273:56"/>
                  <hi>But before I begin, will you be pleas'd to pardon me, if I presume to inquire whether</hi> Leticia, <hi>has not been so faithful as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close her apprehensions to you, that her Lady has, of late, too kindly gaz'd upon a Page I prefer'd to her, whose name is</hi> Horatio.</p>
               <p>The King answer'd, <hi>May be she has; but ask no more questions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will then Sir,</hi> Howard said, <hi>solemnly protest, That whatever may have but the least shadow of a tendency, to disturb your quiet, I have curiously endeavor'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or remove, and will do to the last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my life. Your Majesty having trusted me with the care of</hi> Izabella, <hi>and done me the honour to make me your Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in that Amour, I dedicated my self so to discharge that Trust, as you should never repent the favour. And therefore I was much more vigilant over her, than had she been my own Mistriss.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A while since, I entertain'd</hi> Horatio <hi>to be one of my Pages, and finding him very diligent, serviceable, and I believ'd faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I prefer'd him to wait on</hi> Izabella, <hi>both as the fittest I had, and to give me notice of all things, for you knew, Sir, my suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:63273:57"/>
                  <hi>I was in a few days, so far from doubting his services were not acceptable to her, as I began to doubt, they were so, but too much I was unwilling to admit of so mean a thought, and therefore thrust it from my heart with so much rudeness, as I hoped 'twould never dare to approach it again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, Sir, I could not persuade my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst what I saw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> Izabella <hi>by stealth, even before me, would often cast such eyes on</hi> Horatio, <hi>as made me tremble to think they were the looks of Love; and when I would remove those fears, they appear'd too rational to be cast off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While my jealousies were young, I declin'd, Sir, troubling you with them. But the elder they grew, they became the stronger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I therefore determin'd, by one action, to confirm, or ruine them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To effect which, I pretended yesternight some business which might detain me this day many hours, and beg'd</hi> Izabella<hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if till the evening of it, I paid her not my duties. I went therefore early abroad, but returned privately at Noon, concealing my self in my Closet, till she had dined; for then I knew her Women usually left her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63273:57"/>
and therefore that would be the fittest time to make my discovery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I got unseen, by any, to her Chamber, but found it empty; yet hearing some discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in her Cabinet, and seeing the door un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'd, I enter'd; there I found</hi> Izabella <hi>and</hi> Horatio; <hi>she blush'd, and told me, She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d me not so soon. I reply'd, my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness had been disappointed in part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She observed I was surprized to find a Page with her alone, and therefore told me with new blushings, She had been unkind to</hi> Horatio, <hi>to please herself; for one of her Women had so exceedingly commended his voice, while she was at her dinner, as long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear it, she had made him lose his own, to give her that satisfaction; and just as she was persuading him to sing, I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This smooth Relation, I seem'd to take for good payment, and therefore I chid him, for needing to be persuaded to obey his Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Horatio <hi>therefore immediately sung; but so charmingly, and the words being of the power of Love, he so animated them by his actions, as though your Mistriss, Sir, stood on her guard; yet I too clearly saw, what I
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63273:58"/>
so much dreaded; for never Love spoke so significantly in looks, as in hers, to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The lively sense of your affront, transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to that degree, as I durst stay no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the place; but begging</hi> Izabella<hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, to employ</hi> Horatio, <hi>for one hour, on a pressing business, I took him with me out of her Cabinet, into my own; where lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door, I asked him with an accent which made him tremble, How he durst be alone in a Closet with his Lady?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He reply'd, <hi>It was by her Commands, not by his seeking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I bid him, on your life, never again repeat that presumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He answer'd, <hi>Then, Sir, I beseech you, take me out of her service; for while I am in it, 'tis both my duty to obey her, and your Commands that I should do it: and she is never without company, but she calls me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone into her Cabinet, where she is so kind to me</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Villain,</hi> I reply'd furiously, <hi>How kind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas, Sir,</hi> said Horatio, <hi>you ask in so much anger, as I dare not tell you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tell me,</hi> I answer'd, <hi>drawing out my Punniard, or I'll kill thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:63273:58"/>
                  <hi>He immediately said (but shaking with fear) I will discover all, so you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise me my Pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Discover, said I, to the least circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or thou art dead; and when I have heard all, I will consider if thou art capable of mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Horatio <hi>then said, I think, Sir, she is in Love with me; for when we are alone, she has more than once embraced and kist me; and she has appointed me this night, at midnight, to steal to her Bed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Traytor,</hi> I reply'd, <hi>Dost thou not know she is thy Kings Mistriss? Wert thou my Brother, this shall be thy last hour? But because thou hast confest thy sin, I give thee a few moments to reconcile thy Soul to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore lose them not in fruitless begging of forgiveness from me; for dye thou shalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Horatio <hi>therefore immediately fell to his devotions, but every minute with floods of tears he look'd trembling after me, for I still kept my Punniard in my hand; and when I thought he had prayed long enough, I advanced to kill him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, O God, Sir, how was I surprized, when opening his shirt, he discover'd to me
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63273:59"/>
the breasts of a Woman; but so white, and so firm, as could the fury I was in, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Love, his tears had so softened my temper, that his eyes might have stamp'd it on my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How,</hi> said our Monarch, interrupting <hi>Howard,</hi> (for till then he had listned to him, but in all the agonies of offended Love) <hi>a Woman? What could be her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign? And why was she so long revealing her Sex?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That, Sir,</hi> said Howard, <hi>fill'd me with new wonder; and when I asked her the cause, she told me, her Vncle, to whose care her deceased Father had left her, fell in Love with her, and would have forced her kindness; which to avoid, she had fled from him disguis'd in mans apparel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I well remember Sir,</hi> (continued Howard) <hi>how one day walking in a Field near the High-way, I saw him in it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring his beauty, which was fitter for the Female Sex, than that she then personated; I stop'd him, and believing by his travelling on foot, he was necessitous, I asked him if he wanted a Service, and if he would be one of my Pages? He told me he would most willingly: I therefore entertained him,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63273:59"/>
gave him my Livery, and prefer'd him to</hi> Izabella, <hi>who, it seems, being taken with his face, diligence, and voyce, and mistaking his Sex, bestowed on him her Love; by which he confest to me, he hoped so much to benefit himself, as before she could finally discover the fallacy, he might obtain gifts sufficient to maintain him for his life, and a young Gentleman, with whom she had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed her heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This, Sir, is all I have to tell you, but that I keep</hi> Horatio <hi>lock'd up in my Closet, from whence he cannot escape, till I know the honour of your Commands concerning him, and what your pleasure is on all these disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King awhile walked in his Cabinet with looks, which too evidently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the agitations of his mind; and then turning to <hi>Howard,</hi> embrac'd him, and with a sigh said, <hi>Thou hast done me at once the highest service and disservice imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; for thou hast told me that, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and unreveng'd, had rais'd her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of me; and known, has rais'd my Hate of her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then pausing awhile, he continued, <hi>Oh</hi> Howard, <hi>how unjustly are Monarchs envied
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63273:60"/>
for their Power and Greatness, when the inconstancy of a Mistriss, out-braves both; and when even my Love to her, cannot fix hers to me, she forsakes the Embraces of her Capti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howard,</hi> who found his Prince more sensible of the intended Affront, than he could well have hoped; chang'd his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and casting away all those Reasons with which he had arm'd himself to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Revenge, began seemingly to dissuade him from it, being not ignorant that whoever opposes his Princes Love, without proving the Mistresses crime, as certainly contributes to the heightning of it; as whoever pleads for the pardon of a Mistresses Inconstancy, renders her the more uncapable of obtaining it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Love, and Revenge of a Monarch, are so tender a part of his Prerogative, as he will only allow himself to be the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of their Effects.</p>
               <p>So that when <hi>Howard</hi> began to beg him to remember, <hi>She was not actually, but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63273:60"/>
intentionally Criminal.</hi> Our <hi>Henry</hi> taking him up short, reply'd, <hi>She who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to be False, is so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when our young <hi>Norfolk</hi> added, <hi>That</hi> Izabella <hi>never lov'd any man, but her King.</hi> He answer'd, <hi>'Tis more than she herself knows, and she believes the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> And lastly, when <hi>Howard</hi> desired him to consider, <hi>How Natural it was, for the Young to be Captivated by the Lovely.</hi> He briskly reply'd, <hi>'Tis at least as Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and certainly more Iust, for an injur'd King, to punish the Offender:</hi> To which he added, <hi>No, No, She that can Love any but her own Monarch after she has obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Heart, evidences nothing can fix hers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>However, I will this Night, by a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, convince my self, and her, of her Crime; Tear her from my Heart, and then</hi>—</p>
               <p>There he stop'd, and commanded, his Favorite so to order this business, as to put it past the reach of Fortune to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howard</hi> assur'd him of his utmost care, and then said, <hi>Will you permit me, Sir, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you are convinced, of what you will make
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63273:61"/>
your own eyes, the Witnesses of, to beseech you to command me, before</hi> Izabella, <hi>to kill</hi> Horatio; <hi>and I shall therein act my part so artificially, as she shall in an hour after, believe your Orders are obey'd. For since I find your Majesty has judged her offence merits to divorce her eternally from your thoughts; it will be no small addition, to her Grief, to believe, that in the same sin, which has lost her You, she has been the death of her Lover and herself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King having approv'd of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, shut himself up in his Cabinet, so full of Fury, to have been deluded and betray'd by his first Mistriss, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as impatiently long'd for the hour to revenge it, as she did to commit the Crime, which was to render that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, a Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howard</hi> also retired to <hi>Horatio,</hi> that with him, all the design, might be so cautiously laid, as it could not fail. A Design<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the execution whereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended both his Revenge, for losing his Mistresses Favor, and his security in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing his Masters.</p>
               <p>While they two were adjusting this important Plot, <hi>Leticia,</hi> who was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63273:61"/>
of <hi>Izabella</hi>'s ruine, by her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obstinate, in retaining <hi>Horatio,</hi> beg'd and obtain'd our Monarchs permission, to speak with him alone in a retired place, where usually she had Audience.</p>
               <p>She told him, <hi>That her endless Fidelity to his Service, had oblig'd her some dayes before to tell him her fears of</hi> Izabella<hi>'s guilty inclinations, for the inchanting</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio; <hi>and having by his express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands used all her Arts, Prayers and Tears, to procure her to expel him from her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but unsuccessfully, she too easily saw, for what end, he was still retain'd; she had therefore made a little Hole, through that part of her Chamber Wainscot, which sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it from her Ladies Closet; and had planted herself there with great secresie, from whence she had seen, more than once, the guilty looks she greedily cast on her new Lover; whereby she had concluded there wanted but a fit opportunity to act what they could not but have agreed upon: And having been told, by her own Woman, whom she had made her spy, and perfectly instructed in all the secrets of that Vocation, that this day</hi> Izabella <hi>and</hi> Horatio <hi>had been together in her Closet, she fully believ'd the Assignation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63273:62"/>
was fixt to the ensuing night; since, Sir, she has employed me, to acquaint you, her Head is so indisposed, that should you design her then, the honour of your company, she must beg to be deprived of it, that by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Rest, she may be to morrow, the more fit to obey your pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Monarch comparing this, with what <hi>Howard</hi> had newly told him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be but too certain of <hi>Izabella</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; and therefore having first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest to <hi>Leticia</hi> his sense of her vigilance, and faithfulness, he contriv'd with her, how to surprize her Lady, in the crime.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Leticia</hi> undertook the conduct of, and was commanded to return to <hi>Izabella,</hi> with the Kings passionate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolings, for her Indisposition, and full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances, his Visits that Night, should not contribute to augment it, though by his not paying them, it would bring an accession to his own.</p>
               <p>Our Monarch being ready to be gone, <hi>Leticia,</hi> with all the insinuating Arts of a Woman of her Vocation, humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him to vouchsafe her one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Audience; which the King having granted, she told him,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:63273:62"/>
                  <hi>As my Fidelity has forced me to bring your Majesty unpleasing News of one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss, so my Duty has made me sollicitous, to Present you with a Cure for that unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For, Sir, this morning I went to visit a Lady, whom I had the Honour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with in the first bloomings of her Youth, and who then promis'd such Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when she should come to her Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year, as I believed she onely would merit the Conquest of your Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What my Belief then suggested, my eyes this day, have had the blessing to behold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, Sir, she is a Widow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, Sir, she is also a Maid; for the very day she was married to Sir</hi> Gilbert Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boise, <hi>he was assaulted with a Fever, of which soon after he dyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fate reserving her Virginity, for him alone who is onely worthy of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her own Name was</hi> Blunt; <hi>and as much as the Criminal</hi> Izabella, <hi>surpasses ordinary Beauties, so much my Lady</hi> Talboise, <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends hers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Were every Woman in the World, rob'd of that Grace, Feature, or Motion, which is most Captivating in her, and were all those
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63273:63"/>
borrowed Charms, by the Magick of Love, united, to make one Beauty accomplish'd and perfect, yet even that Mosaick-work Beauty would fall short of the Lovely</hi> Talboise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have begun, Sir, to give her those impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of your Majesty, which I think she will be as little able ever to part with, as you will be to part with her, when you have once had the felicity to see her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leticia,</hi> without staying for the Kings further Inquiry, retir'd.</p>
               <p>But what she had spoke, was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operative on his mind; for it prepar'd him, with the less reluctance, to lose his first Mistriss, by the inchanting Idea's, she had given him of a second.</p>
               <p>While all these things were thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacting against the amorous <hi>Izabella,</hi> she was entertaining herself with those Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which her Fancy promis'd, in the embraces of <hi>Horatio,</hi> and sometimes in exclaiming against the dull motion of the Sun, which added not wings to his course, when her Passion made her wish it.</p>
               <p>At last the long'd for hour of rest to others, and somewhat more valued than rest by <hi>Izabella,</hi> arrived; and because of her pretended indisposition, she went to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63273:63"/>
Bed the earlier, appointing all her Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to retire, and make no noise.</p>
               <p>A thousand times by the light of a Flambeau which was not far from her Bed, she look'd on her Watch, to see when the lazy Hand would reach the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Twelve.</p>
               <p>While she was in that importune ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance, the King had convey'd himself into <hi>Leticia</hi>'s Chamber, having first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Howard,</hi> neither to come into it, nor into <hi>Izabella</hi>'s, but to keep within call, in case he needed his service.</p>
               <p>This our young <hi>Norfolk</hi> joyfully obey'd; for being now arrived near the moment of the Action, he began to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the apprehension, that <hi>Izabella</hi>'s fury and resentment, when she should be detected, if he appear'd an Agent in her shame, would urge her to discover his first Guilt, that she might involve him in her ruine.</p>
               <p>The King also having some reliques of respect for her he had so lately adored, esteemed it undecent, that any but <hi>Leti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> should be the witness of her Ladies disgrace, and possibly in consequence of her own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:63273:64"/>
                  <hi>Howard</hi> therefore stood in an obscure place, yet within hearing of his Princes voice, should he in the least raise it. And <hi>Leticia,</hi> who was intirely ignorant of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio</hi>'s true Sex, had a faithful Centinel near his Chamber door, to advertise her, as soon as ever he opened it; that the King and she might arrive timely enough, to prevent the acting the evil, yet soon enough to discover the intended.</p>
               <p>In these several employments the time was consumed, till the great Clock of the Castle struck Twelve: immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Horatio,</hi> in the dark, stole towards <hi>Izabella</hi>'s Chamber, <hi>Leticia</hi>'s Scout, ran with the News of it to her; and our Monarch and she went hastily the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to it, concluding the fore-way would be bar'd by <hi>Izabella</hi>'s care, as soon as the supposed Gallant was gotten into it.</p>
               <p>Just as the King and <hi>Leticia,</hi> were got about the back-way to the Chamber door, <hi>Horatio</hi> was entred it, <hi>Izabella</hi> had bolted that passage, and in the last tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports of her Passion, being only in an <hi>Aurora</hi> colour Sarcenet Night-gown, had almost stifled <hi>Horatio</hi> with her kisses and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63273:64"/>
embraces; but as she was leading him to the Scene of all her fancied enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Leticia</hi> seized on <hi>Horatio,</hi> our <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> standing at the back-door, unseen by <hi>Izabella,</hi> but clearly seeing all she did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horatio,</hi> who had been assured by his Lord, that onely the King and he would surprize them; for so it had been resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, before <hi>Leticia</hi> was admitted into the Plot; neither did <hi>Howard</hi> know any thing to the contrary, till it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to advertise his supposed Page of it: being therefore amazed and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to see himself thus taken by one, who was not of the design, and by seeing neither of those which he believed were onely privy to it, endeavoured to spring from <hi>Leticia</hi>; who having gotten firm hold of his shirt, by his strugling to get loose, tore off that part of it which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his breasts, whereby <hi>Izabella,</hi> who had alwayes her eyes on him, clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he was not of that Sex, which till then she had believ'd.</p>
               <p>That surprizing sight struck her with more astonishment, than her being detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Leticia,</hi> had filled her with fury and grief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:63273:65"/>But she had scarce time to make any reflections on that discovery, for <hi>Horatio</hi> being scaped at last, out of <hi>Leticia</hi>'s hands, and retiring hastily by the back-door, at which she had entered, was there seized by our Monarch; who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him by the hand towards <hi>Izabella,</hi> with a face inflamed with anger and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, told her:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I come, Madam, to bring you this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and at the same time I Present you him, I declare I am no longer yours: What my eyes have seen, I must believe. No less an evidence I would allow, and no greater I could have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know another Prince offended to the degree I am, would wash away your Crimes, in your Blood; and if I do it not, 'tis onely because I judge to let you live, will be a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer punishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes, perfidious</hi> Izabella, <hi>you shall not only lose for ever the Love you are so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, but him also, for whose embraces, you have abandon'd mine. He shall suffer death for his offence, and you shall live confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, till Age or Melancholy presents you yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:63273:65"/>
                  <hi>Izabella,</hi> who had by the unexpected Accident which I have related, fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered <hi>Horatio</hi>'s true Sex, (which while the King was thus speaking to her, she was fully confirm'd in, for he could not so cover his breasts with the hand that was free, but she saw a part of them) having her judgment clear and active, stepped suddenly back, and as one half amazed, replied:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How, Sir, are these fit expressions for her to whom you first made the glorious Present of your Heart; and for whose sake she sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed all that ought to be most sacred in this World amongst Women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah, Sir, since you are now satiated with those enjoyments which a thousand times you vowed, were the highest you could aspire unto, perform on me, what you threaten against me; for after having lost the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which only made me relish Life, my best Cure will be to be deprived of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You mean,</hi> said the King, interrupting her with indignation, <hi>the felicity of your</hi> Horatio<hi>'s embraces, 'tis those alone, I find, makes you relish that Life, which because you shall be eternally deprived of them, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to lose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:63273:66"/>
                  <hi>Then, Sir,</hi> said Izabella, <hi>I am miserable indeed, since you choose to think me capable of such guilt. But behold your Error, and my Innocence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the end of these words, she forced with both her hands, <hi>Horatio</hi> from his breast, and then with a languishing, yet in a reproachful accent, she added, <hi>Iudge, Sir, if for her embraces, I would abandon those of my King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Monarch, at this, was strangely surprized; not at his seeing <hi>Horatio</hi> was a Woman, but at <hi>Izabella</hi>'s knowing it. And <hi>Leticia</hi> was so confounded at the sight, that 'tis past my Art to describe it; so that she would not rest satisfied at the evidence thereof, which <hi>Izabella</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, but expeditiously tryed further experiments; which having intirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her, she stood like a Statue.</p>
               <p>Her Lady, to improve this consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, turning angerly to her late Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, told her, <hi>Go, wretched Woman, and never dare again to Present your self before me; it was your idle jealousie of me, which made me resolve to divert my self, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex you, by seeming to be in Love with</hi> Horatio. <hi>I observed you had your Spies on
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63273:66"/>
me, and watched my very looks: But alas I little imagined this design for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>irth, should discover your falshood to me, much less that you should by it, prevail with my King to suspect a Fidelity, which I had dedicated to his Love, and not to his Quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But alas I find how much I was mistook; and that what I intended for an innocent delight, has eternally rendered me uncapable of any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And since, Sir,</hi> turning to the King, <hi>you have judged me Criminal, I shall punish my self, as if really I were so, by taking now my last leave of you; yet I shall pray, that who ever you next Honour with your Affection, may be but as sensible of it, as I have been; for more she cannot be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may avoid a misery, like that, which you have loaden me with, and from whose Burthen I am resolved Death shall suddenly relieve me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then with her accustomed grace she kneeled, kissed the Kings hand, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> bathed with her tears, and retired hastily into her Cabinet, bolting the door after her.</p>
               <p>He would be a better Drawer of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions than I pretend to be, that could paint to the Life, those of our Monarch,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63273:67"/>
of <hi>Izabella,</hi> of <hi>Leticia,</hi> and of <hi>Horatio</hi>; for never any four persons at once were assaulted with such violent and various ones, as they were.</p>
               <p>The last of them finding himself at liberty, withdrew to his own Chamber, to put on those Cloaths which might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to disguise his Sex, from the rest of the Family; and by the way was met by his Lord, who was impatiently watching the Result of this whole Adventure, on which his Revenge and Safety, so highly depended. He therefore followed <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> to learn it; which when he had done, his Amazement, Grief and Anger, equal'd those of all the rest.</p>
               <p>The King, in the mean while, having his heart pierced, with <hi>Izabella</hi>'s last words and actions, and trembling with apprehension, lest she might be then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, what she had menaced him with; started out of all his thoughts, and ran to her Cabinet door, where he heard her sigh with such excess, as set on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>He both knocked at the door, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but she neither would open it, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

him. This made him unite all his strength to force it.</p>
               <p>She knew well enough by the voice, and by the attempt, who it was; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun so fortunately to extricate herself out of that ruine into which her mistaken Love, had so far precipitated her, she resolved to perfect what was so far advanced; and therefore just as our Monarch had torn open the door, she got into the Window which was over the <hi>Thames,</hi> and made as if she would have cast herself out of it.</p>
               <p>But the King, as she designed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> catched her in his Arms; and then by all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations of a penitent Lover, so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly beg'd her Pardon, for his guilty suspicions, which had been seemingly, but too well grounded; and so passionately conjured her to cast off a despair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which at once had so frightned and pleased him, since it was the sublimest evidence of her Love and Grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by degrees she gave him some hopes, she might not be for ever inexorable.</p>
               <p>Who will not admire at the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of Love, and at the vicissitude of Humane things; when the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63273:68"/>
of the World, is reduced to beg Pardon, of his Subject, for her own fault; while she is more troubled she could not Act it, than she would have been had she committed it: And yet her sighs, and tears, that an imagined Page, is found to be a Woman, which aggravated her fault, she makes pass even in the judgment of her King, as the proofs of her Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
               <p>Thus the World delights to abuse us, and yet we delight to pursue those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, by which we are abused; and to Court them, neglect our solid Happiness; every one flattering himself with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that he is the happy person who shall fix the wheels of Love and Fortune, both which, will yet be as perpetual in their motions, as the Sun in his.</p>
               <p>But while the King and <hi>Izabella</hi> are peecing up all misunderstandings, while <hi>Leticia</hi> is contriving how to recover the favor of her Lady, or failing of it, to raise her Fortunes, by making the lovely <hi>Talboise,</hi> the Monarch, of our Monarchs heart; while our young <hi>Norfolk,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving by a second design, to repair the unsuccessfulness of the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and while
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63273:68"/>
even <hi>Horatio,</hi> is upbraiding his destiny with frowardness and unconstancy; for having blasted a design, which he thought was so admirably well contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let us return to <hi>Brandon,</hi> who seems justly to complain, we have too long ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected him, since his Actions are to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the greatest and most surprizing Events in our following Adventures.</p>
