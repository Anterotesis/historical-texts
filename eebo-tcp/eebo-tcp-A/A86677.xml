         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The onely place alleadged to prove that Chriſt paid Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> is <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 24. 27. where the Collectors of the <hi>Didrachme</hi> came to <hi>Peter</hi> to demand it of him and his Maſter, in <hi>verſe</hi> 27. Chriſt bids <hi>Peter</hi> pay a <hi>Stater</hi> for himſelf and Chriſt his Maſter; and he doth it. Now this, they ſay, was Tribute-money to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Not onely the Doctor, but many learned men are of this opinion. In the Margin of one Bible, I finde theſe words: <hi>This was an Attick Didrachme, which the Romans exacted after they had ſubdued Judea.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Deodat</hi>'s. But <hi>Beza</hi> denies that: for, ſaith he, <hi>Hoc postea factum;</hi> the Romans did not exact this money untill 75 yeeres after the birth of Chriſt. <hi>Joſeph. de Bello Judaico, Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. Therefore he refers it to <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 17. where the word <hi>[Cenſus]</hi> he thinkes containes both the <hi>Didrachmes</hi> that Chriſt paid; which Taxe he conceives was a Taxe of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which he laid upon every head, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> and Chriſt paid a certain ſum. I do not know in any thing that <hi>Beza</hi> ſtumbles and rambles ſo much, as in this. He proves out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that the <hi>Didrachme</hi> was never paid away from the Temple untill 75 yeeres after Chriſts birth; and therefore he conjectures 'twas ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certaine Taxe laid upon every perſon by the Romans; but brings not the leaſt proofe for it out of Scripture or Hiſtory, that the Romans exacted the <hi>Didrachme.</hi> Some other learned men conjecture that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> exacted this <hi>Didrachme</hi> when <hi>Cirenius</hi> was Governour, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 1. when all the world was taxed: but neither <hi>Dio, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> nor <hi>Joſephus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> nor any other Hiſtorian that ever I heard of, maketh mention that the <hi>Didrachme</hi> ſhould be put upon every mans head. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there were Surveys taken of the Grounds, and Mechanicks names taken, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 1. <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius è lapide</hi> is of opinion, that this <hi>Didrachme</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> paid, was not <hi>ſacrum</hi> but <hi>prophanum;</hi> and that it was paid to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: and he onely, endeavours to give reaſons for this opinion; the one is from Chriſts words to <hi>Peter, ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Of whom doth the Kings of the earth demand Tribute or Cuſtome?</hi> There the word <hi>Cenſum</hi> (ſaith he) declares it to be not the money of the Sanctuary, but the Kings money, the Roman Tribute: for the word <hi>Cenſus</hi> is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114926:5"/>
a Romane word, which ſignifies the Eſtimation or Valuing of goods.</p>
            <p>But grant all that <hi>Cornelius è lapide</hi> ſaith, his conſequence will not hold, that therefore that which <hi>Peter</hi> paid was money to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt, to ſhew <hi>Peter</hi> how little reaſon they had to exact it from him, (who was born King of the Jewes, and was the naturall Son of <note place="margin">'Ei <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Chryſoſt. in <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.</note> the King of kings) puts an alluſive queſtion to him, or, (as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> holds) propoſeth an argument, <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it thus, from <hi>Peters</hi> Conceſſion: If Kings of the earth do not exact Tribute from their naturall Sonnes, being of the Royall bloud (becauſe 'twas their Prerogative royall to receive;) then much leſs reaſon have theſe to demand this money of me, who am their King, and the naturall Son of the King of kings, to whom of right this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute belongs. (For this was no other money then the Shekel of the Sanctuary; and for that end it was gathered, and for that end it was paid, as we ſhall prove anon.) So that <hi>Cornelius è lapide</hi>'s reaſon is invalid, unleſs he will alſo thence inferre, that Chriſt was of the Royall blood of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and Chriſt drew the force of his reaſon from thence; which no man will affirm.</p>
            <p>His other Argument is falſe, which he grounds upon <hi>Joſephus, lib.</hi> 14. <hi>Antiq. cap.</hi> 8. where he ſaith, after that <hi>Pompey</hi> had won the City Jeruſalem by conqueſt, he ſubdued them to the Romans, and from that day exacted the <hi>Didrachme.</hi> Whereas <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeaks not one word of the <hi>Didrachme.</hi> He ſaith, As for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he made it Tributary to the Romans, taking away from the Jewes thoſe Cities in <hi>Coeloſyria,</hi> which they had Conquered, and aſſigning them a proper and peculiar government. <hi>Pompey</hi> was ſo farre from robbing the Temple of the <hi>Didrachme,</hi> that (ſaith <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the ſame Book and Chapter) though he ſaw the Table of Gold, and golden Candle-ſtick, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other rare and precious things in the Temple, beſides two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand talents of ſilver there put; (through the reverence he had of God) he touched nothing of all which he ſaw. So that <hi>è Lapide</hi>'s Reaſons herein are both deſtitute of ſtrength and truth; and therefore none at all.</p>
            <p>I finde learned <hi>Weemes,</hi> and <hi>Godwin,</hi> no leſs learned in the Jewiſh Antiquities, both of this opinion, that Chriſt paid this <hi>Didrachme</hi> to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> but neither of theſe learned men prove that <hi>Caeſar</hi> (in Chriſts time of being on earth) exacted the halfe Shekel that was paid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114926:5"/>
to the Temple; but a man may almoſt prove the contrary from their own words. To begin with Doctor <hi>Weemes,</hi> two things he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth. 1. That <hi>Caeſar</hi> was exceeding favourable to the Jewes. 2. That the Phariſees demanded this Tribute mony of <hi>Peter.</hi> Now if <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſo favourable to the Jewes, as that he granted them a free exerciſe of their Religion, he debarred them not from keeping the Sabbath, nor from circumciſing their children, he neither tooke their <hi>Synedria,</hi> nor their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from them; is it probable that he would take away the money of the Temple, which was to repair it, and to ſupply the Prieſts wants, and ſeveral other holy uſes? Certainly he was no ſuch favourer of the Jews, that would ſtarve all their Prieſts, and ruine their Temple; which <hi>Ceſar</hi> muſt needs be guilty of, if he took away the money due to the Temple.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But he ſaith in another place, that the Phariſees demanded this money of <hi>Peter;</hi> and I am prone to believe it. If then the Phariſees gathered this, as 'tis moſt probable they did, (for the Maſters of the Synagogue, from the Captivity in Babylon, gathered the half Shekel, which is the <hi>Didrachme,</hi> and ſent it to Jeruſalem to the high-prieſts; and the Phariſees were many of them Maſters of the Synagogue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 43.) it is moſt probable, then, that this money that they demanded, was money for the Temple, and that money which every one paid to the Temple according to the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 13. This was ſacred money, and this onely the Phariſees would gather. As for <hi>Caeſars</hi> Taxes, the Phariſees abhorred ſuch an unholy imployment; that was the office of the Publicans, to gather <hi>Caeſars</hi> money: the Phariſees were ſo farre from gathering <hi>Caeſars</hi> money that they abhorred a Publicans compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, becauſe of his office: they would not dine with him, nor converſe with him; but would even waſh after they had gone thorow the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place where the Publicans were converſant. And is it probable that the Phariſees would take upon them the Publicans office, to gather <hi>Ceſars</hi> money? Thus far it ſeems improbable, from M. <hi>Weemes</hi> his own Conceſſions.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Godwin</hi> i. e. acknowledgeth that what the Greek copie reads <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Syriac readeth <hi>duo zu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im.</hi> Now that <hi>zuz</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, ſaith he to the Roman <hi>Denarie:</hi> ſo that by his confeſſion, there is as great difference betwixt the Roman penny which they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 19. and the <hi>Didrachme</hi> which Chriſt paid. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. as betwixt ſeven pence half-penny, and one ſhilling and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114926:6"/>
three pence; which any old man without ſpectacles may diſcerne. M. <hi>Godwin</hi> therefore, to make his opinion hold, makes this diſtinction: There is (ſaith he) the common penny; and the penny of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary: the common penny that valued ſeven pence half-peny, was Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane money; but the penny of the Sanctuary, that valued one ſhilling three pence, he ſaith <hi>Ceſar</hi> exacted. And brings for a proofe <hi>Joſeph. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de bello Judaico, cap.</hi> 26. which plainly proves that <hi>Ceſar</hi> never exacted it till above fourty yeeres after Chriſts aſcenſion; untill which time, the <hi>Didrachme</hi> was payd unto the Temple. So that that which he makes the ground of his argument, proves juſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Thus have I, out of their own mouthes, (who endeavour to prove that Chriſt did pay Tribute to <hi>Ceſar)</hi> proved almoſt, if not altogether, the contrary.</p>
            <p>But to come more cloſe to the Argument, and to prove that the Scripture alleadged proveth not that Chriſt paid Tribute to <hi>Ceſar.</hi> The Scripture alleadged is <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 24. 27. In <hi>ver.</hi> 24, the gatherers of the Tribute came to <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſay, by way of Queſtion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>payeth not your Maſter the Didrach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me? Peter</hi> anſwers, Yes. And in <hi>ver.</hi> 27. Chriſt bids him look in the firſt fiſhes mouth that came to the hook and therein he ſhould finde a Stater; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>thou ſhalt finde a Stater; that give for me and thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I prove this was not paid as Tribute to <hi>Ceſar,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this was Gods money, and none of <hi>Ceſars.</hi> There was <hi>Ceſars</hi> money, and Gods money; both which Chriſt diſtinguiſheth, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 19, when the Phariſees came to tempt him: he calls for a piece of money, <hi>numiſma cenſus,</hi> the Roman Tribute-money: they brought him <hi>denarium,</hi> which had <hi>Ceſars</hi> Image on it. He ſaith, <hi>Whoſe Image and ſuperſcription hath it?</hi> They ſaid, <hi>Ceſars.</hi> Then ſaid he, <hi>Give unto Ceſar the things that are Ceſars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> That money that had <hi>Ceſars</hi> Image and ſuperſcription on it, weighed one <hi>Attick drachme:</hi> for (ſaith <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus) Drachma Attica, &amp; denarius Romanus, ejuſdem fuerunt ponderis &amp; praetii.</hi> The old Silver Denarie here mentioned was in value ſeven pence half-peny: This was <hi>Ceſars</hi> money; and Chriſt bids them to give <hi>Ceſars</hi> money unto <hi>Ceſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there was Gods money, which was the Shekel. Now there was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114926:6"/>
the full Shekel, which weighed four <hi>Drachmes;</hi> and this was the Stater which Chriſt paid for himſelf and <hi>Peter.</hi> Stater and Shekel are all one; onely the one is a Greek word, the other is an Hebrew word. Stater comes from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which ſignifies to weigh; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Hebrew ſignifies to weigh. And in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 8, the Shekel and the Stater are one and the ſame: what the <hi>Hebrew</hi> reads Shekel, the <hi>Septuagint</hi> Tranſlates Stater. Now half this Stater or Sheke every ſoule throughout Iſrael, from twenty years old, was to pay to the Lord. The halfe of this Shekel made the <hi>Didrachme,</hi> which was as much money as the Roman tribute-money in weight. It was in value fifteen pence. (The Romane Tribute-money was in value but ſeven pence half-peny.) This had the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> on one ſide of it, and the Pot of <hi>Manna</hi> on the other ſide ſtamped on it; and this was Gods money, and this Chriſt bids the Phariſees give to God: Give that which was <hi>Ceſars</hi> money to <hi>Ceſar;</hi> and that which was Gods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to God. Now this <hi>Didrachme</hi> was none of <hi>Ceſars</hi> money; for it had not his ſtamp on it, as <hi>Beza</hi> manifeſts: this money went to Gods houſe; and for that end Chriſt paid it. And of this opinion is <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Lucas,</hi> and others (ſaith <hi>Cornelius è lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de).</hi> This half Shekel (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves) and the <hi>Didrach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> are all one: and it was demanded of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and was paid, for Chriſt and <hi>Peter;</hi> for Himſelf, as the firſt-borne; and for <hi>Peter,</hi> as the firſt and chiefeſt of the Apoſtles, or becauſe he was the firſt-borne: for that money was Redemption-money that the Jews paid; it was Gods money, which was paid to God in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Redemption in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when God ſlew all the firſt-borne in <hi>Egypt:</hi> then he ſaved <hi>Iſrael;</hi> therefore the firſt-born of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was God's Redemption, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 13. (the very Text that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> grounds his Diſcourſe on:) which Cuſtome from that day continued amongſt the Jews. So that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is far from conceiving that Chriſt paid that money as Tribute to <hi>Ceſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This half Shekel being Gods due by the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 13, 16, and paid untill the Captivity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the Captivity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afterwards, by every man in <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to the Temple; this having alſo the Stamp of the Sanctuary upon it <hi>viz.</hi> the Pot of <hi>Manna,</hi> and the Rod of <hi>Aaron;</hi> it being alſo in value as much more as <hi>Ceſars</hi> money; it cannot be imagined that this <hi>Didrachme,</hi> and that money, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 19. which they ſhewed Chriſt, ſhould be all one. It is moſt improbable,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114926:7"/>
for this reaſon; Becauſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 24. there they came and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded money at <hi>Capernaum</hi> of Chriſt, and he paid it. Now certain dayes after this at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Phariſees brats <hi>(Matth.</hi> 22) came on purpoſe to intrap him with this Queſtion; <hi>Is it lawfull to pay Tribute to Ceſar, or no?</hi>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome, Hom.</hi> 17. in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. the Phariſees breathed out their fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, in that queſtion. Now if Chriſt had paid Tribute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Ceſar</hi> at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> this queſtion had been out of doubt, and the Phariſees device exceeding weak, in propoſing that which he had put out of doubt before. Therefore 'tis probable that what Chriſt paid at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> was money to the Temple, and not Tribute to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>

            <p n="2">2. This money that Chriſt paid at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> could not be Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute-money to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> becauſe Chriſt was never taxed: he was never inrolled in <hi>Ceſars</hi> books that we read of; neither was there any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for he had neither Houſe, nor Land, nor Money. And what could <hi>Ceſar</hi> exact from him, who had nothing?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the money that Chriſt paid had been Tribute to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> then <hi>Peter,</hi> who had a houſe and family in <hi>Capernaum</hi> ſhould have paid more then Chriſt, who had neither houſe, nor family nor goods, nor any thing elſe of value: but Chriſt paid equally with <hi>Peter;</hi> which, according to the Roman Law had been moſt unjuſt; but, according to Gods Law <hi>(Exod.</hi> 30. 15.) was moſt juſt: for there the Rich was to give no more then the halfe ſhekel, and the Poor was to give no leſſe; becauſe the Redemption of their ſoules was a like pretious; therefore they paid alike, each man his halfe ſhekel; which was here exactly paid by <hi>Peter,</hi> for himſelf, and his Maſter. He gave the Stater; which being divided equally into two, make juſt the redemption-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the half ſhekel for each.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If that money which Chriſt paid, had been Tribute-money to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> then Chriſts inference from <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer to his demands, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 25, had not been good: for if from <hi>Peters</hi> conceſſions, Chriſt had argued thus: If the Kings of the earth demand not Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of their natural ſons, then I am free from paying tribute to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi> this would not have followed unleſs we ſhall make Chriſt of the family of the <hi>Ceſars:</hi> Or if he had argued thus: I am of the family of the Kings of <hi>Inaah;</hi> I am heir to the Crown, therefore I am free
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114926:7"/>
from <hi>Ceſars</hi> Tribute, which he hath laid upon <hi>Judea;</hi> this would not follow neither: for, in a Conqueſt, the King's family is moſt engaged to the Conqueror; and ſo Chriſt could not have expected to be free from <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But now to argue from the money paid to the Temple, to his Prorogative Royal, the Argument will hold: For, if the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kings of the earth be free from Taxes, becauſe of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal, then much more am I free from paying the half She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel, being the Son of God, and the true King unto whom you pay your Redemption-money. In this ſence <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> underſtands it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It cannot be proved by any Hiſtory that ever <hi>Caeſar</hi> exacted, or that the Jews paid this <hi>Didrachme,</hi> until after the deſtruction of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem by <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> which was above fourty yeers after Chriſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion. So that by this time I doubt not but the Reader may ſatisfie himſelf, that the Scriptures alleadged to prove that Chriſt paid Tribute to <hi>Ceſar</hi> do not onely not prove the ſame, but prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſaith (ſecondly) that <hi>Ceſar</hi> was an Uſurper and had no Right at all, but onely bare Poſſeſſion of the Jews Kingdom: and this he proveth out of 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 8. where the Jews made friendſhip, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in aſſociation with the Romanes, not out of any intent to ſubject to them. But, to anſwer that, 'tis well known to every Hiſtorian, that very many yeers after that League made betwixt the Romanes and the Jews, the Jews provoked <hi>Pompey</hi> to break the League. For when <hi>Hircanus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> were in conteſt about the Kingdom and the Prieſthood, they referred the ending of the difference to <hi>Pompey,</hi> who gave the Kingdom and Prieſthood to <hi>Hircanus.</hi> Whereupon thoſe that favoured <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> in Jeruſalem, reſiſted <hi>Hircanus:</hi> whereupon began a Civil War, unto which <hi>Pompey</hi> was called, by <hi>Hircanus</hi> and his Party; who coming with an Army againſt Jeruſalem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged it and took it by ſtorm; ſubduing the people, and making them Tributaries to Rome. And here began the Jews Tribute to the Romanes; they being brought, by a perfect Conqueſt, to ſubmit to the Romanes.</p>
            <p>But to view more ſtrictly every particular of the Doctor's <hi>Theſis:</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Ceſar</hi> was an Uſurper. To that we anſwer, firſt, If we conſider the Office of <hi>Ceſar</hi>

Now though <hi>Adam</hi> fell from this Law, and by that meanes loſt all his ability to keep this Law, yet this Law thereby loſt none of its ſtrength; it expected as much from <hi>Adam</hi> as before he fell and from all other men deſcending from <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo that if the fifth Commandement were in force then, doubtleſs there was ſubject on required then; and this by right belonged to <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Eldeſt man the firſt man. This ſubjection to the eldeſt, was Gods inſtitution <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Caine</hi> was the Eldeſt; he was a wicked man, whom God regarded not: <hi>Abel</hi> was the beloved of God, yet God would not take away <hi>Caines</hi> temporal right of dominion, but ſaid, <hi>He (viz.

               <hi>over him.</hi> So that Monarchie is Gods inſtitution: and perſonall evils in that Monarch, cannot exempt good men from ſubjection to them. Indeed, the world ran into Anarchy after the murther of <hi>Abel;</hi> but yet we ſhall finde that God preſerved Monarchie amongſt his own people in the family of <hi>Seth,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Noah,</hi> and from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and from <hi>Abraham</hi> untill the Church of God became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding numerous: then God raiſed up thoſe two great Ordinances of Magiſtracie and Miniſtry to govern his people. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> both which ſprung out of one fountain, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 13. to ſhew the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is betwixt Magiſtracie and Miniſtry in the Church, they are as two pleaſant rivers riſing from one head and running one way in ſeveral ſtreams, for the protection and profit of the Church. From that day, till the deſtruction of the Jewiſh Sate, (except when Gods heavie hand in judgment was upon them) they were governed by Monarchs. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Monarch: for the twelve Tribes received the Law at his mouth; all other Officers in that State were appointed by him, and not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by God, as Moſes was. From Judges, the State roſe to Kings: when they came to Kings, they came to the top of their proſperity; they came to the government that God had promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to that government which <hi>Moſes</hi> propheſied of, and left directions for, <hi>Dut.</hi> 17. 14, 15, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, God gave then their firſt King in Anger, becauſe they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114926:8"/>
ſought him unlawfully, in murmuring againſt their lawfull Magiſtrate <hi>Samuel</hi> and deſiring a King for unlawfull ends, and not patiently waiting Gods leiſure. This King God took away in his wrath, and cut off his family: but God choſe him another King, <hi>David</hi> by name, and eſtabliſhed his family in the Throne of <hi>Judah,</hi> untill the carrying away of the King and People into Captivity. By which 'tis manifeſt, 'twas not the office of a King that God gave in anger, but the perſon of a King that God gave in Anger. Kingly government continued for fourteen generations in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unmoved, in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Dauid:</hi> neither the Church nor State of Iſrael were ſettled, untill Kingly government was eſtabliſhed; and then the Arke was brought to a ſettled place, and a Temple erected for Gods worſhip. By all which, and much more that might be ſaid, 'tis evident, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is <hi>jure divino;</hi> and therefore the office of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſimply conſidered, was not uſurped, but lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the Doctor ſaith that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had no right, but bare poſſeſſion onely of the Kingdome of <hi>Judea,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To that we anſwer very briefly and plainly not medling with learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> or thoſe other Diſcourſes of learned men, but uſing this plain diſtinction of right in general; There is a Natural, a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, and a Civil right.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Natural right <hi>Ceſar</hi> could not have, unleſs he could prove a ſucceſſion from <hi>Noah;</hi> which were ridiculous to think. Beſides, he got his power by violence; and therfore 'twas not any natural right that he had to be Emperour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a Providential right, which is by Gods permiſſion: this <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> had: for God ſuffered him to ſubdue the Weſt and after that to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Eaſtern Armies that came againſt him: he overthrew <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf and ſo made himſelf Poſſeſſor of the moſt of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Victories in the Eaſt Yea, this right Traitors and Uſurpers have to the Thrones that they poſſeſs: this right a Slave (through Gods juſt judgment on a Nation) may have to the Throne: for not a Sparrow falls to the ground without Gods permiſſion. This right both lawfull Kings and Uſurpers have to the Thrones they poſſeſs. <hi>Athaliah,</hi> that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of the Royal family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had onely this Providential right, which ſhe made appear onely by poſſeſſion. But this right gives not juſt Title, nor can expect any ſubjection meerely upon that and no other right: and the reaſon is, becauſe when Providential right croſſeth Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114926:9"/>
and Natural right, here a man is not bound to follow providence, but to guide himſelf by Moral and Divine precepts: for divine precepts are perpetual ſtanding laws, by which the actions of men ought to be guided: but Providential acts were never ordained for lawes or rules by which men ſhould walk; and therefore to ſuch a right there is no ſubjection due: for Providential right may be given by God to the to the vileſt perſon, in judgment to a nation on purpoſe to try them, that ſo, by ſuch divil-worſhip and unlawful ſubjection that nation may fill up the meaſure of their iniquity, and God may deſtroy both them and their Governours. We ſee this dreadful enſample written on the ten Tribes backes, in bloudy Characters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a Civill right, which in divers reſpects may be either humane or divine. As for example: <hi>Caine</hi> had a Civill right of domination; this civill right, it was in reſpect of its original, and the Author of it, divine: for God had ordered it ſo: but as deſcending from <hi>Adam</hi> the Monarch of the world, he had a right by ſucceſſion; which right we call humane right.</p>
            <p>Now a humane right is either by Succeſſion or Conqueſt, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact. To be briefe, we affirme that <hi>Ceſar</hi> had an humane right by conqueſt, over the Kingdome of Judea. That I call an humane right, by conqueſt, which brings the whole Community, by an over-awing power, to promiſe ſubjection to, and owne the Authority of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; whereupon the Conqueror promiſeth them protection. This gives the Conqueror a humane right and title: for he holds his title <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re gentium &amp; conceſſu gentium.</hi> The Learned well obſerve there are five ſorts of Subjects: 1. <hi>Subjecti naturae.</hi> 2. <hi>Subjecti affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> 3. <hi>Subjecti fortunae.</hi> 4. <hi>Subjecti belli.</hi> 5. <hi>Subjecti ex com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact.</hi> The Jewes were <hi>Subjecti belli,</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who by Conqueſt ſubdued <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and made him take an Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance not to rebell againſt him; the breaking of that Oath was rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 13. Here <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Conqueſt gave him a humane right; otherwiſe there could be no rebellion againſt him. Now I prove the Jews were either <hi>ſubjecti affectionum, ſubjecti belli,</hi> or <hi>ſubjecti ex compacto,</hi> or all, to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> by this Argument, If the chief Prieſts and the people owned no other King then <hi>Ceſar;</hi> then <hi>Ceſar,</hi> by the conſent of the Prieſts and people, was their King, and they his ſubjects: But the chiefe Prieſts and the people owned none for their King but <hi>Ceſar, John</hi> 19. 12. the Jewes cried out, <hi>If thou let this</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:114926:9"/>
               <hi>man go, thou art not Ceſars friend. Whoſoever maketh himſelf a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpeaketh againſt Ceſar.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>Pilate ſaith, Behold your King.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>the chief Prieſts anſwered, We have no King but Ceſar.</hi> Now I would faine know of the Doctor, what more <hi>Ceſar</hi> could deſire to make him King of the Jewes by humane right, then the conſent of the high Prieſts and the people. So that <hi>Ceſar</hi> had more then bare poſſeſſion: for he had as much humane right as both the chiefe Prieſts and the people could give him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt poſition of the Doctor's we contradict, by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that bare Poſſeſſion without Right gives no true Title to any Power; neither is it ground for any people to ſubject to ſuch a power. This my Poſition hath been already proved, by more learned Pens; therefore the leſs ſhall be ſaid at this time; onely we'll ſtate what <hi>bare poſſeſſion</hi> meanes rightly, by putting a right Caſe.</p>
            <p>We'll ſuppoſe that <hi>Eutopia</hi>'s Kingdome is governed by a King, whoſe power is meaſured by the Lawes of his Kingdome, which are the rules of government: thoſe Lawes are made not by the King alone, but by a Convention of to Eſtates who are joyned in equal power with the King in making a Law: for thoſe two Eſtates have Negative voices (which is their grand priviledge) equal with the King: In this reſpect there is no Subordination in the three Eſtates ſitting; for they are concauſes of the ſame effect; which admits not of Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Yet this King is <hi>Principium, Caput, &amp; Finis Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti:</hi> for he is <hi>Primus motor:</hi> he is created by none, nor choſen by none; but he creates the Lords, who make one of the two Eſtates which he aſſembles to him to make a Law: and the other, by vertue onely of the Kings Writs &amp; Summons, are inabled to be choſen by the People, and ſent up to the place mentioned in the King's Summons, there to conſult <hi>de arduis Regni.</hi> This King hath power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue or to diſſolve a Parliament when he pleaſeth; but this power he inveſts his Parliament with: which done, He and the Parliament differ; whereupon the King forſakes his Parliament; which by Law he cannot do, the Parliament ſitting; for neither of the three Eſtates can depart upon any pretence from the other two, withoutt he joynt conſent of the whole: if either do, the other two will act, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempore,</hi> as if the third were preſent; becauſe otherwiſe, through the obſtinacie of one, the whole would run to ruine, by reaſon of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114926:10"/>
third's abſence. This difference at laſt breakes into a Civil War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and the two Eſtates: whereupon neceſſity inforceth the two Eſtates to lay hold on the Kings Sword, the <hi>Militia,</hi> which was the Kings undoubted Right; and the Parliament could not have touched it, had the King continued with them. The King complains that the Parliament takes away his right; the Parliament ſay the King's miſtaken, and miſled by evil Popiſh Councel; who under pretence of eſtabliſhing him, ſeeke his ruine, and the ruine of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Parliament: they proteſt they intend not to take it from him, but ſecure it for him; which they may do, in time of ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger: and to ſhew their Loyalty, they voluntarily enter into a Solemn League and Covenant, to defend Religion, Lawes, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Kings Perſon, againſt Papiſts on the one hand, and Sectarians on the other hand. After they have thrown down the Papiſts party, who were the King and Parliaments Enemies on the one hand, up ſtarts a Subtile Politick Religious Hypocrite, who by undermining and ſupplanting his betters, gets at laſt to have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the whole <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome in his hands: which, when he hath it, contrary to his former Oathes, Vows, Proteſtations, and Covenant, all which he ſolemnly took in publicke, he lays violent hands on the King, allures by promiſes, and terrifies by threats the two Eſtates, who hereupon are divided: the timerous and guilty party flie to this Hypocrite, who preſently ingageth them to live and die with him: which done, by the power of his Sword he removes thoſe that did oppoſe him, and puts in his own party, who vote what he commands them. This done, he claps up the King cloſe priſoner, and then puts on his party to inforce him to reſigne his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: which the whole Kingdome ſeeing, riſe up in Armes againſt this Traiterous Hypocrite, and divert Him and his and party from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in their intended deſigne. Whereupon the two Eſtates aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and ſit freely, and vote a Treaty with the King. The King yeelds to it, and ſignes the Propoſitions; eſpecially theſe three. 1. <hi>To root out Popery.</hi> 2. <hi>To establiſh the Protestant Religion.</hi> 3. <hi>To give the power of the Militia to the Parliament.</hi> This the two Eſtates vote to be ſufficient ground for the ſetling of the Kingdomes Peace. Hereupon this aſpiring Hypocritical Traytor, perſorce, pulls down thoſe that voted this, and ſets up againe his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114926:10"/>
own party, which were formerly ingaged to him. Whereupon the ſecluded Members make this Proteſt: <hi>We the Knights, Commons, and Burgeſſes of the Parliament, above a hundred in number, being forcibly ſeized on and, kept by violence from ſitting in the Houſe, do, in our owne, and the names of the Counties for which we ſerve, proteſt, to the Kingdome, that (ſince the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable force upon our Perſons, againſt our Ordinances and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) all Acts or Votes, made or to be made during our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, are null and void: and all Aſſiſtants or Abettors in the ſame Treaſonable armed violence, are hereby proclaimed open Enemies, and profeſſed Perverters of the Kingdomes Priviledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the third Eſtate proteſteth: notwithſtanding the pact party in the third Eſtate of the Kingdome of <hi>Eutopia</hi> ſits by the power of the aſpiring Trayterous Hypocrite, who hath the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> thorowout the Kingdom into his hands: theſe few proceed in their exorbitant and illegal courſes, to deſtroy the chiefe of the three Eſtates; and for this end, deſire the ſaid Eſtate of Lords to joyne with them; which by the law of Nature they cannot do: for neither of the three Eſtates are capable of being attached as Eſtates: for, then two might joyne together to deſtroy any one of the three; and ſo the Government muſt neceſſarily, by its own power, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. The Lords reject the motion: hereupon this pact party, by the power of the Sword, which now was wholly theirs, clap a Lock and a Guard upon the doore of the Houſe of the ſecond Eſtate of Lords; and forthwith dubb themſelves Kings, by voting theſe three Votes. 1. <hi>That the People are the original of juſt Power.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Commons are the Supreame power of the Nation.</hi> 3. <hi>That whatſoever is declared by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to be Law, hath the force of a Law.</hi> Againſt this the Houſe of Lords, who are the ſecond Eſtate in the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, proteſt; as alſo againſt their violence in ſecluding them from ſitting in the Parliament.</p>
            <p>This pact party proceed by their owne power, and erect a Court, and appoint the men who ſhall ſit, judge and condemne the King, who is the firſt Eſtate; who, upon the Scaffold where they behead him, proteſteth, that <hi>would he have yeelded to have given away his power, he needed not to have come there; but for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:114926:11"/>
               <hi>Lawes, and Liberties of the Kingdome, he there died a Martyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in ſuch a Caſe, where a whole Kingdome is ingaged by Oathes, Vows, Proteſtations, and Covenants, to defend their lawfull Governours and Government all the dayes of their life; if ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall ariſe, and, contrary to their Vows, Oathes, Proteſtations and Covenants, riſe up againſt, overthrow, impriſon, behead, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top the three Eſtates, all which three never reſigned the leaſt of their power, but all three openly proteſted againſt them as publike enemies to the Kingdome, and Traytors; I ſay, in ſuch a caſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that party be in poſſeſſion, and have ſuppreſſed the ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Kingdome, yet this gives them no juſt Title to the Government; neither doth it diſengage people from their former Oaths to the ancient Government, nor oblige the People to ſubject to the Uſurper. For if this ſhould be true, that an Uſurper that hath no right, but being in poſſeſſion, ought therefore to be ſubjected to, then this muſt neceſſarily follow, that all reſiſtance made againſt an Uſurper, is Treaſon or Rebelion; and then the Prieſts, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and People, in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. who depoſed <hi>Athaliah</hi> the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſet up the lawfull heire the Kings Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in her ſtead, rebelled: but the Scripture doth not affirme anywhere that they were Rebels, or Traytors, nor dares any ſober-minded man affirme it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more but this, (becauſe I am unwilling to exceed or be tedious upon this Diſcourſe) that he that ſhall affirme, that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due to an Uſurper, becauſe he is in poſſeſſion of the Throne, affirmes that, which, 1. Iscontrary to the Law of God; 2. To the Law of Nature; 3. He maintains a damnable ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He oppoſeth the Law of God: for the fifth Commandment injoynes every man, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> Now an Uſurper is he that depoſeth and murthereth my Civil Father; and I am no more bound to obey him, then the natural Son is bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him who murthers his Father, on purpoſe to take poſſeſſion of his family and eſtate: nor no more, then the Apoſtles were bound to obey <hi>Judas</hi> becauſe he betrayed his Maſter; though he ſhould have got Chriſts Coat on after he had murthered him.</p>
            <p>Againe, 'Tis contrary to that Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal:</hi> for he that gives to an Uſurper, that which is due to his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114926:11"/>
Magiſtrate, plainly robbs his Magiſtrate of his due. S. <hi>Paul</hi> injoynes the Romans to pay <hi>Tribute to whom Tribute is due:</hi> but no Tribute is due, no nor Honour, to an Uſurper, one that hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Humane nor Divine right. Indeed many times people have been forced to pay Tribute to an Uſurper, and to ſit ſilent under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Uſurpers: but a forced ſubjection is ſo far from being an argument that ſubjection is due, that it proves the contrary.</p>
            <p>'Tis contrary to that Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe againſt thy neighbour:</hi> for in ſubjecting voluntarily to an Uſurper, the lawful Magiſtrate is ſlandered as a Tyrant and an Uſurper, and the Tyrant and Uſurper is honoured as a lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo contrary to that Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> for in ſetting up and worſhipping the Uſurper, the Authority, Honour, and Majeſtie of the lawfull Magiſtrate is ſtifled, and killed; and, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that goeth about to deſtroy a King, as much as in him lies indeavours to dethrone God: for Kings are Gods repreſentatives on earth.</hi> But I ſhall bring the Fathers, anon, within the Ordinance of ſpeaking Treaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis contrary to the law of Nature: for Juſtice which is the Queene of Nature's Laws, bids me <hi>Suum cuique tribuere,</hi> give to every one his due. It forbids me to give that to the Servant which is due to the Maſter; it forbids me to ſet the Foot where the Head ſhould be, and the Head where the Foot ſhould be. <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved this as a great evil which he ſaw; <hi>Princes on foot, and Servants on horſeback.</hi> If that were ſo great an evil, what would he have ſaid, if he had ſeen Princes heads on the block, and their ſworn ſervants, yea, thoſe that were ſcarce <hi>worthy to eat with the doggs of their flock,</hi> judging and condemning their Maſters heads to be cut off! This ſin is ſo much againſt the light of Nature, that the Ravens of the field ſhall pick out his eyes that is ſo preſumptious as to behold ſuch iniquity with approbation. But this ſin and great evil, even againſt Nature, are they guilty of, who ſhall yeeld ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience to thoſe who are ſuch Uſurpers; inaſmuch as they allow of all their actions, and juſtifie their authority.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis a damnable ſin to ſubject to Uſurpers, who have no Right but bare Poſſeſſion; becauſe, they that ſo ſubject themſelves, <hi>reſiſt</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:114926:12"/>
               <hi>the powers that are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 2. <hi>and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> Now he that ſubjects to an Uſurper, who in the ſight of all the world, hath, by Treaſon againſt the Higher Powers, got poſſeſſion of the Throne, conſents to, and allowes of the evil of the Uſurper, and ſo comes into the ſame condemnation with him. If under the Law, <hi>(Lev.</hi> 20. 9.) <hi>He that curſed his Father was ſurely to be put to death;</hi> of how much greater judgement is he worthy, who ſhall crucifie his Civil Parents, the Parents of the Kingdome; who ſhall preſume to make, by his Rebellion and Treaſon, a whole Kingdome Fatherleſſe! This ſinne of Rebellion is ſo abominable, that in one place 'tis put in the ballance with Witch-craft, to ſhew that Witches and Rebels, as they are two abominable parties in a Kingdome, ſo they are fitteſt to be linked together: They are fit Companions; the one renounceth his Allegiance to God, and the other renounceth his Allegiance to Gods Vicegerent, to his Soveraigne. In <hi>Deuteronom.</hi> 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. the ſecond Curſe to which all the People were to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> was this; <hi>Curſed be he that ſetteth light by his Father and Mother:</hi> This is put next to the Curſe of the Idolater, to ſhew, that Rebellion againſt a lawful Magiſtrate, is next to Rebellion againſt the Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now if Rebellion be ſo great ſinne in thoſe that act it, How much greater is their ſinne that ſet up ſuch Rebels in the Throne, and, by ſubjecting to them, give them the Honour due to thoſe they murthered and dethroned! If God doth ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Murtherer to live;</hi> that God ſaith, Thou ſhalt not exalt and magnifie that Murtherer.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all, with <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. where Chriſt himſelfe ſtiles thoſe that ſubject to an uſurped power, <hi>Worſhippers of the Dragon. Verſ.</hi> 1. The Beaſt of the Sea, that is, a Beaſt riſing out of the Church; that is, ſay learned Interpreters, the Government by Popes. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. The Popes got to their greatneſſe by Subtilty, and Murther, and Treaſon; by dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their lawfull Maſters, the Roman Emperours. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. All the World wondered after this Beaſt; that is, the greateſt part of the Weſtern Empire ſubjected to the Pope; and this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114926:12"/>
ſubjection to the Pope, that Grand Uſurper, is called, <hi>(Verſ.</hi> 4.) Devil-worſhip; And they worſhipped the Dragon; and why the Dragon? Becauſe he gave power to the Beaſt. Uſurpers have not the power from God, but from the Devil; and he that ſubjects to an Uſurper, ſubjects to the Devil.</p>
            <p>Now as for that man that dares preſume to preach for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Uſurpers, and bring our bleſſed Lord and Saviour for an example, I pity that man, and wiſh him hearty and ſpeedy repentance, before that God whom he hath blaſphemed by a ly, fall upon him.</p>
