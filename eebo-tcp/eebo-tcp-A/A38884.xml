         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to attempt the Enemy in other places, where they had drawn down
their men: My Lord <hi>Gray's</hi> was likewiſe order'd over and it pleaſed
the Lord in half an hour or an hours diſpute the enemy quitted their
ground and fled away, only about Poyick Bridge (which they had
broke down, having the advantage of hedges and ditches) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
a ſharp diſpute with Col. <hi>Haines</hi> his Regiment, and Col.

the Lord that the Enemy likewiſe quitted the ground and runne
away, ſome of Col. <hi>Hains</hi> his men wading over the River to advance
upon them; about a mile beyond Poyick the Enemy had broken
down another bridge upon the paſſe, unto which place we ſent ſome
Dragoons, who with the aſſiſtance of ſome Horſe made the Enemy
quit that place, which gave a paſſage over for Lieut, Gen. <hi>Fleetwoode</hi>
Regiment, Col. <hi>Twiſletons</hi> and Col. <hi>Kenricks,</hi> who were commanded
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54138:3"/>
to purſue the Enemy, who as we had ſuppoſed made towards Hereford
or Ludlow, but they wheeled off and run into Worceſter, only ſome
few who were taken. The ground where we fought was full of hedges
that our horſe had not much liberty to engage: but both Horſe and
and Foot where they had opportunity (through the Lords preſence
ſtrengthning of them) did very gallantly: After the Enemy had run
away into Worceſter, they drew out their whole Army of Horſe
and Foot upon our Army on the other ſide, ſuppoſing that moſt of
our Army had been advanced over the River, but the Lord made
our Army there alike ſucceſſefull as on the other ſide; being aſſiſted
by Major Gen. <hi>Desboroughs</hi> Regiment. of Horſe, and Col. <hi>Cobbets</hi>
of Foot, on that ſide was part of the Generals Regiment, Major Gen.
<hi>Lamberts,</hi> Commiſſary Gen. <hi>Whalies,</hi> Major Gen. <hi>Harriſons</hi> brigade,
and Col. <hi>Tomblins</hi> with ſome of the Surrey and Eſſex Troops, thoſe
of Foot were Major Gen. <hi>Lamberts,</hi> Col. <hi>Prides,</hi> Col. <hi>Coopers,</hi> the
Cheſhire Brigade and the Eſſex Foot, all of theſe as the Lord gave
them opportunity did behave themſelves very gallantly, and beat
the Enemy that came out, and thoſe of them in the Royall Fort into
the Town, and afterwards in the night time poſſeſſed themſelves of
the Towne, but as many Horſe as could got away, though I ſuppoſe
not three thouſand in all eſcaped us: Col. <hi>Barton</hi> being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Bewdley the day before with ſome Horſe and Dragoones, did
take many priſoners in their running away, it is ſaid 1200. Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
morning by order from the Generall, we commanded 1500 horſe
and dragoons to purſue after the Enemy (under the command of Col.
<hi>Blundell</hi>) who fled in the ſame way they came hither, M. G. <hi>Harriſon</hi>
is likewiſe gon after them, and will we doubt not (through the Lords
mercy) overtake moſt of them, Col. <hi>Lilburn</hi> will, we hope, put a ſtop
unto them.</p>
            <p>The King (it is ſaid) went away with not above 12. horſe, tis thought
there is not 1000 horſe of them together; In all the engagements that
ever hath beene, I think we have not ſeen a more immediate hand
of God appearing than in this; I believe there was never more courage
and reſolution in an Army, yet leſſe done by us as men; that which adds
much to the mercy is that the preſence of the Lord was ſo immediate
with us, that we may ſay no fleſh hath cauſe to boaſt, but we muſt ſay it is
the Lord hath done all theſe things; and O that we may have hearts to
walke ſuitable unto what the Lord hath done for us, that it may appear
by our walking and actings, that we are the people that the Lord hath
done all this for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54138:3"/>
The number of thoſe that are taken are ſaid to be about
10000, and neer 3000 ſlain, but in neither can I be poſitive, of
all that were ſlain on our ſide, I am perſwaded there is not 100:
of Officers I hear but very few, Lievt. Col. <hi>Moſely,</hi> and Capt.
<hi>Iones</hi> of Colonel <hi>Cobbets</hi> Regiment were ſlain, Major General
<hi>Lamberts</hi> horſe was ſhot: the number of the Arms and Colours
are ſo many, that as yet there can be no certain accompt given of
them; the General did exceedingly hazard himſelf, riding up
and and downe in the midſt of their ſhots, and went himſelf up
to their Fort and offered them quarter, was then anſwered with
nothing but ſhot, the Major General likewiſe and all the other
Officers, did doe in their ſeveral places very gallantly. In the
perſuit, Col. <hi>Lilburns</hi> and the Generals Regiment of Foot
have taken the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> Earl of <hi>Louderdale,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cleavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

            <p>IT hath pleaſed the Lord to give a great mercy to us
in the delivery up of a great many of the Leaders,
and chiefe of the Scottiſh Forces into our hands. I
(being commanded forth with a party of Horſe and
Dragoons,) marched on a dark rainy night, in rough
and tedious way, to the Town neer the High-Lands
called <hi>Ellit,</hi> where we had intelligence, that moſt of
the Scots Commanders lay, which wee found to bee
true, and have taken there theſe Priſoners in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
Liſt, nominated, not above two of the moſt
conſiderable men of the Committee of State are left,
beſides thoſe who are here, the reſt of the enemy were
quartered at two little Towns within a mile, but my
Party, who were about 800 were ſo diſperſed in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſuch rich Prizes, that I could not poſſibly go any
further; but having ſuch conſiderable Priſoners,
thought it moſt convenient to march away with
them. The enemy were about 4000. who are all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed.
Some of our party have gotten 500. 300.
200. 100 pounds a peece, and none of them but well
rewarded for their ſervice. I deſire the Lord to give
us hearts to be truly thankfull to him for this and all
other his mercies towards us. I am</p>
