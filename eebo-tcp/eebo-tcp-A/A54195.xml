            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE, BEING A SUMMARY ACCOUNT Of the DIVERS <hi>Diſpenſations of God</hi> TO MEN,</head>
            <head type="sub">FROM The Beginning of the World to That of our preſent Age, by the Miniſtry and Teſtimony of his Faithful Servant <hi>George For,</hi> as an Introduction to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Journal.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DIVERS have been the <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> of God ſince the Creation of the <hi>World</hi> unto the Sons of <hi>Men;</hi> But the Great <hi>End</hi> of all of them has been the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of his own Excellent Name in the Creation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of Man:</hi> Man, the <hi>Emblem</hi> of himſelf, as a God on Earth and the <hi>Glory</hi> of all his Works. The World began with <hi>Innocency:</hi> All was then good that the good God had made: And as he bleſſed the Works of his hands, ſo their <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> magnified him their <hi>Creator.</hi> Then the Morning Stars Sang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:36281:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for <hi>Joy,</hi> and all parts of his Works ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to his <hi>Law.</hi> Not a <hi>Jarr</hi> in the whole Frame, but Man in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the <hi>Beaſts</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> the <hi>Fowl</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Fiſh</hi> in the <hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>Lights</hi> in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Earth;</hi> yea the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> Worſhipped, praiſed and exalted his Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs. O <hi>Holy Sabbath,</hi> O <hi>Holy Day</hi> to the Lord!</p>
            <p>But this Happy State laſted not long: For Man, the Crown and Glory of the Whole, being tempted to aſpire <hi>above</hi> his place, unhappily yielded againſt <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> as well as <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Felicity;</hi> and ſo fell below it, loſt the Divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the Wiſdom, Power and Purity he was made in. By which, being no longer fit for <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> he was <hi>expelled</hi> that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God, his proper Dwelling and Reſidence, and was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, as a poor <hi>Vagabond,</hi> from the preſence of the Lord, to wander in the Earth, the Habitation of <hi>Beaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet God, that made him had pitty on him; for He ſeeing he was deceived, and that it was not of <hi>Malice,</hi> or an <hi>Original Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> in him, but through the Subtilty of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> (that had firſt fallen from his own State, and by the Mediation of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> man's own Nature and Companion, whom the Serpent had firſt deluded) in his infinite Goodneſs and Wiſdom found out a way to <hi>Repair</hi> the <hi>Breach, Recover</hi> the <hi>Loſs,</hi> and <hi>Reſtore</hi> fallen Man again by a <hi>Nobler and more Excellent</hi> Adam, promiſed to be born of a <hi>Woman;</hi> that as by means of a <hi>Woman</hi> the evil one had prevailed upon <hi>Man,</hi> by a <hi>Woman</hi> alſo He ſhould come into the World, who would <hi>prevail</hi> againſt him and <hi>bruiſe his Head,</hi> and deliver Man from his Power: And which, in a ſignal manner, by the Diſpenſation of the Son of God in the Fleſh, in the fullneſs of Time, was <hi>perſonally</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> accompliſhed by him, and in him, as Man's <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his Power was not limitted, in the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of it, to that time; for both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>ſince</hi> his bleſſed <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> He has been the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> of all that ever feared God: Preſent with them in their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, followed them in their Travels and Afflictions, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and carried them through and over the Difficulties that have attended them in their <hi>Earthly Pilgrimage.</hi> By this <hi>Abel</hi>'s heart excelled <hi>Cains,</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> obtained the preheminence, and <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God. It was this that ſtrove with the <hi>Old World,</hi> and which they rebelled againſt, and which ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inſtructed <hi>Noah</hi> to Salvation.</p>
            <p>But the outward <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> that followed the benighted <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> after his Fall, eſpecially among the <hi>Patriarcks,</hi> was generally that of <hi>Angels;</hi> as the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> do in many places expreſs, as to <hi>Abraham, Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. The next
<pb facs="tcp:36281:2"/>
was that of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was alſo delivered by <hi>Angels,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us. This <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> was much outward, and ſuited to a low and ſervil State; called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of a <hi>School-Maſter,</hi> to point out and prepare that People to look and long for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who would deliver them from the ſervitude of a <hi>Ceremonious</hi> and imperfect <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> by knowing the Realities of thoſe Miſterious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations in themſelves. In this time the Law was written on <hi>Stone,</hi> the Temple built with <hi>Hands</hi> attended with an outward <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi> and <hi>External Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that were <hi>Shadows of the Good Things that were to come,</hi> and were only to ſerve till the <hi>Seed</hi> came, or the more excellent and general manifeſtation of Chriſt, to whom was the Promiſe, and to all Men only in him, in whom it was <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> even <hi>Life</hi> from <hi>Death, Immortality</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the <hi>Prophets</hi> foreſaw, and comforted the believing <hi>Jews</hi> in the certainty of it; which was the <hi>Top</hi> of the Moſaical <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> and which ended in <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtery, the Forerunner of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as <hi>John</hi>'s was finiſhed in him, the <hi>Fullneſs</hi> of all. And God, that at ſundry Times and in divers manners had ſpoken to the Fathers by his Servants the Prophets, Spoak then by his <hi>Son Chriſt Jeſus, Who is Heir of all things;</hi> being the Goſpel-Day, which is the Diſpenſation of <hi>Sonſhip:</hi> Bringing in thereby a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Teſtament and a better hope; even the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Glory</hi> of the latter days, and of the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of all things; yea, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of the Kingdom unto</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Now the Spirit, that was more ſparingly communicated in former Diſpenſations, began to be <hi>Poured forth upon all Fleſh,</hi> according to the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> that ſhined in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> or but <hi>dimly before,</hi> the moſt gracious God cauſed to <hi>Shine out of Darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Day-ſtar</hi> began to ariſe in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> giving unto them the knowledge of God in the Face (or Appearance) of his <hi>Son Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Meek,</hi> the true <hi>Mourners,</hi> the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi> and <hi>Thirſty</hi> after <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Peace-makers,</hi> the <hi>Pure in Heart,</hi> the <hi>Merciful</hi> and the <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> came more eſpecially in Remembrance before the Lord, and were ſought out and bleſſed by <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s true <hi>Shepherd.</hi> Old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with her Children grew out of Date, and the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into Requeſt, the <hi>Mother</hi> of the Sons of the <hi>Goſpel-Day.</hi> Wherefore no more at Old <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> nor at the Mountain of <hi>Samaria,</hi> will God be worſhipped above other places; for, behold, he is declared and preached a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and he will be known as ſuch, and worſhipped in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth.</hi> He will come nearer then of old time, and he will write his <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and put his Fear and Spirit in the <hi>inward parts,</hi> according to his promiſe. Then <hi>Signs, Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> flew away, the Day having diſcovered their Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
<pb facs="tcp:36281:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in not reaching to the inſide of the <hi>Cup,</hi> to the <hi>cleanſing</hi> of the Conſcience; and all Elementary ſervices were expired in and and by him that is the ſubſtance of all.</p>
            <p>And to this Great and Bleſſed End of the Diſpenſation of the Son of God, did the Apoſtles Teſtifie, whom he had choſen and anointed by his Spirit, to turn the <hi>Jews</hi> from their Prejudice and Superſtition, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from their Vanity and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to Chriſt's <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> that ſhined in them; that they might be <hi>quickned</hi> from the Sins and Treſpaſſes in which they were Dead, to ſerve the Living God in the <hi>Newneſs</hi> of the Spirit of Life, and walk as Children of the <hi>Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Day,</hi> even the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Holineſs:</hi> For ſuch <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> the Light of the World, <hi>and make no more Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof.</hi> So that the <hi>Light, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace that comes</hi> by Chriſt, and appears in Man, was what the Apoſtles mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from, and turned Peoples Minds unto, and in which they gathered and built up the Churches of Chriſt in their Day. For which cauſe they adviſed them not to <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but <hi>wait</hi> for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Speak</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Walk</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> too, as that which approved them the truly begotten Children of God; <hi>born, not of Fleſh and Blood, or of the will of Man, but of the will of God;</hi> by doing his will, and denying their own; by drinking of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Cup,</hi> and being Baptized with <hi>his Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Self-denial:</hi> The Way and Path that all the Heirs of Life have trod to Bleſſedneſs. But alas! even in the Apoſtles Days, (thoſe bright Stars of the <hi>firſt</hi> Magnitude of the Goſpel Light) ſome Clouds (foretelling an <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of this Primitive Glory) began to appear, and ſeveral of them gave early Caution of it to the Chriſtians of their Time; that even then there was, and yet would be more and more, a <hi>falling away</hi> from the Power of Godlineſs and the Purity of that Spiritual Diſpenſation, by ſuch as ſought to make a fair <hi>ſhew in the Fleſh,</hi> but with whom the offence of the Croſs ceaſed: Yet with this comfortable Concluſion, that they ſaw beyond it a more glorious Time than ever, to the true Church. Their ſight was true, and what they foretold to the Churches, gathered by them in the Name and Power of Jeſus, came ſo to paſs: For Chriſtians degenerated a-pace into outſides, as <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Meats,</hi> and divers other <hi>Cerimonies.</hi> And which was worſe, they fell into <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> about them, <hi>ſeparating</hi> one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then <hi>Envying,</hi> and, as they had Power, <hi>Perſecuting</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the ſhame and ſcandal of their common Chriſtianity, and grievous ſtumbling and offence of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> among whom the Lord had ſo long and ſo marvellouſly preſerved them. And having got at laſt the Worldly Power into their Hands, by Kings and Emperors embracing the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion,</hi> they changed what they could, the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is not of this World, into a <hi>Worldly Kingdom;</hi> or at leaſt ſtiled the <hi>Worldly Kingdom</hi> that was in their Hands the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:3"/>
and ſo they became <hi>Worldly,</hi> and not true Chriſtians. Then <hi>Humane Inventions</hi> and <hi>Novelties,</hi> both in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> crowded faſt into the Church; a Door being opened thereunto by the Groſſneſs and Carnality that appeared then among the generality of Chriſtians; who had long ſince left the Guidance of God's meek and heavenly Spirit, and given themſelves up to <hi>Superſtition, Will-worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Voluntary Humility.</hi> And as <hi>Superſtition</hi> is <hi>Blind,</hi> ſo it is <hi>Heady</hi> and <hi>Furious;</hi> for all muſt ſtoop to its blind and boundleſs <hi>Zeal</hi> or <hi>Periſh</hi> by it: In the Name of the Spirit, perſecuting the very appearance of the Spirit of God in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and oppoſing that in them which they reſiſted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Light, Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but always under the Notion of <hi>Innovation, Hereſie, Schiſm,</hi> or ſome ſuch plauſible Name. Though Chriſtianity allows of no Name or Pretence whatever for perſecuting of any Man for matters of meer Religion; Religion being in its very Nature, <hi>Meek, Gentle</hi> and <hi>Forbearing;</hi> and conſiſts of <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which no Perſecutor can have, whilſt he remains a Perſecutor; in that a Man cannot believe well, or hope well, or have a charitable or tender regard to another, whilſt he would <hi>violate</hi> his mind or <hi>perſecute</hi> his <hi>Body</hi> for matters of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip</hi> towards his God.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Falſe Church</hi> ſprang up, and mounted the <hi>Chair.</hi> But though ſhe loſt her <hi>Nature,</hi> ſhe would keep her good Name of the <hi>Lambs-bride,</hi> the <hi>True Church</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Faithful;</hi> conſtraining all to receive her <hi>Mark,</hi> either in their Forehead or Righthand, publickly or privately: But Indeed and in Truth ſhe was <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Mother of Harlots:</hi> Mother of thoſe that with all their ſhow and outſide of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were adulterated and gone from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Nature and Life of Chriſt, and grown <hi>Vain, Worldly, Ambitious, Covetous, Cruel,</hi> &amp;c. which are the Fruits of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and not of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it was that the True Church fled into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> that is, from <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> to a <hi>Retired, Solitary</hi> and <hi>lonely State;</hi> hidden and as it <hi>were out of Sight</hi> of Men, though not out of the World: Which ſhows that her wonted <hi>Viſibility</hi> was not <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the Being of a <hi>True Church</hi> in the Judgment of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſhe being as True a Church in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> though not as <hi>Viſible</hi> and <hi>Luſtrious,</hi> as when ſhe was in her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Splendor of Profeſſion. In this State many <hi>Attempts</hi> She made to return, but the Waters were yet too High, and her way blocked up, and many of her excellent Children in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Centuries</hi> fell by the Cruelty of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> becauſe they would not fall from their <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to the Truth.</p>

The laſt Age did ſet ſome ſteps towards it, both as to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> But <hi>Practice</hi> quickly failed, for <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> flowed in a little time, as well among the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the <hi>Reformation</hi> as thoſe they reformed from; ſo that by the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Converſation</hi> they were not to be diſtinguiſhed. And the Children of the <hi>Reformers,</hi> if not the <hi>Reformers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, betook themſelves very early to <hi>Earthly Policy</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to uphold and carry on their <hi>Reformation</hi> that had been begun with <hi>Spiritual Weapons;</hi> which I have often thought, has been one of the greateſt reaſons the Reformation made no better <hi>Progreſs,</hi> as to the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of Religion: For whilſt the <hi>Reformers</hi> were <hi>Lowly</hi> and <hi>Spiritually Minded,</hi> and truſted in <hi>God,</hi> and lookt to <hi>Him,</hi> and lived in his <hi>Fear,</hi> and conſulted not with <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> nor ſought Deliverance in their own way, there were daily added to the Church ſuch as, one might reaſonably ſay, ſhould be ſaved. For they were not ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be ſafe from <hi>Perſecution</hi> as to be Faithful under it.</p>
            <p>Being more concerned to ſpread the <hi>Truth</hi> by their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> in <hi>Tribulation,</hi> than to get the worldly Power out of their Hands that inflicted their Sufferings upon them; and it will be well if the Lord ſuffer them not to fall by the <hi>very ſame way</hi> they took to ſtand. In <hi>Doctrine</hi> they were in ſome things ſhort, in other things, to avoid one extream they run into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And for <hi>Worſhip,</hi> there was for the generality, more of <hi>Man</hi> than <hi>God.</hi> They owned the <hi>Spirit, Inſpiration</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> indeed, and grounded their <hi>Seperation</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> upon the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding</hi> they received from it, in the <hi>Reading</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> and this was their Plea, <hi>the Scripture was the</hi> Text, <hi>the Spirit the</hi> Interpreter, <hi>and that to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one for himſelf.</hi> But yet there was too much of humane <hi>Invention, Tradition</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> that remained both in <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> and of worldly <hi>Authority</hi> and worldly <hi>Greatneſs</hi> in their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> eſpecially in this Kingdom, <hi>Sweden, Denmark</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> God was therefore pleaſed among us, to ſhift from <hi>Veſſel</hi> to <hi>Veſſel:</hi> And the next remove <hi>humbled</hi> the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> ſo that they were more <hi>Strict</hi> in <hi>Preaching, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi> in <hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>Zealous</hi> for keeping the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Repeating</hi> at Home in their <hi>Families</hi> what they had heard in publick.</p>
            <p>But even as theſe grew into <hi>Power,</hi> they were not only for <hi>Whipping</hi> ſome out, but others into the <hi>Temple:</hi> And they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>Rigid</hi> in their <hi>Spirits,</hi> rather than <hi>Severe</hi> in their <hi>Lives,</hi> and more for a <hi>Party</hi> then for <hi>Piety:</hi> Which brought forth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>People,</hi> that were yet <hi>more retired</hi> and ſelect.

            <p>Theſe <hi>People</hi> made alſo Profeſſion of <hi>Neglecting,</hi> if not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing</hi> and <hi>Cenſuring,</hi> not only the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> but uſe of all <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Learning</hi> as to the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> and all other Qualifications to it beſides the <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and common to <hi>Men;</hi> and for a time they ſeemed like <hi>John</hi> of Old, a <hi>Burning</hi> and a <hi>Shining Light,</hi> to other <hi>Societies.</hi>

            <p>Theſe <hi>People</hi> were called <hi>Seekers</hi> by ſome, and the <hi>Family of Love</hi> by others; becauſe, as they came to the knowledge of one another, they ſometimes met together, not <hi>formally</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi> or <hi>Preach,</hi> at appointed times or <hi>Places,</hi> in their own <hi>Wills,</hi> as in times paſt they were accuſtomed to do; but waited together in <hi>Silence,</hi> and as any thing roſe in any one of their Minds that they thought <hi>Savoured</hi> of a <hi>Divine Spring,</hi> ſo they ſometimes <hi>Spoke.</hi> But ſo it was that ſome of them not keeping in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> and in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> after the Abundance of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> were <hi>exalted</hi> above <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and for want of ſtaying their Minds in an humble Dependance upon him that opened their <hi>Underſtandings</hi> to ſee great things in his <hi>Law;</hi> they run out in their own <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and <hi>mixing</hi> them with thoſe <hi>Divine Openings,</hi> brought forth a <hi>Monſtrous Birth;</hi> to the Scandal of thoſe that feared <hi>God,</hi> and waited daily in the <hi>Temple,</hi> not made with Hands, for the <hi>Conſolation</hi> of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the Jew <hi>inward,</hi> and Circumciſion in <hi>Spirit.</hi>

            <p>This <hi>People</hi> obtained the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Ranters</hi> from their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> and <hi>Practices.</hi> For they interpreted <hi>Chriſt's</hi> fullfilling of the Law for us, to be a diſcharging of us from any <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> required, inſtead of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for ſins paſt, upon <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and that now it was no <hi>Sin</hi> to do that which before it was a <hi>Sin</hi> to commit; the ſlaviſh Fear of the <hi>Law</hi> being taken off by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all things good that <hi>Man</hi> did, if he did but do them with the Mind and Perſwaſion <hi>that it was ſo.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that divers fell into <hi>Groſs</hi> and <hi>Enormous Practices;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in excuſe thereof that they could, without <hi>Evil,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame Act which was <hi>Sin</hi> in another to do; <hi>thereby diſtinguiſhing between the Action and the Evil of it, by the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Mind and Intention in the doing of it.</hi> Which was to make Sin <hi>Super-abound</hi> by the aboundings of <hi>Grace,</hi> and to turn from the <hi>Grace of God</hi> into Wantonneſs, a ſecurer way of Sinning than before: As if <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not to <hi>take away</hi> Sin, but that we might Sin <hi>more freely</hi> at his Coſt, and with leſs Danger to our ſelves.

            <p>It was about that very ſame time, as you may ſee in the enſuing <hi>Annales,</hi> that the <hi>Eternal, Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Good God</hi> was pleaſed, in his Infinite <hi>Love,</hi> to Honour and Viſit this benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

And as God had delivered their <hi>Souls</hi> of the wariſom Burthens of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> and enriched their poverty of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and ſatisfied their great <hi>Hungar</hi> and <hi>Thirſt</hi> after <hi>Eternal Righteouſneſs,</hi> and filled them with the <hi>Good Things</hi> of his own <hi>Houſe,</hi> and made them <hi>Stewards</hi> of his Manifold <hi>Gifts;</hi> ſo they went forth to all Quarters of theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> to <hi>Declare</hi> to the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> thereof, <hi>what God had done for them;</hi> what they had found, and where and how they had found it; <hi>viz.

            <p>And as their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> was to the <hi>Principle of God in Man,</hi> the <hi>precious Pearl</hi> and <hi>Leven</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as the only bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed means appointed of God to <hi>Quicken, Convince</hi> and <hi>Sanctifie</hi> Man; ſo they opened to them what it was in it ſelf, and what it was given to them for: <hi>How</hi> they might know it from their own <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that of the <hi>Subtil</hi> appearance of the <hi>Evil one;</hi> and what it would do for all thoſe whoſe minds are turned off from the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> and its <hi>Lifeleſs</hi> ways and <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and ad-hear to this bleſſed <hi>Light</hi> in themſelves, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers and condemns <hi>Sin</hi> in all its appearances, and ſhows how to overcome it, if minded and obeyed in its holy <hi>Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Convictions:</hi> Giving <hi>Power</hi> to ſuch to <hi>Avoid</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt</hi> thoſe things that do not pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> and to grow <hi>Strong</hi> in <hi>Love, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Good Works:</hi> That ſo Man, whom <hi>Sin</hi> hath made as a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> over-run with <hi>Briers</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> might become as the <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> cultivated by his divine <hi>Power,</hi> and repleniſht with the moſt <hi>Virtuous</hi> and <hi>Beautiful Plants</hi> of God's own <hi>Right Hand</hi> Planting, to his Eternal Praiſe.</p>

            <p>It were fitter for a <hi>Volumn</hi> than a <hi>Preface,</hi> but ſo much as to repeat the <hi>Contents</hi> of their cruel <hi>Sufferings</hi> from <hi>Profeſſors</hi> as well as from <hi>Prophaine,</hi> and from <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> as well as the <hi>Rabble,</hi> that it may well be ſaid of this <hi>abuſed</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> they went forth <hi>Weeping</hi> and ſowed in <hi>Tears,</hi> bearing <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to the <hi>Precious Seed,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which ſtands not in <hi>Words,</hi> the Fineſt the Higheſt that Man's <hi>Wit</hi> can uſe, <hi>but in Power;</hi> the Power of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to whom <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> hath given all Power in <hi>Heaven</hi> and in <hi>Earth,</hi> that he might rule <hi>Angels</hi> above, and <hi>Men</hi> below; who impowred them, as their <hi>Work</hi> witneſſeth, by the many that were <hi>turned</hi> through their Miniſtry <hi>from Darkneſs to the Light,</hi> and out of the <hi>Broad</hi> into the <hi>Narrow</hi> Way, bringing <hi>People</hi> to a <hi>Weighty, Serious</hi> and <hi>God-like</hi> Converſation; the <hi>Practice</hi> of that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they <hi>Taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as without this Secret <hi>Divine Power</hi> there is no <hi>Quickning and Regenerating of dead Souls,</hi> ſo the want of this Generating and begetting <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> is the Cauſe of the little <hi>Fruit</hi> that the many Miniſtrys that have been, and are in the World bring forth.

Two things are to be briefly toucht upon, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> they <hi>Taught,</hi> and the <hi>Example</hi> they lead among all <hi>People.</hi> I have already toucht upon their <hi>Fundamental Principle,</hi> which is as the <hi>Corner ſtone</hi> of their <hi>Fabrick:</hi> And to ſpeak eminently and properly, their <hi>Characteriſtick,</hi> or main diſtinguiſhing <hi>Point</hi> or <hi>Principle,</hi> viz. the <hi>Light of Chriſt within,</hi> as God's Gift for Man's <hi>Salvation.</hi> This I ſay, is as the <hi>Root</hi> of the goodly Tree of <hi>Doctrines</hi> that grew and branched out from it, which I ſhall now mention in their <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Experimental</hi> Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Repentance from dead Works to ſerve the Living God.</hi> Which comprehends three Operations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> a ſight of <hi>Sin. Secondly,</hi> A <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> for it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An <hi>Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the Time to come. This was the <hi>Repentance</hi> they preached and preſſed, and a Natural reſult from the <hi>Principle</hi> they turned all People unto. For of <hi>Light</hi> came <hi>Sight;</hi> and of <hi>Sight</hi> came <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Sorrow;</hi> and of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> came <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentment</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> Which <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Repentance leads to <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> that is, <hi>Forgiveneſs of the Sins that are paſt through Chriſt the alone Propitiation and the Sanctification or Purgation of the Soul from the defiling Nature and Habits of ſin preſent;</hi> which is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the compleat <hi>Senſe</hi> of that <hi>Word;</hi> comprehending both juſtification from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of the <hi>Sins</hi> that are paſt, as if they had never been commited, through the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy of God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and the <hi>Creatures</hi> being made inwardly juſt through the <hi>Cleanſing</hi> and <hi>Sanctifying Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt revealed in the <hi>Soul;</hi> which is commonly called <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence ſprang a <hi>Second</hi> Doctrine they were led to declare, as the <hi>Mark of the Price of the High Calling</hi> of all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> viz. <hi>Perfection from ſin,</hi> according to the Scriptures of Truth, which teſtifie it to be the <hi>end of Chriſt's coming</hi> and the <hi>Nature of his Kingdom,</hi> and for which his <hi>Spirit</hi> was given. But they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver held a <hi>Perfection</hi> in Wiſdom and Glory in this <hi>Life,</hi> or from <hi>Natural Infirmities</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> as ſome have with a weak or ill mind, imagined and inſinuated againſt them.</p>
            <p>This they called a <hi>Redeemed State, Regeneration,</hi> or the <hi>New-Birth:</hi> Teaching every where, according to their <hi>Foundation,</hi> that without this <hi>Work</hi> were known, there was no inheriting the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third,</hi> To an acknowledgment of <hi>Eternal Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> as they have good Reaſon; for elſe of all People, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they muſt be the <hi>moſt Miſerable:</hi> Who for about <hi>Forty Years,</hi> have been exceeding great Sufferers for their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and in ſome Caſes, treated <hi>worſe</hi> then the <hi>worſt</hi> of Men; yea, as the <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Off-ſcowering</hi> of all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:7"/>
This was the <hi>Purport</hi> of their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> which, for the moſt part, is what other <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of Chriſtianity pretend to hold in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> but not in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> that has been long loſt by Mens departing from that <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Seed of Life,</hi> that is in Man and which Man has not regarded, but loſt the <hi>Senſe</hi> of; and in and by which he can only be quickned in his <hi>Mind</hi> to ſerve the <hi>living God</hi> in <hi>Newneſs</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> For as the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> was loſt, and the generality lived and <hi>Worſhipped God</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own Wills, and not after the Will of <hi>God,</hi> nor the mind of Chriſt, which ſtood in the <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> ſo that which they preſt, was not <hi>Notion</hi> but <hi>Experience,</hi> no <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality</hi> but <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> as being ſenſible in themſelves, through the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God's Righteous Judgments,</hi> that <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhould ever ſee the Lord</hi> with Comfort.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and out of them, as the larger <hi>Branches,</hi> there ſprang forth ſeveral particular <hi>Doctrines,</hi> that did exemplifie and further explain the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the General Doctrine before obſerved, in their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Examples.</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>loving one another.</hi> This is a noted <hi>Mark</hi> in the <hi>Mouth</hi> of all ſorts of People concerning them. <hi>They will meet, They will help and ſtick one to another.</hi> Whence it is common to hear ſome ſay, <hi>Look how the Quakers love and take care of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Others leſs Moderate will ſay, <hi>The Quakers love none but themſelves,</hi> and if <hi>loving one another</hi> and having an <hi>Intimate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> and conſtant care to meet to <hi>Worſhip God</hi> and help one another, be any Mark of <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi> they had it, Bleſſed be the Lord, in an ample manner.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>To love Enemies:</hi> This they both <hi>Taught</hi> and <hi>Practiſed:</hi> For they did not only refuſe to be revenged for <hi>Injuries</hi> done them, and condemned it as of an <hi>Unchriſtian Spirit,</hi> but they did freely <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,</hi> yea, <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Relieve</hi> thoſe that had been <hi>Cruel</hi> to them, when it was in their <hi>Power</hi> to have been even with them; of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſingular <hi>Inſtances</hi> might be given: Endeavouring, through <hi>Patience,</hi> to overcome all <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and Preaching this <hi>Doctrine</hi> as <hi>Chriſtian</hi> for others to follow.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The Sufficiency of Truth ſpeaking,</hi> according to Chriſt's own form of Words, of <hi>Yea, Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay, Nay,</hi> among Chriſtians without <hi>Swearing,</hi> both from Chriſt's expreſs Prohibition <hi>to Swear at all.</hi> Mat. 5. And for that they being under the <hi>Tye and Bond of Truth in themſelves,</hi> there was both no Neceſſity for an <hi>Oath,</hi> and it would be a <hi>Reproach</hi> to their Chriſtian Veracity to <hi>Aſſure</hi> their <hi>Truth</hi> by ſuch an Extraordinary way of Speaking: But offering at the ſame time, to be punniſht to the full, for falſe <hi>Speaking,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for <hi>Perjury,</hi> if ever guilty of it; and hereby they exclude, with all <hi>True,</hi> all <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Prophane Swearing;</hi> for which the <hi>Land</hi> did and doth <hi>Mourn,</hi> and the great God was and is not a little offended with it.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:36281:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
IV. <hi>Not Fighting</hi> but <hi>Suffering,</hi> is another Teſtimony peculiar to this People: They affirm that Chriſtianity teacheth People <hi>To beat their Swords into Plough Shears, and their Spears into Pruning Hooks, and to learn War no more, that ſo the Wolf may lie down with the Lamb, and the Lyon with the Calf, and nothing that deſtroys be entertained in the Hearts of People;</hi> exhorting them to employ their <hi>Zeal</hi> againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> and turn their <hi>Anger</hi> againſt <hi>Satan,</hi> and no longer <hi>War</hi> one againſt another; becauſe, all <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings</hi> come of Mens own <hi>Hearts Luſts,</hi> according to the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> and not of the <hi>Meek Spirit</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus who is Captain of <hi>another Warfare,</hi> and which is carried on with <hi>other Weapons.</hi> Thus, as <hi>Truth</hi> ſpeaking ſucceeded Swearing, ſo <hi>Faith and Truth ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fighting,</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practiſe</hi> of this <hi>People.</hi> Nor ought they for this to be Obnoxious to <hi>Civil Government,</hi> ſince if they cannot Fight for it, neither <hi>can they Fight againſt it;</hi> which is no mean ſecurity to the State: Nor is it reaſonable that People ſhould be blamed for not doing more for others than they can do for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſet aſide, if the <hi>Coſts</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of War were well conſidered, <hi>Peace,</hi> with its <hi>Inconveniencies,</hi> is generally <hi>Preferable.</hi> But though they were not for <hi>Fighting,</hi> they were for <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to <hi>Government;</hi> and that, <hi>not only for Fear, but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Sake,</hi> where <hi>Government</hi> doth not <hi>interfere</hi> with <hi>Conſcience:</hi> Believing it to be an <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> and where it is juſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, a great <hi>Benefit</hi> to Minkind: Tho' it has been their <hi>Lot,</hi> through blind <hi>Zeal</hi> in ſome, and <hi>Intereſt</hi> in others, to have felt the <hi>Strokes</hi> of it with greater <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Rigour</hi> than any other <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> in this Age; whilſt they, of all others (Religion ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide) have given the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> the <hi>leaſt occaſion of Trouble</hi> in the Diſcharge of his Office.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Another part of the <hi>Character</hi> of this People is, <hi>They refuſe to pay Tythes,</hi> or <hi>Maintenance to a National Miniſtry,</hi> and that for two Reaſons; The one is, that they believe all <hi>compelled Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> even to <hi>Goſpel Miniſters,</hi> to be <hi>Unlawful,</hi> becauſe <hi>expreſly contrary</hi> to Chriſt's Command, who ſaid, <hi>Freely you have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, freely give:</hi> At leaſt, that the Maintenance of <hi>Goſpel Miniſters</hi> ſhould be <hi>free</hi> and not <hi>forced.</hi> The other Reaſon of their <hi>Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> is, Becauſe thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> are not <hi>Goſpel ones,</hi> in that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is not their <hi>Foundation,</hi> but <hi>Humane Arts and Parts:</hi> So that it is not matter of <hi>Humor</hi> or <hi>Sullenneſs,</hi> but <hi>pure Conſcience</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, that they cannot help to ſupport <hi>National Miniſters</hi> where they dwell, which are but too much and too viſibly become ways of <hi>Worldly Advantage</hi> and <hi>Preferment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Not to reſpect Perſons,</hi> was another of their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> for which they were <hi>often Buffeted</hi> and <hi>Abuſed.</hi> They Affirmed it to be ſinful to give <hi>Flattering Titles,</hi> or to uſe <hi>Vain Geſtures</hi> and <hi>Complements</hi> of <hi>Reſpect;</hi> tho' to <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> they ever made a <hi>Difference,</hi> but after their <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Homely Manner,</hi> yet ſincere and ſubſtantial way; well remembering the
<pb facs="tcp:36281:8"/>
Example of <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Elihu,</hi> but more eſpecially the <hi>Command</hi> of their Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who forbad his Followers to call Men <hi>Rabby,</hi> which implies <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> alſo the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable Greetings</hi> and <hi>Salutations</hi> of thoſe Times; that ſo <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> to which the proud Mind of Man is incident, in his fallen Eſtate, might not be Indulged but Rebuked.</p>
            <p>They alſo uſed the Plain <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon, whatever was his <hi>Degree</hi> among Men. And indeed the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> was much ſeen, in bringing forth this People in ſo Plain an <hi>Appearance;</hi> for it was a <hi>Cloſe</hi> and <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Teſt</hi> upon the Spirit of thoſe they came among; ſhewing their Inſides and what predominated, notwithſtanding their High and Great Profeſſion of <hi>Religion.</hi> This, among the reſt, ſounded ſo harſh to many of them, and they took it ſo ill, that they would ſay, <hi>Thou me, Thou my Dog: If thou thoueſt me, I'le thou thy Teeth down thy Throat,</hi> forgetting the <hi>Language</hi> they uſe to God in their own <hi>Prayers,</hi> and the common Stile of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and that it is an abſolute and eſſential <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>Speech:</hi> And what good had their <hi>Religion</hi> done them, who were ſo ſenſibly toucht with <hi>Indignation</hi> for the uſe of this <hi>Plain, Honeſt,</hi> and <hi>True Speech?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. They recommended <hi>Silence</hi> by their Example, having very few words upon all Occaſions: They were <hi>at a Word</hi> in <hi>Dealing;</hi> nor could their <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> many Words tempt them from it; having more regard for <hi>Truth</hi> than <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> to Example then <hi>Gain,</hi> they ſought <hi>Solitude;</hi> but when in <hi>Company,</hi> they would neither uſe nor willingly hear <hi>Unneceſſary</hi> as well as <hi>Unlawful Diſcourſes;</hi> whereby they preſerved their Minds pure and undiſturbed from unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Diverſions:</hi> Nor could they humour the Cuſtom of <hi>Good Night, Good Morrow, God Speed;</hi> for they knew the <hi>Night</hi> was <hi>Good,</hi> and the <hi>Day</hi> was <hi>Good,</hi> without wiſhing of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that in the other Expreſſion, the <hi>Holy Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was too lightly and unthinkingly uſed, and therefore taken in <hi>Vain.</hi> Beſides, they were Words and Wiſhes of <hi>Courſe,</hi> and are uſually as little meant, as are <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> in the Cuſtom of <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Knee;</hi> and ſuperfluity in thoſe as well as in other things was Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom to them; and therefore They did not only decline to uſe them, but found themſelves often preſt to reprove the Practice.</p>
            <p>For the ſame reaſon they forbore <hi>Drinking to People, or Pledging of them,</hi> as the manner of the World is: A Practice that is not only Unneceſſary, but they thought <hi>Evil</hi> in the <hi>Tendencies</hi> of it; being a <hi>Provocation</hi> to <hi>Drinking</hi> more than did <hi>People Good,</hi> as well as that it was in it ſelf <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. Their way of <hi>Marriage</hi> is peculiar to them; and is a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing</hi> Practice from all other Societies profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> They ſay that <hi>Marriage</hi> is an <hi>Ordinance of God, and that God only can rightly join Man and Woman in Marriage.</hi> Therefore they uſe
<pb facs="tcp:36281:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neither <hi>Prieſt</hi> nor <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> but the <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> concern'd take each other as <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> in the preſence of divers Credible Witneſſes, <hi>promiſing unto each other with God's Aſſiſtance, to be Loving and Faithful in that Relation till Death ſhall ſeparate them.</hi> But, antecedent to all this, They firſt preſent themſelves to the <hi>Monthly Meeting</hi> for the Affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> where they reſide; There declaring their <hi>Intentions</hi> to take one another as <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> if the ſaid Meeting have nothing material to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt it. They are conſtantly askt the neceſſary <hi>Queſtions,</hi> as in Caſe of <hi>Parents,</hi> or <hi>Guardians</hi> if they have acquainted them with their <hi>Intention,</hi> and have their <hi>Conſent,</hi> &amp;c. The Method of the <hi>Meeting</hi> is to take a Minute thereof, and to appoint <hi>Proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to enquire of their <hi>Converſation</hi> and <hi>Clearneſs</hi> from all others, and whether they have diſcharged their <hi>Duty</hi> to their <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Guardians;</hi> and make report thereof the next <hi>Monthly Meeting;</hi> where the ſame Parties are deſired to give their Attendance. In caſe it appears they proceeded Orderly, the Meeting paſſes their <hi>Propoſal,</hi> and ſo <hi>Records</hi> it in their Meeting Book; and in Caſe the Woman be a <hi>Widow</hi> and hath Children, due care is there taken, that Proviſion alſo be made by her for the <hi>Orphans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid <hi>Marriage;</hi> adviſing the Parties concerned to appoint a convenient Time and place, and to give fitting Notice to their <hi>Relations,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Neighbours,</hi> as they deſire ſhould be the Witneſſes of their <hi>Marriage:</hi> Where they take one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Hand, and by Name promiſing Reciprocally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Manner before expreſſed. Of all which <hi>Proceedings,</hi> a <hi>Narative,</hi> in a way of <hi>Certificate,</hi> is made, to which the ſaid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties firſt ſet their Hands, thereby making it their <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Deed;</hi> and then divers of the <hi>Relations, Spectators</hi> and <hi>Auditors</hi> ſet their Names as <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of what they Said and Signed. Which <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate,</hi> is afterward <hi>Regiſtred</hi> in the <hi>Record</hi> belonging to the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> where the Marriage is Solemnized. Which Regular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod has been, as it deſerves, adjudged in <hi>Courts of Law a good Marriage,</hi> where it has been Diſputed and Conteſted, for want of the accuſtomed Formality of <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> they have Refuſed, not out of <hi>Humour,</hi> but <hi>Conſcience</hi> reaſonably grounded, in as much as no Scripture Example tells us, that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had any other part of <hi>Old Time,</hi> than that of a <hi>Witneſs</hi> among the reſt, before whom the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to take one another: And therefore this People look upon it as an <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to advance the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Profits</hi> of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> And for the uſe of the <hi>Ring,</hi> it is enough to ſay that it was an <hi>Heathen</hi> and vain <hi>Cuſtom.</hi> and never in Practice among the People of God, <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Primitive Chriſtans.</hi> The words of the Uſual form, as <hi>With my Body I thee Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. are hardly defenſible: In ſhort, they are more Careful, Exact and Regular than any Form now uſed, and it is Free of the inconveniencies other Methods are attended with.

VIII.

            <p n="9">IX. Their <hi>Burials</hi> are performed with the ſame <hi>Simplicity.</hi> If the <hi>Corps</hi> of the Deceaſed be near any publick <hi>Meeting Place,</hi> it is uſually carried thither, for the more convenient <hi>Reception</hi> of thoſe that Accompany it to the <hi>Ground</hi> they <hi>Bury</hi> in, and it ſo falls out ſometimes, that while the <hi>Meeting</hi> is gathering for the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> ſome or other have a <hi>Word of Exhortation,</hi> for the ſake of the People there met together: After which, the <hi>Body</hi> is borne away by the Young Men, or thoſe that are of their Neighbourhood, or that were moſt of the Intimacy of the <hi>Deceaſed Party:</hi> The Corps being in a plain <hi>Coffin,</hi> without any <hi>Covering</hi> or <hi>Furniture</hi> upon it. At the <hi>Ground,</hi> they pauſe ſome time before they put the <hi>Body</hi> into its <hi>Grave,</hi> that if any one there ſhould have any thing upon them to exhort the <hi>People,</hi> they may not be diſſappointed, and that the <hi>Relations</hi> may the more <hi>Retiredly</hi> and <hi>Solemnly</hi> take their laſt leave of the <hi>Corps</hi> of their departed <hi>Kindred,</hi> and the <hi>Spectators</hi> have a Senſe of <hi>Mortality,</hi> by the occaſion then given them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon their own <hi>Latter End.</hi> Otherways, they have no ſet <hi>Rites</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> on thoſe Occaſions; neither do the <hi>Kindred</hi> of the <hi>Deceaſed</hi> ever wear <hi>Mourning;</hi> they looking upon it as a <hi>Wordly Ceremony</hi> and piece of <hi>Pomp,</hi> and that what <hi>Mourning</hi> is fit for a Chriſtian to have at the Departure of a beloved <hi>Relation</hi> or <hi>Friend,</hi> ſhould be worn in the <hi>Mind</hi> which is only ſenſible of the <hi>Loſs,</hi> and the Love they had to them, and Remembrance of them, to be outwardly expreſt by a reſpect to their Advice, and care of thoſe they have left behind them, and their Love of that they Loved. Which <hi>Conduct</hi> of theirs, though unmodiſh or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionable, leaves nothing of the Subſtance of things neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or undone; and as they aim at no more, ſo that ſimplicity of <hi>Life</hi> is what they obſerve with great Satisfaction, though it ſometimes happens not to be without the <hi>Mockeries</hi> of the vain World they live in.</p>
            <p>Theſe things gave them a <hi>Rough</hi> and <hi>Diſagreeable</hi> Appearance with the Generality; who thought them <hi>Turners of the World upſide down,</hi> as indeed, in ſome Senſe they were; but in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that wherein <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo charged, <hi>viz. To bring things back into their Primitive and right Order again.</hi> For theſe and ſuch like <hi>Practices</hi> of theirs were not the <hi>Reſult</hi> of <hi>Humour,</hi> as ſome have fancied, but a Fruit of <hi>Inward Senſe,</hi> which God,
<pb facs="tcp:36281:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
through his <hi>Fear,</hi> had begotten in them. They did not conſider how to contradict the <hi>World,</hi> or diſtinguiſh themſelves; being none of their Buſineſs, as it was not their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> no, it was not the Reſult of <hi>Conſultation,</hi> or a framed deſign to declare or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend <hi>Schiſm</hi> or <hi>Novelty.</hi> But God having given them a ſight of themſelves, they ſaw the <hi>whole World</hi> in the ſame <hi>Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> and ſenſibly diſcerned the <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi> of Men, and the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi> of <hi>Things.</hi> What gratified the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye and the Pride of Life which are not of the Father, but of the World;</hi> and from thence Sprang in that <hi>Night</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> which hath been over People, through their Degeneration from the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, theſe and many other vain Cuſtoms; which are ſeen by the Heavenly day of Chriſt which dawns in the Soul, to be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrong in their <hi>Original,</hi> or, by <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Abuſe,</hi> Hurtful in their <hi>Practice.</hi> And though theſe things ſeemed <hi>Trivial</hi> to ſome, and rendered this People <hi>Stingy</hi> and conceited in ſuch Perſons <hi>Opinions;</hi> there was and is more in them than they were aware of. It was not very eaſie to our <hi>Primitive Friends,</hi> to make themſelves <hi>Sights</hi> and <hi>Spectacles,</hi> and the <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Deriſion</hi> of the World; which they eaſily foreſaw muſt be the Conſequence of ſo <hi>Unfaſhionable</hi> a <hi>Converſation</hi> in it.

            <p>And though they were not <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> in the <hi>Eſteem</hi> of this <hi>World</hi> (for then they had not wanted <hi>Followers</hi> upon their own <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Authority)</hi> yet they were generally of the <hi>moſt Sober</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Perſwaſions</hi> they were in, and of the <hi>moſt Repute</hi> for <hi>Religion;</hi> and many of them of <hi>good Capacity, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Account</hi> among Men.</p>
            <p>And alſo ſome among them neither wanted for <hi>Parts, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> nor <hi>Eſtate;</hi> though then, as of Old, <hi>not many Wife, nor No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> &amp;c. were called, or at leaſt received the <hi>Heavenly Call;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Croſs</hi> that attended the Profeſſion of it in <hi>Sincerity:</hi> But neither do <hi>Parts</hi> or Learning make Men the better <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> though the better <hi>Orators</hi> and <hi>Diſputants;</hi> and it is the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of People about the <hi>Divine Gift</hi> that cauſes that vulgar

Why ſhould they not turn to the Lord with all their <hi>Hearts,</hi> and ſay from the <hi>Heart, Speak Lord, for now thy poor Servants hear. Oh! that thy will may be done, thy Great, thy Good and Holy will in Earth as it is in Heaven:</hi> Do it in us, do it upon us, do what thou wilt with us, for we are thine and deſire to glorifie thee our <hi>Creator,</hi> both for that, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art our <hi>Redeemer;</hi> for thou art redeeming us from the <hi>Earth;</hi> from the <hi>Vanities</hi> and <hi>Pollations</hi> of it, to be a <hi>Peculiar People</hi> unto thee.

            <p>But thou haſt <hi>Evilly</hi> entreated and requited them. Thou haſt ſet at naught all their <hi>Counſel,</hi> and would have none of their <hi>Reproof,</hi> as thou ſhouldeſt have done. Their appearance was too <hi>Straight,</hi> and their qualifications were to <hi>Mean</hi> for thee to receive them; who like the <hi>Jews of Old,</hi> that cryed, <hi>Is not this the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Son, and are not his Brethren among us; which of the Scribes, of the Learned (the Orthodox) believe in him?</hi> Propheſying their <hi>fall</hi> in a year or two, and making and executing of ſevere <hi>Laws</hi> to bring it to paſs; by endeavouring to terrifie them out of their <hi>Holy way,</hi> or diſtroying them for abiding <hi>Faithful</hi> to it. But thou haſt ſeen how many <hi>Governments</hi> that riſe againſt them, and determined their <hi>Downfal,</hi> have been <hi>overturned</hi> and <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,</hi> and that they are <hi>ſtill</hi> preſerved, and become a <hi>great</hi> and a conſiderable <hi>People,</hi> among the Middle ſort of thy nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inhabitants. And notwithſtanding the many difficulties <hi>without</hi> and <hi>within,</hi> which they have Laboured <hi>under,</hi> ſince the Lord God Eternal firſt gathered them, they are an <hi>encreaſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> the Lord ſtill adding unto them, in divers <hi>Parts,</hi> ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, if they perſevere to the End. And to thee; were they and are they lifted up as a <hi>Standard,</hi> and as a <hi>City</hi> ſet upon a <hi>Hill,</hi> and to the Nations round about thee, that in <hi>their Light,</hi> thou may'ſt come to ſee <hi>Light,</hi> even in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Light of the World;</hi> and therefore thy <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> too, if thou wouldſt but turn from thy many evil ways, and receive and obey it. For in the <hi>Light of the Lamb, muſt the Nations of them that are ſaved walk,</hi> as the Scriptures Teſtify.</p>
            <p>Remember, O Nation of great <hi>Profeſſion!</hi> How the Lord has waited upon thee ſince the Days of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the many <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> with which he has pleaded with Thee; and <hi>awake</hi> and <hi>ariſe</hi> out of thy <hi>deep Sleep,</hi> and yet hear (his <hi>Word</hi> in thy <hi>Heart)</hi> that thou may'ſt live.</p>
            <p>Let not this thy day of <hi>Viſitation</hi> paſs over thy Head, nor neglect thou ſo great <hi>Salvation</hi> as is this which is come to thy Houſe, Oh <hi>England!</hi> For why ſhould'ſt thou die, Oh <hi>Land</hi> that God deſires to Bleſs?

I. They were <hi>changed</hi> Men themſelves before they went about to <hi>change</hi> others. Their <hi>Hearts</hi> were rent as well as their <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and they knew the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Work of God</hi> upon them. And this was ſeen by the great Alteration it made, and their ſtricter Courſe of Life, and more Godly Converſation, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They went not forth or <hi>Preached</hi> in their own <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> but in the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and Spoke not their own <hi>ſtuddied Matter,</hi> but as they were opened and moved of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> with which they were well acquainted in their own Converſion; which cannot be expreſt to <hi>Carnal Men</hi> ſo as to give them any intelligible account; for to ſuch it is as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>like the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wind, which no Man knows whence it cometh, or whether it goeth:</hi> Yet this Proof and Seal went along with their Miniſtry, that <hi>many were turned</hi> from their <hi>Life-leſs</hi> Profeſſions, and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of their Ways,</hi> to the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and an <hi>Holy Life,</hi> as thouſands can witneſs. And as they Freely received what they had to ſay from the Lord, ſo they Freely adminiſtred it to others.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Bent</hi> and <hi>Streſs</hi> of their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> was <hi>Converſion</hi> to God, <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Holineſs;</hi> not Schemes of <hi>Doctrines</hi> and Verbal <hi>Creeds,</hi> or new <hi>Forms of Worſhip;</hi> but a leaving off in Religion the <hi>Superfluous,</hi> and reducing the <hi>Ceremonious</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> part, and preſſing earneſtly the <hi>Subſtantial,</hi> the <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Proffitable</hi> part; as all upon a ſerious Reflection muſt and do accknowledge.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. They directed <hi>People</hi> to a <hi>Principle,</hi> by which all that they aſſerted, <hi>Preached</hi> and <hi>Exhorted</hi> others to, might be wrought in them and known, through <hi>Experience,</hi> to them to be true; which is a high and diſtinguiſhing <hi>Mark</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> both that they <hi>knew</hi> what they ſaid, and were not afraid of coming to the <hi>Teſt.</hi> For as they were bold from <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> ſo they required <hi>Conformity</hi> upon no <hi>Humane Authority,</hi> but upon <hi>Conviction,</hi> and the <hi>Conviction</hi> of this <hi>Principle,</hi> which they aſſerted was in them that they <hi>Preached unto, and unto that directed them,</hi> that they might <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>prove</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of thoſe things which they had affirmed of it, and its Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation and Work in Man. And this is more than the many <hi>Miniſtries</hi> in the World pretend to. They declare of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſay many things true; in words <hi>of God, Chriſt, and the Spirit; of Holineſs and Heaven; that all Men ſhould Repent and mend their Lives, or they will go to Hell,</hi> &amp;c. but which of them all pretend to ſpeak of their own <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Experience?</hi> Or ever directed Men to a Divine Principle, or <hi>Agent,</hi> placed of God <hi>in Man,</hi> to help him; and how to know it, and <hi>wait</hi> to feel its <hi>Power</hi> to work that good and acceptable <hi>Will of God</hi> in them.</p>

Some of them indeed have <hi>Spoke</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of it to <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Performance</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> to God; but <hi>where</hi> and <hi>how</hi> to find it and wait in it to perform, was yet as a Miſtery reſerved for <hi>this further degree of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> So that this People did not only in words, more than equally preſs <hi>Repentance, Converſion</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> but did it <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>experimentally;</hi> and directed thoſe to whom they preach'd, to a ſufficient <hi>Principle,</hi> and told them where it is, and by what <hi>Tokens</hi> they might know it, and which way they might experience the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of it to their <hi>Soul's Happineſs.</hi> Which is more then <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Speculations,</hi> upon which moſt other <hi>Miniſtries</hi> depend; for here is <hi>certainly,</hi> a <hi>bottom</hi> upon which Man may boldly appear before God in the great Day of Account.</p>
            <p n="5">V.

And thoſe that have embraced this <hi>Divine Principle,</hi> have found this Mark of its <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> (that the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did of Chriſt when in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſiah,)</hi> viz. <hi>It had told them all that ever they did;</hi> ſhowed them their <hi>inſides,</hi> the <hi>moſt inward</hi> ſecrets of their Hearts, and laid <hi>Judgment</hi> to the <hi>Line,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to the <hi>Plummet;</hi> of which <hi>Thouſands</hi> can, at this day give in their Witneſs.

of <hi>London,</hi> in expreſs Terms, and likewiſe particular ones to divers <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> which accordingly overtook them; and which were very remarkable in the Places where they dwelt, and in time they may be made publick for the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Reader,</hi> thou ſeeſt this People in their <hi>Riſe, Principles, Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Progreſs,</hi> both their General and Particular <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> by which thou maiſt be informed how and upon what foot they <hi>Sprung</hi> and became ſo conſiderable a <hi>People.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains next that I ſhew alſo their <hi>Care, Conduct</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as a Chriſtian and <hi>Reformed Society,</hi> that they might be found living up to their own <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> And this, the rather, becauſe they have hardly ſuffered more in their Character from the <hi>Unjuſt</hi> Charge of <hi>Error,</hi> than by the falſe <hi>Imputation</hi> of <hi>Diſorder:</hi> Which <hi>Calumny</hi> indeed has not failed to follow all the true ſteps that were ever made to <hi>Reformation,</hi> and under which Reproach none ſuffered more than the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians</hi> themſelves, that were the Honour of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> and the great Lights and Examples of their own and ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>This People encreaſing daily both in Town and Country, an Holy Care fell upon ſome of the <hi>Elders</hi> among them, for the Benefit and Service of the Church. And the firſt Buſineſs in their View, after the Example of the <hi>Primitive Saints,</hi> was the Exerciſe of <hi>Charity,</hi> to ſupply the Neceſſities of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and anſwer the like Occaſions: Wherefore <hi>Collections</hi> were early and liberally made for that, and divers other Services in the Church, and intruſted with Faithful Men, fearing God, and of good Report, who were not weary in well-doing; adding often of their own, in large Proportions, which they never brought to account, or deſired ſhould be known, much leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them, that none might want, nor any Service be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded or diſappointed.</p>
            <p>They were alſo very careful, that every one that belonged to them, anſwered their Profeſſion in their Behaviour among Men, upon all Occaſions; that they lived Peaceably, and were in all things good Examples. They found themſelves engaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord their Sufferings and Services; and in caſe of Marriage, which they could not perform in the uſual Methods of the Nation, but among themſelves; they took care thal all things were clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parties and all others, and it was then rare that any one entertain'd ſuch Inclination to a Perſon on that account, till he or ſhe had communicated it ſecretly to ſome very Weighty and Eminent Friends among them, that they might have a ſenſe of the Matter; looking to the Council and Unity of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as of great Moment to them. But becauſe the Charge of the Poor, the Number of Orphans, Marriages, Sufferings and other Matters multiplied, and that it was good that the
<pb facs="tcp:36281:13"/>
Churches were in ſome way and Method, of proceeding in ſuch Affairs among them, to the end they might the better correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond upon occaſion, where a Member of one Meeting, might have to do with one of another: It pleaſed the Lord in his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, to open the Underſtanding of the firſt Inſtrument of this Diſpenſation of Life, about a Good and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way of Proceeding; and he felt an Holy Concern to viſit the Churches in Perſon throughout this Nation, to begin and eſtabliſh it among them; and by his Epiſtles the like was done in other Nations and Provinces abroad; which he alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Viſited, and helped in that Service, as ſhall be obſerved when I come to ſpeak of him.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Care, Conduct</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> I have been ſpeaking of, and which is now practiſed among this People, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This Godly Elder, in every County where he travelled, exhorted them, that ſome out of every Meeting of Worſhip, ſhould meet together once in the Month, to confer about the Wants and Occaſions of the Church. And as the Caſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo thoſe Monthly Meetings were fewer or more in number in every reſpective County; Four or Six Meetings of Worſhip, uſually making one <hi>Monthly Meeting</hi> of Buſineſs. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Brethren</hi> met him from place to place, and began the ſaid <hi>Meetings,</hi> viz. <hi>For the Poor, Orphans orderly Walking, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to their Profeſſion, Births, Marriages, Burials, Sufferings</hi> &amp;c. And that theſe <hi>Monthly</hi> Meetings ſhould, in each County make up one <hi>Quarterly</hi> Meeting, where the moſt <hi>Zealous</hi> and <hi>Eminent Friends</hi> of the County ſhould aſſemble to <hi>Communicate, Adviſe</hi> and <hi>Help</hi> one another, eſpecially when any <hi>Buſineſs</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed difficult, or a <hi>Monthly</hi> Meeting was tender of determining a Matter.</p>
            <p>Alſo theſe <hi>Quarterly</hi> Meetings ſhould digeſt the Reports of the <hi>Monthly</hi> Meetings, and prepare one for the <hi>County,</hi> againſt the <hi>Yearly</hi> Meeting; in which the <hi>Quarterly</hi> Meetings reſolve, which is held Yearly in <hi>London;</hi> where the Churches in this <hi>Nation,</hi> and other <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> Meet, by choſen Members of their Reſpective Counties, both mutually to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their <hi>Church Affairs,</hi> and to adviſe and be adviſed in any depending Caſe to <hi>Edification.</hi> Alſo to provide a requiſite Stock, for the diſcharge of general <hi>Expences</hi> for general <hi>Services</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> not needful to be here particularized.</p>
            <p>At theſe Meetings any of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> may come if they pleaſe, and ſpeak their <hi>Minds</hi> freely, in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> to any matter; but the Mind of each Meeting therein repreſented is chiefly underſtood, as to perticuler <hi>Caſes,</hi> in the Senſe delivered by the Perſons deputed or choſen for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
During their Yearly <hi>Meeting,</hi> to which their other <hi>Meetings</hi> referr in their Order and Reſolve themſelves; care is taken by a Select Number, for that ſervice choſen by the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> to draw up the Minutes of the ſaid Meeting, upon the ſeveral matters that have been under Conſideration therein, to the end that the Reſpective <hi>Quarterly</hi> and <hi>Monthly Meetings</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all Proceedings, together with a general <hi>Exhortation</hi> to <hi>Holineſs, Unity</hi> and <hi>Charity:</hi> Of all which Proceedings in <hi>Yearly, Quarterly</hi> and <hi>Monthly Meetings,</hi> due <hi>Record</hi> is kept by ſome One appointed for that Service, or that hath voluntarily undertaken it. Theſe Meetings are opened, and uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in their <hi>Solemn</hi> waiting upon God, who is ſometimes graciouſly pleaſed to anſwer them with as ſignal Evidences of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Preſence,</hi> as in any other their Meetings of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>It is further to be Noted, that in theſe <hi>Solemn Aſſemblies,</hi> for the Church's Service, there is no one preſides among them after the manner of the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of other People; Chriſt only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Preſident,</hi> as he is pleaſed to appear in <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in any one or more of them, to whom, whatever be their <hi>Capacity</hi> or <hi>Degree,</hi> the reſt adhere with a <hi>Firm Unity,</hi> not of <hi>Authority</hi> but <hi>Conviction,</hi> which is the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> and way of Chriſt's <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in his <hi>People:</hi> Making good his bleſſed Promiſe, <hi>That he would be in the Midſt of his, where and whenever they were met together in his Name, even to the End of the World.</hi> So be it.</p>
            <p>Now it may be expected, I ſhould here ſet down what ſort of Authority is exerciſed by this <hi>People,</hi> upon ſuch Members of their Society, as correſpond not in their <hi>Lives</hi> with their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> and that are <hi>Refractory</hi> to this good and wholeſom Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſettled among them; and the rather becauſe they have not wanted their Reproach and Suffering from ſome <hi>Tongues,</hi> upon this occaſion in a plentiful manner.</p>
            <p>The Power they exerciſe is ſuch as Chriſt has given to his own <hi>People,</hi> to the End of the World, in the Perſons of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>viz. To Overſee, Exhort, Reprove,</hi> and after long <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Waiting</hi> upon the <hi>Diſobedient</hi> and <hi>Refractory, to diſown them, as any more of their Communion, or that they will any longer ſtand Charged in the Sight and Judgment of God or Men, with their Converſation or Behaviour as one of them, untill they Repent.</hi> The ſubject matter about which this <hi>Authority,</hi> in any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Branches</hi> of it, is Exerciſed; is <hi>Firſt,</hi> in <hi>Relation</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Secondly,</hi> about thoſe things that more ſtrictly referr to their own <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and diſtinguiſh them from all other <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Extreams upon which many Split, <hi>viz.

               <pb facs="tcp:36281:14"/>
that ſuch as will not Conform, though againſt <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> ſhall be puniſht in their <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Eſtates;</hi> or leaving all looſe and at large, as to <hi>Practice,</hi> unaccountable to all but God and the <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> To which hurtful Extream, nothing has more contributed than the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of <hi>Church Power,</hi> by ſuch as ſuffer their <hi>Paſſions</hi> and private <hi>Intereſts</hi> to prevail with them to carry it to outward Force and <hi>Corporal Puniſhment.</hi> A Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice they have been taught to diſlike, by their extream <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> as well as their known Principle for an univerſal <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, they equally diſlike an <hi>Independency</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi> An unaccountableneſs in <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Converſation</hi> to the Terms of their own <hi>Communion,</hi> and to thoſe that are the <hi>Members</hi> of it. They diſtinguiſh between Impoſing any Practice that immediately regards <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip,</hi> (which is never to be done nor ſuffered or ſubmitted unto) and requiring <hi>Chriſtian Compliance</hi> with thoſe Methods that <hi>only reſpect Church Buſineſs</hi> in its more <hi>Civil</hi> part and <hi>Concern,</hi> and that regard the Diſcreet and Orderly Maintenance of the Character of the <hi>Society</hi> as a <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Religious Community.</hi> In ſhort, what is for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> that Men may Practice what they profeſs, live up to their own <hi>Principles,</hi> and not be at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to give the <hi>Lie</hi> to their own <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> without <hi>Rebuke.</hi> They compell none to them, but oblige thoſe that are of them to walk <hi>Suitably,</hi> or they are denyed by them: That is all the Mark they ſet upon them, and the <hi>Power</hi> they Exerciſe, or Judge a Chriſtian Society, can Exerciſe upon thoſe that are the Members of it.</p>
            <p>The way of their Proceedings againſt ſuch as have <hi>Lapſt</hi> or <hi>Tranſgreſt,</hi> is this. He is viſited by ſome of them, and the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> laid <hi>Home</hi> to him, be it any evil <hi>Practice</hi> againſt known and general <hi>Virtue,</hi> or any Branch of their <hi>Particular Teſtimony,</hi> which he, in <hi>Common,</hi> profeſſeth with them. They labour with him in much <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for the good of his <hi>Soul,</hi> the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> and Reputation of their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> to own his <hi>Fault</hi> and condemn it, <hi>in as ample a Manner as the Evil or Scandal was given by him;</hi> which for the moſt part, is performed by ſome <hi>Written Teſtimony</hi> under the Partys Hand; and if it ſo happen that the Party prove <hi>Refractory,</hi> and is not willing to clear the <hi>Truth</hi> they profeſs, from the <hi>Reproach</hi> of his or her evil doing or Unfaithfulneſs, they, after repeated <hi>Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and due waiting for a <hi>Token</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> give forth a <hi>Paper</hi> to <hi>diſown</hi> ſuch a <hi>Fact,</hi> and the <hi>Party</hi> offending; recording the ſame as a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of their care for the Honour of the <hi>Truth</hi> they profeſs.</p>
            <p>And if he or ſhe ſhall clear their Profeſſion and themſelves, by ſincere Acknowledgment of their <hi>Fault,</hi> and Godly ſorrow
<pb facs="tcp:36281:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for ſo doing, they are received and looked upon again as <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of their <hi>Communion.</hi> For as God, ſo his true People <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid</hi> no Man after <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the account I had to give of the People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as to their <hi>Riſe, Appearance, Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> in this Age of the <hi>World,</hi> both with Reſpect to their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Converſation.</hi> And I Judge it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this place, becauſe it is to <hi>Preface</hi> the <hi>Journal</hi> of the firſt <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Glorious</hi> Inſtrument of this <hi>Work,</hi> and for a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to him in his ſingular <hi>Qualifications</hi> and <hi>Services,</hi> in which he abundantly excelled in this day, and are worthy to be ſet forth as an Example to all ſucceeding Times; to the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Moſt High God,</hi> and for a juſt <hi>Memorial</hi> to that Worthy and Excellent Man, <hi>his Faithful Servant and Apoſtle</hi> to this Generation of the World.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the Third Head or Branch of my <hi>Preface,</hi> viz. The <hi>Inſtrumental Author.</hi> For it is Natural for ſome to ſay, Well, here is the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> but where and who was the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Inſtrument;</hi> he that in this Age was ſent to begin this <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> I ſhall, as God ſhall enable me, declare who and what he was, not only by report of others, but from my own long and moſt inward <hi>Converſe</hi> and intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; for which my Soul bleſſeth God, as it hath often done; and I doubt not, but by that time I have diſcharged my ſelf of this part of my <hi>Preface,</hi> my ſerious <hi>Readers</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I had good Cauſe ſo to do.</p>
            <p>The Bleſſed Inſtrument of and in this day of God, and of whom I am now about to Write, was <hi>George Fox,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from another of that Name, by that Other's addition of <hi>Younger</hi> to his Name in all his <hi>Writings;</hi> not that he was ſo in Years, but that he was ſo in the <hi>Truth,</hi> but he was alſo a <hi>Worthy Man,</hi> Witneſs and Servant of God in his time.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>George Fox</hi> was Born in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> about the Year 1624. He deſcended of <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Sufficient Parents,</hi> who endeavoured to bring him up, as they did the reſt of their Children, in the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Nation;</hi> eſpecially his Mother, who was a Woman accompliſht above moſt of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the place where ſhe lived. But from a <hi>Child</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of another <hi>Frame</hi> of <hi>Mind</hi> than the reſt of his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> being more <hi>Religious, Inward, Still, Solid</hi> and <hi>Obſerving</hi> beyond his Years, as the <hi>Anſwers</hi> he would give, and the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions</hi> he would put upon occaſion, manifeſted to the Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that heard him, eſpecially in <hi>Divine Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Mother taking Notice of his <hi>Singular Temper,</hi> and the <hi>Gravity, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> that very early ſhined through him,
<pb facs="tcp:36281:15"/>
refuſing <hi>Childiſh</hi> and <hi>Vain Sports</hi> and <hi>Company,</hi> when very <hi>Young;</hi> ſhe was <hi>Tender</hi> and <hi>Indulgent</hi> over him, ſo that from her he met with little Difficulty. As to his <hi>Employment</hi> he was brought up in <hi>Country Buſineſs,</hi> and as he took moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in <hi>Sheep,</hi> ſo he was very skillful in them, an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that very well ſuited his mind in ſeveral Reſpects, both for its <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Solitude;</hi> and was a juſt Figure of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Miniſtry and Service.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not break in upon his own Account, which is by much the beſt that can be given, and therefore deſire, what I can, to avoid ſaying any thing of what is ſaid already, as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Paſſages</hi> of his coming forth; but, in general, when he was ſomewhat above Twenty, he left his <hi>Friends,</hi> and viſited the moſt <hi>Retired</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> People in thoſe Parts; and ſome there were ſhort of few, if any, in this <hi>Nation,</hi> who waited for the <hi>Conſolation</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Night and Day; as <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, Anna</hi> and good Old <hi>Simeon</hi> did of Old Time. To theſe he was ſent, and theſe he ſought out in the Neighbouring Countrys, and among them he Sojourned till his more ample <hi>Miniſtry</hi> came upon him. At this time he taught and was an Example of <hi>Silence,</hi> endeavouring to bring them from <hi>Self-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,</hi> Teſtifying and turning to the Light of Chriſt within them, and encouraging them to wait in <hi>Patience</hi> to feel the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it to ſtir in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> that their <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of God might ſtand in the <hi>Power</hi> of an Endleſs Life, which was to be found in the <hi>Light,</hi> as it was obeyed in the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it in Man. <hi>For in the Word was Life, and that Life is the Light Men.</hi> Life in the <hi>Word,</hi> Light in <hi>Men,</hi> and Life in <hi>Men</hi> as the <hi>Light</hi> is obeyed; the Children of the <hi>Light</hi> living by the Life of the <hi>Word,</hi> by which the word <hi>begets</hi> them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to God, which is the <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>New Birth,</hi> without which there is no coming unto the Kingdom of God; and which, whoever comes to, is greater than <hi>John,</hi> that is, than <hi>John's</hi> Diſpenſation, which was not that of the Kingdom, but the Conſummation of the Legal, and Forerunning of the <hi>Goſpel Times.</hi> Accordingly, ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe <hi>Parts,</hi> and thus his <hi>Time</hi> was employed for ſome Years.</p>
            <p>In 1652. He being in his uſual <hi>Retirement</hi> to the Lord upon a very <hi>High Mountain,</hi> in ſome of the hither parts of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> as I take it, his Mind exerciſed towards the <hi>Lord,</hi> he had a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the great Work of God in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and of the way that he was to go forth to begin it. He ſaw People as thick as <hi>Motes in the Sun,</hi> that ſhould in time, be brought Home to the Lord; that there might be but <hi>one Shepherd and one Sheepfold</hi> in all the Earth. There his Eye was directed <hi>Northward,</hi> behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great People that ſhould receive him and his Meſſage in thoſe Parts. Upon this <hi>Mountain</hi> he was moved of the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:36281:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>

They felt the <hi>Divine Motions,</hi> and were frequently drawn forth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to viſit the <hi>Publick Aſſemblies,</hi> to reprove, inform and exhort them, ſometimes in <hi>Markets, Fairs, Streets,</hi> and by the <hi>High-way-ſide,</hi> calling People to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to turn to the Lord with their Hearts as well as their Mouths; directing them to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within them, to ſee and examine and conſider their ways by, and to eſchew the <hi>Evil</hi> and do the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Acceptable</hi> Will of God. And they ſuffered great <hi>Hardſhips</hi> for this their <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Good-will,</hi> being often <hi>Stockt, Stoned, Beaten, Whipt</hi> and <hi>Impriſoned,</hi> though <hi>Honeſt Men</hi> and of <hi>Good Report</hi> where they lived, that had left <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> to viſit them with a living Call to <hi>Repentance.</hi> And though the <hi>Prieſts</hi> generally ſet themſelves to oppoſe them, and write againſt them, and inſinuated moſt <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Scandalous Stories</hi> to <hi>Defame</hi> them, ſtirring up the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to ſuppreſs them, eſpecially in thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> Parts; yet God was pleaſed ſo to fill them with his living <hi>Power,</hi> and give them ſuch an open Door of utterance in his <hi>Service,</hi> that there was a mighty <hi>Convincement</hi> over thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>And through the tender and ſingular Indulgence of Judge <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> who were wont to go that <hi>Circuit,</hi> in the Infancy of things, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were never able to gain the point they laboured for, which was to have proceeded to <hi>Blood,</hi> and if poſſible, <hi>Herod</hi> like, by a <hi>Cruel</hi> exerciſe of the <hi>Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> to have cut them off and rooted them out of the <hi>Country.</hi> Eſpecially Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> who was not only a Check to their <hi>Rage</hi> in the Courſe of <hi>Legal Proceedings,</hi> but otherwiſe upon occaſion, and finally countenanced this People; for his <hi>Wife</hi> receiving the <hi>Truth</hi> with the Firſt, it had that <hi>Influence</hi> upon his Spirit,

being a <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> and ſeeing in his own <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> a full Confutation to all the popular Clamours againſt the <hi>Way of Truth,</hi> that he covered them what he could, and freely opened his <hi>Doors,</hi> and gave up his <hi>Houſe</hi> to his <hi>Wife</hi> and her <hi>Friends,</hi> not valuing the <hi>Reproach</hi> of Ignorant or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <hi>Minded People,</hi> which I here mention, to His and her <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and which will be I believe, an <hi>Honour</hi> and a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to ſuch of their <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> as ſhall be found in that <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, Humility, Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the Lord.</p>
            <p>That Houſe was for ſome Years at firſt, till the <hi>Truth</hi> had opened its way in the <hi>Southern</hi> parts of this Iſland, an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Receptacle of this <hi>People.</hi> Others of good Note and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> Countrys, had alſo opened their Houſes with their Hearts, to the many <hi>Publiſhers,</hi> that in a ſhort time the Lord had raiſed to declare his <hi>Salvation</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> and where Meetings of the Lord's <hi>Meſſengers</hi> were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently held, to communicate their <hi>Services</hi> and <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Edify</hi> one another in their <hi>Bleſſed Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leaſt this may be thought a Digreſſion, having touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this before, I return to this <hi>Excellent Man:</hi> And for his <hi>Perſonal Qualities,</hi> both <hi>Natural, Moral</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> as they appeared in his <hi>Converſe</hi> with <hi>Brethren</hi> and in the <hi>Church of God;</hi> take as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">I. He was a Man that God endued with a <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Depth,</hi> a diſcerner of others <hi>Spirits,</hi> and very much a <hi>Maſter</hi> of his own. And though the ſide of his <hi>Underſtanding</hi> which lay next to the World, and eſpecially the <hi>Expreſſion</hi> of it might ſound <hi>Uncouth</hi> and <hi>Unfaſhionable</hi> to <hi>Nice Ears,</hi> his matter was nevertheleſs very profound; and would not only bear to be often conſidered, but the more it was ſo, the more <hi>Weighty</hi> and <hi>Inſtructing</hi> it appeared. And as <hi>abruptly</hi> and <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly</hi> as ſometimes his Sentences would fall from him, about <hi>Divine Things,</hi> it is well known they were often as <hi>Texts</hi> to many fairer <hi>Declarations.</hi> And indeed it ſhowed beyond all <hi>Contradiction</hi> that God ſent him, that no <hi>Arts</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhare in his matter or manner of his <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> and that ſo many <hi>Great, Excellent</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary Truths</hi> as he came forth to Preach to <hi>Mankind,</hi> had therefore nothing of Man's <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to recommend them. So that as to <hi>Man</hi> he was an <hi>Original,</hi> being no Man's <hi>Copy.</hi> And his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> ſhow they are from one that was not Taught of Man, nor had Learned what he ſaid by <hi>Study.</hi> Nor were they <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> or <hi>Speculative,</hi> but ſenſible and <hi>Practical Truths,</hi> tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and the ſetting up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in the <hi>Hearts of Men,</hi> and the way of it was his <hi>Work.</hi> So that I have many times been overcome in my ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:36281:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and been made to ſay, with my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> upon the like Occaſion; <hi>I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent of this World, and revealed them to Babes,</hi> For many times hath my <hi>Soul</hi> bowed in an Humble <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he did not chooſe any of the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> of this World to be the firſt <hi>Meſſenger</hi> in our <hi>Age,</hi> of his bleſſed <hi>Truth</hi> to <hi>Men;</hi> but that he took one that was not of <hi>High Degree,</hi> or <hi>Elegant Speech,</hi> or learned after the way of this World, that his <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> he ſent him to do, might come with leſs <hi>Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> or <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of <hi>Humane Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and with more <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Clearneſs</hi> upon the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of thoſe, that ſincerely Sought the way of <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Love</hi> of it. I ſay, beholding with the Eye of my mind which the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> had opened in me, the <hi>Marks</hi> of God's <hi>Finger</hi> and <hi>Hand</hi> viſibly in this <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,</hi> from the Clearneſs of the <hi>Principle,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy</hi> of it in the Exemplary <hi>Sobriety, Plainneſs, Zeal, Steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Humility, Gravity, Punctuality, Charity</hi> and <hi>Circumſpect</hi> care in the <hi>Government</hi> of Church Affairs, which ſhined in his and their <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> that God employed in this <hi>Work,</hi> it greatly confirmed me that it was of God, and engaged my <hi>Soul</hi> in a <hi>Deep Love, Fear, Reverence</hi> and <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> for his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> therein to <hi>Mankind;</hi> in which Mind I remain, and ſhall, I hope, to the end of my <hi>Daies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. In his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> or <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> he much laboured to open <hi>Truth,</hi> to the Peoples <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> and to bottom them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Principal, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Light of the <hi>World,</hi> that by bringing them to ſomething that was of God in themſelves, they might the better know and judge of him and themſelves.</p>
            <p>He had an Extraordinary <hi>Gift</hi> in opening the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> He would go to the <hi>Marrow</hi> of things, and ſhow the <hi>Mind, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> and <hi>Fullfilling</hi> of them with much <hi>Plainneſs,</hi> and to great <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Edification.</hi>

            <p>The Miſtery of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> of the <hi>Fall</hi> and <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> of <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Subſtance,</hi> of the <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Sons State,</hi> and the fullfiling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>True Light,</hi> in all that are his, through the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> were much of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Drift</hi> of his <hi>Teſtimonies.</hi> In all which he was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed to be of God, being ſenſibly felt to ſpeak that which he had received of Chriſt, and was his own Experience, in that which never <hi>Ers</hi> nor <hi>Fails.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, he excelled in <hi>Prayer.</hi> The Inwardneſs and Weight of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Solemnity</hi> of his <hi>Addreſs</hi> and <hi>Behaviour,</hi> and the <hi>Fewneſs</hi> and <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of his <hi>Words,</hi> have

often ſtruck, even <hi>Strangers,</hi> with <hi>Admiration,</hi> as they uſed to reach others with <hi>Conſolation.</hi> The moſt <hi>Awfull, Living, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Frame</hi> I ever Felt or Beheld, I muſt ſay was his in <hi>Prayer.</hi> And truly it was a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> he knew and lived neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Lord than other Men; for they that know him moſt will ſee moſt reaſon to approach him with Reverence and Fear.</p>
            <p>He was of an <hi>Innocent Life,</hi> no <hi>Buſie Body,</hi> nor <hi>Self Seeker,</hi> neither <hi>Touchy,</hi> nor <hi>Critical:</hi> What fell from him was very <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive,</hi> if not very <hi>Edifying.</hi> So <hi>Meek, Contented, Modeſt, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Steady, Tender,</hi> it was a pleaſure to be in his <hi>Company.</hi> He exerciſed no <hi>Authority</hi> but over <hi>Evil,</hi> and that every where and in all; but with <hi>Love, Compaſſion</hi> and <hi>Long Suffering.</hi> A moſt <hi>Merciful Man,</hi> as ready to <hi>Forgive</hi> as unapt to take or give an <hi>Offence.</hi> Thouſands can truly ſay, he was of an Excellent <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Savour</hi> among them, and becauſe thereof, the moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Spirits</hi> loved him with an unfained and unfading <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was an Inceſſant <hi>Labourer;</hi> for in his Younger time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his many great and deep <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Travels</hi> had enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his <hi>Body</hi> for Itinerant <hi>Services,</hi> he laboured much in the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> turning many to God, and confirming thoſe that were convinced of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſetling Good Order as to <hi>Church Affairs</hi> among them. And towards the Concluſion of his <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Services,</hi> between the Years Seventy One, and Seventy Seven, he Viſited the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> and in the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> as his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Journal</hi> Relates, to the Convincement and Conſolation of many. After that time he chiefly reſided in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and beſides the <hi>Services</hi> of his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> which were Frequent and Serviceable, he writ much both to them that are within, and thoſe that are without the <hi>Communion.</hi> But the care he took of the <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in General was very great.</p>
            <p>He was often where the <hi>Records</hi> of the Affairs of the <hi>Church</hi> are kept, and the Letters from the many <hi>Meetings</hi> of God's People over all the World where ſettled, come upon Occaſions, which <hi>Letters</hi> he had read to him, and Communicated them to the <hi>Meeting</hi> that is Weekly held there for ſuch <hi>Services,</hi> he would be ſure to ſtir them up to diſcharge them, eſpecially in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Caſes.</hi> Showing great <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> upon all ſuch Occaſions, carefully looking into the <hi>Reſpective Caſes,</hi> and endeavouring <hi>Speedy Relief</hi> according to the Nature of them. So that the Churches and any of the <hi>Suffering Members</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, were ſure not to be forgotten or delayed in their Deſires if he were there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As he was <hi>Unwearied,</hi> ſo he was <hi>Undaunted</hi> in his <hi>Services</hi> for God and his People, he was no more to be moved to <hi>Fear</hi> than to <hi>Wrath.</hi> His Behaviour at <hi>Darby, Litchfield, Appleby,</hi> before <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> at <hi>Launſton, Scarborough, Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> with many other Places and Exerciſes, did abundantly evidence it to his Enemies as well as his Friends.</p>
            <p>But as in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> ſome riſe up againſt the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> even from among thoſe that they had turned to the Hope of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their greateſt Trouble; ſo this <hi>Man of God</hi> had his ſhare of <hi>Suffering</hi> from ſome that were convinced by him, who through prejudice or miſtake run againſt him, as one that ſought Dominion over <hi>Conſcience;</hi> becauſe he preſt by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Epiſtles, a ready and zealous compliance with ſuch good and wholeſome things, as tended to an <hi>Orderly Converſation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in their walking before Men. That which contributed much to this ill <hi>Work,</hi> was in ſome a begrudging of this <hi>Meek Man,</hi> the love and eſteem he had and deſerved in the Hearts of the People, and weakneſs in others, that were taken with their groundleſs Suggeſtions of <hi>Impoſition</hi> and blind <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They would have had every Man <hi>Independent,</hi> that as he had the <hi>Principle</hi> in himſelf, he ſhould only ſtand and fall to that and no Body elſe; not conſidering that the <hi>Principle</hi> is <hi>One</hi> in all; and though the Meaſure of <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Grace</hi> might dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet the Nature of it was the ſame, and being ſo, they ſtruck at the <hi>Spiritual Unity,</hi> which a People, guided by the ſame <hi>Principle,</hi> are naturally led into: So that what is an evil to One, is ſo to All, and what is <hi>Vertuous, Honeſt</hi> and of good <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> to <hi>One,</hi> is ſo to All, from the Senſe and Savour of the one <hi>Univerſal Principle</hi> which is common to all, (and which the diſaffected profeſs to be) the Root of all <hi>True Chriſtian Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,</hi> and that Spirit into which the People of God drink and come to be <hi>Spiritually Minded,</hi> and of one <hi>Heart</hi> and one <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some weakly miſtook good <hi>Order</hi> in the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Church Affairs,</hi> for <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and that it was ſo preſt or recommended by Him and other Brethren: And they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to reflect the ſame things that <hi>Diſſenters</hi> had very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably objected upon the <hi>National Churches,</hi> that have coercively preſſed Conformity to their <hi>Reſpective Creeds</hi> and <hi>Worſhips:</hi> Whereas theſe things related wholly to <hi>Converſation,</hi> and the <hi>Outward</hi> (and as I may ſay) <hi>Civil</hi> part of the <hi>Church,</hi> that Men ſhould walk up to the Principles of their <hi>Belief,</hi> and not be wanting in <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> But though ſome have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fallen through <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> and an unreaſonable <hi>Obſtinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> even to a <hi>Prejudice;</hi> yet bleſſed be God, the Generality have returned to their <hi>Firſt Love,</hi> and ſeen the Work of the <hi>Enemy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:18"/>
that looſes no <hi>Opportunity</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> by which he may check or hinder the <hi>Work</hi> of God, and diſquiet the <hi>Peace</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and chill the <hi>Love</hi> of his People to the <hi>Truth</hi> and one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and there is hope of divers that are yet at a Diſtance.</p>
            <p>In all theſe Occaſions, though there was no Perſon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſtruck ſo ſharply at, as this <hi>Good Man,</hi> he bore all their <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and returned not <hi>Reflection</hi> for <hi>Reflection;</hi> but forgave them their weak and bitter <hi>Speeches,</hi> praying for them that they might have a Senſe of their hurt, and ſee the <hi>Subtilty</hi> of the <hi>Enemy</hi> to Rend and Devide, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into their <hi>Firſt Love, that thought no Ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, I muſt ſay, that though God had viſibly cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with a <hi>Divine Preference</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> and indeed his very Preſence expreſt a <hi>Religious Majeſty;</hi> yet he never abuſed it, but held his Place in the <hi>Church of God</hi> with great Meak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a moſt engaging <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Moderation.</hi> For upon all Occaſions, like his bleſſed <hi>Maſter,</hi> he was a <hi>Servant</hi> to all; holding and exerciſing his Elderſhip, in the <hi>Inviſible Power</hi> that had gathered them, with Reverence to the Head and Care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Body: And was received only in that <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of Chriſt as the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Chief Elder</hi> in this <hi>Age;</hi> who, as he was therefore worthy of double <hi>Honour,</hi> ſo for the ſame Reaſon it was given by the <hi>Faithful</hi> of this day; becauſe his <hi>Authority</hi> was inward and not outward, and that he got it and kept it by the Love of God and Power of an <hi>Endleſs Life.</hi> I write my <hi>Knowledge</hi> and not <hi>Report,</hi> and my <hi>Witneſs is True,</hi> having been with him for <hi>Weeks</hi> and <hi>Months</hi> together on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Occaſions,</hi> and thoſe of the neareſt and moſt exerciſing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that by Night and by Day, by Sea and by Land; in this and in <hi>Foreign Countrys:</hi> And I can ſay, I never ſaw him out of his Place, or not a Match for every Service or Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>For in all things he acquitted himſelf like a Man, yea a ſtrong Man, a <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> minded Man. A <hi>Divine</hi> and a <hi>Naturaliſt,</hi> and all of God Almighty's making. I have been ſurpriſed at his <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> in Natural things; that whilſt he was Ignorant of uſeleſs and Sophiſtical <hi>Science,</hi> he had in him the <hi>Foundation</hi> of uſeful and commendable <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and cheriſht it every where. <hi>Civil</hi> beyond all Forms of <hi>Breeding,</hi> in his <hi>Behaviour.</hi> Very <hi>Temperate,</hi> eating <hi>Little,</hi> and ſleeping <hi>Leſs,</hi> though a <hi>Bulky Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he Lived and Sojourned among us, and as he lived, ſo he died; feeling the ſame <hi>Eternal Power</hi> that had raiſed and preſerved him in his laſt <hi>Moments.</hi> So full of aſſurance was he, that he Triumpht over <hi>Death;</hi> and ſo even to the laſt, as if <hi>Death</hi> were hardly worth <hi>Notice</hi> or a <hi>Mention:</hi> Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

In a good Old Age he went, after having lived to ſee his <hi>Childrens Children to many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Truth.</hi> He had the Comfort of a ſhort <hi>Illneſs,</hi> and the Bleſſing of a clear <hi>Senſe</hi> to the laſt; and we may truly ſay, with a Man of God of Old, <hi>that being Dead, he yet Speaketh;</hi> and though abſent in <hi>Body,</hi> he is <hi>Preſent</hi> in <hi>Spirit;</hi> neither <hi>Time</hi> nor <hi>Place</hi> being able to interrupt the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> or diſſolve the <hi>Fellowſhips</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Juſt.</hi> His <hi>Works</hi> praiſe him, becauſe they are to the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of him that worked by him; for which his <hi>Memorial</hi> is, and ſhall be <hi>Bleſſed.</hi> I have done, as to this part of my <hi>Preface,</hi> when I have left this ſhort <hi>Epitaph</hi> to his Name. <hi>Many Sons have done virtuouſly in this Day, but Dear</hi> George <hi>thou Excelleſt them All.</hi>

            <p>And now, <hi>Friends,</hi> you that profeſs to walk in the way, this <hi>Bleſſed Man</hi> was ſent of God to turn us into, ſuffer I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you the word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> as well <hi>Fathers</hi> as <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> as <hi>Young Men.</hi> The Glory of this Day and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Hope that has not made us aſhamed ſince we were a <hi>People,</hi> you know is that <hi>Bleſſed Principle</hi> of Light and Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which we Profeſs, and Direct all People to, as the great <hi>Inſtrument</hi> and <hi>Agent</hi> of Man's Converſion to God: It was by this we were firſt Touched, and effectually enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to our Inward State, which put us upon the <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>Latter End,</hi> cauſing us to ſet the Lord before our <hi>Eyes,</hi> and to Number our <hi>Days,</hi> that we might apply our <hi>Hearts</hi> to <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> In that Day we judged not after the Sight of the <hi>Eye,</hi> or after the <hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>Ear,</hi> but according to the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> this <hi>Bleſſed Principle</hi> gave us; we judged and acted in reference to Things and Perſons, our ſelves and others, yea, towards God our <hi>Maker.</hi> For being quickned by it in our <hi>Inward Man,</hi> we could eaſily diſcern the difference of things, and feel what was <hi>Right,</hi> and what was <hi>Wrong,</hi> and what was <hi>Fit</hi> and what not, both in reference to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Concerns. That being the ground of the <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> of all <hi>Saints,</hi> it was in that our <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> ſtood. In this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb facs="tcp:36281:19"/>
to have a <hi>Senſe</hi> one of another, acted towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all Men, in <hi>Love, Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the feeling of the <hi>Motions</hi> of this <hi>Principle</hi> we drew near to the Lord, and waited to be prepared by it, that we might feel thoſe <hi>Drawings</hi> and <hi>Movings,</hi> before we approached the <hi>Lord in Prayer,</hi> or open'd our <hi>Mouths</hi> in <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> And in our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and Ending with th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, ſtood our <hi>Comfort, Service</hi> and <hi>Edification.</hi> And as we run faſter, or fell ſhort we made <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> for our ſelves to bear; our Services finding in our ſelves a <hi>Rebuke</hi> inſtead of an <hi>Acceptance,</hi> and in lieu of <hi>Well done, who has required this at your Hands?</hi> In that day we were an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed People,</hi> our very Countenances and Deportment declared it.</p>
            <p>Care for others was then much upon us, as well as for our ſelves, eſpecially the <hi>Young Convinced.</hi> Often had we the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> to our <hi>Neighbours, Relations</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance;</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Strangers</hi> alſo, We were in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> for one anothers <hi>Preſervation:</hi> Not ſeeking, but ſhunning Occaſions of any <hi>Coldneſs</hi> or <hi>Miſunderſtanding,</hi> treating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as thoſe that believed and felt God preſent. Which kept our Converſation <hi>Innocent, Serious</hi> and <hi>Weighty,</hi> guarding our ſelves againſt the <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Friendſhips</hi> of the World. We held the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of it, and not in our own <hi>Spirits,</hi> or after our own <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were bowed and brought into <hi>Subjection,</hi> in ſo much that it was viſible to them that knew us, we did not think our ſelves at our own <hi>Diſpoſe,</hi> to go where we <hi>Liſt,</hi> or ſay or do what we <hi>Liſt,</hi> or when we <hi>Liſt.</hi> Our <hi>Liberty</hi> ſtood in the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> and no <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> no <hi>Profit,</hi> no <hi>Fear</hi> no <hi>Favour</hi> could draw us from this retired, ſtrict and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Frame.</hi> We were ſo far from ſeeking occaſions of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> that we avoided them what we could; perſuing our own Buſineſs with <hi>Moderation,</hi> inſtead of medling with other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>Unneceſſarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Words</hi> were <hi>Few</hi> and <hi>Savoury,</hi> our <hi>Looks Compoſed</hi> and <hi>Weighty,</hi> and our whole <hi>Deportment</hi> very <hi>Obſervable.</hi> True it is, that this Retired and ſtrict ſort of <hi>Life</hi> from the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Converſation of the World,</hi> expoſed us to the Cenſures of many, as <hi>Humouriſts, Conceited</hi> and <hi>Self-righteous Perſons,</hi> &amp;c. But it was our <hi>Preſervation</hi> from many <hi>Snares,</hi> to which others were continually expoſed by the <hi>Prevalency</hi> of the luſt of the <hi>Eye,</hi> the luſt of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> that wanted no Occaſions or Temptations to excite them abroad in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I cannot forget the <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Chaſt Zeal</hi> of that Day. Oh! how Conſtant at <hi>Meetings,</hi> how Retired in them, how firm to <hi>Truth's Life,</hi> as well as <hi>Truth's Principles;</hi> and how <hi>Entire</hi> and <hi>United</hi> in our <hi>Communion,</hi> as indeed became thoſe that profeſs <hi>One Head,</hi> even Chriſt Jeſus the Lord.</p>
            <p>This being the Teſtimony and Example the Man of God, before mentioned, was ſent to <hi>Declare</hi> and <hi>Leave</hi> amongſt us, and we having Embraced the ſame as the <hi>Merciful Viſitation</hi> of God to us, the <hi>Word of Exhortation</hi> at this time is, that we continue to be <hi>found</hi> in the Way of this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> with all <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> and ſo much the more, by how much the Day draweth near.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, as to you, my <hi>Beloved</hi> and much <hi>Honoured Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> in Chriſt, that are in the Exerciſe of the <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> Oh, feel Life in the <hi>Miniſtry!</hi> Let Life be your <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> your <hi>Well-ſpring</hi> and <hi>Treaſury,</hi> in all ſuch Occaſions, elſe you well know, there can be no begetting to God, ſince nothing can quicken or make People alive to God, but the life of God: And it muſt be a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in and from Life, that enlivens any People to God. We have ſeen the <hi>Fruit</hi> of all other <hi>Miniſtrys</hi> by the few that are turned from the <hi>Evil</hi> of their <hi>Ways.</hi> It is not our <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Memory,</hi> the repetition of former <hi>Openings</hi> in our own will and time, that will do God's <hi>Work.</hi> A dry <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Miniſtry,</hi> however ſound in Words, can reach but the <hi>Ear,</hi> and is but a <hi>Dream</hi> at the Beſt: There is another <hi>Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that is ſoundeſt of all, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt the power of God. This is the <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Opens</hi> and none <hi>Shuts,</hi> and <hi>Shuts,</hi> and none can <hi>Open;</hi> as the Oil to the <hi>Lamp,</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> ſo is that to the beſt of <hi>Words.</hi> Which made Chriſt to ſay, <hi>My Words they are Spirit, and they are Life;</hi> that is, they are from Life, and therefore they make you alive, that <hi>receive</hi> them. If the <hi>Diſciples</hi> that had lived with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> were to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till they received it; ſo muſt we wait to receive, before we <hi>Miniſter,</hi> if we will turn People from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> and from <hi>Satan's</hi> power to God.</p>
            <p>I fervently bow my Knees to the God and Father of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that you may always be like minded, that you may ever wait <hi>Reverently</hi> for the coming and opening of the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> and tend upon it in your <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> that you may ſerve God in his <hi>Spirit.</hi> And be it little, or be it much, it is well; for much is not too much, and the leaſt is enough, if from the motion of <hi>God's Spirit;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, verily, never ſo little is too much, becauſe to no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
            <p>For it is the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> immediately, or through the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of his <hi>Servants,</hi> that teacheth his People to profit; and
<pb facs="tcp:36281:20"/>
to be ſure, ſo far as we take him along with us in our <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> ſo far we are profitable and no farther. For if it be the Lord that muſt work all things in us and for our ſelves; much more is it the <hi>Lord,</hi> that muſt work in us for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> of others. If therefore it was once a <hi>Croſs</hi> to us to <hi>Speak,</hi> though the Lord required it at our Hands; let it never be ſo to be ſilent, when he does not.</p>
            <p>It is one of the moſt dreadful <hi>Sayings</hi> in the <hi>Book of God,</hi> That he that adds to the <hi>Words</hi> of the Prophency of this <hi>Book,</hi> God will add the <hi>Plagues</hi> written in this <hi>Book.</hi> To keep back the Counſel of God, is as Terrible; for he that takes away from the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of this <hi>Book,</hi> God ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his part out of the <hi>Book of Life.</hi> And truly, it has great <hi>Caution</hi> in it to thoſe, that uſe the Name of the Lord, to be well aſſured, the <hi>Lord Speaks,</hi> that they may not be found of the Number of thoſe, that add to the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> giveth them to bear; nor yet to mince or diminiſh the ſame, both being ſo very offenſive to God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>Brethren,</hi> let us be careful neither to out-go our <hi>Guide,</hi> nor yet loiter behind him; ſince he that makes <hi>Haſte,</hi> may miſs his <hi>Way,</hi> and he that ſtays behind, looſe his <hi>Guide:</hi> For even thoſe, that have Received the <hi>Word of the Lord,</hi> had need wait for <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that they may ſee how to divide the <hi>Word</hi> aright; which plainly implieth that it is poſſible for one, that hath received the <hi>Word of the Lord,</hi> to miſs in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of it, which muſt come from an <hi>Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and a <hi>Self-working,</hi> which makes an unſound and dangerous <hi>Mixture;</hi> and will hardly beget a right minded li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving People to God.</p>
            <p>I am earneſt in this, above all other Conſiderations, as to publick <hi>Brethren,</hi> well knowing how much it concerns the preſent and future <hi>State,</hi> and preſervation of the <hi>Church of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that has been gathered and built up by a <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Powerful Miniſtry,</hi> that the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> be held, preſerved and continued in the <hi>Manifeſtations, Motions</hi> and <hi>Supplies</hi> of the ſame <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> from time to time.</p>
            <p>And where ever it is obſerved, that any one does <hi>Miniſter</hi> more from <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> than <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> though they have an <hi>Inlightned</hi> and <hi>Doctrinal Underſtanding;</hi> let them in time be adviſed and admoniſhed for their <hi>Preſervation,</hi> becauſe inſenſibly ſuch will come to depend upon a <hi>Self-ſufficiency;</hi> to forſake Chriſt the living <hi>Fountain,</hi> and to hew out unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Ciſterns</hi> that will hold no living <hi>Waters;</hi> and by degrees draw others from waiting upon the <hi>Gift of God</hi> in themſelves, and to feel it in others, in order to their <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to wait upon them, and to turn from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Man</hi> again, and ſo to make <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> once delivered to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and of a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> towards God; which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept by that <hi>Divine Gift</hi> of life, that begat the one and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd and ſanctified the other in the Beginning.</p>
            <p>Nor is it enough that we have known the <hi>Divine Gift,</hi> and in it have reached to the <hi>Spirits</hi> in <hi>Priſon,</hi> and been the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of the <hi>Convincing</hi> of others of the way of God, if we keep not as low and poor in our ſelves, and as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord as ever; ſince no <hi>Memory,</hi> no <hi>Repetitions</hi> of former <hi>Openings, Revelations</hi> or <hi>Enjoyments</hi> will bring a <hi>Soul</hi> to God, or afford <hi>Bread</hi> to the <hi>Hungry,</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> to the <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> unleſs Life go, with what we ſay, and that muſt be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
            <p>O that we may have no other <hi>Fountain, Treaſury</hi> or <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence!</hi> that none may preſume at any rate to Act of themſelves for <hi>God!</hi> Becauſe they have long acted from <hi>God,</hi> that we may not ſupply want of waiting with our own <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or think that we may take leſs Care, and more liberty in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than formerly; and that where we do not feel the Lord by his Power to open us and enlarge us, whatever be the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> or has been our <hi>Cuſtomary Supply</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> we may not exceed or fill up the time with our own.</p>
            <p>I hope, we ſhall ever Remember, who it was that ſaid, <hi>Of your ſelves you can do nothing,</hi> our ſufficiency is in Him: And if we are not to ſpeak our own <hi>Words,</hi> or take Thought what we ſhould ſay to Men in our <hi>Defence,</hi> when expoſed for our <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> ſurely, we ought to ſpeak none of our own <hi>Words,</hi> or take Thought what we ſhall ſay in our <hi>Teſtimony</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> in the <hi>Name of the Lord</hi> to the <hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>People;</hi> for then of all Times, and of all other Occaſions ſhould it be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us; <hi>for it is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſpeaketh in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt and does keep its <hi>Analogy</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> with the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> that as no Man can <hi>Inherit the Kingdom of God, unleſs he be born of the Spirit;</hi> ſo no Miniſtery can beget a <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but that which is from the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For this, as I ſaid before, the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> waited before they went forth; and in this our <hi>Elder Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of God in our <hi>Day,</hi> waited, viſited and reached to us. And having begun in the Spirit, let none ever hope or ſeek to be made perfect in the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> For what is the <hi>Fleſh</hi> to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Chaff</hi> to the <hi>Wheat?</hi> And if we keep in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we ſhall keep in the <hi>Unity</hi> of it, which is the ground of true <hi>Fellowſhip.</hi> For by <hi>Drinking</hi> into that one <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> we are made one People to God, and by it we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb facs="tcp:36281:21"/>
in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi> No <hi>Envying,</hi> no <hi>Bitterneſs,</hi> no <hi>Strife</hi> can have place with us. We ſhall watch always for <hi>Good,</hi> and not for <hi>Evil</hi> over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>rejoice</hi> exceedingly, and not begrudge at one anothers increaſe in the <hi>Riches</hi> of the <hi>Grace,</hi> with which God repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his <hi>Faithful Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>Brethren,</hi> as to you is committed the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> which give you frequent Opportunities, and great Place with the People among whom you <hi>Travail,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you that you would not think it ſufficient to declare the <hi>Word of Life</hi> in their <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> however <hi>Edifying</hi> and <hi>Comfortable</hi> ſuch opportunities may be to you and them: But as was the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Man of God</hi> before mentioned, in great <hi>Meaſure,</hi> when among us, inquire the State of the ſeveral <hi>Churches</hi> you Viſit; who among them are <hi>Afflicted</hi> or <hi>Sick,</hi> who are <hi>Tempted;</hi> if any are <hi>Unfaithful</hi> or <hi>Obſtinate,</hi> and endeavour to Iſſue thoſe things in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which will be a glorious <hi>Crown</hi> upon your <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> As that prepares your way in the Hearts of the People to receive you as Men of God, ſo it gives you Credit with them to do them good by your <hi>Advice</hi> in other Reſpects. The <hi>Afflicted</hi> will be <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted</hi> by you, the <hi>Tempted</hi> Strengthened, the <hi>Sick</hi> Refreſhed, the <hi>Unfaithful</hi> Convicted and Reſtored, and ſuch as are <hi>Obſtinate Softned</hi> and fitted for <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> which is Clenching the <hi>Nail,</hi> and applying and Faſtning the general <hi>Teſtimony</hi> by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Care of the ſeveral Branches of it, in reference to them more immediately concerned in it.</p>
            <p>For though <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> too, may reſide in ſuch places, who are of Worth and Importance in the general, and in other Places; yet it does not always follow, that they may have the Room they deſerve in the hearts of the People they live among; or ſome particular occaſion may make it unfit for him or them to uſe that <hi>Authority.</hi> But you that Travail as God's <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> if they receive you in the Greater, ſhall they refuſe you in the Leſs? And if they own the general <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> can they withſtand the particular <hi>Application</hi> of it in their own Caſes? Thus, ye will ſhew your ſelves <hi>Workmen</hi> indeed, and carry your Buſineſs before you, to the praiſe of his Name that hath called you from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> that you might turn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from <hi>Satan</hi>'s Power unto God and his Kingdom, which is within. And Oh that there were more of ſuch Faithful <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers</hi> in the <hi>Vineyard</hi> of the Lord! Never more need ſince the day of God!</p>
            <p>Wherefore I cannot but <hi>Cry</hi> and <hi>Call</hi> aloud to you, that have been long Profeſſors of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and know the <hi>Truth</hi> in the convincing Power of it, and have had a ſober <hi>Converſation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, yet content your ſelves only to know <hi>Truth</hi> for

your ſelves; to go to <hi>Meetings,</hi> and Exerciſe an ordinary <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and an honeſt <hi>Behaviour</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> and limit your ſelves within thoſe Bounds, feeling little or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon your <hi>Spirits</hi> for the Glory of the Lord in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirity of his <hi>Truth</hi> in the Earth, more than to be glad that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſucceed in ſuch Service; Ariſe ye in the Name and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus!</hi> Behold, how white the <hi>Fields</hi> are unto <hi>Harveſt</hi> in this and other <hi>Nations,</hi> and how few Able and <hi>Faithful Labourers</hi> there are to work therein! Your <hi>Country Folks, Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Kindred</hi> want to know the Lord and his Truth, and to Walk in it. Does nothing lie at your Door upon their Account? Search and ſee, and looſe no time, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, for the Lord is at Hand. I do not Judge you, there is one that Judgeth all Men, and his Judgment is true: You have mightily increaſed in your outward <hi>Subſtance;</hi> may you equally increaſe in your inward <hi>Riches,</hi> and do good with both, while you have a day to do <hi>Good.</hi> Your Enemies would once have taken what you had from you, for his Names Sake, in whom you have believed; wherefore he has given you much of the <hi>World</hi> in the Face of your <hi>Enemies.</hi> But Oh let it be your <hi>Servant</hi> and not your <hi>Maſter,</hi> your <hi>Diverſion</hi> rather than your <hi>Buſineſs!</hi> Let the Lord be chiefly in your Eye, and ponder your Ways, and ſee if God has nothing more for you to do; and if you find your ſelves ſhort in your Account with him, then wait for his <hi>Preparation,</hi> and be ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word of Command, and be not weary of <hi>well doing,</hi> when you have put your Hand to the <hi>Plow;</hi> and aſſuredly you ſhall Reap (if you faint not) the Fruit of your Heavenly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in God's Everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And you, Young Convinced Ones, be you Entreated and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to a Diligent and Chaſt waiting upon God, in the way of his <hi>Bleſſed Manifeſtation</hi> and appearance of himſelf to you. Look not out, but within: Let not anothers <hi>Liberty</hi> be your Snare. Neither Act by <hi>Imitation,</hi> but <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Feeling</hi> of God's Power in your ſelves: Cruſh not the tender <hi>Buddings</hi> of it in your <hi>Souls,</hi> nor over run in your deſires, and your warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Affections</hi> the Holy and Gentle Motions of It. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is a ſtill <hi>Voice</hi> that Speaks to us in this Day, and that it is not to be heard in the <hi>Noiſes</hi> and <hi>Hurries</hi> of the <hi>Mind;</hi> but is diſtinctly underſtood in a retired Frame. Jeſus loved and choſe out <hi>Solitudes;</hi> often going to <hi>Mountains,</hi> to <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Sea-ſides</hi> to avoid <hi>Crowds</hi> and <hi>Hurries,</hi> to ſhew his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> it was good to be <hi>Solitary,</hi> and ſit looſe to the World. Two Enemies lie near your <hi>States, Imagination</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> but the plain, practical, Living, Holy Truth, that has convinced you will preſerve you, if you mind it in your ſelves, and bring all Thoughts, Imaginations and Affections to the Teſt of it, to ſee if they are wrought in God, or of the Enemy, or your own ſelves: So will a true <hi>Taſt, Diſcerning</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:22"/>
be preſerved to you, of what you ſhould do and leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: And in your diligence and Faithfulneſs in this way you will come to inherit Subſtance; and Chriſt, the Eternal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, will fill your <hi>Treaſury.</hi> And when you are Converted, as well as Convinced, then confirm your <hi>Brethren,</hi> and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to every good <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> that the Lord ſhall call you to; that you may be to his Praiſe, who has choſen you to be partakers with the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Light</hi> of a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, an Inheritance incorruptible, in <hi>Eternal Habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, as for you that are the Children of God's People, a Great Concern is upon my Spirit for your good; and often are my Knees Bowed to the God of your <hi>Fathers</hi> for you, that you may come to be partakers of the ſame <hi>Divine Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that has been the <hi>Glory</hi> of this Day; that a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you may be to <hi>God,</hi> an <hi>Holy Nation</hi> and a <hi>Peculiar People, Zealous</hi> of <hi>Good Works,</hi> when all our <hi>Heads</hi> are laid in the <hi>Duſt.</hi> Oh you <hi>Young Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> let it not ſuffice you, that you are the Children of the People of the <hi>Lord!</hi> you muſt alſo be born again, if you will inherit the Kingdom of God. Your Fathers are but ſuch after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and could but beget you into the likeneſs of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but you muſt be begotten into the likeneſs of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by a <hi>Spiritual Generation.</hi> And therefore look carefully about you, Oh ye <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Children</hi> of God, Conſider your <hi>Standing,</hi> and ſee what you are in Relation to this <hi>Divine Kindred, Family</hi> and <hi>Birth!</hi> Have you obeyed the <hi>Light,</hi> and received and walked in the Spirit, that is the <hi>incorruptible</hi> Seed of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of which you muſt be born again: God is no reſpecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Father cannot ſave or anſwer for the <hi>Child,</hi> the <hi>Child</hi> for the Father, <hi>but in the Sin thou Sinneſt, thou ſhalt die; and in the Righteouſneſs thou doeſt, through Chriſt Jeſus, thou ſhalt live;</hi> for it is the <hi>Willing</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi> that ſhall eat the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Land.</hi> Be not deceived, God is not mocked, ſuch as all <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>People</hi> Sow, ſuch they ſhall reap at the hand of the juſt God. And then your many and great Priviledges, above the Children of other People, will add weight in the ſcale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, if you chooſe not the way of the Lord. For you have had Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept, and not only <hi>good Doctrine,</hi> but <hi>good Example;</hi> and which is more, you have been turned to and acquainted with a Principle in your ſelves, which others have been ignorant of; and you know, you may be as Good as you pleaſe, without the Fear of Frowns and Blows, or being turned out of doors and forſaken of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> for God's Sake, and his Holy Religion, as has been the Caſe of ſome of your <hi>Fathers</hi> in the day they firſt entred into this <hi>Holy Path:</hi> And if you, after hearing and ſeeing the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that God has wrought in the deliverance and perſervation of them, through a <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Troubles,</hi> and the manifold Temporal, as well as ſpiritual Bleſſings, that he has filled them with in the
<pb facs="tcp:36281:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſight of their Enemies, you ſhould neglect and turn your backs upon ſo great and ſo near a <hi>Salvation,</hi> you would not only be moſt ungreatful <hi>Children</hi> to God and them, but muſt expect that God will call the Children of thoſe that knew him not, to take the <hi>Crown</hi> out of your Hands, and that your lot will be a dreadful Judgment at the hand of the Lord. But Oh that it may never be ſo with any of you! The Lord forbid, ſaith my <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, Oh ye <hi>Young Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> look to the Rock of your <hi>Fathers!</hi> chuſe the God of your <hi>Fathers:</hi> There is no other God but him; no other <hi>Light</hi> but his; no other <hi>Grace</hi> but his, nor <hi>Spirit,</hi> but his to Convince you, Quicken and Comfort you; to Lead, Guide and Preſerve you to God's <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom:</hi> So will you be Poſſeſſors, as well as Profeſſors of the <hi>Truth;</hi> embracing it not only by <hi>Education</hi> but <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Conviction,</hi> from a Senſe begotten in your <hi>Souls,</hi> through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Eternal Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God in your hearts, by which you may come to be the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> through Faith, and the circumciſion not made with Hands, and ſo heirs of the promiſe made to the <hi>Fathers</hi> of an Incorruptible <hi>Crown:</hi> That (as I ſaid before) a <hi>Generation</hi> you may be to God, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Profeſſion of the bleſſed <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of it. For <hi>Formality</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> is Nauſeous to God and good Men; and the more ſo, where any Form or Appearance has been new and peculiar, and begun and practiſed upon a Principle, with an Uncommon <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Strictneſs.</hi> Therefore I ſay, for you to fall flat and formal, and continue the profeſſion without that <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Savour,</hi> by which it is come to obtain a good Report among Men, is not to anſwer God's Love, nor your Parents Care, nor the mind of <hi>Truth</hi> in your ſelves, nor in thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; who tho' they will not obey the Truth, have <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> enough to ſee if they do that make a Profeſſion of it. For where the <hi>Divine Virtue</hi> of it is not felt in the <hi>Soul,</hi> and waited for, and lived in, imperfections will quickly break out, and ſhew themſelves, and detect the Unfaithfulneſs of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that their inſides are not ſeaſoned with the Nature of that holy <hi>Principle</hi> which they profeſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, Dear <hi>Children,</hi> let met intreat you to ſhut your Eyes at the <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Allurements</hi> of this low and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing World, and not ſuffer your affections to be captivated by thoſe <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Vanities</hi> that your <hi>Fathers,</hi> for Truths Sake, long ſince turned their Backs upon: But as you believe it to be the <hi>Truth,</hi> receive it into your Hearts, that you may become the <hi>Children of God:</hi> So that it may never be ſaid of you, as the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> Writes of the <hi>Jews</hi> of his time, That Chriſt, the true <hi>Light,</hi> came to his own, but his own received him not; but to as many as received him, to them he gave <hi>Power</hi> to become the <hi>Children of God; which were born, not of Blood, nor of the
<pb facs="tcp:36281:23"/>
Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</hi> A moſt cloſe and comprehenſive Paſſage to this occaſion: You exactly and peculiarly anſwer to thoſe profeſſing <hi>Jews,</hi> in that you bear the Name of God's People, by being the Children and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Form of God's People: So that he by his <hi>Light</hi> in you, may be ſaid to come to his own, and if you obey it not, but turn your Back upon it, and walk after the <hi>Vanities</hi> of your <hi>Minds,</hi> you will be of thoſe that receive him not, which, I pray God, may never be your <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> but that you may be throughly ſenſible of the many and great Obligations you lie under to the Lord for his <hi>Love,</hi> and your Parents for their <hi>Care:</hi> And with all your <hi>Heart</hi> and all your <hi>Soul,</hi> and all your <hi>Strength</hi> turn to the <hi>Lord,</hi> to his <hi>Gift</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in you, and hear his <hi>Voice</hi> and obey it, that you may Seal to the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of your <hi>Fathers,</hi> by the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of your own <hi>Experience;</hi> that your <hi>Childrens Children</hi> may bleſs you, and the <hi>Lord</hi> for you, as thoſe that delivered a faithful <hi>Example,</hi> as well as <hi>Record</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God</hi> unto them. So will the <hi>Gray Hairs</hi> of your Dear <hi>Parents</hi> yet alive, go down to the <hi>Grave</hi> with <hi>Joy,</hi> to ſee you the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Truth,</hi> as well as theirs, and that not only their Natures but Spirit ſhall live in you when they are gone.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this <hi>Preface</hi> with a few Words to thoſe that are not of our <hi>Communion,</hi> into whoſe hands this may come, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe of our own <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> As you are the <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and my Brethren after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> often and earneſt have been my <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> to God on your behalf, that you may come to know him that has Made you to be your <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Reſtorer</hi> to the <hi>Image</hi> that, through Sin, you have loſt, by the power and <hi>Spirit</hi> of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom he hath given for the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> And Oh that you, who are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would receive him into your Heart! for there it is you want him, and at that <hi>Door</hi> he ſtands knocking, that you ſhould let him in, but you do not open to him; You are full of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gueſts,</hi> ſo that a Manger is his Lot among you Now, as well as of Old: Yet you are full of Profeſſion, as were the <hi>Jews</hi> when he came among them, who knew him not, but rejected and evilly intreated him. So that if you come not to the Poſſeſſion and Experience of what you profeſs, all your <hi>Formality</hi> in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> will ſtand you in no ſtead in the Day of God's Judgment.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you ponder with your ſelves your <hi>Eternal Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and ſee what <hi>Title,</hi> what <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> you have for your <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> If more than a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and an Hiſtorical Belief of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Have you known the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Fan</hi> of Chriſt that winnows away the Chaff; The <hi>Carnal Luſts</hi> and <hi>Affections?</hi> That Divine <hi>Leven</hi> of the Kingdom, that being received, <hi>Levens</hi> the whole Lump of
<pb facs="tcp:36281:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Man, ſanctifying him throughout in <hi>Body, Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit?</hi> If this be not the <hi>Ground</hi> of your Confidence, you are in a Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſtate.</p>
            <p>You will ſay perhaps, that though you are <hi>Sinners,</hi> and live in the daily Commiſſion of <hi>Sin,</hi> and are not Santified, as I have been Speaking, yet you have Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who has borne the Curſe for you, and in him you are Compleat by <hi>Faith;</hi> his <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> being imputed to you.</p>
            <p>But my <hi>Friends,</hi> let me intreat you not to deceive your ſelves, in ſo Important a Point, as is that of your <hi>Immortal Souls.</hi> If you have true <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, your <hi>Faith</hi> will make you Clean, it will Sanctifie you; for the <hi>Saints</hi> Faith was their <hi>Victory:</hi> By this they over came <hi>Sin within,</hi> and <hi>Sinful Men without.</hi> And if thou art in Chriſt thou walkeſt not after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but after the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe Fruits are Manifeſt. Yea, thou art a <hi>New Creature, New Made, New Faſhioned</hi> after God's <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Mold:</hi> Old things are done away, and behold, all things are become <hi>New: New Love, Deſires, Will, Affections</hi> and <hi>Practices.</hi> It is not any longer <hi>Thou</hi> that liveſt, Thou <hi>Diſobedient, Carnal, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> One; but it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that liveth in thee, and to live is <hi>Chriſt</hi> and to die is thy <hi>Eternal Gain;</hi> becauſe thou art aſſured, <hi>That thy Corruptible ſhall put on Incorruption, and thy Mortal, Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> and that thou haſt a Glorious Houſe Eternal in the Heavens that will never wax Old or paſs away. All this follows being in Chriſt, as Heat follows Fire and Light the Sun.</p>
            <p>Therefore have a Care how you preſume to <hi>Rely</hi> upon ſuch a <hi>Notion,</hi> as that you are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whilſt in your old fallen <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For what <hi>Communion</hi> hath <hi>Light</hi> with <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> or Chriſt with <hi>Belial?</hi> Hear what the beloved Diſciple tells you: <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with God, and walk in Darkneſs, we lie, and do not the Truth.</hi> That is, if we go on in a ſinful way, are Captivated by our <hi>Carnal Affections,</hi> and are not Converted to God, we walk in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and cannot poſſibly have any fellowſhip with <hi>God.</hi> Chriſt <hi>Cloths</hi> them with his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> that receive his Grace in their Hearts, and deny themſelves, and take up his <hi>Croſs</hi> daily, and follow him. Chriſt's <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> makes Men inwardly <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> of Holy Minds, Wills and Practices. It is nevertheleſs Chriſts, becauſe we have it; for it is ours, not by <hi>Nature,</hi> but by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Adoption:</hi> It is the Gift of <hi>God:</hi> But ſtill tho' not ours, as of or from our ſelves, for in that Senſe it is Chriſt's, for it is of and from him, yet it is ours; and muſt be ours in <hi>Poſſeſſion, Efficacy</hi> and <hi>Enjoyment</hi> to do us any <hi>Good,</hi> or Chriſt's <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us nothing. It was after this manner, That he was made to the primitive Chriſtians, <hi>Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and <hi>Redemption;</hi> and if ever you will have the <hi>Comfort, Kernel</hi> and <hi>Marrow</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> thus you muſt come to learn and obtain it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:24"/>
Now, my <hi>Friends,</hi> by what you have Read, and will Read in what Follows, you may perceive, that God has viſited a <hi>Poor People</hi> among you with this ſaving <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> whom he has upheld and encreaſed to this Day, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fierce oppoſition they have met withal. Deſpiſe not the meanneſs of this <hi>Appearance:</hi> It was, and yet is (we know) a day of ſmall things, and of ſmall Account with too many; and many hard and ill Names are given to it; but it is of God, it came from him becauſe it leads to him. This we know, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make another know it, as we know it, unleſs he will take the ſame way to know it, that we took. The World talks of God; but what do they do? They pray for <hi>Power,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Principle in which it is. If you would know God and Worſhip and ſerve God, as you ſhould do, you muſt come to the means he has ordained and given for that purpoſe. Some ſeek it in <hi>Books,</hi> ſome in <hi>Learned Men,</hi> but what they look for, is in themſelves, but they overlook it. The <hi>Voice</hi> is too ſtill, the <hi>Seed</hi> too ſmall, and the <hi>Light</hi> ſhineth in <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> They are abroad, and ſo cannot divide the <hi>Spoil;</hi> but the <hi>Woman,</hi> that loſt her <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> found it at <hi>Home,</hi> after ſhe had light her Candle and ſwept her Houſe. Do you ſo too, and you ſhall find what <hi>Pilate</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to know, <hi>viz. Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The light of Chriſt within, who is the Light of the World, (and ſo a Light to you, that tells you the Truth of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) leads all, that take heed unto it, out of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> into God's marvellous <hi>Light;</hi> for <hi>Light</hi> grows upon the <hi>Obedient.</hi> It is ſown for the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and their way is a ſhining <hi>Light,</hi> that ſhines forth more and more to the perfect day.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, O <hi>Friends,</hi> Turn in, Turn in, I beſeech you! Where is the <hi>Poiſon,</hi> there is the <hi>Antidote:</hi> There you want Chriſt, and there you muſt find him; and bleſſed be God, there you may find him. <hi>Seek and you ſhall find,</hi> I teſtifie for God: But then you muſt ſeek aright, with your whole <hi>Heart,</hi> as Men that ſeek for their <hi>Lives,</hi> yea, for their <hi>Eternal Lives:</hi> Diligently, Humbly, Patiently, as thoſe that can taſte no Pleaſure, Comfort or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in any thing elſe, unleſs you find him whom your <hi>Souls</hi> want, and deſire to know and love above all. O it is a <hi>Travail,</hi> a Spiritual <hi>Travail!</hi> Let the Carnal, Profane World think and ſay as it will. And through this Path you muſt walk to the City of God, that has Eternal <hi>Foundations,</hi> if ever you will come there.</p>
            <p>Well! And what does this bleſſed <hi>Light</hi> do for you? Why, 1. it ſets all your ſins in order before you: It detects the Spirit of this World in all its <hi>Bates</hi> and <hi>Allurements,</hi> and ſhews how Man came to fall from God, and the fallen Eſtate he is in. 2. It begets a Senſe and Sorrow, in ſuch as believe in it, for this fearful Laps. You will then ſee him Diſtinctly, whom you have <hi>Pierced</hi> him, and all the <hi>Blows</hi> and <hi>Wounds</hi> you have given him by your <hi>Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:36281:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and how you have made him to ſerve with your Sins, and you will <hi>Weep</hi> and <hi>Mourn</hi> for it, and your <hi>Sorrow</hi> will be a <hi>Godly Sorrow.</hi> 3. After this it will bring you to the Holy <hi>Watch,</hi> to take <hi>Care</hi> that you do ſo no more, that the Enemy ſurpriſe you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Then <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as well as <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> will come to <hi>Judgment,</hi> which is the way of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> in which the <hi>Redeemed</hi> of the Lord do Walk. Here you will come to love God above all, and your Neighbours as your ſelves. Nothing <hi>Hurts,</hi> Nothing <hi>Harms,</hi> Nothing makes <hi>Afraid</hi> on this <hi>Holy Mountain:</hi> Now you come to be Chriſt's indeed, for you are his in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not your own. And when you are thus Chriſt's, then Chriſt is yours, and not before: And here <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi> and with the <hi>Son</hi> you will know, and the Efficacy of the <hi>Blood</hi> of Cleanſing, even the <hi>Blood</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Lamb,</hi> which ſpeaketh better things than the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and which cleanſeth from all Sin the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of thoſe that, through the living Faith, come to be ſprinkled with it from dead Works to ſerve the living God.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, Behold the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the People called <hi>Quakers!</hi> Behold their <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline!</hi> And behold the bleſſed <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> that were ſent of God in this Excellent <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Service!</hi> All which will be more particularly expreſſed in the Enſuing <hi>Annals</hi> of the Man of God; which I do heartily recommend to my <hi>Readers</hi> moſt ſerious Peruſal, and beſeech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that his Bleſſing may go along with it, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of many, as yet Strangers to this <hi>Holy Diſpenſation,</hi> and alſo to the Edification of the Church of God in General: Who, for his manifold and repeated Mercies and Bleſſings to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this day of his great Love, is worthy ever to have the <hi>Glory, Honour, Thanksgiving</hi> and <hi>Renown;</hi> and be it rendred and aſcribed, with Fear and Reverence, through him in whom he is well pleaſed, his bloved <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Lamb,</hi> our <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> that ſits with him upon the Throne, World without End.</p>
            <closer>Amen, Says
<signed>One that God has long ſince Mercifully favoured with his <hi>Fatherly Viſitation,</hi> and who was not Diſobedient to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Viſion and Call, to whom the Way of Truth is more <hi>Lovely</hi> and <hi>Precious</hi> than ever, and that knowing the Beauty and Benefit of it above all Worldly Treaſure, has choſen it for his <hi>Chiefeſt Joy,</hi> and therefore recommends it to thy Love and Choice, becauſe he is with great Sincerity and Affection thy Souls Friend.
