            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43541:4"/>
and increaſe it ſelf and others in truth and love.</p>
               <p>1. Inſtead of the immediate preſence of God,
(whom bleſſed are the eyes who ſee) which I hope
<hi>to enjoy with theſe eyes face to face: One thing have I
deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell
in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold
the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple;</hi> for
I have loved the habitation of his houſe, and the
place where his honour dwelleth, ever ſince I have
gone with the multitude, ever ſince I have gone with
them into the houſe of God, with the voyce of joy
and praiſe, with a multitude that kept Holy day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord God of

God, bleſſed are they that dwell in thine houſe, for
they will be still praiſing thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Inſtead of that perfection of Soul, Nature, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
Gifts and Graces which I hope for, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to ſtay here a while, growing in grace, and in
the knowledge of God, perfecting holineſſe in the
fear of the Lord, and withall in my place to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
towards the work of the Miniſtry, and the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the

by exerciſing an impartiall Authority, by ſhewing
an exemplary Converſation, in order to the reſtoring
of that purity, decency, order, and Uniformity of
Chriſtian Religion, which becomes the wiſedom
and honour of this Nation, by the exacteſt Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43541:5"/>
with the Catholick Church, in its pureſt and
Primitive Conſtitution, a happineſſe to be effected
and enjoyed by the pious Councils, devout Prayers,
potent Preaching, and Learned Writings of good
and great men, owned by all Churches, loved by all
people, ſupported by all Princes, according to all
right reaſon, all due order, all politick honour, all
Scripturall patterns and Divine preſidents, beſides
the Laws and antient Cuſtoms of this Church and
State, which had allwaies a due regard to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their Learning, the ſoundneſs of their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the gravity of their Ages, the ſanctity of their
Lives, and the dignity of their Calling.</p>
               <p>3. Inſtead of the excellent ſociety of Saints and
Angells, which I hoped for in Heaven: I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be with the Excellent that are in the Earth,
who content themſelves with that plain and priſtine
holyneſle, which is taught in the Scripture, depoſited
in the Church, preſerved by an holy Miniſtry, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in Chriſtian lives; Moſt eminently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in Jeſus Chriſt: and his Apoſtles, the great
and famous teachers and examples of holy truth,
holy duties, holy Sacraments, holy Orders, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Miniſtry in the Church to this time: that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
by which we obey the command, embrace the
truth, fear the threatnings, obſerve the duties, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Inſtitutions, continue the Orders, reverence
the Embaſſadours, joy in the Graces, hope in the
promiſes, and in all things are conformable to Chriſt
by his bleſſed Spirit, who transforms us from glory
to glory: I mean thoſe holy men, 1. that <hi>hear the
word</hi> with trembling; 2. that <hi>pray with understanding;</hi>
conſtancy, fervency, reverence, and comlineſle;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43541:5"/>
3. that receive the pledges of Gods love in Chriſt,
from the hands of Reverend men, called of God by
the Church with care, preparedneſſe, and thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
4. thoſe holy men who love in ſincerity, give
with cheerfullneſſe, rejoyce in well doing, <hi>ſuffer with
patience,</hi> live by faith, act by charity: And live in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
contentedneſſe and humility, a communion of
theſe Saints is part of the glory to be revealed: O
happy thoſe who enjoy the benefit of their compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
abilities, their aſtoniſhing accompliſhments,
their powerfull diſcourſes, their obliging converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
their enflamed devotion, their exact piety, their
remarkable integrity, their innocent and large pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
their ſervent zeal, and their publick Spirit: O
it is good for us to be here.</p>
               <p>4. Even the High-prayſes of God, which we
hope ſhall be in our mouthes with Angels, and Arch-Angells:
We may enjoy in the Holy Church,
which throughout all the World doth acknowledge
God with heavenly prayſes, they on Earth anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

delay of that perfect ſtate where Sin is quite remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Sorrow caſt away, Teares wiped from mens
eyes, to hope for that ſtate of the Church, wherein
we might be kept regularly to mortifie the deeds of
the body, where we might have learned to ſwallow
up our Sorrow, with the graces of Patience and Joy,
our Fears with a Bleſſed Hope, our wants with a

World; In a word, enjoying by a gratious Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
a Heaven of happineſſe in this vale of miſery,

               <p>6. Theſe and the like particulars, made up that
happineſſe, in the hope whereof, I flattered my ſelf,
to ſome comfort in my few dayes full of trouble:
The happineſſe that we ſhould all have to rejoyce
with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and be glad with her; <hi>All we that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her, and to rejoyce for joy, with all we that mourned
for her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A happineſſe we thought unqueſtionable, when
our God who ſeemed to be angry but for a moment
returned to embrace us with everlaſting kindneſſe;
When 1. aſſiſted by his grace and bleſſing, 2. coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
with the preſence and authority of a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

the Prudence of man reconciling intereſts, cloſing

Diſcipline, to eſtabliſh an Eccleſiaſtical Law, alas
he cannot ſhew his authority in things neceſſary, for
his Subjects are tyed to them already, nor in things
ſinfull, for they are forbidden already, nor in things
indifferent, for there all men muſt be at Liberty:
Wherein have you ſworn to him as Supream? O be

Laws of one ſolemnly acknowledged ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
which are 1. Scriptural as to the main ground,
rule, and end of them; 2. Rational, as to the Order,
decency &amp; gravity of them; 3. Primitive and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
be diſowned, repined at and complained of, by
men ſworn to obſerve thoſe Laws: O men fearing
<hi>God, when you have vowed a vew deferr not to pay it, for
he hath no pleaſure in fools:</hi> Suffer not thy mouth to
cauſe thy fleſh to ſin; neither ſay thou before the
Angel it is an Error, wherefore ſhould God be angry

for in many words which may be alleged to excuſe
the violation of this Oath there is vanity: <hi>But fear
thou God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This oppoſition to his Majeſties Authority in
matters Eccleſiaſtical, is againſt their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
(and unhappy are they that condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in others, in thoſe things which they allow)
you that diſown Authority in matters of Religion,
did not you exerciſe it? you that repine at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

you that are troubled for deprivation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Non-ſubſcription, did not you turn out holy, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

you have done: Neither is his Majeſty more ſevere

Thus I ſee (ſaith the Royal Martyr) thoſe who

the due obedience of lawfull Conſtitutions, ſo that

O ſuffer others to deal with you, as you have

Prophets.</p>
               <p>4. This diſcontent of yours to the preſent eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment,
is very partiall, (for men that know they
ſhould have no reſpect of Perſons, and that nothing
ſhould be done through partiality) you who could
call an Uſurping Tyranny a <hi>Liberty;</hi> who could be
contented with that variety of Governments and
Factions, that exerciſed the Nations patience, can
diſcern nothing in a lawfull Prince but Jealouſies,
in a ſettled Church but Superſtition, nothing in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Laws but Perſecution, nothing in an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion but Popery; are ye not (Brethren)
partiall in your ſelves, and become Judges of evil
thoughts: <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. 4. if ye fulfill the <hi>Royal Law</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scripture, you do well; but if ye have
reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſin, and are convinced
of the <hi>Law</hi> for tranſgreſſors.</p>
               <p>5. This unexpected diſcontent ſeems to be a
great ſcandall and offence to his Majeſty, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of our Faith, and all other Kings and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43541:12"/>
who will now look upon Proteſtants as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of Government, Enemies of Orders, and
diſturbers of Peace: When they are thus unquiet
under an innocent Government, how will they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themſelves under a ſeverer Tyranny? if they
are thus impatient of their good and gentle, how
impatient will they be of their moroſe and auſtere
Maſters? Its an offence to the Church to ſee its lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Cuſtoms decryed, its venerable Laws neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
its antient Canons deſpiſed, its great Example
deſpiſed; and that he is now the beſt Chriſtian, who
was formerly the worſt Infidell, that <hi>did not hear the
Church:</hi> Its a grief to good men that have many ſad
thoughts of heart for the diviſions of <hi>Reuben;</hi> and
a joy to the bad, who cry, <hi>Aha, ſo would we have
it.</hi>—O woe to the world becauſe of offences;
woe to thoſe men by whom offences come; Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
you are called to Liberty, but it is a great
ſin to uſe your Liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh,
but by love ſerve one another: Its not good to
do any thing whereby thy <hi>Brother,</hi> much leſſe
whereby the whole Church ſtumbleth, or is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
if the Primitive Chriſtians, when it was at
their own choice, whether they ſhould uſe ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
thing, or whether they would not uſe them,
complyed in their practiſe with their Brethren, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
their Liberty, ſo as to give no offence:
What ſhall they anſwer to the God of Peace, whoſe
Liberty though determined by Superiors, is uſed by
them to the diſobedience of thoſe Superiours, and
the offence of their Brethren?</p>
               <p>6. The preſent diſtemper ſeems to be ungratefull,
in regard of other favours of his Majeſty; his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43541:13"/>
hath ſaved our lives, and now do we ſtand upon
our Liberty? now we had been many dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a King, without a Prince, and without a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and newly return to ſeek the Lord and <hi>David</hi>
our King; ſhall we ſo far ſin againſt the Lord, as
to run back again to our former method of ſin and
miſery? God forbid! Are we newly pardoned
and ſaved to return with the Dog to his vomit, and
with the Sow to her wallowing in uncle anneſſe, do
live by his mercy, and ſhall we not make him that
natural, equal, and eaſic return to live in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>2. This <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> is not only ſinfull in its
nature, but as miſchievous in its apparent effects:
which are,</p>
               <p>1. A needleſs breach of the Communion of
Saints; O ſad, that men profeſſing one Religion,
acknowledging one God, partaking of one Faith,
initiated by one Baptiſm, joyned together with one
Spirit, redeemed with one precious bloud, called
to one hope, looking for one Common ſalvation,
ſhould for things Confeſſed indifferent keep up
diviſions, foment diſtances, and refuſe to be of
one heart, one mind, and one way, that the Lord
may be one, and his Name one.</p>
               <p>2. A diſhonor to the Goſpel, whoſe deſign is peace,
whoſe Author is a Prince of Peace, whoſe Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are Embaſſadors of Peace, whoſe Spirit is a
Spirit of Peace, whoſe higheſt honour was meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and peace: but alas! is become now the
great make-bate of the world, the enemy of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the ſubverter of Laws, the pretence of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that which <hi>turnes the world upſide down.</hi> Wo is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43541:13"/>
us when our excellent Religion is ill-ſpoken of, by
reaſon of our unworthy Converſation; the <hi>Heathen</hi>
whom we ſhould Convert, will be jealous of us; the
<hi>Turk</hi> whom we ſhould Convince, will keep at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from us; the <hi>Papist</hi> whom we ſhould Reform,
will perſecute, when we cannot live under Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
mild, and juſt Governments, but are diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
unthankfull, unholy, truce-breakers, traytors,
heady, high-minded, <hi>having a form of godlineſs, and
denying the power thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This Non-Conformity will continue thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
which endangered the firſt Reformers at
<hi>Francford:</hi> diſturbed the State in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
time, diſquieted the Church in King <hi>James</hi> his
dayes, and ruined the Church and State in King
<hi>Charles</hi> his time, that time of the beſt temper, and
the health fulleſt Conſtitution, made up of ſincere
truth, unfeigned charity, liberal piety, unaffected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
with juſt authority and uninterrupted ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Entertained with holy moderation and humble
proſperity. Come not thou my Soul into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
unto their aſſemblies mine honour be not thou
united, who maintain a perpetual diſſention, and
cheriſh the grounds of an endleſs Schiſm, as ſerves
to give both occaſion and confidence to different
parties, both to excite their private ambitions, and in

opportunity is given by any negligence, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or diſtemper in Government or Governors.</p>
               <p>4. This non-Conformity, will obſtruct the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of true Piety, while men are to much enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the Circumſtances they neglect, the ſubſtance
of Religion, while by a ſullen ſeparation, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

from one another, to an incapacity of exhorting
one <hi>Another while it is called to Day, leaſt</hi> any be <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
through the deceitfullneſs of Sin; Of Provoking one
another to love, and to good works: And of following after
the things that make for Peace, and things wherewith
one may edifie another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This publick diſagreement will be a great obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the progreſſe of the Goſpel, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be received by others, untill we are agreed in the
profeſſion of it our ſelves: while we thus unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
engaged one againſt another, we cannot all end
that publick Service of making <hi>the way of God to be
known upon Earth, his ſaving health among all Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its too great an advantage to the common Enemy,
who making uſe of Parties reaſons and paſſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
other, thereby overthrows all. It was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> to the Perſons that undertook
to reduce <hi>Ireland</hi> back again to Popery, <hi>That they
ſhould apply themſelves to the Nonconformiſt, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
them with the Covetouſneſſe, ambition, and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Conformiſts on the one hand:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>and on the other
they ſhould apply themſelves to the Conformists, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
them with the Factiouſneſſe, diſobedience, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of the Nonconformiſts; that ſo they might be
provoked to ſpend their fury upon each other, to their
mutual ruine.</hi> I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge you
what I ſay.</p>
               <p>7. This rupture is dangerous to our Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
for beſides the Roman advantage, which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
and Laſt, the private paſſions and various inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of Factions and parts will hazard the Civil peace
by endeavours to promote their ſeveral opinions and
pretences under any ſpecious name whatſoever;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43541:14"/>
alas! if theſe Separations continue, men know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is but one Religion, as there is but
one God, and his holy Will but one, every one
is prone to preſume that he is in the right. Next
hee growes ſo partial to his own perſwaſions, to
imagine this above all others beſt, and onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to God; then he concludes all other wayes
of Religion as diſpleaſing to God as to himſelf: hence
zeal and impotent Impulſes to propagate his own
way, and overthrow all others, as an acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and ſacrifice to God: which is done, firſt by
words, diſputing, writing, rayling, and reviling; if
that will not ſerve to reform the obſtinate world, then
he firſt wiſheth, afterwards uſeth the ſword, as ſoon
as he and his party can get number and power ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to act with probable ſafety: ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
he counts a Call of God, an hand of Providence
inviting and directing what to do to eſtabliſh his own
way againſt all others, never ſo approved of good
men, and proſpered by Gods grace and bleſſing: yea,
therefore we may obſerve that they are unwilling to
grant that freedom to others their inferiors in number
and power, which they once deſired of their ſuperiors
upon a reaſon of State, that dictates to all men thus
much: <hi>That publick Differings in matter of Religion
are very dangerous to the civil Peace of thoſe that
enjoy Power, and are quiet under it;</hi> which every
party ſecretly envieth, repines at, and endeavors to
obtain for it ſelf: and therefore make no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of any Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Subjection, or
Chriſtian patience and ſubmiſſion, longer then they
are ſo ballanced by the power and prudence of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
that they <hi>cannot ſubdue all things under their
feet:</hi> Oh, its pity that thoſe more minute Opinions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43541:15"/>
and Perſwaſions (when Religion which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain,
ſtirs up mens paſsions) ſhould have more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to divide, than all the Agreements in other main
matters, hath to preſerve love and unity, as men,
Countrey-men, and Chriſtians: in ſo much that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> which was grown to that height
of Beauty, Piety, Order, Moderation, and Honor, as
became the glory of God, the majeſty of Chriſtian
Religion, and the Wiſdom of this Nation, hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>H. 8. Ed. 6. Q. Eliz</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> time bin
endangered by theſe ſtruglings in Religion (which the
publick Power, policy, and vigilancy of thoſe times
repreſſed) and at laſt was undone by ſuch breaches
that are unparalleled in former, and will be ſcarce
credible in after Ages.</p>
               <p>8. This reluctancy of ſome againſt the preſent
Eſtabliſhment, threatens all Government which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in a full power to eſtabliſh and maintain Laws,
Equity, Juſtice, and Religion: on the one hand, that
we may lead peaceable and quiet lives, in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and honeſty: and on the other hand, in due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
for Conſcience ſake, to thoſe Laws and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Government, every one ſtudying to be
quiet, and to follow his own buſineſs.</p>
               <p>If you now refuſe the ſeaſonable and well-advis'd
Law, Order, and Decency propoſed by the Church,
under pretence of Liberty of Conſcience, you will
teach others to refuſe Laws of the ſame nature from
you: with the ſame Arguments that you oppoſe the
directions of the Liturgy, others did ariſe who oppoſe
the Rubrick of the Directory; and there is no ſtop in
ſetting up private Opinions againſt publick deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;
but in confuſion, diſorder, &amp; ruine to your
private judgement: you cannot allow preſent Laws,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43541:15"/>
others private judgement cannot allow your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances:
Its your thoughts that you are above forms,
its others thoughts they are above ordinances: you
diſlike a Surplice, they diſlike a Gown: you cannot
approve the Biſhops double honor of reverence and
revenue, and they cannot approve yours of reverence
and tythe: you cannot uſe the Croſs in Baptiſm,
they cannot uſe Baptiſm it ſelf: you cannot admit
ſome innocent circumſtances in the Lords Supper,
they caſt off the Lords Supper it ſelf: you cannot
away with Muſick, nor they with Pſalms: what end
would there be of Diſſenſions, unleſs the Magiſtrate
did interpoſe for outward peace and order? men ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would grow worſe and worſe, deceiving and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deceived, till their folly be made manifeſt to all
men. What diſſolution of order? what novelties of

ſacrilegious invaſions of the Church? what contempt
of the Clergy? what overthrows of Magiſtrates, and
all Government, have been managed by the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
now contended for, all ſober men have beheld
with ſorrow of heart, and can bear witneſs to with
their ſighs, teares, and ruine? <hi>O tell it not in Gath,
publiſh it not in Askelon!</hi> I pray God give us all
moderation and impartiality, the beſt tempers in
religion, unpaſsionately to conſider from whence we
are fallen by <hi>humane policies,</hi> and to what we are
tranſported by popular zeal, that all diſtempers
may be laid aſide by free converſe, and a Chriſtian
correſpondence, whereby thoſe ſad principles of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
ſchiſm might be removed: by which on our
ſide men think, becauſe in many things they are right,
therefore they can erre in nothing: and on the other
ſide, becauſe in ſome things men have miſtaken and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43541:16"/>
erred, therefore they can be in nothing right, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard ſo that Truth and Charity which is the
life and quinteſſence of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>9. Its of very dangerous conſequence, that you,
who ſhould promote the joy and thankfulneſs of His
Majeſties loving ſubjects for His happy Reſtauration,
ſhould now occaſion theſe fears, jealouſies, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. We are agreed,<note place="margin">Ameſius Caſe of Conſcience. Mr. Downham of Oathes. Dr. Saunderſon de Juramento. Biſhop Gaudens Analyſis. Biſhop Tailor Conſcience. Baldwin, de Conſcientia.</note> That an unlawful Oath cannot
tye us to the performances of it, (becauſe nothing can tye
us to ſin) but rather to a repentance for it: as a double ſin,
1. the one, the intention of an evil: 2 the other, ſwearing
of it ſo intended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. We are agreed, That the ſolemn League and
Covenant was unlawful, 1 becauſe it was impoſed contrary
to the Liberty the Subject had ſworn in the Proteſtation to
defend; to which Liberty, the Impoſition of a new Oath,
other then is eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament, King, Lords
and Commons, is ſaid in the Petition of Right, and in the
Declaration of the Lords and Commons, to be contrary.</p>
                     <p>2. It was againſt the conſent of the ſupream Magiſtrate,
without whom no publick Reſolution can be taken contrary
to his Government, no more then we muſt allow a childe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43541:26"/>
or ſervant, to reſolve any thing contrary to the welfare of
the family where they are, without the father or maſters
conſent.</p>
                     <p>3. Becauſe it was in the manner of it violent, wherein
men had uot power over their own will.</p>
                     <p>4. Becauſe it was in the matter of it ſinful; as 1. obliging
us to things diſorderly beyond our meaſure, to meddle with
things too high for us: 2. As obliging us to caſt out Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
as tyrannical, and the Liturgy as ſuperſtitious: 1 to the
ſcandal of the Papiſt, to whom the Cauſe is hereby yielded,
which our Learned Writers have maintained againſt them.
2. To the juſtifying them in the ſcorn and reproach of our
Religion. 3. To a confeſſion that the Laws and Puniſhments
made and inflicted againſt Papiſts here, are unjuſt. 4. To
the violation of our own Conſciences, 1. who approved
both, as agreeable to the word of God in our ſubſcriptions
at our Ordination, and otherwiſe: 2 who ſwore to both in
our Proteſtation, to defend the true Proteſtant Religion
expreſſed in the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in
the Oath of Supremacy. 3. who know both to be of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
inſtitution, and of ancient practiſe, and ſo owned
by us, in our ſubſcription to the 39 Articles. 4. as obliging
men to extirpate that, which the Parliament declared they
would not aboliſh <hi>Rem. 15. Dec. 1641. Decl. 9. Apr.</hi> 1642.
5. Unlawful, becauſe obliging us to what is unpoſſible. 6 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
limiting our care of his Majeſty, to the defence of
true Religion, whereas we muſt be loyal to him, let him
profeſs what Religion he pleaſe. 7. It was unlawful in the
end of it, which was war, turmult, and ſedition, and the ruine
of the kingdom, becauſe of that oath the land mourned, and
we did many ſad things with <hi>Herod,</hi> becauſe of the oath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> We are agreed, That as if a woman vowed a vow to the Lord,
which her father diſſalloweth in the day that he heareth of it, not any
of her bonds, or vowes ſhall ſtand, <hi>Num.</hi> 30. ſo now we have vowed a
vow, and the father of our countrey diſalloweth it, the vow where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we have bound our ſelfs ſhould not ſtand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. We agree all herein, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Dangerous poſition
aboveſaid, and the Covenant are of ſuch deſperate tendences that if we
abjure them not, as we may be deprived by the ſtatute of Conformity
ſo we may be proceeded againſt as dangerous perſons,<note place="margin">Se at for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Majeſty perſon.</note> by the ſtatutes of
treaſon, the Kingdom will think that he that hath a Covenant in his
heart hath a war there too, and ſo muſt not onely looſe his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but his protection too, as a perſon not onely to be ſilenced but
confined too.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:43541:26"/>
Thus at a Conference it was agreed how far we
ought to ſubmit to a Chriſtian Magiſtrates Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in matters of Religion, upon ſuch Principles as
are owned by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Manton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crofton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Mr. <hi>Caſe,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> and many others, in print before the
world.</p>
