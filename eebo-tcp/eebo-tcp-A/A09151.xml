            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Taffie and slew them, and burned the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

The fifth day after there came men from

therfore and Dan, feigning our selues to

set the Gates wide open to our Brethren

when we had sacked the City one did caste

went we to Thamua, whiche was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge

went and sued humbly to my Father, who
made a couenaunt with them, so as wee

When the eighteene yeares were past, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

howbeit wee did shut them vp within it,
and besieged it. Nowe when they shewed
not themselues abroad in twentie dayes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14005:35"/>
together, I put my helmet vpon my head
and in sight of them all set vp a ladder, and
scaling the wall slew fower of their noble
men with a Stone of the weight of three
talentes. The next day Ruben and Gad
went in and slewe three score other. Then
they offered peace, and we by our fathers
aduice receaued them to tribute. And they
gaue vs two hundred quarters of Corne,
fiue hundred Bates of Oyle, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande

Ye childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Isachar heare

the woordes of the beloued of the Lorde.
I am Iacobs fifth sonne, in the reward of

out of the fielde, and Rachell mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng

Ruben wept, and at his noise my mother
Lea came out. Now the Mandrakes were
sweete sented apples, whiche the lande of
Aran bryngeth forthe in high countreis,
by the waterualleis. And Rachell saied, I
will not geue thee these Apples, because
they shal helpe me to children. Now there
were twoo of these Apples. And Lea said,
doth it not suffice thee, that thou hast got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
awaie the housbande of virginitie, but
that thou wilte haue this also: She aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
let Iacob lye with thee to night,
for thy sonnes Mandragoras. Lea saied
vnto her, do not boste nor brag, for Iacob
is myne, and I am the wife of his youth.
And Rachell aunswered, howe so, was he
not first handfasted vnto me, and serued he
not our Father, fowerteene yeres for me?
<pb facs="tcp:14005:44"/>
What shall I doe to thee? For many are
the wiles and policies of menne, and gile
goes forward vpon yearth. If it had been
otherwise, thou shouldest not haue sen Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
in the face at this daie. For thou arte
not his wife, but werte guilfully putte to
hym in my steade. My father deceiued me,
and conueiyng me awaie that nighte, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
me not to see hym. For had I been
there, this had not come to passe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take thee one Mandrake, and in lewe
of the other, I graunte thee hym for one
nighte. And Iacob knewe Lea, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuyng
bare me, and called my name Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char,
because of the hire. Then an Angell
of the lorde appeared vnto Iacob, and said
that Rachel should beare but two sonnes,
because she had forsaken the companie of
her housebande, and chosen continencie:
And if my mother Lea had not geuen thee
twoo Apples for his companie, she should
haue borne eighte children, whereas by
reason of that, she bare but sixe, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell
twoo, because GOD visited her in
the Mandrakes. For he knewe that she
desired to company with Iacob for issues
