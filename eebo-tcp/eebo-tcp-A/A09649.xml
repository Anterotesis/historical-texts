         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OVR worſhips remember, that at
the beginning of the laſt newe yere,
I preſented to you in wrighting, that
which the Lorde a little before, had
giuen me to ſpeake, in two ſhort Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
at BURI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, adding not muche to that which
was then vttered, as the diligent hearer of me can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.
The reaſon of my ſo doing I alledged (as the
trueth was:) that I might haue ſomevvhat (according
to the maner of that time) vvherewith to teſtifie the
good affection vvhich of duty I owe vnto you both:
as vvel for the manifold bleſſings, vvhich the church
of God and the common wealth in theſe partes of
Suffolke, enioyeth by your meanes: as for your care
for my particuler ſafetie, and for the great comfort
which by you, from time to time, I haue had ſithence
my comming into this countrie. The Lord regiſter
them in his booke, that they may come into your
good accounts in the day of his ſonne. And becauſe
it pleaſed you then, to giue ſuch liking of the treatiſe,
that both of you deſired to reteine the coppie, and
requeſted the ſame at my hands, vvherof alſo I made
promiſe: the beſt vvay for the performance of this,
I ſuppoſed vvas the putting of it in print: which I was
the rather contented to do, becauſe the matter deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
in it, beeing neceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arie to be taught &amp; belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb facs="tcp:6768:3"/>
I hoped might be profitable and comfortable to
others: vvhich alſo vvas the iudgement of ſome god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and learned men that reade it ouer. My purpoſe
when I preached of the text, was to ſturre vp my ſelf
and the hearers, to beare patiently, comfortablie, and
profitablie al afflictions that might fal out for a good
conſcience ſake: my purpoſe in ſending it a broade,
and in making it more common to the churche of
God, is the ſame. The doctrine is neceſſarie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
vs for thoſe times of trouble, which the abuſing
of our peace, the contempt of the goſpell, the euill
handling of the miniſters, &amp; the infinite abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the land, haue moſt iuſtly deſerued. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alſo as vve haue theſe many yeares beene vvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and threatned, not only by our prophets &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
but alſo by fearefnll ſignes in heauen &amp; earth,
that fortesl vnto vs further euils, vnleſſe in time from
the higheſt to the lovveſt vve repent, take a better
courſe, and turne from our diſobedience. Yea, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the time preſent, this argument is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
vnneceſſary: for although we haue iuſt cauſe
dayly vpon our knees, to praiſe God for her maieſty,
the moſt honourable of her counſell, and the reſt of
the gouerners in the Churche &amp; common wealth:
by whoſe gracious meanes wee haue good lawes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
&amp; executed, for the liberty of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; for the comfort and incouragement of ſuch
as meane well: yet wee ſee howe in euerye
place where the worde is taught: cold proteſtantes,
earthly minded men, papiſtes and Athieſts, ſeeke &amp;
deuiſe all poſſible meanes they can, to hinder the
courſe of the goſpell, and to diſquiet the preachers &amp;
profeſſours, which oppoſe them ſelues againſte their
corruptions, and refuſe to ioyne with them in their
diſorders. A matter too to vſual in theſe euil dayes,
<pb facs="tcp:6768:3"/>
as the faythfull ſeruants of God knowe, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places finde true by miſerable experience If the
preachers in any towne be carefull to do their duty,
what quarrelles doe wicked men pick, to ſtop their
mouths, weary them, and to driue them away? and if
any of the flocke take part with their teachers, and
profeſſe obedience to the trueth, they want no euill
words, frovvning lookes, and hard practiſes againſte
them, from popiſh, vvorldly, &amp; irreligious men. The
practiſes of our country of Suffolke, (to let paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alowde for vengeance in the eares of the Lorde of
hoſtes, as your vvorſhips very vvell know. VVe haue

They teache the trueth of God, vvith all manner
ſo dutifulnes and holy loialty to her maieſty and the
ſtate, they be carefull to liue vvell to the vttermoſte
of their povver: and the Lorde be thanked, that hath
giuen them ſome good meaſnre of grace, in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.
They lacke not countenance, comfort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
from the honorable and worſhipful in the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſion
of peace for the ſhire, ſo farre as they maye
with a good conſcience, and according to the lawes
of our moſt gracious ſouereigne. VVee prayſe
God therefore, and thinke our ſelues bound to pray
daily for you all. But I pray you, what impes hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
ſturred vp amongſt vs, almoſt in euery Towne
vvhere the vvorde is preached, to hinder this vvorke
of the Lorde? hath there bene any vvay vnattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to ſhake ſome of the preachers, and in them, no

of the teachers, and to profeſſe more holineſſe
then others, (though alas not ſo much as they ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:6768:4"/>
doe) eſcape not the vennom of poiſoned tongues.
The pore people here and there in the country, that
be more carefull then the reſt, to reſort to ſermons,
to heare the vvoorde, learne their dutie, and vvith a
good conſcience to diſcharge ſuch duties as by oth,
are layd vpon them, bee not vvithout their croſſes.
Some (by the malice of naughty inſufficient mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
&amp; other vntovvarde men), to redeeme peace,
glad to leaue the tovvn vvhere they dvvelled: Others

You ſee then what we haue here to learne
in the firſt place, namely not to be troubled
at the perſecutions which may happen to
our ſelues, or any other the members of
Chriſt, For the profeſſion of his truth and
doing of our duety, as though ſome ſtrange
thing were come to paſſe, ſeeing it is the
ordinary courſe, which the wicked worlde
(whoſe works are nought) taking their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from their grandfather <hi>Caine,</hi> hath
from time to time practiſed agaynſte the
church, and the ordinary way, by the which
the Lord from age to age, hath lead all his
children: to the verifiyng of that, which
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> preached whereſoeuer

God, and enter into the profeſſion of his

If I take the courſe of the world, I run to

the only way vnto heauen &amp; eternall life, I

For then how earneſt ſoeuer wee ſeeme to

to imagine that wee bee without all feare
<pb facs="tcp:6768:13"/>
of reuolting,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 13</note> becauſe in the liberty &amp; peace

ſhold be eaſily diſcerned from the hypocrit
and diſſemvler. When all the enemies of
<hi>Dauid</hi> were ſubdued round about, and the
whole kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> approued him
for their only and true ſouereigne, ther was
no great trial of the fidelitie of his ſubiects
But when <hi>Sheba</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Bichri</hi> blew
the Trumpet and ſayd,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 20. 1. 2</note> we haue no parte
in <hi>Dauid,</hi> neither haue we inheritaunce in
the ſonne of <hi>Ishai,</hi> euery man to his tents
<pb facs="tcp:6768:13"/>
O <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And this drew away great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the people to make an inſurrection:
Then ſuch as in the middeſt of thoſe rebels
by word or practiſe, teſtified their ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Dauid</hi> with the hazard of their eſtate,
gaue vndoubted teſtimonies of their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We can not ſay for a truth, that al ſuch
be faythfull to her maieſtie, whiche in this
her great proſperity (wherein no enemye
dare quech) ſeemeth ſo to be: they which in
the dayes of <hi>Westmerland</hi> and <hi>Nort hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaud,</hi>
ſtoode vnto her in thoſe partes of
the North agaynſt their Lordes to their
daunger, were faythfull in deede, and the
land might make a good reckoning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
in any other the like occaſion. As therefore
by ſuche meanes as theſe, loyall and true
hearted ſubiectes to their prince be tried: ſo
when troubles and perſecutions ariſe for
the word, they which be ſincere &amp; vpright
in the feare of the Lord, be diſcerned from
the counterfeite, whiche in their profeſſion

               </gap>aue ſought nothing but their aduauntage

               </gap>nd eaſe. And then in deed we haue put the
church of God and our owne conſciences
out of al doubt concerning our entegritye,
when in the middeſt of afflictions for the
<pb facs="tcp:6768:14"/>
goſpell ſake, we haue continued with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to profeſſe the ſame. We ſee therefore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
it is not without good cauſe, why perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be called a fiery trial. Now, euen this
ſhould teach vs, patiently &amp; comfortably to
endure al maner of croſſes, for the trueth &amp;
a good conſcience, ſith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our holding out in
them, is a certein proofe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our faith is good
&amp; our obedience ſuch as will go for paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
before the Lord. From whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo we may
vndoubtedly perſwade our ſelues, that wee
ſhal not faint when the like or greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
fall out. When we haue a caſe in law
for any landes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we claime, we are glad to
haue our euidences examined, whether they
be good or no, before we come to the pinch:
&amp; if we haue golde lye by vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we occupy
not, wee are content to haue it tried before
hand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be ſure it will bee currant,
whenſoeuer occaſion falleth out to vſe it.
Why then be we not glad, of diſgracings,
railings, complaints, loſſe of fauour, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
and ſuch like, when they come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs for doing of our duty &amp; righteouſnes
ſake? ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by our ſuffering of them, the
Lord prepareth vs for greater matters, &amp;
our patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in theſe is as it were an earneſt
<pb facs="tcp:6768:14"/>
vnto vs, that wee ſhall ſtand when we bee
tried to the vttermoſt. Therfore I conclude
this part,<note place="margin">Iac. 1. 2. 3. 4.</note> with that of S. <hi>Iames:</hi> count it
for great ioy (my brethren) when you fall
into many tentations: knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the triall
of your faith bringeth forth patience. And
let patience haue her perfect work, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you
may be perfect &amp; entire lacking nothing.</p>
            <p>The ſecond effect of perſecutions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
they be compared to a fiery triall, I
ſayd was this. As fire drieth vp al maner of
droſſe in the good golde, ſo they dry vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
corruptions, that creepe vpon the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the time of their liberty &amp; peace. For
thus it fareth with the beſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when they be a litle quiet, &amp; the world
ſeemeth to ſmile vpon them, if they breake
not out, as reſty &amp; pampred horſes, to open
outrage &amp; diſorder, yet at the leaſt ther ſtea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them much vanity, worldlines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in things earthly, &amp; negligence (if not
conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt) of things heauenly. Wherupon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
loue of the word doth decreaſe in them, and
they become not ſo carefull and zealouſe of
the honour of God as they were before.

The Lord ſeeing the tickle diſpoſition that
is in all men to this vnrulineſſe, was
wont to meete with the ſame before hande

               </gap>olde Croſſes, euen in ſuch men
as he made eſpeciall account of. For no
doubt this was one principal end, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
turmoyles, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>
were encombred with, that ſo they mighte
be brought to deſpiſe the earth which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed
with ſo many miſeries, ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

as he mercifully and in great wiſdome did

as were otherwiſe like to haue poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their hearts: ſo dealeth he as gratiouſly

Whereuppon, beſide the inward

meanes and inſtrumentes whereby they
<pb facs="tcp:6768:15"/>
come, crying out of the iniurie of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours,
and clearing of them ſelues as

conclude to be righteous and ſo iuſt,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 10.</note> as hee
will not puniſhe withoute cauſe, and that
therfore ſomthing is amiſſe in them which
he woulde haue them to ament: althoughe
that be good, commanded of God, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their duty for the which they be
perſecuted by their aduerſaries. Whereby
it commeth to paſſe, that they examin them
ſelues and their doinges more ſtreightly, &amp;
finde out many corruptions, which before
were eyther vnknown, or elſe vnregarded,
and therfore would haue proued very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

do it more often and earneſtly then before.
We ought therefore to be glad, &amp; to thanke
the Lord moſt hartely, whenſoeuer it ſhall
pleaſe him to purge vs on this ſort. Our
veſſels of ſiluer and golde which in time
doe gather ſoyle, we deſire to haue ſcoured:
and the linnen that wee vſe to our tables,
we reioyce to haue often waſhed. And why
then do we not take in good part all maner
of perſecutions? ſeeing they be ſcourgings
and waſhings to our ſoules, whereby the
Lorde mindeth to make vs cleane, from
ſome vntowardnes that is in vs. Verily
this is a greater mercye then any mans
tongue is able to vtter, and the wiſdome of
the Lorde in this behalfe is very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
we be entred into an euill courſe ſome
way or other, offenſiue to the maieſtye of
God, and hurtfull vnto our ſelues, In the
mean time God concealeth thoſe diſorders
of oures from men, whiche peraduenture
woulde procure our puniſhmente by their
Lawes, and intending to reclayme vs, &amp;
to bring vs to himſelfe againe, hee ſturreth

<pb facs="tcp:6768:16"/>
cauſeth ſome afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come vnto vs for
well doing, that was due vnto vs for our
ſinne and diſobedience. O the ritches of his
grace: who is able to conceiue it? Certein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 23. 27 28.</note> cauſing the <hi>Pailistines</hi> to

wearied man, as this ſhould be ioifull vnto
vs, when after this manner he ſtoppeth vs
in our euill courſe, and cauſeth vs to retire
from that which is not good. But ynoughe
of this fruite of perſecutions, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of God in the ſame. It remaineth that
each man in all ſuch troubles ſturre vp his
heart, and pray to God, that he may profite

In this verſe he requireth more then in the

aſtoniſhed at our perſecutions for the truth
ſake: here he ſayth that we muſt reioyce &amp;
be glad, when any ſuch thing commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the next, is from the rewarde, that

he was ſo before vs.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 39..</note> If ſome of our friendes
whom we truſt doe betray vs, ſo did <hi>Iudas</hi>
to our Lord. If we be arraigned before the
indgemente ſeates of princes, if there,
wee bee ſkoffed and mocked at, beaten
with roddes, and condemned to death: was
<pb facs="tcp:6768:17"/>
not this alſo the portion of the ſon of God?
If we be thought the worſt men vppon the
earth, more daungerous and hurtfull to the
common wealth then any others, we know
that <hi>Barrabas</hi> was preferred before the
Lord of life. This is therefore a certeine
trueth, that Ieſus Chriſte hath gone this
way before us. And <hi>Cranmer</hi> in thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
diſgracings about his diſgrading: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
man whom <hi>Bonner</hi> ſcourged in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and all the martyrs in their torments,
were nothing els but his companions.
Now this ſhoulde be ſufficient to comfort
vs in all our troubles, and to cauſe vs moſt
ioyfully to endure the ſame. It is an olde
ſaying: it is comfort to the wretched, to
haue companions in their miſeries: howe
comfortable then ſhould it be vnto vs, ſeing
Ieſus Chriſt tooke part with vs? When
<hi>Vriah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 11. 10. 11.</note> by <hi>Dauids</hi> commandement was ſent
to the court, and by the king himſelfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to goe to his wife to his owne houſe
to take his eaſe: he refuſed it, &amp; choſe rather
to ſleepe at the pallace dore with the reſt of
the kings ſeruants. And being demaunded
the reaſon by <hi>Dauid</hi> of his ſo doing, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
that it was vnequall and vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:6768:18"/>
for him to be at reſt in his bedde in the
houſe, when <hi>Ioab</hi> his Lord lay in the fields.
The valiant &amp; couragious ſouldier thought
it a matter of delight vnto him, to endure
hardnes with his captein, and the greateſt
diſhonour that coulde be, to doe otherwiſe.
How much more ought we to reioyce in all
our extremities? ſeeing in them we do after
a ſort drinke of one cup with Chriſt, and as
it were draw in one yoke with him. It had
beene ſufficient to cheare vs, if <hi>Peter</hi> had
ſaid as our Lord ſpake before in the goſpel
of <hi>Mathew:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 5. 12.</note> ſo perſecuted they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophetes
which were before you. But when he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that perſecution and affliction was
the portion of the ſonne of God, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to patience, and a comfort in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
free from all chalenge, exception, and
ſpeaking againſt. If the prince ſhoulde ſay
vnto vs, or any other ſubiect: you muſt do
ſomwhat for me, which the L. <hi>Chanceller,</hi> &amp;
the reſt of my priuye counſell haue done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, ſurely the thing beeing good,
though neuer ſo painfull, we ought to yeeld
vnto it. But if the prince ſhoulde ſay, mine
only ſonne and heire, or mine owne ſelfe
haue borne this brunt already: how coulde
<pb facs="tcp:6768:18"/>
we challenge the prince of any hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
offered vnto vs? and how beaſtly faint
hearted, and cowardly ſhoulde wee be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
it? Therefore to end this matter: let vs
be patient in all our afflictions and reioice
in the ſame, ſeeing therin we be partakers
with Ieſus Chriſte the ſonne of God, and
our true ſoueraigne and euerlaſting king.
For as the wood caſt into the bitter waters
at <hi>Marah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 15. 25.</note> made them ſweet to the children
of Iſrael: ſo Ieſus Chriſte being throwen
into the ſea of afflictions, hath made them
moſt ſweete to ſo many as beleeue in him.
The ſecond reaſon is the recompence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
vnto ſuch, as with Ieſus Chrſte ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
afflictions for a good conſcience. <hi>When
his glory ſhall appeare</hi> (ſayth the apoſtle)
<hi>then shal you reioice, and leap for ioy:</hi> For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ioy of Gods children ſhall be
perfect then, wheras now by reaſon of our
corruption &amp; mortality, it is mingled with
much heauineſſe and ſorrowe. But we muſt
note, that this ſhalbe at ſuch time, as Chriſt
appeareth agayne in his maieſty. Whiche

or ſet againſte, that baſe condition of

is nowe in perfect glory, euen in reſpect of
his humanity, although the worlde neither

wherein the father hath appointed
by him to iudge the earth, he ſhall appeare
moſt glorious and excellent as he is, with

therefore blaſpheme the ſpirit it ſelfe being
the authour and fountaine of the ſame: as

            <p>Moreouer, this ſpeech teacheth what puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye

the temple and houſe of God, and the

in the officers of princes houſes, that no fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines

the prince, or the nobles paſſing by: &amp;
for this purpoſe there be writings ſet vp in
euery place. But ther is not the like regard
of the Lords court, to keepe corruption out
of his houſe. We ſee how the church is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered,
with euil miniſters, with adulterers,
whoremaſters, ſwearers, prophaners of the
Sabbaoth, mockers of the worde, and the
meſſengers thereof, vſurers, deceiuers, rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
&amp; contentious perſons. Againſt whom
there is very ſmall diſcipline. Although the

forbidding theſe enormities, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they ſhold be thruſt out of his church,
as vnworthy of any place there, vntill they
haue declared openly their true repentance

The apoſtle telleth vs here, that the time
was then come, that the Lord would begin
to puniſh his moſt faythful ſeruaunts: and
therefore we muſt eyther bee contented to
endure afflictions, or elſe not to be acconn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the houſholde and Churche of God.
The Lorde in this place is likened vnto a
wiſe and carefull prince, who although hee
haue an eye to the diſorders of the whole
realm and kingdome, yet doth eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to correct y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of his own famili.
Euen ſo God: although in all ages he hath
teſtified his diſpleaſure agaynſt ſinne in all
kind of people and perſons: yet his roddes
and ſcourges haue at all times beene ſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
about the chaſtiſing of his churche,

<hi>Dauid.</hi> Had not he moſt wicked of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time,
greater eaſe and peace then they had in the

if we looke to the whol nation of the Iews,

vnto himſelfe, it ſuffiſeth vs for this
text to be perſwaded of this trueth, whiche
we may vnderſtand by the recordes of the
ſcriptures. Although it mighte bee briefly
ſayde, that hee hath an eſpeciall care of the
ſaluation of his people, and therefore puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
them aboue and before the reſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime

Moreouer, becauſe his mercies towardes

righteous, that it offending, ſhould both be

courſe of the Lorde toward his Churche,
from the beginning: ſo was it eſpecially
true of the time wherein the Apoſtle writ,
after the manifeſtation of the ſonne of God
in the fleſh. For both then, &amp; euer ſithence,
<pb facs="tcp:6768:32"/>
the Lorde was and continueth ſo ſharpe to

but as the glorye of it approcheth
neerer &amp; neerer: ſo the warrfare of it vpon

The perſecutions, vnder the Romaine em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,

of late yeares with in our owne realm,
when as it was peaceable and quiet, with
all the wicked of the lande. And how hath
it gone more lately with the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and faythfull ſeruants of God in our
neighbour countries of Flanders, France,
and Spayue, as their ſtories doe witneſſe:
when as in the meane time, brothels, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
adulterers, inceſtuous perſons, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,

fel vpon thoſe zealouſe and ſincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours
of the trueth? S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore
ſayth truely, of all faithful Chriſtians, that
if the hope of the life to come were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
of al other men, they were moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
If in this life onely we beleeued in
Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 19.</note> we were (ſayth he) moſte wretched
of all others. Neither ſpake he this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
good matter to lead him vnto it. For
whereas the wicked, liue peaceablie in
the worlde (becauſe the worlde loueth it
owne) be free from aduerſity, and in their
proſperity reioyce them ſelues: the faithful
ſeruants of God bee alwayes hated and

creade awry, but the Lord calleth them
agayne into the way, with ſome ſcourge, &amp;
in the middeſt of their greateſt peace, they
be humbled with inward temptations, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for ſinnes paſt, griefe for preſent and
dayly falles, doubtes &amp; terrors, ſo as they
alwayes woorke out their ſaluation with
feare &amp; trembling.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> Inſomuch as indeed the
moſt wicked were in better caſe then they,
if their fayth, hope, &amp; good conſcience, had
no other recompenſe but in this life. But
the life to come is their comforte, becauſe
they know,<note place="margin">

that is an houſe not made with handes, but

not be diſcomforted in oure troubles, as
though for them wee mighte conclude wee
were forſaken of the Lorde, and did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

               <hi>If it beginne first with vs, what shall be

eſtate of Gods Church &amp; people
vpon the earth, and how the Lorde ſeemeth
to fauor the wicked, becauſe for a time they
floriſh, and be ſpared in their ſinnes. Now,
leaſt the faythfull ſhoulde be deceiued with
the proſperity of the wicked, and imagine
that the Lord would euer beare with them
in their naughtineſſe: here the apoſtle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that they likewiſe muſt haue their
courſe, and that neceſſarily there muſt be a
time wherein they ſhall be plagued. For
thus doth he reaſon from the leſſe vnto the
greater: If God correct them that imbrace
his goſpell, and be careful to doe him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſeruice, if he begin firſt to ſcourge ſuch:
is it poſſible that they ſhould eſcape moſte
fearefull vengeance, which be ſworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to his maieſty: ſuperſtitious, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
ignorant, and diſobedient to his wil?
The time certeinly will come (God being
iuſt) when they ſhall bee rewarded ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
into their boſoms.<note place="margin">Pſal. 79. 12.</note> Therefore let not

becauſe they are afflicted and kept vnder,
when themſelues, enioy the deſire of their

heartes, and often times be the Lordes
roddes, whereby he whippeth his choſen.
For when the Lorde hath worne them to
the ſtumps, aboute the backes of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to their greate good, then muſte
themſelues be throwne into the fire of
deſtruction, becauſe the Lorde hath no

ſo as he may ſeeme to haue caſt of his owne

be, but that there are vnſpeakable torments
after this life, appointed to ſuch as make a
ſport of ſinne, neuer turne to God, and dye
without repentantaunce: although in this
world they abound with all health, wealth,
and proſperitie? let vs therefore reioyce
in all our afflictions, wherein we take part
with all the ſeruauntes of God: and let vs
not be offended at the proſperity of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly:

            <p>This is the concluſion of the whole trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe:
as thoughe hee ſhoulde haue ſayde on
this wiſe: ſith the afflicting of the churche
is no newe thing, ſith it is a meane to trye
the good from the bad, and to make them
<pb facs="tcp:6768:41"/>
better, in whome there is (by the grace of
God) ſome goodnes: ſith in all ſufferings it
is a partaker with Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
with him, when he appeareth againe
in glory: ſith we be happy when we be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pirite of God &amp; of glory reſteth vpon vs:
ſith we ſuffer not as euill doers, but as chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
&amp; ſo haue no cauſe to bee aſhamed:
ſith the time is now, wherein the Lord wil
ſcourge his owne houſe: and hereafter will
moſt ſeuerely proceede agaynſt the wicked
although he ſpare them for a time: Let vs
continue in well doing, and committe oure
ſelues to him, that is faithfull, and able
to keepe that, whiche wee truſt him with.
There is yet another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort for vs in this
verſe, that we heard not before: and that is
where he telleth vs, that we be not afflicted
by the will and pleaſure of men, but onelye
at the pleaſure &amp; appointment of the Lord.
To proue this point of doctrine, I ſhall not
need to labour much: the truthe of it ſhould
ſoone be granted, if we knew what we ſayd
in this confeſſion: I beleeue in God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
almighty maker of heauen and earth.
For what is this elſe, but to aſcribe ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:6768:41"/>
ſouereigne power vnto God, that nothing
is done nor can be done, in heauen, earth, or
hell, but that onely which he determineth &amp;
appointeth? The diuel himſelfe coulde not
ſturre one foote forward,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 12. &amp; 26.</note>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 8. 30. 32.</note> to hurt <hi>Iob</hi> in his
cattel, children, or himſelfe, till the Lorde
from heauen had firſt ſayd, goe: Nay the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of Deuils, coulde not touche one of the
Gadarenes ſwine, til the Lorde Ieſus had
firſt giuen them licence. And ſhal we think
that mortall men, (whoſe malice againſte
the hurch is not ſo deadly, nor their power
ſo great) can ſo much as lift vp a finger to
pul a hair fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faces of any of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Luk. 127.</note>
till firſt the Lord haue taken order for
the matter? wee be deceiued, &amp; greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togate
from the maieſty of the almighty, if
we once imagine any ſuch thing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Nabucadonizer</hi> in the middeſt of all
his malice to the Iews the church of God,
is termed the Lordes ſeruaunt:<note place="margin">Ier. 25. 9.</note> becauſe in
deede as an hangman or executioner, he did
nothing elſe, but that which hee had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
Although the ſinne of the king was
in this behalfe great, becauſe his purpoſe
was not to doe the will of the Lord, but to
ſatiſfie his owne proude and cruell affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb facs="tcp:6768:42"/>
So is <hi>Aſhur.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 25.</note> (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Aſſiria) called
the rod of God. And to this purpoſe it is
ſaid in the acts, that <hi>Poncius Pilate</hi> and the
Iewes,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 28.</note> in condemning and crucifying the
ſonne of God, did that which the father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had appointed. Inſomuch as it may
be truely concluded, that the deuill and all
the wicked of the earth, in their extreameſt
rage againſt the ſaints, do nothing elſe but
the will of God,<note place="margin">Iſa. 10. 5. 8.</note> although they know it not,
neither do it to any ſuch inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſith they who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
oppoſe themſelues againſt his maieſty.
And yet the Lorde muſt not be charged to
be the author of euill: for the ſelf ſame fact,
I mean the troubling of the church, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of God, and his purpoſe therein, is
holy, glorious, righteous, full of mercy, and
to the great good of his ſeruaunts: which
neuertheleſſe in reſpect of the inſtruments
by whome God worketh it, is wicked, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt,
full of cruelty, and intended to the hurt
of his children. But inough of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
place, that the enemies of the faythful,
be nothing els, but the Lords rods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he exerciſeth his people: and that of
themſelues they can do no more, then a rod
or a whippe out of the hand of the ſmiter.
<pb facs="tcp:6768:42"/>
Now this teacheth vs not to fear the faces
of the vngodly, nor to be diſmaid at their
threates: the Lorde appointeth them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
bondes, beyonde the which they can
not paſſe the bredth of an haire. And this
offreth vnto vs great comfort. For what
childe that is wiſe and hath vnderſtanding,
doeth not reioyſe, in the correction of his
father? ſith being perſwaded of his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and tender affection, he is out of doubt,
that it is well meant, and ſhall turne to his
good. Seing then the Lord is our Father,
&amp; his compaſſion ouer vs, paſſeth the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of a mother toward the infant ſucking
vpon her breſt:<note place="margin">Iſa. 49. 15.</note> Let vs be comfortable in
all our afflictions, ſith they come from him,
and fall vpon vs according to his will. And
that we maye haue to cheare vs in all our
diſtreſſes, let vs ſerioſly meditate vpon this
one thing: the Lorde ſendeth them. After
which conſideration: it by the teſtimonye
of the ſpirite crying in our hearts (Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba)
father,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> &amp; the ſanctification of our liues,
we can perſwade our ſelues, that we be his
children: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſent ſmart ſhall not quail vs,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note>
becauſe of the fruit of righteouſnes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> &amp; it muſt needs turne to our beſt,
<pb facs="tcp:6768:43"/>
becauſe it commeth from our father. Thus
much of theſe words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtle: <hi>Let ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
as bee afflicted according to the will of
God. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His concluſion is, that in all well doing
we commende our ſoules vnto God, that
hath made them. For, as wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the time of our peace, declared ſome
rare of pleaſing God, and doing his will: ſo
is it our dueties to continue in our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and not for them, to take any libertie
to doe euill. And therefore wee muſt not
murmure againſt the Lorde, as though he
dealte hardly with vs: wee muſte not bee
fainthearted to denie his trueth: we muſte
not be bitter to our enemies in curſſing of
them, and rewarding them as they deale
with vs: but with all patience, weekeneſſe,
gentlenes, courage, forgiuing of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
and praying for them: conſtantly to
endure whatſoeuer the Lorde will trie vs
with, according to the precepts of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures,
&amp; the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
