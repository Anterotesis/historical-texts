         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that I deſired two or three women that were there
to depart the roome, that I might ſpeake one

trouble your conſcience, you ſhall doe wel to reveale

went to the performance of what I came for, namely,
the adminiſtration of thoſe holy Miſteries of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

drunke I utterly denyde it, neither was it poſitively
proved, but meerely by the threats of ſome of the
Proſecutors, as I can make appeare, fairely extorted
from them, and that in a doubtfull and ambiguous
ſence too. The husband and the women acquitted
me before the Committee for any ill behaviour, or
incivility, or any outcry made by the Woman.</p>

            <p>THat the Communion Table was removed, I

but a command from Authority at a publike Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I doe not remember that my ſelfe ſet any help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I uſed no inſolent or proud geſture, either at my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to it, departure from it, or paſſing by it,
as is falſly ſuggeſted: but what I did was, as in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to my firſt Article.</p>
            <p>That I bow at the Name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> I confeſſe it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

            <p>Concerning exacting of Fees (a thing for which
I ſtand ſo much condemn'd) I have given an anſwer
to the Articles in generall, but will give the Reader
ſatisfaction in the particulars alleaged. And</p>
            <p>1. For Maſter <hi>How:</hi> Hee was indeed an ancient
Pariſhioner, and one to whom (ſo long as he liv'd)
I was much beholding; and becauſe he was one that
honour'd the Church, and the well eſtabliſht Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93714:8"/>
thereof, and was indeed a Benefactor (if it
may be ſo properly call'd) by his dayly ſollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of friends, to a good value. I gave order he ſhould
be decently and ſolemnly enterr'd, and attended on
to his grave by thoſe that appertaine to the Church
(the Quire.) It was deſir'd Maſter <hi>Riſdon</hi> ſhould
preach, I gave way to it, but it was not perform'd, and
the reaſon was this. There came an Order from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
that there ſhould be no night Funerals, upon
a complaint made by the Heralds at Armes; the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor
of maſter <hi>How</hi> had notice of this, and that
the whole Solemnitie muſt bee finiſht by foure a
clock; this was promiſde, till paſt ſix we waited, at
laſt Maſter <hi>Riſdon</hi> ſaid unto me, I neither will, nor
dare preach, becauſe it is paſt the Canonicall houre,
and againſt the Order of the Lords, nor is it ſafe for
you to bury it this night, let us attend no longer, but
be pleaſed to give order that the Church doores may
be ſhut up. Whereupon they were; preſently after
the Gueſts invited to the Funerall came with the
Coarſe, and knockt, I cauſed the doores preſently
to be open'd, and the Body was buried preſently.
Without a Sermon indeed, becauſe of maſter <hi>Riſdons</hi>
former refuſall, not out of any denyall of mine. It
was never prov'd that I had five pound for a Sermon
for him, and that maſter <hi>Ioyce,</hi> who was brought as a
witneſſe, knowes well, and ſo does one maſter <hi>Iohn
Wright</hi> a Gentleman of our Pariſh, who was by at
the agreement, and will teſtifie that it was for the
ground, and the other Church-officers duties, which
for my ſhare came but to five ſhillings, beſides the
ground which was in the Chancell, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93714:9"/>
the benefit of opening of it, and interring of
the Body, totally belonging to me, for which I had
three pound laid down, of which maſter <hi>Wright</hi> lent
the Executor twenty ſhillings.</p>
            <p>2. For maſter <hi>Darnton,</hi> I confeſſe, that he dying
in my Pariſh, I did expect as large a proportion for
my duties, as any that ſhould come out of another
Pariſh to Officiate in my Pulpit. He miſtooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that ſaid, I call'd it my Shop. Indeed, this I
ſaid, both upon that and the like occaſion to himſelfe
and others, that it was my livelyhood, and that I
had reaſon to make the beſt benefit, aſwell as any of
them of their ſhops; and this I hope may receive a
favourable conſtruction. That I deny'd abſolutly
that Doctor <hi>Holeworth</hi> ſhould preach his Funerall
Sermon, is utterly falſe, but as maſter <hi>Pettit,</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
upon occaſion will teſtifie for me, I ſaid, I
thought my Pulpit honour'd by him, and ſo indeed I
doe, and ever ſhall; He is knowne to be a man ſo
generally learned, a man of ſo rare abilities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of nature, and on whom God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
ſuch an admirable gift and faculty in the
way of his Preaching. That I ſpent my time as the
Taverne while the Funerall was Solemnizing, is like
the reſt of the Authors Scandals, maliciouſly inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and utterly falſe: neither did any ſuch thing
come in proofe.</p>
            <p>To the Articles concerning my Superſtitious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Surplice, and other (as he ignorantly
termes them) Popiſh practices; which I thanke God,
I am farre from, and hope in God, ever ſhall be. I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93714:9"/>
have anſwered to them before; and his vaine bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Tawtologie, and multiplication of termes, to
infuſe ſuſpicion againſt me, in point of my Religion,
into the peoples heads, my practice being known to
be otherwiſe, ſhall not make me waſt my time, and
tire the Reader.</p>
            <p>As for the Article concerning my Drunkenneſſe,
It was teſtified by Maſter <hi>Riſdon,</hi> the Lecturer, who
for feare of loſing his quarterly Contribution might
happily be drawne to ſay that, which I dareſay, and
he himſelfe had ſince ſaid, he will not, if he came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his oath, ſweare for a World. And it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
by many, that hee gave his Teſtimony very
faintly, and not without being jogged and egged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by one <hi>William Greenhill,</hi> a Chandler, that ſtood
behind him, (That <hi>Arch-incendiary</hi> of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi>
Pariſh who, together with his brother in Law <hi>Iohn,</hi>
I know not what to call him more, have beene the
Plotters and Contrivers of theſe Articles in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
againſt me, and the Procurers of witneſſes to
teſtifie upon them, as I will make appeare. Were
it not by meanes of theſe two, I am confident, and
ſo are many more beſides me, that my ſelfe and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhoners
ſhould live as lovingly, and as peaceably,
as any Paſtor and people in England. But this by the
way. In briefe, I beleeve 'tis an hard matter to
ſweare poſitively when a man is drunke: but he that
glanc't at that teſtimony, let him knocke at his owne
breaſt, and ſee if he bee not guilty himſelfe of that
ſinne, and in a higher meaſure too, which he laies to
the charge of others, though thats no warrant for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93714:10"/>
me nor any other to ſinne, becauſe I can produce
Preſidents.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament
to the dying woman, her husband himſelfe did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Committee, and will any where elſe cleere
me for any rudeneſſe, or any incivillity, which might
cauſe her to cry out, and ſo did Miſtreſſe <hi>Iohnſon</hi> her
Neighbour in Warwick Lane, and the reſt of the
Women then preſent. All that one of them ſaid,
was this, that ſhe conceited me to be diſtemper'd in
drinke, and that ſhe we might; my diſtractions and
griefes have been ſo many, my miſeries and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

eat nor dranke that day, by my lookes, diſcourſe,
and unwonted alteration of ſpeech, I have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be diſtemper'd, and I deſire the Reader to
judge of me in a Chriſtian way, and to beleeve this
to be true. The improbabilitie to tempt a dying wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in an uncivell way, being in all mens opinions,
ſo abominable, rediculous, that I ſhould injure my
ſelfe to God, about a confutation which the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
did for me.</p>

effect, <hi>The Plotters in that buſineſſe were but a few male-contented
Perſons, and that they deſir'd at their death that
this act might be forgotten, and that I ſhould ſay, that I
thankt God that it was ſo almoſt, and I hop't 'twould bee
quite forgotten.</hi>

Should I have deliver'd any ſuch Doctrine in a
Pulpit, or ſpoken ſuch words in any place whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
upon the perprecation of ſo horrid and damnable
Treaſon as that, a Treaſon never to be forgot while
the World laſteth; I confeſſe, I deſerv'd to ſuffer the
ſame, if not a farre greater puniſhment then they
did; Hanging, drawing, and quartering were not
conſiderable puniſhments, they were too low for
the offence in me, becauſe a Miniſter; and I could
not for ſhame ſue for any mercy heere. And it is a
wonder, if not a miracle to mee, that in ſo great a
Congregation as mine is, not one of the Auditors
were able to teſtifie any ſuch thing but himſelfe, and
he but fumblingly neither. I am ſure there are divers
of the Pariſh, learned men and good Schollers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that have tenacious memories as he can poſſibly
have. But God forgive him for caſting ſuch an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
aſperſion upon me, I doe forgive him from my
heart, 'twas a miſtake in the carriage, that's my
conſtruction of him, in point of Charitie. And as
it falls out, 'tis well I pen all I Preach, as the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
ſayes, in a written Booke, for by that means,
I am able to give the Reader ſatisfaction, and ſet it
downe word for word as I deliver'd it.</p>
            <p>The words upon which I Preacht, were theſe, <hi>Or
deſpiſeſt thou the riches of Gods goodneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> After I
had ſpoken of <hi>the riches of Gods goodneſſe</hi> in generall,
I deſcended to particular inſtances, wherein this
Kingdome, above all other Nations whatſoever, had
reaſon to contemplate of the riches of his goodneſſe.
And firſt I inſtan'ſt, for bleſſing us with the glorious
Sunne-ſhine of the Goſpell, in a perſpicuous and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93714:11"/>
cleere way, wholly hid from many, and darke unto
others, &amp;c. Then I ſhewed how the riches of his
goodneſſe had be ne manifeſted to us, in his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
and ſundry Deliverances, from 88. the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and from the Gunpowder-Plot, and there I
tooke occaſion to ſay thus much. This dayes So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie,
I hope, we ſhall never forget; but as once
a yeare publikely, ſo every day privately comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate,
A day on which the King himſelfe and his
Iſſue, that State, and all the Commons aſſembled in
the High Court of Parliament ſhould at one inſtant
have bin blown up, and our Kingdom brought to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deſolation. This could not certainly be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
or invention by mortals, how politike ſoever:
Certainely the Devils broke looſe from Hell, and
took upon them humane ſhapes to lay the ground-worke
of ſo great a Conſpiracie. No Hiſtory can
paralell it, no Age come neere ſo cruell an intention,
ſo bloody a Deſigne, tending to the utter extirpation
and diſ-hereditation of us, and all our Poſterities,
rights and intereſts to the Worlds end. The ſubject
is mooving, and able to melt the moſt ſtony and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
heart. And I am perſwaded that though the
deſire of change and innovation in Religion, or
hope of Honour and preferment (being formerly
diſcontented perſons, which works much in ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits)
or deſire of gaine, or profit, or ſome ſuch like
thing: yet they themſelves could not chooſe but
have ſome relactancie, and ſtartle at it, being a fact
of that high nature, ſo generally prejudiciall to the
Countrey in which they received their birth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
all their meanes, livelyhood, and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93714:11"/>
in this world. Reſolute I know they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the laſt moment of their lives, and little or no
confeſſion, no ſignes of ſorrow or repentance could
be drawne from them, though ſtrongly laboured
that way for the good of their ſoules. Yet there
were amongſt them that did profeſſe, not onely a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
but even an utter loathing and deteſtation of ſo
horrid and prodigious a Treaſon, And wiſht this,
that no records might be regiſtred, no remaines might
be kept, wherby it might appeare to Poſteritie: what
enemies and ſlaves they had beene? how vilianous
and treacherous to their owne Countrey? <hi>Non igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
Cano,</hi> Their Confeſſions are extant, and I have read
ſome of them to this purpoſe. Tis greater to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the horridneſſe of this Treaſon, then to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to aggravate it with words and language. No
tongue how fluent ſoever, being able to ſet forth the
fouleneſſe, the Devilliſhneſſe of it. <hi>Vox fancibus hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>
I am at a ſtand, and will forbeare to name if any
more, but leave you to meditate on the riches of
Gods goodneſſe in that great deliverance.</p>
            <p>Pardon good Reader, my rediouſneſſe, it ſtands
me upon to be punctuall upon ſuch an allegation as
this, and laid downe to be fully prooved. Let any
that has read that and reads this, and compare them
together, ſee if any ſuch doctrine can be pickt out of
that part of my Sermon, but meerely the contrary.
'Twas a profitable inverſion of my words, for them
to make me more odious (as they have done in the
reſt) to the Honourable Court of Parliament, which
I hope they will take into their grave conſiderations,
and not ſuffer me to groan under the preſſure of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93714:12"/>
malicious accuſations.</p>
            <p>Touching the proofe that I had taken for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
at ſeven of the clock on Sabbath day mornings
ſeverall ſummes of money of the Pariſh, I confeſſe.
And thus it was, The Pariſh after the choice of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer
there, before they ſtirr'd, at the motion of a
worthy and eminent member of that Honourable
Houſe of Commons, whoſe Name I dare not be to
bold with. For my willingneſſe to condeſcend to
let them have a free choice of a man they lik't of, did
voluntarily under their hands, as will appeare in the
Veſtry Booke, give me 20. pound a yeare, as an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to my ſmall Living, to bee paid by 5. pound a
quarter, this fell ſhort. The Sickneſſe drew on, it
was thought fit that Lecture, above others (becauſe
it was a Lecture, to which all perſons, both out of the
City and Suburbs, Out-places, and By-Alleys, which
might breed a generall Contagion) ſhould ſurceaſe.
When it pleaſd God, to ſtay his hand, a new Lecturer
was choſen, and the money I receiv'd from them was
not for the ſetting up of the Lecture, but for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares
of the 20. pound unpaid, and that they know
very well.</p>
            <p>Touching the Teſtimony of the Coachman, I
hope the World will conceive, that it is no argument
of Incontinency to ride abroad in a Coach, and take
the ayre. And I hope the world will judge that if
every man had made choice of his Mate, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
any incivility, and vile and obſcene geſtures, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we would not have beene ſo impudent as to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93714:12"/>
call up a Coachman to be witneſſe of it. Beſides the
fatteſt of the three was my own Siſter, ſince dead, and
I hope with God. And I hope the World wil in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
beleeve, that God has not given me over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
ſence, to be ſo unnaturall, as inſuch, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to pollute and defile my own Siſter. That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſd,
I hope the World will yet further in Charity
beleeve, that I would not ſtand by and ſee another be
uncivill, and ſhee ſo immodeſt, fleſh and blood would
not have endur'd that. And for ſetting them downe
at Newgate, and ſtudying there to make an excuſe
to their Husbands, where they had been, for my
part, I know no ſuch thing, neither am I acquainted
with any ſuch conditions in Women.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the ſcandalous Pamphelter ſayes, we
arriv'd at a houſe fit for our intention, I ſhall ſatisfie
you in that, The place wee arrived at, was the
ſigne of the Goat at <hi>Hammerſmith.</hi> For which cauſe,
the ridiculous fellow, in the Frontiſpeece of his abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably
abſurde Pamphlet, pictures a Coach with
perſons in it, and over the head, <hi>Away for Hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith.</hi>
The ground of his fond conceit. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that live there, and have done for many yeares,
are of that credit and repute, ſo generally known for
their honeſty and ſufficiencie, that they would ſcorn,
if they had ſuſpected any ſuch thing, to have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the leaſt ſhew of incivilitie in their houſe; and
beſides, they knew us all to well for that. But to
aggravate proofes in a continued malice, I beleeve
they hired this journeyman Coachman for a ſmall
matter (for he is fouly ſlander'd if that will not doe
it) to ſay any thing they would have him</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:93714:13"/>
Concerning my frequenting Miſtreſſe <hi>Stevenſons</hi>
company, I could hardly avoid that, becauſe I dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and lodged in the houſe: and for Miſtreſſe <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
her husband going to Sea, left me in truſt with
the mannaging of his whole eſtate, and the bringing
up of his Children. <hi>David Lloyd</hi> his ſervant, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others, can, and will at any time be ready to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie:
but never kept company with any of them
both, in any uncivill way. Concerning the woman
he calls my wife, which I doe not, nor have reaſon to
acknowledge to be ſo, reaſons not onely knowne to
my ſelfe, but many more, 'tis as falſe as malicious.</p>
            <p>Concerning Miſtreſſe <hi>Valentines</hi> Kinſwoman, I
neither know her, nor to my remembrance ever ſaw
her above once, and that was in the Kitching at the
Chequer at Dowgate, an open and publike place,
for all commers, and therefore unfit for ſuch a luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
deſire as hee mentions her. Neither did I ever
know her name, till of late, and upon enquiry I finde
that before ſhee was married, her name was <hi>Margaret
Sweet,</hi> one that liv'd by making of Buttons (a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
I diſlike not, I ſpeak it not for that) but ſhee
ſeldome wrought not aboue once or twice in a month,
but ranne up and downe after ſeverall young men,
no conſtant abode at any certaine place, but ran from
lodging to lodging, a common Tale-bearer, and
make-bate betweene party and party, and noted for
this among all her kindred, that they could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
one word that proceeded out of her mouth.
Let the World judge what a witneſſe this demure
creature is. And the Pamphleter tels me one thing,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93714:13"/>
which I never knew of, that a Biſhops wife may bee
a Lady, we have no ſuch honour conferr'd upon their
wiues in our Kingdome, and in other parts they are
not married. But the Devill ow'd him a ſhame, and
be forgot himſelfe before he was aware.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Teſtimony of one <hi>Benſon,</hi> that
liv'd once at the Queenes head in Smithfield, but now
at the Bull head in Cheapeſide: It is alleg'd that I
ſhould ſpeake in his houſe ſix yeares agoe, at a dinner
upon occaſion of diſcourſe, theſe words, That man
which has a handſome woman to his Wife, and was
jealous without a cauſe, it was lawfull for her to
make (ſo the Pamphleter deſerv'd, nay, the teſtimony
of <hi>Benſon)</hi> him a Cuckold; and rather then he
ſhould not be made one, I would ride an 100. miles
to doe it my ſelfe; that this point of Doctrine I had
preacht, and would preach, and that to all eternitie:
I take God to witnes, as I ſhal anſwer it at his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
when I have moſt neede of his mercy, I neither
remember any ſuch, either words, or meeting. And
what is ſpoken in mirth at a Table, may in ſix yeares
be eaſily forgotten; and the former part to be jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and inoffenſive. The latter troubled me, that I
ſhould Preach it, whereupon I beſought the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
that they would be pleaſde to aske <hi>Benſon,</hi> and
the reſt, whether he, or any of them preſent, who
were my Accuſers in other matters, and my conſtant
Auditors, whether he or any of them had ever heard
me preach it, or no. They conceiv'd it to be a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
queſtion, and accordingly demanded it, the reſt
were ſilent (not an argument of conſent, but of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93714:14"/>
as not knowing any thing of the matter) and
<hi>Benſon</hi> anſwered, no indeed, I never heard him preach
it. This being only a merry ſpeech (if any ſuch ſpeech
did proceed from me) will, I hope, be conceived not
to be an offenſive of any ſuch nature, as the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would have it. Heartily ſorry I am, if any ſuch
inconſiderate words paſt from me, and I hope, God
and the Parliament, will forgive my extravagant
language.</p>
            <p>Concerning my comming in unſeaſonably, when

            <p>This was a proofe much inſiſted upon, and of
which there was taken by the Committee more then
ordinary notice. And therefore this appearing to be
utterly falſe, I hope it will be conceiv'd, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Articles are aſwell Scandalous, by adding to
them more then was delivered before the Comittee,
aſwell as his Teſtimony is wonderfully enlarg'd,
and cleane altered by the Pamphlerer from what he
ſpake.</p>
            <p>Concerning the two Siſters mentioned in the
Booke, 'till long ſince the publication of it, I never
underſtood who they were, but by accident I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that it was one Miſtreſſe <hi>Buckle</hi> and Miſtreſſe
<hi>Iordan;</hi> In the firſt womans company I never was,
and if ſhe dyed of the Pox, and her head dropt off in
the Coffin, that concernes not me, and I beleeve it
a meere ſlander. In miſtreſſe <hi>Iordans</hi> company I was
twice, and no more, upon a difference, miſtreſſe <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
and miſtreſſe <hi>Whitney,</hi> both of my Pariſh, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to maſter <hi>Iames Waters</hi> the then Churchwarden,
and my ſelfe. And this divers are living to teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Thus the Pamphleter ends his proofes in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
alleaging that more ſuch foule and ſcandalous
things might have beene proved, but glances at the
heads of none. Indeede he need not, theſe were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93714:15"/>
bad, if they were true, but I thanke God
they are not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ex ungue Leonem,</hi> Let the World conceive but
thus much by this little, that if he had had any other
crime, of any conſequence whatſoever, or his malice
could have invented, what favour I had beene like to
finde from a braſen fac't fellow, void of all ſenſe and
truth, that hath dip't his pen ſo falſely and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
againſt me.</p>
            <p>He might aſwell have inſerted in his Booke, that I
writ diverſe and ſundry Letters, betweene two and
three hundred to be ſeene, ſent to the Lady <hi>Wolley</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſt,
for ſeverall ſummes of money, for the reliefe
of Priſoners, poore Schollers, decea'ſt Miniſters
Widdowes, ſetting up of new married couples, and
many more ſuch Stratagems, converting it all to my
owne uſe, without having yet given any account.
He might aſwell have inſerted, that I ſeldome taught
any Schollers, whoſe friends were of ability, but I
got money from their Parents, for the above named
uſes, and kept it to my ſelfe. He might have inſerted
that I was found behind a Grammar Schoole doore,
young, and know not mine owne name, nor the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
from whence I came.</p>
            <p>His naming of places of Scripture, in the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of judgements, concernes all men aſwell as
my ſelfe: and I hope neither I, nor any other of the
Clergy, take them aſcendently from the foot of us
to the head; for to thoſe the fellow chiefely, but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93714:15"/>
moſt ignorantly, applies them. His termes upon me
of <hi>Athiſticall,</hi> ſon of <hi>Beliall,</hi> and putting on a Whores
forehead, carrying my ſelfe moſt proudly and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
are termes I returne upon himſelfe, as being
moſt guilty of them; I take them as ſcurrilous and
rayling language, and therefore paſſe them by with
ſcorne and indignation. I doe onely obſerve one
thing in a word, to ſee how the fooliſh fellow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
himſelfe; he accuſeth me for Officiating
ſhameleſly in mine own perſon, and preſently after
condemnes mee, that I ſeldome or never come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. And for that, Courteous Reader,
ſuſpend your Judgement when time ſhall ſerve. I
hope to give a cleare ſatisfaction to all men, for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
as yet my conſtant perſonall performance.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he condemnes me that I commit

and drunken practiſes afreſh without any bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
