         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sway'd with popular opinions,
and possessed with certain narrow
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37544:11"/>
principles, which they have long
imb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>b'd, without ever throughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining,
or so much as inquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
nay, never in their Lives haying
deliberately thought upon the <hi>nature
of the things</hi> here treated of, may
think our pains very superfluous,
and that the whole subject of Dreams
is altogether Vanity, or perhaps, as
some may conceive Superstitious, and
unlawful to be taken notice of. But
if these honest souls will be pleased
but to consider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That Physitians generally
agree, that the natural temperament
or <hi>complexion,</hi> and consequently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times the secret Diseases of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are as soon, or better found out
by their <hi>Dreams,</hi> than by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
signs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That since the <hi>Heart of
man is deceitful above all things,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for him that would truly <hi>know
himself,</hi> it has by wise Doctors
of <hi>Morality</hi> been always advised to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37544:11"/>
take notice (amongst other things)
of his usual <hi>Dreams,</hi> there being
scarce any thing that more discovers
the secret bent of our minds and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Vice,</hi> or this
or that particular Evil, as <hi>Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
Sensuality</hi> or the like, then
these nocturnal sallies and reaches of
the <hi>Soul,</hi> which are more free &amp; undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd,
&amp; with less reserve than such as
are manifested when we are awake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If they shall call to mind
(which I more especially advise them
to do) that as Dreams are one of the
clearest natural Arguments of the
<hi>Immortality</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> so they were
one of the usual wayes, whereby God
vouchsafed of old to <hi>Reveal</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and secrets to the Prophets
and holy men; and that it is one of
his gracious promises, touching the
Glory and fuller manifestations of
the Gospel dispensation, <hi>that then
their young men should See Visions and
their old men Dream Dreams.</hi> And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37544:12"/>
if withall they shall without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
read over what we have candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
written touching all these Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
and many other Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
matters relating thereunto in
the following Treatise. When, I
sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, in a true Light they have seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
laid to heart all this, I am apt
to think they may find cause to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<hi>other</hi> Conceptions, and more
favourable Sentiments, and judge
this hitherto too much neglected stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
well worthy of their future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards:
I call it <hi>neglected study;</hi> for
though not few of the Antients, and
some of latter times have written
concerning <hi>Dreams,</hi> as <hi>Aristole, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistius,
Artimedorus, Carden,</hi> &amp;c. yet
did they not sufficiently comprehend
the <hi>true Nature,</hi> Sourse, Original or
Radix thereof, nor the real Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are to be made of them, and
whence each kind do proceed; but

of <hi>Dreams,</hi> may justly be said to be
neglected, because instead thereof,
vain and idle notions are imbraced,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37544:13"/>
just as if a body should go to chop
with a Saw, or to saw with an Ax;
he uses indeed those Instruments, but
absurdly, and to no purpose but his
own Detriment. And yet ought not
this common abuse of misconstrued
<hi>Dreams,</hi> at all to derogate from the
worth of the thing it self, duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,
any more than because some
men are drunk, therefore we shuld

or because many greedy people sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
themselves with <hi>Victuals,</hi> or
rashly prejudice their Health, by
Tampering with <hi>Medicines</hi> they do

'Tis certain every thing has

degenerated, that he generally lays

<hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>Superstition,</hi> and the

through his own ill conduct &amp; Error.</p>

               <p>Whence it appears that the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

vapour sometimes proceeds from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased
corrupted Humours, and
then the Sleep is not natural, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37544:15"/>
unsound, troublesom, &amp; the symtom
of a disease. The natural vapour
is that which either ariseth from the
Concoction of the aliment in the
Stomach, which generally causeth
a man's <hi>first Sleep,</hi> which therefore
is more sound, deep and vehement,
by reason of the more <hi>gross Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
and more turbulent, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the impurity of the vapours,
or else 'tis the <hi>Ebullition,</hi> or Boyling
up of the more fervid Blood, which
commonly causeth morning Sleeps,
which are more sweet, light and apt
for <hi>Dreams,</hi> by reason of the more
pure vapours, and the more rare and
perlucid Exhalations; but when
the same is too long continued, 'tis
apt to fill the head with vapours,
which being so over filled, is distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and Akes, and occasions <hi>Rhumes,
Catarhs, Consumption of the Lungs,</hi>
and many other inconveniencies,
which all people should take spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
notice of, and endeavour to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37544:15"/>
prevent, especially the nice and
<hi>Sloathfull Dames</hi> of the Female Sex,
who both by their Constitution and
want of Exercise, and ill customs
in this kind, do more abound with
moist Humors, and consequently
are more obnoxious to those Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.
The Form of Sleep consists
in a free and willing cessation of the
external Sences; for when the first
<hi>Censorium</hi> (which is called the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
of the common Sense) is bound
and obstructed with a soporiferous
vapour, the external Actions of the
animal Functions cease.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted, that as the
<hi>outward</hi> Senses are Five in number,
viz. <hi>Seeing, Hearing, Feeling, Tasting</hi>
and <hi>Smelling,</hi> of which, if any one
remain free, and not affected, sleep
cannot be perfect, as where any one
of them, in a person that has the use
of them all, happens to be affected,
such person cannot be said to be
composedly vigilent: So there are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37544:16"/>
also Four other Senses, called Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
because feared within the Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,
and whose objects are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the species of things <hi>present,</hi> but
they perceive the sensible species of
things <hi>absent, past,</hi> and to come.</p>
               <p>1st, The first, called the <hi>common
Sense,</hi> where all the diverse Objects
apprehended, or rather communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by the outward Senses, are
assembled, and gathered together,
to the end they may afterwards be
compared, distinguished and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the one from the other,
which the particular Senses could
not do, being every one attentive to
his proper object, and not able to
take cognizance thereof, or of his
Companion; for to speak properly,
we know not what we see <hi>simply by
our Eyes,</hi> or hear by our <hi>Ears,</hi> but
by our <hi>common Sense,</hi> which judgeth
rightly thereof, the other being but
the <hi>Organs</hi> to bring the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of things thither to be censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37544:16"/>
and judged of, whence properly
all their Objects and Offices may be
said to be his.</p>
               <p>2dly, The <hi>Phantasie</hi> doth more
fully examine the species perceived
by the common Sense, whether of
things present or absent, keeping
them longer, and thence making
new and compounded Images or
Conceits of <hi>its own.</hi> Its Objects are,
all the species communicated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by the <hi>common Sense,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
(especially in the Melancholy
People)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it fancies many other
things, as <hi>Centaurs, Chimaera's,</hi> and
a thousand odd Forms which never
really had beeing in the Nature of
Things; yet it is to be noted that
the parts thereof must alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of such thing of which we have
seen, read, or heard of, it is (or
ought to be) in men Govern'd or
regulated by <hi>Reason,</hi> but in Beasts
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t seems to be the highest Faculty
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eir nature is endued with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:37544:17"/>
3. <hi>Iudgment</hi> (or Reason) is a
Superious Faculty in man, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Rule over all the rest, the
Guide of Actions, or judge of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
world, to approve of what is
good, and reject what is Evil.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Memory</hi> is a Retentive Faculty
of the Soul, whose Office is to Regist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
up all the species which the other
senses have introduced, that they
may be forth-comming, or ready
when occasion shall serve, or they
are called for by the <hi>Phantacy</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
whence some to illustrate the use
of all these powers, have compared
them to a <hi>Court of Iudicature,</hi> the
outward Senses being as <hi>Solicitors</hi>
that bring the <hi>Causes;</hi> the <hi>Common
Sense,</hi> as the <hi>Master of Requests,</hi>
who receives all their Informations;
the <hi>Phantacy</hi> like the <hi>Lawyers</hi> and
<hi>Advocates,</hi> that bandy the business
to and fro in sever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l forms, with
a deal of noise and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffle <hi>Reason,</hi>
as the <hi>Iudge,</hi> that having calmly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37544:17"/>
heard each parties Pretentions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,
an upright Sentence; and
<hi>Memory</hi> as the <hi>Clark</hi> records the
whole proceedings.</p>
               <p>Whether these several Faculties
have <hi>distinct Seats,</hi> or <hi>Cells</hi> in the
Brain, has been much disputed by
<hi>Anatomists, Physitians</hi> and <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers:</hi>
The great Argument of thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
that would have it so, is that 'tis
certain by Experience (which they
confirm by many Instances) that
sometimes one of these may be hurt,
and the other remain found, as that
the <hi>Phantacy</hi> may be impared, yet
both <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> remain
unhurt: The <hi>Iudgment</hi> cract, yet
<hi>Phantacy</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> active, and
the <hi>Memory</hi> Spoilt, yet <hi>Phantacy</hi> and
<hi>Iudgment</hi> (as to things present)
good. But as in the Stomach by
several distempers, several Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are hurt, as by <hi>moist</hi> diseases,
the <hi>Retentive;</hi> by dry, the <hi>digestive;</hi>
and yet it will not thereupon follow,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37544:18"/>
the <hi>digestive</hi> and <hi>Retentive</hi> have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Organs or Seats; So it may
possibly happen in these <hi>Faculties</hi> of
fle <hi>Brain,</hi> without assigning to each
a distinct Cell, though the common
Opinion (and for ought I know it
may be true) is, that the <hi>Phantasie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
in the formost, the Judgment in
the middle, and the Memory in the
hindermost Ventricle of the Brain.</p>
               <p>But to reduce what has been said
of these internal <hi>Senses</hi> to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Subject; you are to note, that
the Imagination is ever busie, and (as
far as I can perceive) never <hi>Sleeps;</hi>
the <hi>Iudgment</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> for the most
part, is impedited from acting, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
after its common way or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Fashion, when a man sleeps.
The <hi>Memory</hi> sometimes is more, and
sometimes less clouded and obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
according to the nature of the
fumes sent up; and hence it comes to
pass, that we have sometimes a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
sometimes a more confused, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37544:18"/>
sometimes scarce any Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Remembrance of our <hi>Dreams</hi>
when we awake. But of this we
shall have occasion to speak further,
in the following Discourse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>And in the mean time shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Chapter of <hi>Sleep</hi> with a
brief Account of two strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
that are wont to happen to
some people therein; that is to say,
of such as <hi>walk in their Sleep,</hi> and of
such as are troubled with that which
is commonly called, the <hi>Incubus,</hi> or
<hi>Night-Mare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching of the first, that
some people there are, who whilest
they are fast asleep, leap our of their
<hi>Beds,</hi> unlock <hi>Doors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> go into the
Streets, and sometimes on Tops of
Houses, or other dangerous places,
where they would not go waking,
and if not interruped, will again
return to their Beds. The matter of
Fact, I say, is so notorious, that I
need not spend time to prove it by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37544:19"/>
instances, since I think there are few
but know, or have been most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
inform'd thereof, among some
of their Acquaintance: But the
Cause or Reason of all this is more
occult, which I shall endeavour to
discover, as it occurs to my present
thoughts.</p>
               <p>'Tis observable, those that have
these Vagaries, are generally (and
I think I may say always) <hi>young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
in the flower of their years,
and strength, of <hi>Sanguine Complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
active, sprightly, and full of
Blood; I am therefore of opinion
that this comes to pass by that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Blood swelling, and
as it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rothing out, boyling and
active spirits, which ascending to
the <hi>Brain,</hi> stirs up and stimulates its
Faculties, whereby it performs its
actions to these strange motions and
effects; so that the Body, by the
impulse of the animal spirits, which
contains in the Brain, the strength of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37544:19"/>
the Nerves and Muscles, that is, the
Instruments of <hi>Motion</hi> is carried
forth, and even in <hi>Sleep</hi> excited to
those actions. For persons of this
condition, are of a thin and eurious
contexture, small bulk, but of great
agility and a fervent mind, whence,
if they can but take hold of any
thing with their Fingers and Toes,
being then void of all fear, because
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ensible of any danger, they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
themselves thereupon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
such things, as waking
they would dread to attempt.</p>
               <p>But if in such Bodies the Humors
shall be fermented to a lesser degree,
and a smaller ardor and agitation of
the spirits, then they only talk, cry
out, move and fling themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
as if they would jump out;
but yet still contain themselves in
their Beds, because the spirits are not
strong and violent enough to raise
the body: and the proper Cure of
this I conceive will be to use a spare

diet, and perhaps, in some Cases
<hi>Blood-letting,</hi> and especially to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

cool temper, without inflaming it
with <hi>passions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the other sort, <hi>Viz.</hi> those
that in their sleep are troubled with

and in children and young people

and lying on their backs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And tho
the Vulgar, when they are thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
conceit it some external thing
comes and lies upon them, which
they fancy to be some Ghost, or

proceeds from inward Causes.</p>
               <p>This Discease being an obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

especially of <hi>Breathing</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi>
with a false apprehension of some

Breast, and as it were stiffling them,
occasioned, by means the free pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of the Spirits to the Nerves is
hindred, the passages being stopt by
a surcharge of the aforesaid Humors.</p>
               <p>This happens most to such as use
to lie upon their Backs; and whilst
it is upon them, they are in great
Agony, being unable to speak, but
strive to do it with imperfect
groans, but if any person speak to

if they can move, or turn the body

the universal spirit or power of the

Soul and Spirit in <hi>Min,</hi> it is always
in motion and generating, and as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37544:22"/>
the Scripture saith of the wonderful

slumbereth not, nor sleepeth:</hi> for sleep
does truly signifie death and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and nothing sleepeth but what
is <hi>mortal</hi> and finite. So the soul and
spirit in man sleepeth not, as being
the Breath of God and Eternal; for
in God there is no Time, nor Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or divisions of Time, as nights,
days, years or the like, nor any use,
as to himself, of Sun or Moon, but
they are Creatures made by him for
the Accomodation of this lower
World, and the Inhabitants thereof,
as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Revelations doth
declare, speaking of the <hi>new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
or Super-Caelestial Paradise,
<hi>There was there neither days nor nights,
nor Light of the Sun or Moon, but
the divine Power and Spirit of the
Lamb was the Glory and Light thereof:</hi>
And this Glympse of the ineffable
Splendor he saw upon the <hi>Lords-day</hi>
when he was in the spirit, not in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37544:23"/>
the operations of the senses of the
external Nature or Body of this
world, unto which the properties
of the <hi>natural sleep</hi> do belong; but
the Soul or Spirit cannot <hi>sleep,</hi> for
then it could not be eternal, but
when the Body and Senses lie lock't
up fast in the Arms of <hi>Merpheus,</hi>
then is the soul or spirit as it were
unchain'd or unbound, as being
free'd from the continual Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the senses and Earthly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
which whilst they are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and in full strength and vigour,
do captivate the soul, and hinder its
generating and progress in that
manner, as it doth when the body
is a sleep or dead; for the <hi>soul</hi> of
<hi>man</hi> hath so great Power, when freed

sensual power, that it can make
something where nothing is, and
from the Representations of Swords
or Guns, Fire or Water, as real,
when and where there is indeed no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37544:23"/>
such palpable substance, but it is
real and substantial in the spirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the good and evil words and
works of men, shall be unto them
in Eternity; their works do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, not after the manner
of this world, but in the Spirit,
yet real and essential. Now it is
from the Soul or Spirit in man,
which is the mage of the divine
Eternal Spirit, and never stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
still, Sleepeth or Slumbereth
whence <hi>Dreams</hi> and all Nocturnal
Visions do arise and proceed; for
whilst the Senses and Powers and
Faculties of the outward Nature
do sleep, rest or cease from their
Functions, the Soul and Spirit
ceaseth not from its operation,
but goeth on forming, figureing,
and Representing of things as real,
and substantial; for in truth (though
ofttimes we perceive it not) and
more often cannot remember par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
yet when ever we sleep
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37544:24"/>
we <hi>dream;</hi> for you may as well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
Fire without heat, Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

suitable to its Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But here some will be apt to
object and say,</hi> This is a strange
Paradox; for if we always <hi>Dream</hi>
in some kind or other, as often as
we sleep, how is it that we but seldom
perceive, or are sensible of it? Sure if
the Soul and Spirit be as you teach, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
busie in framing and representing
of things, we should remember some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas we sleep
soundly for several nights together
sometimes, and cannot remember that
we had any Dreams at all.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, That the
thoughts of worldly Affairs, and the
intemperances most men commit
in Meats, Drinks, Labours, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
and Passions, do not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloud
the Soul and Intellect, and

Sight, as every one is obedient and
capable; so on the other side, such
as give way to <hi>Evil,</hi> are by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and the continual workings
of the Spirit of Error, made
more strong in <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
And as the former by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Purity give advantges to
the good Angels and Spirits to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37544:29"/>
have communications with them,
who are always ready to unfold
the Misteries of their Kingdom
to the sober and clean of Heart;
so the latter do by their Voices
powerfully attract the bad Angels
and Spirits, which do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

strengthen them in Evil. And
therefore those that would have
the company of the good Spirits

by night in <hi>Dreams</hi>
and <hi>Visions,</hi> and desire to retain
the Forms and Figures represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
with the <hi>Interpretations</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

even as at the first dawning
of the day, press on towards <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
having always a well-prepared
Temple to receive the
sweet influence of Gods Spirit
and company of good Angels,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37544:30"/>
or their Communications after a
Spiritual way; for as those <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Intelligencers</hi> are <hi>administrating
Spirits</hi> to God primarily, so in the
second place, their delight is to
do good Officers to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servants of God, thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the praise and glory of the
great and Alcreating Jehovah Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lohim,
Blessed forever</p>
               <p>This is a Lesson which every
one ought to be sensible of, and
endeavour to learn, and which,
if duly regarded, then most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whose faces are looking <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>-
wards, would have more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thoughts, and greater esteem
for the <hi>Visions of the Night,</hi> and
the most wonderful and hidden
Conversations thereof; for if man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
were sensible of these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Truths, and the wonderful
power of their own souls in such
cases, it would beget an awful
Dread, or sober and Tremendous
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37544:30"/>
Considerations and Contemplations,
which would not only invite the
Courteous Communications of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent
Spirits, but so still and
prepare the <hi>inward Man,</hi> and all
the noble Faculties of <hi>Nature,</hi>
as to render them capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
such abstracted <hi>sights</hi> and
<hi>Manifestations,</hi> whereby they would
take some Root in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and so make Impressions on the
Spirits, and thence blossom forth,
and grow up to very happy fruits,
both for encreasing good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schewing
Evil. So great is the
power of Sobriety, Temperance,
Cleanness and Self-denial, as being
most sublime and elevating Vertues,
and a great help to make men hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
both in this World, and that
which is to come.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is highly convenient
for every one that applyes his
Thoughts to this Science of <hi>Dreames,</hi>
orindeed to any sort of Knowledge,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37544:31"/>
that is truly Philosophical and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
to be serious and sober, and
to learn first the mysteries of his
<hi>own World,</hi> before he lets his Eyes
and Imaginations ramble into, or
gaze after the Wonders or Vanities
of the great <hi>External World,</hi> being
certain of this, That if he do not
in some competent measure <hi>know
himself,</hi> and continually endeavour
the Advancement and Encrease of
that Knowledge, he will never
come to understand any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
himself, as he ought to do,
much less enjoy the participation of
those <hi>Misteries</hi> of which we treat
in this Discourse.</p>

               <p>IN the former Chapter I acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you with the General or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Reason of Dreams, <hi>viz.</hi>
Because the Soul or Spirit of Man,
being the Image of the Immense
Creator, and Epitome of the whole
created Bulk of Nature, it so far
resembles Him that never slumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or sleepeth, as to be always
active; for in the adoreable divine
Architype though there be no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or shadow of change, yet
there are perpetual Emanutions of
Beneficence, and reflected Ideas of
Love and Complacency.</p>
               <p>But now from this prime <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catartick</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:37544:32"/>
or original <hi>first Moving
Cause,</hi> we must descend to <hi>others</hi>
more particular and <hi>Immediate</hi> which
influence the Soul this or that way
in its <hi>Formative Activity,</hi> and <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduate</hi>
its <hi>operations.</hi> And these oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional
Impressions, as they Cause
very different Representations to us
in our sleep, so they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very <hi>various,</hi> For,</p>
               <p>1. Some Dreams proceed from
the Constitution or Complection
of each particular person,</p>
               <p>2. Others from his profession
or course of Living; those things
which he is most earnestly intent
upon, or concern'd about in the
day time.</p>
               <p>3. Others are occasion'd by the
influx of the Planets predominate
in his Nativity, or at such or

               <p>4. Other (Confused) Dreams
may arise from unfit Diet, or
Medicines, which sending up abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Vapours to the Brain, (the

as is experienced by drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

men in Feavers and the like.</p>
               <p>5. Others are injected by Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

with us, thereby often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning
us of impending dangers,
or instructing us to some eminent
advantage, if we have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion
to make use of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions.</p>
               <p>7. It sometimes pleases Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, in a special and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manner to reveal his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
to those that fear him, by
Representations in <hi>Dreams,</hi> which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37544:33"/>
then are more usually called Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to difference them from the
other kinds.</p>
               <p>Now though we shall occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally

yet to avoid prolixity, I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>duce
all Dreams to a <hi>Three fold Radix,</hi>
or Original, according to which
the three fold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grand Principles
carry the upper dominion in the
Centre of Life, or <hi>Will-Spirit,</hi> in
each person, that is to say, they
proceed either from the <hi>Sidereal</hi> or
<hi>outward Principles of this world.</hi> Or
secondly, from the <hi>dark Wrath</hi> or
<hi>fierce fiery Life.</hi> Or Lastly, from
the <hi>meek friendly divine Principle</hi> of
Love, which of these th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e does
predominate, of a suitable Nature
and property shall your Dreams
be. As for Example:</p>
               <p>1. If the <hi>dark, wrathful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fierce, keen
principle</hi> bear sway, then the noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37544:34"/>
Representations are Dark,
Melancholy, Fierce, Frightfull, and
the like.</p>
               <p>2dly If the middle uniting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or Friendly qualifying Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of divine Light do hold the
chief dominion in the Life's Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
then the Dreams are more
Essentially pleasant and delightful
to the Soul, and oft-times many
<hi>wonderful Secrets</hi> are revealed, and
<hi>impending Dangers</hi> foretold in a
Figurative way, easily deciphered,
or understood by a well prepared
mind. But,</p>
               <p>3dly, If the principle of this
outward world, and the Business
or things thereof do bear sway<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and carry the supream Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it generally happens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men, that lead a meer brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
and sensual Life, and iudulge
themselves in <hi>Vices,</hi> Superfluities, and
the Vanities of the world, then
the <hi>Dreams</hi> are full of Idle Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37544:34"/>
confused Mixtures of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Affairs and things belonging,
or relating to what each man is
concerned in, or busied about, and
these are apt to be forgotten, or
so darkly represented, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
remembred, that they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
very little use or benefit to
those that receive them, unless
they were before hand made sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of that <hi>ill Conduct</hi> of their
Lives which occasions them, and
thence would be perswaded, by a
total change of their Manners and
Conversations, to improve and
fit their spirits for better and
more advantageous Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the Condition of Souls
after Death, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>BY what has been said it partly
appears, That altho by the
degeneration of Mankind, instead
of observing and noting the nature
of those things, <hi>Dreams</hi> are become
a <hi>By-Word;</hi> and serve only to be
derided and scoft at, yet essentially,
and in themselves unto the wise,
and well-minded, they may disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
great <hi>Secrets,</hi> both or Time and
Eternity; which will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if we modestly consider, that
there is scarce any thing that yields
so true and great a figure, or simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the condition of the Soul
after Death, or in the state of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
as <hi>Dreams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:37544:37"/>
For as <hi>Death</hi> is a full Period to
all the Senses and outward Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Humane Life, the very
same is <hi>Sleep,</hi> during the time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
for if a man should sleep seven
or eight dayes, nay, if possible se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years, when he awakes, it
would be no more to him then one
night: By this it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that <hi>Sleep</hi> is a <hi>Temporary Death</hi>
to the Senses, where no distinction,
length or shortness of Time is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.
Therefore in <hi>Sleep</hi> all men
are, as it were totally dead, as to
the sensitive and distinguishing
power of Nature and the time
passes away as if he were in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
insensibly to all the outward
Properties; for what happens to
the Soul in <hi>Dreams,</hi> is somewhat
like, or a notable Resemblance of
that which attends it in its separated
estate, whether in the Good or in
the Evil.</p>
               <p>Thus in Dreams the soul enjoys
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37544:38"/>
a more compleat and unmixed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight, than is possible
for any person to enjoy when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
and in the use of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est
Senses; for then in the
height of his Complacency, fears
and apprehensions of losing the
pleasing objects, or jealousies of
others sharing with him therein,
or one thing or other is apt to
crowd in and interrupt his Joy.
But in many <hi>Dreams</hi> the <hi>Horizon
is all Light,</hi> and clear, no Cloud
to be seen, and the whole seems
to be so real, that nothing we
possess in this world can for the
time be more; insomuch, that
these Joys, and delightful Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
do oft times awaken the
sensitive power of the outward
Nature, the thoughts and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
thereof is very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the mind even after the
waking of the Body. As on the
other side, <hi>Evil Dreams</hi> cause
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37544:38"/>
strange Trouble Fear and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to the Soul, it apprehends
it self to be in real danger of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
falling, killing, being run
through with Knives, Swords, and
the like; falling down from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices,
being in pain, anguish
and agony, and many other things
of that kind, which do all arise
from the awakening or kindling of
the wrath and fierce poisonous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Central Fire, which cruel
fears and pains are real and essential
to the Soul, as the Body or Senses
are dead or asleep (which is as it
were, all one) and yet there is no
material thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eer them, that can
wound or hurt them. So great is
the power of the Soul when it has
either wholly, or in part, for a small
time, quitted it self from the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Senses, that it can make
something where no thing is, and
create either Grief or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rrow, all
according to that Principle or Form
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37544:39"/>
that is chief in the Government of
the Soul. For as that is quallified,
such is the nature of those <hi>Ideas</hi> that
are generated, and the <hi>Phantasies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
either of joy or fear, as the
Radix stood in Equality or Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
for in the sepera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Bliss or the Curse, there is
no Matereal thing, that can hurt or
afflict the <hi>Soul,</hi> but only its own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
or <hi>Turba,</hi> and what it forms
unto it self in the principle of <hi>Evil,</hi>
in which it self is comprehended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Root and Fountain, whence
all <hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> takes its Birth.
As on the contrary, those that are
comprehended in the blessed Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or friendly principle of <hi>Light</hi> &amp;
<hi>Love,</hi> their Joy &amp; Pleasure does arise,
and is continually generated from
the same principle in the Spirit,
and is real and essential, beyond
all outward Enjoyments, or what
can be apprehended, because none
in the Body can have the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37544:39"/>
or true sense of it. For
that property or principle man
has precipitated himself into, and
which has gotten the upper do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion

does proceed, and is generated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Joy or Sorrow according
to the degree and nature of that

whilst the Soul remain'd in the

nor thought of when awake, for the
formings of the predominate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
in mans soul are beyond all
<hi>humane Number:</hi> Now let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a man in a terrible Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frightful Dream, were never to
awake, but to continue eternally in
this imagined Agony and Dread,
what a disconsolated State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
would this be to the soul,
where all these fears and troubles are
apprehended to be <hi>Essential,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are during the Sleep of
the Senses. But when the Soul
is thus perplexed, and in this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
fear and horror, it violently
seizes on the Body, as its <hi>Natural
House,</hi> and with its fierce motion
<hi>awakes</hi> it, and causes the very flesh
to tremble, and then the Soul or
Spirit is glad and rejoyces that it
bath escaped those dangers it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37544:40"/>
whereas if it had not been
cloathed with an humane Body, it
would have been destitute of any
such refuge to case its self, as Soul
are after Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions</hi> are incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,
like the <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
the Joy, Pleasure, Trouble, or
Sorrow that is apprehended, is as
<hi>Essential</hi> to the Soul as any sensual
pleasure, fear or grief is to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
And what we have said of the
Kingdom of Darkness, Sorrow and
woe, the like is to be understood
in the Light and Blessed Kingdom
of Heaven, where the <hi>Paradisical
Ioys</hi> are incorporeal, or else the
beautified Inhabitants could not
have any pleasure in, or <hi>Simile</hi> with
them; for when the body is dead,
and the Soul separated from it,
then all incorporeal things became
as substantial as material things do
to the Body; and the Seeing,
Hearing, Smelling, Tasting and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37544:41"/>
Feeling is as <hi>real</hi> and essential to
the Spirit, as all sorts of gross
substances are to the outward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and during sleep, the Soul
is as it were seperated, and as if it
were in Eternity, does really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
pleasure or pain, according
to that principle that predominates
therein, whilst the Body lies as
it were dead, and also all the senses
not at all concerned with, or capable
of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but oft-times the Soul or
Spirit being affrighted with hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
apprehensions, and dangers, or
too highly lifted up with <hi>Ioy</hi> and
Delight, does return and seizes the
Body, and awakens the outward
senses, which immediately puts a
period to the Joy or Sorrow, Grief
or Pleasure, and they seem to the
outward Sense and Reason, as if
there had not been any such thing,
but all had been a Romance or Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion,
for so it may well be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

moisture in the deceased Body does
in some degree continue; for as the
moisture and matter of the Body
does waste, so the Apparition or
<hi>Ghost</hi> does grow weak, and at last
vanish.</p>
               <p>For the Soul cloathed it self by
the help of the matter contained in
the Body, which is done by a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathitical
Operation between the
External, and Internal, for there is
some likeness or Relikes of the Spirit
remaining in the deceased Body so
long as it continues moist and full
of matter, for if it were not so, it
were impossible that any Soul should
appear in any Body or shape either
humane or Beastial.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was that some of the
Philosophical Antients commanded
the Bodies of the dead to be burnt,
to Ashes, which did totally destroy
the <hi>Humour Radicalis</hi> or Spirit of the

perventing such <hi>Apparitions,</hi> as we

are speaking of, and hindering Souls
from Cloathing, themselves with
thin Aireal Bodies, which they can
do only by a Sympathetical agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between themselves and their
old Houses, the deceased Bodies.
For if the Soul departs from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
filld with Affections to external
things, be they what they will, then
finding it discomposed and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted,
it longs after its old Body or
House, and by <hi>Simile,</hi> and help of
the Fluid Humours and Spirits yet
remaining in the Body, it attracts
a subtle matter, in which having
vested it self, it becomes to outward
view Corporeal.</p>
               <p>But if the Body should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
by Fire then the Spirit or
Soul would be prevented wholly of
matter for this sidereal Cloathing;
And therefore this way of burning
the dead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>odies, was practised, as in
divers other Nations, so also in
<hi>England</hi> in former Ages; for then
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37544:44"/>
it was more frequent for departed
Souls, as also for divers other sorts of
<hi>Spirits</hi> to appear to the living, than
of late years (for some Reasons
which I shall not stand to insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or explain in this place) And
therefore they did consume their
dead Bodies with Fire, by which
there was an immediate and full
Separation between the Body and
Soul, and no simile remain'd, and
consequently no matter could be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
or coagulated for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of such <hi>Spectre's</hi> or <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the like Reason (we may note
by the way) that the first <hi>Midwives,</hi>
and Directors of Women, after
Delivery, ordered the After-Birth,
with Consumption by Fire, to put a
period to the Atomes or subtle Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
that can and do powerfully pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
all Bodies; for they are so
subtle and quick, that nothing can
hold or hinder them from returning
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37544:44"/>
to their <hi>Centers,</hi> but only the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the whole. But it is further
to be observed, That all Midwives
ought to let the <hi>After-Burthen</hi> be
through cold before they burn it,
or else the fierce surprisal which the
Fire makes upon the Spirits, will
force them back to their <hi>Center</hi>
whence they proceed, with a Rapid
motion, and carry with them the
hot sulpherous Atomes and Particles
of the Fire, which in some Complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will wound the Health, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cause Fevers, and unnatural
Heats and Indispositions, and more
heat the Milk by simile; These
things are seldom considered, and
therefore the Evils thereof are the
ofter felt.</p>
               <p>But to return from <hi>this Digression</hi>
(wherein we thought it not unfit
to point out briefly the Nature,
Causes, and Manner of Souls ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
after Death, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happens where the affections
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37544:45"/>
are exceeding violent, as aforesaid)
it is <hi>far easier,</hi> and more familiar for
the deceased Souls to communicate
their secrets to their living Friends
in <hi>Dreams,</hi> then to appear thus in
external Forms, by cloathing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with thin Elemental Bodies;
for men in <hi>Dreams</hi> are nearer unto
the condition of departed Souls then
when awake; and therefore they can
with ease, and great familiarity dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and reveal their minds unto
them, more especially, if there were
a simile between their spirits, or if
there was a hearty Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
whilst they lived: For all the
time the Body sleepeth, it is as it
were dead, and ten hours is but as
one minute, but the spirit and soul
liveth and acteth, and seeth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
things as if it had not
any earthly Body, but were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in Eternity; for near and afar
off is all a like unto it, it can as
easily visit remote Countries and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37544:45"/>
Regions beyond the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> or
<hi>Tropicks,</hi> as a mans own House or
Garden; it can sink it self into the
deepest of Depths, and also sore
aloft and range through all the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
sphears; the Etherial Spirits
of men being thus <hi>volatile,</hi> and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
when the outward body or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are dead, or, (which is all one
for the time) <hi>asleep,</hi> the Immaterial
Beeings, or seperated Souls being
of an <hi>homogenial</hi> Nature, and like
state, can easily hold communication
therewith by such means as are
proper for the intercourse of such
spirituous Essences, especially if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Death of the Body there was
something strongly impressed on the
Spirit of the deceased, which proves
very burthensome until they have
by some means revealed it to those
to whom they had a desire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
it before their Death, but by
some accident were prevented, or
where there is some great sympathy
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37544:46"/>
or similitude between the Soul of the
deceased, and the Living and for
this last reason, the Souls of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
some<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imes do make application
to such sympathizing Souls of the
Living whilst the Body lies asleep,
and reveal great secrets, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But there is such a vast dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between the Incorporeal Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
viz. Souls departed; Spirits
and Angels on the one side, and our
outward material Senses and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
on the other, as makes all these
<hi>Wonderful</hi> mysteries that happen to
man of this Nature appear but as
meer fantasies, shadows or Vanity,
and therefore this secret spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and real Communications of
Souls are derided in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
which unbelief and contempt
doth drive away and cause a sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Souls of the deceased, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37544:46"/>
also of all good Spirits and Angels,
which otherwise would be more
prompt and ready to such Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
as being forward to serve,
help, and enlighten those that are
sober, and we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l-minded, and such
as believe, and are sensible of those
wonderful things, and mysterious
Impartments; for a strong Faith,
firm desire and belief, viz. when the
Spirit or Soul is delighted in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of this spiritual discourse
and converse, does naturally attract
and draw the internal powers, Souls,
and good Angels, and causeth them
to delight to accompany men, both
sleeping and waking, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ending them
from various dangers and troubles,
and ready at all times to reveal and
foretel them of future things, but
on the contrary <hi>Incredulity</hi> with
vain despising Discourses do potent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drive them away, and causes, as
it were a total separations, so that
there seems to the outward senses
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37544:47"/>
and Reason of most men that there
is no such thing, but all idle vain
Conceits; so greatly is mankind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
having by vanity and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
apprehensions put out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Eyes of his intellectuals, so
that they are to him but as idle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations.</p>
               <p>But the Records of sacred Truth
do assure us, that most of the Sober
inlightned men in former Ages,
were sensible of this secret converse
of Angels and Souls, and had my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
revealed to them from God,
and his ministring Spirits, in Dreams
and Visions, as appears in the holy
Scriptures, of which we shall take
a particular survey in a Chapter by
it self.</p>
               <p>But now mankind's frowardness
intemperance and incredulity have
so estranged those holy powers,
good Angels and Spirits, that they
cannot come near man, to reveal
unto him the secret mysteries of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37544:47"/>
their Beeings and Conditions, on
foretel him either Good or Evil that
shall happen unto him; for a firm
Faith in God, and frequent medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on those sublime things have
a wonderful power sympathetical
inclination and attraction on good
Angels and Spirits of all offices and
kinds; for all things both in the
material &amp; immaterial worlds have
that secret communication and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
by likenesses; for the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
we resemble, and become like
the good Angels, they are the
more ready and prone to serve us,
this being the simpathetical draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is the way of God
in nature, for every thing doth
incorporate with its likeness, and
by a secret agreeable power, each
thing is ready to strengthen its own
Property, having the Key in its
self, that can open the Gates of its
own Principle in all other things,
both Heavenly and Earthly; for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37544:48"/>
they all flow from the two grand
principles, viz. Good and Evil, and
which soever of these two a man
suffers his will to enter into, that
property or principle gets the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and chief goverment in the
Soul; and if it be in the evil or fierce
wrathfull principle, then the Spirit
and Soul by way of desires and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
penetrates all Elements,
and things both extertnal and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and wheresoever it finds matter
capable, or disposed to receive them,
it incorporates, and with highest
diligence indeavours to destroy its
contrary, viz. all Goodness and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
And thus men are rendred fit
and capable to be the companions of,
and have society or secret commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
with evil Angels and spirits,
there being often internal agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and compacts bewteen the
Souls of men and evil Angels by way
of Imagination and desires in the
very center of their lives; which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37544:48"/>
very few persons are sensible of,
though subject unto, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot comprehend from
whence those multitudes of evil
suggestions, desires and vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
where-with they find
themselves incombred, do proceed;
for whosoever suffers his will and
strong desires to enter into the fierce
violent envious wrathfull original
spirit or property, has unity with,
and becomes a Companion of all
evil angels and spirits, whence do
proceed those wonderfull troops
and numberless swarms of vain
thoughts, imaginations, desires,
words and actions, being the very
dictates of Devils.</p>
               <p>And from the same black Stygian
fountain do arise that wonderful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
and cunning, and those strange
unimaginable inventions of evil
words, acts and vain plays, so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
a sober man would think
it impossible for men to be so strong,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37544:49"/>
ready and cunning in the doing of
evil; hence the old deceiving Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
is said to have been more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
then any beast of the field, <hi>Gen.</hi>
3. 1. And our Lord Christ tells us,
that the Children of this world
(the race of <hi>Cain</hi> and sons of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial)</hi>
are wiser (that is, more
crafty and full of inventions) in
their Generation then the Children
of Light, and so the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
calls <hi>Elinas</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>O thou
full of all Subtilty, and all Mischief,
thou Son of the Devil, and Enemy
of all Righteousness,</hi> Acts 13. 10.
for as man is various in his central
ground as to inclinations, disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
love, hate and the like; so
various also are the evil angels and
spirits; whence we read their name
is said to be Legion, because they
are many; so that whatsoever a
man inclines to, or awakens in his
will and desires, whether good
or evil, there is presently a spirit
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37544:49"/>
or angels of the same property, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and prompt to execute, and put
into practice such his imaginations,
and to incline, and urge him forward
in the thing.</p>
               <p>But these sublime Matters are
understood or considered but by
very few; and therefore I would
intreat my Friends, and all that
are of humane Race, seriously to
ponder in their Minds, from what
Fountain, Principle and Ground that
great Variety of Dark Vain and
Evil Thoughts, Imaginations,
Words and Actions do proceed; of
which, some few I shall set down
for an Example, or Looking-glass
to the considerate Reader. As first,
in Child-hood, for to wish to be
Kings and Emperors, to have brave
Houses, and costly Furniture; to
have gay Clothes, and think that
whoever meets one, does, or at
least ought to admire an Ass for
his golden trappings; to desire to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37544:50"/>
live idlely, and spend all ones time
in eating, drinking, sleeping and
playing: And as people attain to
maturer Years, to wish and desire,
a great deal of Mony and Liberty,
to have Variety of Women; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
all others in Evil Mischievous
Arts and Sciences, to Hurt, Kill and
Murder all such as shall Offend
them. For a Man secretly to wish
his Wife dead, that He might have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nother with more Mony, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
how to Circumvent another
in a Bargin, or Defraud him of
his Inheritance or Right, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of law, and then to boast of
our Wit and Cunning in doing it,
for a man to design himself an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Empire, or the Government
of the whole world, as some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have done, and sacrificed mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of mens lives to that conceit.
These and the like strange Evil,
and most abominable Thoughts,
Imaginations and Desires bubble
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37544:50"/>
up in, and have possession of most
mens Minds, even to the day of
death, which do all arise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the poysonous Root, by
the Promptings Instigations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gections
of the evil Genij, which
are like swarms of Bees in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
man, if he suffer his will
and desires to enter into their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
and Property, which is to
do Evil, and only Evil, and that
continually: Others there are,
whose desires are not so far enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon Notorious Wicked Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but rather amuse themselves
with Vanities, and Things which
they conceit to be Innocent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diferent,
as an over care of being
well spoken of in the World; and
therefore studying Complements,
and Civilities, to procure Esteem,
pleasing themselves with fine Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and dilicate Walks, and
Gardens, doting upon a brave Horse,
or a Dog, or placing all their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37544:51"/>
Delight and Joy, in
some one particular Child, or the
like.</p>
               <p>Now when any one doth thus
inordinately take pleasure in such
things, he or she will continually
be incouraged, and prompted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by evil, Angels, and Genij,
of a middle Nature, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
both with the property of
the inward and outward Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
having as it were an equal
mixture, of both which diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attend the Motions, Actions
and Inclinations of each people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
and making them strong,
and fixed in their way of Vanity,
and when ever they go about to do
an Action that in it self is good, they
suggest something that may mar
and spoil it by circomstances: As
when they give an Almes, they
tickle them with a conceit of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and so they do it not for God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake,
that hath commanded it, but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37544:51"/>
to be seen, and praised if men;
if they are abstemious, these ill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
recommend it, not as a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Vertue, but as it saves their
money, or preserves their credit,
and so in all other like cases.</p>
               <p>Others by Complection, or Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
devout, having entertain'd,
and suffered their desires to enter
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o Superstitions or limmited sowr
harsh forms of Religion, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
they are attended with an
evil Genius, or Angel, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
their peevish mistakes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a notion of Zeal, so that at
length, for a Lye and vain super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
idle Fancy of another mans,
they will both suffer death them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and when they most cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
murder their Brethren that will
not, nor cannot believe as they
do, they think they do God good
service, witness the daily Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of many Turks, and others.</p>
               <p>So Great, Strong and Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37544:52"/>
are the simpathetical opperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of evil Angels, and Spirits,
on the souls of men, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
any person inclines to, or
what Principle or Property soever
is awakened, or gets the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the center of his Life, or
that the same does naturally invite,
or attract, a Genius or Angel of
a surable property, which does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
wait upon him, or her,
so long as they shall continue in
that state; But if the will (which
indeed is the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> in man)
turn it self away from that, and
enter into another thing, then
the Government of that Genius,
or Angel, grows weak, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
takes his place, according to
the nature of that thing the man
is inclined unto; for no sooner
can a man fix his thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
strongly upon any thing, but
a genius is presently at his Elbow,
and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ady to suggest an increase
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37544:52"/>
of the same longing, and prompt
him to put his Imaginations into
Action.</p>

               <p>VVhat we said of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

Variety of mixed thoughts and

so that sometimes, when a man has
as it were just concluded to do an

comes in with a powerful admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
but with a gentle soft, and

               <p>Thus sometimes a man going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

and most wicked thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
injected, or darted as it

beam'd in from the good <hi>genius,</hi>

<hi>Evils</hi> and <hi>Miseries,</hi> and from this
impure Fountain, which men awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
by their Intemperance and

of vain <hi>Dreams,</hi> and lying <hi>Visions;</hi>
for according as the more central
parts are awakened, and sutable to
that Principle that governs in the

               </p>
               <p>Yet it must be understood that
no man's <hi>dream</hi> is wholely, and
altogether evil and vain, for that
cannot be, except men were meer
<hi>Devils,</hi> which also cannot be, so
long as we live in the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for mans fall was not like the
fall of the evil Angels, for these
latter fell into the <hi>dark Abiss,</hi> or <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Wrathful Principle,</hi> without,
or beyond <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Creature,</hi> and
therefore there was for them no
help, nor recovery; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
men fell into the knowledge
of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> that is into <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:37544:55"/>
and <hi>Creature,</hi> which is his inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
happiness, as being not left
destitute, or uncapable of the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
or Regenerating Seed</hi> of the
woman; for there does centrally
dwell in the humane Nature that
which the wise man calls, <hi>The Voice
of Wisdom,</hi> that continually calls
man to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and Reproves
him for his evil Wayes. This is the
<hi>Genius Optimus,</hi> the Soul of the Soul,
and the Eye of the Mind, that has
power, and is alwayes willing to
defend man from all the Assaults of
evil Angels, and unto this holy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and friendly Fountain, the
Dictates and Voices of all good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Spirits do concur, it being
a great part of their work and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to assist man, and preserve
him from the inward incursions of
the multitude of malignant Spirits.</p>
               <p>And as mens Thoughts Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Words and Works are mixed,
viz. <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> but generally
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37544:55"/>
the evil does much over-ballance the
good; the very same is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of their <hi>Dreams,</hi> and night
<hi>Visions;</hi> whence it comes to pass
that the far greater part of mens
<hi>Dreams</hi> proving, so false frivilous
vain and impertinent they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
infamous, and a Reproach is
unjustly brought upon <hi>Dreams</hi> in
general; whereas indeed the fault is
in themselves that their Dreams are
no more certain; for the streams
cannot aford good pure water, if
the Fountain be defiled; neither can
any expect true delightful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
Dreams and night Visions,
when the unequal Forms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of nature have gotten the
upper dominion in the heart and
soul? Or who can hope for the
friendly Visits and Communications
of good Angels, when both Soul and
Spirit are captivated in evil, and
lives as it were in another Country
or Region, which is as opposite to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37544:56"/>
that wherein they delight, as Light
is to Darkness, or the <hi>Zenith</hi> to the
<hi>Nadar?</hi> And therefore they cannot
come there; for <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Genij</hi>
have power only in their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
principles, and mankind
cannot draw neer, nor have any
Communication with them, nor
they with him, except he immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his will and desires into their
principle.</p>
               <p>This is clearly manifested by all
things in this external world, which
is a real and true Figure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
from whence it proceeded;
for here we see how every thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to accompany its own kind,
as proceeding from the same Matter
and Element, and when the same
properties have the chief dominion
in the Centre of Life: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those men whose predomnant
Qualities are alike, have a great
affinity with each other in their
Dispositions and Inclinations, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37544:56"/>
and do often heartily love and desire
each others company; and the same
is to be understood in many other
things where they agree in number,
weight and measure, there they
powerfully incorporate and rejoyce
together, and with united Forces
endeavour to cast out their Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
A pregnant Example of this
we have in sounds, If two Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Musick of one sort be
Tun'd to an equal pitch, strike one
of the strings, and the same string
on the other Instrument will Shake
or Tremble, as I my self have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.
The very same attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and sympathetical Inclinations
have all other things, though in
some it be more occult: what man
in the world would believe the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
Vertue and Power which
the Lodstone has upon Iron, if
it did not appear to his Eye? For
the wise and wonderfull Creator
has endued all things with an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37544:57"/>
vertue and attractive Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and Certainly, if Nature
hath such Great Power, and Secret
Energy in inanimate Things, much
more there is in the Living Power,
or Highest Graduated Spiritual and
Immortal Beeings, of which these
Outward Things are but Figures;
if man did but know, or were but
sensible how Wonderfully he is
Made, and Excellency of his own
Composition, and that in him is
Contained the True and Real Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
both of Time and Eternity,
then would he be ashamed of his
condition, and ever Praise and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
and Serve his Blessed Creator
in Fear, and endeavour to immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Him and all Good Angels, in
Innocency and Well-doing, which
would more powerfully attract the
Sweet and Blessed Influences of all
Good Spirits, and the Intrinsick
Vertue of every other Thing,
whereas Discord and Evil do as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37544:57"/>
Powerfully drive away all Good
Intelligences, and make men alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
incapable of Divine Visions,
so that he being Defiled and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Violence, cannot foresee
any Celestial Thing; but becomes
as it were wholy Blinde as to those
Sublime Misteries, and Holy Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which is a Wofull Condition,
and very Deplorable, for then,
they call Evil Good, and Good
Evil, not being Capable to make
any Distinction of their Properties,
or the Principles of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>On the other side, a firm Faith,
and a continued Contemplation or
Meditation on the wonderfull va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Seperated Beeings, and the
Immortal World (whence all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
things take their Birth; the
inward Beeing the Life, and the
outward, but as the Body) for men,
I say, to be sensible of these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Opperations does Facilitate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37544:58"/>
and promote true Visions;
more especially if Temperence,
Cleanness &amp; Innocency be observed
in Meats, Drinks, Exercise, Words,
Works, and Communications, for
these Vertues are Divine Gifts;
he that obtaineth the Knowledg and
Government of himself is endued
with a Glimps or Ray of Divine
and Universal Understanding, both
of the Material and Immaterial
Creatures, together with the Fear
of the Lord, and the inward Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Holy Spirit, and Divine
Power; therefore it is said, That
the Spiritual man discerneth all
things, even the deep things of God;
that is, both things Internal, as
well as External, wherewith agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Apostle, teaching, That what
ever may be known of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in man; who is the only Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature
in this Visible Material World,
that is capable of all Spiritual and
Natural Learning, and as he shall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37544:58"/>
give way and be obedient to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
voice of Wisdom that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
cries in the Gates of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosmical
City, so shall he be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
by degrees with a True Sight,
and Spiritual Apprehension accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the use he makes of, and
the Advantages he puts his intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Talents unto. For the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all Wisdom, and Right
Knowing is within, in our own
Apartments; therefore there is a
Necessity for every Man first to
know himself in some Measure,
before he Think or Presume, to
know or Understand any other
Thing Truly, be it either Natural
or Spiritual; and those that with
an Holy Humility do Aspire to this
Sublime Knowledge, <hi>Viz.</hi> of God,
Nature, and Themselves, ought
by all means to be in good earnest,
and Zealous for Cleanness and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Living; for Abstinence, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and Temperence do wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37544:59"/>
fortifie the Observers thereof,
against the Assaults and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Evil Spirits and Angels, and
make the Body Lightsom, Pleasant
and Healthy, thereby enlarging
all its Functions, and also Prepares
the Soul for Celestial Irradiations,
rendring it more fit to become the
Temple of God, and Associate
of Holy Powers; those Pure Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemious
Vertues do in a wonderful,
but secret manner attract the good
Angels and Spirits, more especially
to such Persons as by an insight into
these Mysteries, shall be satisfied of
the possibility of such Spiritual Visits
and Communications, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ready to reveal the Secrets of
Time and Eternity, to such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and imitate them.</p>
               <p>For no man can open the Gate of
that holy and friendly principle in
which they live, but those only who
have obtained the right Key through
obedience to the heavenly voice of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37544:59"/>
Wisdom in themselves; for this is
the strait Gate, and the narrow
Way that leadeth into the holy City;
all things are moved by Concord and
Equality, which all the Prophets and
renowned Law-givers were truly
sensible of from the beginning of
the world, being wonderful for
their strict observance of Sobriety
and Temperance, as <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> &amp;c.
who were so given to fasting, that
their <hi>Faces</hi> are said to have <hi>shined;</hi>
that is, the divine principle and voice
of Wisdom was so resplendent in
them, that they had, and held the
measure and reins of Goverment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Body, as if they had been a
Spirit; indeed all holy men endued
with divine understanding, and such
as obtained of the Lord the great
Blessing of Intelligences, and the
free Communication of good Spirits
and Angels, have been remarkable
for Sobriety, Temperance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Living, for mens minds can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37544:60"/>
be any otherways preserved free
and potent.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> was highly
sensible of this, when he and his
Companions, were both courted and
threatned with the displeasure of
the King and his Servants, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eating of the unclean Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,
both of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

came from the Kings luxurious Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which he and his fellows refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to defile themselves with, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rather to adhere to wisdom's
voice, than suffer themselves to be
seduced out of natures pure simple
and innocent way, by either the
Flatteries or Menaces of the Court;
and therefore according to the Law
of their God, and the Dictates of
his Hand-maid Nature, contented
themselves with clean and harmless
<hi>Foods</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> viz. <hi>Herbs, F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uits,
Seeds</hi> and <hi>Grains;</hi> for those things
had not only a real Affinity with
the innocent Principle in man, but
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37544:60"/>
also they could be procured without
<hi>Violence, Oppression</hi> or <hi>Dying Groans,</hi>
and likewise without any trouble or
hazard to Body or Minde; Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which the Kings royal Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
could not boast of.</p>
               <p>Were not the Rachabites enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the Recommendation, even
of the Blessed Creator Himself, to
all Posterity, for their Abstinence
and Temperence? The truth is,
none can preserve their Spirits Clean
and Pure, but such as Extenuate
the Gross Superfluous Humours by
Purity and a Spare, Frugal Innocent
Diet, by which the Body becomes
more easily Penetrable, it being a
Maxime that may pass amongst the
things undoubtable, that if the
Body be not fitly preserved and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
the Spirit whilst it is linkt
there-unto, and as it acts, so it
suffers by it too, cannot conveniently
Exert its Functions; for Abstinence
and Temperance do dignifie men,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37544:61"/>
and render them fit for the Exercise
of all Vertue, being the Root of
Strength and Fortitude.</p>
               <p>For this cause the Mother of
<hi>Sampson,</hi> was commanded in Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
on, or Dream, by the Angel of the
Lord to abstain from Wine, and
Strong Drinks, and so was <hi>Samson</hi>
her Son, who was endued with
wonderfull Strength; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Vertues of Temperance
and Cleanness are Practised, other
Holy Vertues may be expected
to follow, because by its power,
no superfluous Matter is Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
that may dull or indispose the
Phantasie, or other intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Power of the mind; and so the
Soul being freed from burthensom
Vapours, becomes watchful and
soberly active both in Words and
Works; for the Body and inferiour
Earthy Spirits, being kept under,
the Soul is thereby adopted to the
Superior Powers, and their sweet
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37544:61"/>
influences: Did not our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
live to great Ages in perfect
Health and Strength of Body and
Mind, enjoying many heavenly
Priviledges by Vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and innocent Course of Life?
Now the Reason why Cleanness
Temperance and Sobriety have been
so much praised by all good men,
is because they proceed and are
streams that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> blessed Fountain of true
Light and Love; and all that espouse
them in good earnest, are power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
drawn into the same Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
strengthening and defending
the observers thereof, against all
Kinds of Superfluity and Madness
of Riot. Hence it was that the
Wise Seers of old abstain'd from
unclean Foods, and the Flesh and
Blood especially of such Animals,
whose predominant Quality and
Ascendent chiefly stood in, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the wrathful and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37544:62"/>
Nature; they being throughly
sensible what a base depraved thing
it was that the noble Faculties of the
Soul and Humane Nature should
mix, joyn and incorporate with
the Bruitish Nature, and unclean
wrathful properties of Beasts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
such as by Natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
desire to eat the Flesh and
Blood of others their Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
it being concluded on all
sides, that such <hi>Carnivorous Blood-sucking
Creatures,</hi> are Radically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
and not fit to be eaten: which
being a known Truth, that scarce
any will deny, <hi>I</hi> do thence further
demand by parity of Reason, how
then Mankind can be clean, either
in Soul, Body or Spirit, that now
are so far generally degenerated as
greedily to desire and devour the
Flesh of all the Inhabitants of the
four Worlds or Elements? What
great Matters or Heroick Acts, or
spiritual performances can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37544:62"/>
from such as defile themselves
both in Quantity and Quality of
Foods, which renders them unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of seeing, judging or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any thing as they ought
to do.</p>
               <p>Therefore whoever would know
God, and the wonderful Faculties of
his own Soul, must be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the wholsome Rules of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
Temperance and Cleanness
in Meats, Drinks and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For all the great Seers,
and holy Prophets, every one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his respective Gift and
Manifestation, was an immitator of
God, by living in the practice of
those good Vertues, which fitted
and prepared them for every Good
Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Temperance,</hi> being the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Guard, and chief watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that suffereth not the Soul to
sleep, or be overcome with the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
pleasures of Gluttony and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37544:63"/>
but frees it from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensom

and makes it see things,
even as they are in their Naked es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Verities, and attracting the
Coelestial Quires for such Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
both sleeping and waking,
as their Companions that delight
to communicate with the undefiled
in Mind and Body.</p>
               <p>But on the Contrary, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Intemperance defiles both
the Body and Soul, depraves and
stupifies all the intellectual Powers,
and renders them uncapable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Convers with good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
or Angels; for Disorders do
as Naturally drive away and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
them, as vertue and sobriety do
attract their happy Company: But
Superfluity and Debauchery have a
powerful inclination and sympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
force over evil Doemons, and
causes a near affinity between the
soul and them, whence do proceed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37544:63"/>
such a multitude of vain Thoughts,
Dreams, Words and Works. And
therefore the Scripture saith of the
evil Angel, <hi>That be goes about like a
roaring Lyon, seeking whom be may
devour,</hi> being a great Prince of
the wrathful evil part of the world,
but not in the humane friendly or
good part, for that is separated from
his Principle, beyond the Sphear of
his Activity, so that he hath there
no power.</p>
               <p>And although nothing can be
more prompt and ready than these
<hi>dark spiritual Beeings,</hi> to assist and
carry on all evil designs in the hearts
of men, that incline to do the works
of their principle; yet still they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
annoy nor injure any but only
such as draw near unto or a waken
their fierce wrathful Fountain, by
means of <hi>Uncleanness, Superfluity,</hi>
and <hi>Intemperance,</hi> which are the grand
Inletts of the Devil, that give him
power over the Soul and Spirit;

Darkness, and they knew it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themselves,
but others, who have
adhered unto the voice of Wisdom
in themselves, and live in the power
and Vertue of <hi>Temperance,</hi> do clearly
perceive and know it; for those that
are afflicted and inslaved, do make
demonstrations of their wretched
condition, and what Angels or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are their Guardians, by their Vile
and Blasphemous Words, Wicked
Works, Cruel Violences and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to those of their own kind, and
also to all the inferiour Creatures;
which does sufficiently manifest
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37544:64"/>
whose Children they are, and what
Angel is their Captain and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor,

For the Thoughts Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Ideas, Figures, Shapes,

Astreal Forms, which hath had the

               <p>The like is to be understood of
the Shapes or Forms, wherein <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Souls appear</hi> or represent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for the same are either hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
and frightful, or pleasant
and humane, according to what
Property or Principle they are fallen
into, or captivated under. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those that have precipitated
themselves into the divided Forms,
into Beastiallity, and the savage Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
having cast off and abondon'd
the humane Property, and grown
Hardhearted, Cruel, and Sordid,
without Mercy, Compassion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency;
such, I say, as live and dye
in this Savage, Brutish State, do
fall into the dark, Fierce, Hellish
Principle, which had already in
their Life time captivated the Soul,
as may be understood by the unclean
Words and Works, that Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37544:65"/>
from them; Now according to
what Property or Form has got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the chief dominion in the Soul,
such a Shape and Form is the Soul
and Spirit Cloathed with. For in
the Dark, Wrathful, or Hellish
Fountain, there is as great a Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Shapes, Forms and Figures,
as there is in the Paradisical or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Principle of the Light-King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Love; for every Soul shall be
capable to reinvest and attract mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of all things of the nature
of the property that carries the
upper dominion in the Spirits; for
such seed as men do sow, such a
Body, <hi>Viz.</hi> of that Nature is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and of a suitable Shape and
Form: for so the great and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
Apostle speaks of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
<hi>God giveth to every Seed its
own Body:</hi> Wherefore if men sow
hellish Seeds in their Lives, no
wonder if they be cloathed with
sutable shapes in the next World,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37544:66"/>
But on the contrary, those that in
earthly Pilgrimage have freed their
Souls and Spirits from Oppression,
Violence, Uncleanness and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and seperated themselves
from the giddy Croud, and vain
Wayes of the Multitude, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
their Wills and Desires
into the Friendly Principle of Gods
Eternal Love and Light, and have
been guided by its Counsel, their
Souls shall after Death arise, and be
cloathed with a more Perfect, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and Glorious, Humane, Shape
and Form; of whom our Lord
Jesus Christ was the first: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
He had Vanquisht Death by his
Resurrection, He Appear'd in the
same Shape, Form and Body, as he
had before in his Life. Likewise
the good Angels, and all separated
Souls of <hi>Saints,</hi> have in all Ages
appeared to the Prophets, and holy
men in humane Shapes and Forms,
exceeding beautious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:37544:66"/>
For it is not to be doubted but
that in the beginning the blessed
Creator made Man in this very
<hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Shape</hi> (as to his Body)
which he does retain, though not
now altogether so beautifull, by
reason of his Degeneration and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Intemperances, which have in
some degree defaced the lovely Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of his Body and Countenance;
for though Man through Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and giving way to vain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
hath lost the Government
of the divine <hi>Principle,</hi> and so is faln
from his first illustrious and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Estate,</hi> yet nevertheless he has
in some measure preserved still his
outward original shape or form of
Body; for the Lord endued every
Body with a <hi>Seed</hi> in it self, to beget
and produce its own <hi>Species,</hi> in all
particulars; and if it had not been
for this great and undefeazable Law
of the Creator, Man by his great
Lusts, Intemperances, Violence, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37544:67"/>
Cruelty, Vanities, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evil Courses, would long since
have destroyed, and lost his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
humane shape and form, as
well as that Angelical form of his
Soul: But it was not in the power
of his will to alter Shapes, and
change one Form into another, so
long as his Soul is cloathed with
<hi>Humane Nature;</hi> for the truth is, he
hath done what he could to be a
Beast outwardly as well as inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
nay, he is become far worse
than any of the savages of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
internally in the Spirit; and
therefore the illuminated Prophets,
called men by the names of the
worser sort of Beasts, in whom the
fierce, cruel, wrathful nature is most
predominant; as, Generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
Lions, Foxes, Wolves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
also the evil separated Spirits, or
Souls of Men, as well as faln An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
have always been resembled
and likened unto savage Beasts, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37544:67"/>
sented accordingly, when ever they
appeared in brutish, or fierce hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
forms.</p>
               <p>Therefore when <hi>departed Souls</hi>
shall appear to their surviving
Friends, either cloathed with sideral
thin Bodies, or in <hi>Dreams,</hi> in beastial
shapes, and hideous frightfull forms,
it is but a bad sign or token of their
Condition and State in the other
World, and that they have not
retained the humane property in the
time of the Souls being in the Body;
for according to what property of
the wrathfull Principle man has
suffered his Will and Desires to enter
into, that same Quality or Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
gets the Dominion and chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the Centre of the Soul;
and if men live and dye in the
power and strength of that predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
wrathful Nature, and do
not weaken or change it by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Regeneration, then from
that very property is generated a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37544:68"/>
new Body, and sealed with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Signiture; for every Spirit has,
and is end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed with an innate power,
by which it can attract suitable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of all things for a Covering;
or Body, suitable; or of a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
form and nature to its self;
for, as at the beginning, when the
eternal sole <hi>Self-Existent Essence</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Himself to the Creation, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of all external Beeings
and Creatures, then according to the
qualification of the seven Fountain-Spirits,
and what property, degree
and nature of the Spirit such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was capable to attract out of all
things, for a Covering or Body,
such was the external nature, form
or shape proportionable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Life or Spirit.</p>
               <p>Therefore the outward Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or Forms, Shapes and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of each Creature, both in the
Animal, Vegetable and Mineral
Kingdoms, doth clearly manifest
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:37544:68"/>
what form or property in the seven,
fold nature carries the uppermost
Goverment therein: But none can
rightly distingush this but only the
unvailed Eye, though every one may
more or less perceive it, since in
Animates 'tis most clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
by the eyes of each Creature.</p>
               <p>For the Eyes are the open Gates
and Light of all the natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
through which continually
pass the most subtle spirits of life,
and have there their free egress and
regress. For which Reason the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of nature, and the strength,
weakness, liveliness, and dull, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
indispositions both of Man and
Beast may easiest be perceived by
the eyes and face. And hence also it
comes to pass, that the wishful looks
of some saturnine people, whose
souls are captivated in the astringent
bitter, wrathful nature, do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wound the pure spirits and
health, of those they wish evil unto,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37544:69"/>
which the Ancient called <hi>Fassination,</hi>
and our Vulger say of such as they
conceive to be injured, that they are
bespoke. Yet it is to be noted that
the wishes of those bad people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their fight or looking upon one,
hath not that power to hurt the
health, or any thing of that nature,
as seeing and wishing both together;
nor yet can either of them, or both

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> any, but only such as are under
the dominion of their Spirits, and
live under the government of the
same evil Properties, though in a
lower degree; for those that are
higher exalted then themselves in
the Wrathful Bitter Saturnine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they cannot injure, much less
can they touch or hurt others, who
live in any degree of Regeneration,
and acknowledge the holy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and eternal Light and Love
of Jesus Christ to be Guide and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of their Souls, there being
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37544:69"/>
a wonderful difference, and vast
Gulf between the Principles they
live in, the one being <hi>Light,</hi> and the
other <hi>Vtter Darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as the extern Signature of
all material Bodies is an intelligible
Character, or Index of the internal
Spirit or Vertue, so separated Souls,
when they assume aierial Bodies,
or represent themselves in <hi>Dreams,</hi>
do it in Shapes and Figures Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous
to the state they are in,
and that Principle which bears sway
over them.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this Chapter,
with two observations delivered by
two learned men.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Trythemius,</hi> who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
that never any good Angel
appeared in the shape of a woman.
The other <hi>Van Helmon,</hi> who in
his ninty third Chapter has these
words; If an Angel appear Beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
let him be accounted an evil
one, for a good Angel hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37544:70"/>
appeared with a Beard.</p>
               <p>The truth is a woman is the
weaker vessel, and was first in the
Transgression, so that Sex is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of weakness; and therefore
there is no reason, why the good
Angels, amongst whom there is no
difference of Sex, should chuse to
appear as a female, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a species above humane kind,
assumes the shape of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
of that kind, and for the
same reason they may appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
beards, both because hair is an
excrement, and verges somewhat
in resemblance to the brutish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as also more especially, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to denote their perpetual Youth,
Beauty and Vigour, wherein those
intellectual beeings, which keep their
First, Glorious, and Happy estate,
do alwayes remain. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
in all those particulars is to
be understood of the evil Genij,
who by their fall rendred themselves
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37544:70"/>
lyable to weakness, imperfection,
and continual Transgression, and
consequently allyed to the savage
nature, which they often resemble,
in being all over hairy, as is storied
of the Satires and Fawns, a sort of
corporial Demons, mentioned by
the Ancients, and one of which,
the great <hi>Augustine</hi> testified that
himself saw.</p>

Testimonies of Sacred Writ;
The ever blessed Creator, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sending his Angels and good
Spirits, to tell and reveal unto his
People, and Sons of Wisdom, his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37544:71"/>
Divine Pleasure, sometimes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
them of future things, and
sometimes of their own evils, and
at other times, to avoid and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the evils that evil men threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them with, as <hi>Genesis</hi> 20. 3.
God came to <hi>Abimeleck</hi> in a dream
by night, and said unto him, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
thou art but a dead man,
for the woman which thou hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for she is a mans wise, This
Angelical admonishion and reproof,
proved very profitable to <hi>Abimelech;</hi>
for hereby he repented of his evil,
which otherwise he would ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have committed, and saved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his people unviolated, and
safe from the severe Judgments,
so near impending and threatned,
so <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 10, 11. The Angel of
the Lord appeared to <hi>Iacob</hi> in a
dream, and bad him return into
his own Land; and when in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to that Vision, he had stolen
away unawares from <hi>Laban,</hi> and

                  <hi>Laban</hi> with his Brethren, persued
him seven days Journey, designing
as it seems, to fall upon him with
Violence, 'tis said in the 24th verse,
that the Lord came to <hi>Laban</hi> the
<hi>Assyrian,</hi> in a Dream by Night,
and said unto him, Take heed that
thou speak not to <hi>Iacob</hi> either good
or bad; that is, offer not any Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
to him, as appears <hi>verse</hi> 29.
By which means the rage of <hi>Laban</hi>
was restrained, and <hi>Iacob</hi> preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from danger. Did not <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
whilst yet but a Child, receive inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his future advancement,
in a Dream, <hi>Gensis</hi> 37. 9. Which
Dream was repeated, or doubled
unto him, for the greater assurance

thing. Of <hi>Pharoh</hi>'s chief Butler and
Baker it is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. 5. That
whilst they were in Prison, they
dreamed a Dream, both of them,
each man his Dream in one Night,
each man according to the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37544:72"/>
of his Dream: And when
<hi>Ioseph</hi> their Fellow-Prisoner came
unto them, in the morning, and
found them sad, and enquired the
reason, they told him, we have
dreamed a Dream, and there is no
Interpreter thereof: To which he
did not reply as many of the People
that would be counted wise men in
our Day would probably have done
in such a Case, <hi>viz. All Dreams are
Vanities and Fancies, you should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
regard them, they signifie nothing,
and therefore never trouble your heads
about the Interpretation,</hi> &amp;c. But on
the contrary, he tells them; <hi>Do not
Interpretations belong to God? Tell
me your Dreams, I pray you,</hi> verse 8.
And having heard them, proceeds
to give a true Interpretation thereof,
<hi>That the</hi> Butler <hi>should be Restored,
and the</hi> Baker <hi>Hanged in three dayes
space,</hi> which was exactly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 1. We
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37544:72"/>
read of a Dream that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King
of <hi>Egypt</hi> had, first, of seven fat
Kine, devoured by seven lean ones.
And afterwards of seven full ears
of Corn, devoured by seven thin,
and blasted ones, which the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
illuminated, young servant of
God, <hi>Ioseph</hi> interpreted to be a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from God; for, saith he, <hi>verse
25. God hath shewed</hi> Pharaoh <hi>what he
is about to do; there shall be seven
Years of Plenty, and afterwards seven
Years of Famine; Therefore he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to lay up the fifth part of all the
increase, during the seven fruitfull
Years;</hi> by which secret admonition
of the good Angels of the Lord,
King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was put into a way
to preserve himself and his people,
and particularly to be a shelter, and
maintianer of the Patriarks of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
and all his off-spring. And as well,

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:37544:73"/>
but still to one and the same
purpose; for which <hi>Ioseph</hi> gives the
reason, <hi>vers.</hi> 32. For that the Dream
was doubled unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> twice,
it is because the thing is established
by God, and God will shortly
bring it to pass; whence we may
learn, that when Dreams are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to us under several Forms,
we ought to take more especial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them, and may be assured both
of a certain and speedy coming to
pass of the things thereby signified.</p>
               <p>Dreams and Vision, were the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Wayes, whereby the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
his Councels to his Servants
and Prophets, to be communicated
to his people, for which there is
a plain express word of promise,
<hi>Numb: 12. 6. If there be a prophet
among you, I the Lord will make my
self known unto him in a Vision, and
will speak to him in a Dream.</hi>

                  <hi>Samuel,</hi> (whom he had caused

him, why he had disturbed him

<hi>Saul</hi> answered him, saying, I am in

hear what they say, and afterwards shall
thy hands be strengthened. Then he
went down with <hi>Phurah</hi> his servant,
unto the outside of the Armed men, that
were in the Host; and the <hi>Midianites,</hi>
and <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and all the Children
of the <hi>East</hi> lay along in the Valey like
Grass-hoppers for multitude, and their
Camels were without number, as the

Behold, I dreamed a dream, and loa

to <hi>Solomon</hi> in a Dream by
Night, and god said; Ask what I shall
give thee: And <hi>Solomon</hi> said, Now,

and I am but a young child; I know not
how to go out, or come in; and thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

thou hast chosen, a great people, that
cannot be numbred, or counted for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
Give therefore thy servant an

that I may discern between Good
and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thy so great people? And the speech
pleased the Lord that <hi>Solomon</hi> had ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this thing; and God said unto him,
Because thou hast asked this thing, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37544:75"/>
hast not asked for thy self long Life,
nor Riches, nor the life of thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but has asked for thy self under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to discern judgement of things;
Behold I have done according to thy
word; loe, I have given thee a wise and
understanding Heart, so that there was
none like thee before thee, neither after
thee shall any arise like unto thee; and I
have also given unto thee that which
thou hast not asked, both Riches and
Honour; so that there shall not be any
amongst the Kings like unto thee in all
thy dayes; And if thou wilt walk in my
wayes to keep my Statutes, and my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
as thy Father <hi>David</hi> did
walk, then I will lengthen thy days; and
<hi>Solomon</hi> awoke, and behold it was a
Dream.</p>
               <p>Hear we see what a large commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
or converse the Lord is
pleased to hold with the Spirit of
<hi>Soloman</hi> in a Dream; and as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
was nevertheless real on <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
part; nor less acceptable to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37544:75"/>
God, then if it had been made wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
nay, probable, was more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
because the more pure,
free and undisturbed desire of his
Soul, not then seduced by the senses,
or beclouded with corporeal objects;
so what the Lord promised him in
this vision, was punctually made
good and performed. But though
God speaketh frequently in Dreams,
yet many times man by his Dulness,
Corruptions and Depravedness ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
himself insensible of those illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;
whence holy <hi>Iob</hi> affirms,
<hi>God speaketh once, yea, twice, yet man
perceiveth it not; in a Dream, in a
Vision of the night, when deep sleep fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

and sealeth their instruction,</hi> Job 33. 14
15, 16. And as those Dreams and
Visions are sometimes matter of
joy and comfort, so at other times,
they are terrible and frightful; and
therefore the same pious Author
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37544:76"/>
complains, <hi>Iob. 7. 14. When I say,
my bed shall comfort me, my couch shall
ease me; then thou scarest me with

               </p>
               <p>'Tis the duty of the Prophets and
Servants of God to have a due regard
to their <hi>Dreams;</hi> and though some
pretended <hi>Dreams,</hi> when they had
none, or made use of them to seduce
the People to Idolatry, yet still the
true Prophets were not to slight <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
and <hi>Dreams,</hi> because of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Impostures; and such as were
guilty of the latter were by <hi>Mose's</hi>
Law to be put to death <hi>Deut. 8. 1.
If there arise amongst you a Prophet,
or a Dreamer of Dreams, and giveth
thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or
the wonder came to pass, whereof he
speakes unto thee, saying, Let us go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  </gap>. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had
Dreamed Dreams, and his spirit
was troubled because the thing was
gone from him; that is, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
what he had seen, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37544:77"/>
a general remembrance that
he had a strange and wonderful
Dream; when all the <hi>Magicians,</hi> and
<hi>Astrologers,</hi> and <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi>
were so far from being able to
recall his Dream, that they told
him, <hi>There was not a man upon the
Earth could do it;</hi> This holy Prophet
<hi>Daniel,</hi> not only shewed the King
the <hi>Dream,</hi> but also the <hi>Interpretation</hi>
thereof; (the same being revealed
unto him in a <hi>Night Vision,</hi> Dan. 2.
19.) whereupon he acquaints the
King, that <hi>there is a God in Heaven
that revealeth secrets, and maketh
known to the King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar,
<hi>what shall be in the Latter dayes; As
for thee, O King, thy thoughts came
into thy mind upon thy Bed, what should
came to pass hereafter, and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
secrets maketh known unto thee
what shall come to pass;</hi> and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to tell him the particulars of
his <hi>Dream,</hi> and the meaning thereof,
being a Declaration of the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37544:78"/>
Empires, and Monarchies,
that should succeed in the Earth, and
their Qualities, Splendor and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>The same King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
was premonished in a <hi>Dream,</hi> of the
Judgement that was coming upon
him, for his presumption and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness
of God; he was driven
out of his Kingdom, and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men, and did eat Grass with
Oxen, &amp;c. Also in the 7th. of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
we read, how the Lord by his
Angel shewed that holy Prophet the
things that should come to pass in
the world in the Latter days.</p>
               <p>Nor was this Method of God's,
(whereby he revealed his secrets by
Dreams) peculiar to the legal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
but seems more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be extended unto, and enlarged
under the Gospel, according to that
prophesie of <hi>Ioel,</hi> chap. 2. 28. <hi>And
afterwards (saith the Lord) I will pour

repeated and applied to the Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

<hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2. 17.</p>
               <p>So in the new Testament we read,
That when <hi>Ioseph</hi> thought to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom he had
espoused, because he perceived her
to be with Child; <hi>The Angel of the
Lord appeared unto him in a Dream;
saying,</hi> Joseph, <hi>thou son of</hi> David,
<hi>fear not to take</hi> Mary <hi>to thy Wife; for
that which is conceived in her, is of
the holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth
a son, and thou shalt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Iesus;</hi> for he shall save his people
from their Sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 20. And in
the second Chapter, when the wise
men came out of the <hi>East</hi> to visit
him that was born King of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and were sent by <hi>Herod</hi> to
<hi>Bethlem,</hi> bidding them, when they
had found him, to bring him word,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37544:79"/>
that he also might worship him;
they were warned of God in a <hi>Dream,</hi>
that they should not go again to
him; and therefore returned into
their own Country another way:
After whose departure, <hi>vers. 13.
Behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared
again unto</hi> Joseph <hi>in a Dream, saying,
Arise and take the Babe and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

there till I bring thee word; for</hi> Herod
<hi>will seek the Babe to destroy him.</hi> And
in the same Chapter <hi>vers. 19. When</hi>
Herod <hi>was dead, behold an Angel of
the Lord</hi> (once more) <hi>appeared to</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph
<hi>in</hi> Egypt, <hi>saying, Arise, and

the Lord to appear unto his people
in nightly <hi>Visions</hi> and by <hi>Dreams;</hi>
and in that secret way of Comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to reveal unto them many
wonderful things; insomuch that
they did account themselves as it

holy Spirits and Angels, when the
Lord did with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37544:80"/>
Complaint of King <hi>Saul.</hi> But
in this our Rude and Blind Age, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of complaining for want of
the presence of the Lord and his
holy powers, most people make a
Laughing-stock, and Derision of
<hi>Dreams,</hi> and all things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
so great is the <hi>Degeneration</hi> of
<hi>Mankind</hi> from all sublime <hi>Truths</hi> and
heavenly <hi>Converse</hi> of good Spirits
just as though there were no <hi>Angels</hi>
or <hi>Genij,</hi> or that the blessed God of
Truth had not granted any of them
to be our <hi>Guardians</hi> and <hi>Assistants</hi>
in our <hi>Necessities,</hi> and under his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
providence, to protect and
desend <hi>mankind,</hi> from the many
shares and inventions of evil Spirits,
which continually seek how they
may devour and destroy man, and
lead him captive into perdition:
But the Word of Truth assures us,
That the God of all Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
has made his Angels great and
powerful <hi>ministring Spirits,</hi> to aid
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37544:80"/>

and advance the Kingdom of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in former Ages we read, That
he sent his good Angels, as Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of his favour, and to defend
his people from incursions of the
evil ones; for they do continually
fight against the Malicious degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <p>Thence <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he sent

to fetch a wife for his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi>
did by Faith assure him, The Lord
should send his Angel before him,
and prosper what he went about,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 7. and 14. So the Lord
promises the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> Exod.
23. 20. <hi>Behold, I send an Angel
before thee, to keep thee in the way,
and to bring thee into the place which
I have prepared. Beware of him, and
obey his Voice, provoke him not, for
he will not pardon your Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
for my Name is in him. <hi>But
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37544:81"/>
if thou shalt indeed obey his Voice, and
do all that I shall speak, then I will
be an Enemy to thine Enemies, and an
Adversary to thine Adversaries; for
mine Angel shall go before thee in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the</hi> Amorites, &amp;c. Chapter 23.
24. Therefore now go, lead the
people unto the place of which I
have spoken unto thee: <hi>Behold,

which is repeated again, <hi>Chap. 33.

Gird thy self, and bind on thy Sandals;
and so he did: And he said unto him,
Cast thy Garment about thee, and follow
me; and he went out and followed him,
and wist not that it was true, that was
done by the Angel, but thought he saw
a Vision. When they were past the first

the Iron Gate that leadeth unto the
City, which opened unto them of its own

therefore in some Translations that
eighth verse of the thirty second
chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is thus read,

to the Nations their Inheritance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
he separated the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi>
when he set the Bounds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
according to the number of the
Sons of God;</q> that is allotted to all
the several Nations, distinct Rulers,
and Supervisors, amongst the Holy
Angels, here called the Sons of
God.</p>
               <p>Thus as all Contention Hate, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Strife, Oppression, Violence,
Fighting, Killing, Murders and
Wars, both Private and Publick;
are first conceived in the Spirit, and
have their Foundation from the
Wrathful, Poysonous Principle, so
when men by their sinful vanity
have awaked or kindled this direful
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37544:84"/>
Principle, which threatens destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Ruin to both private Families
and publick Societies, States or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
then there begins a great
Combat, and as it were open Wars
between the Guardian Angels of
each person or Country; and which
soever of them gets the Victory, that
King, Country or People succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in its Wars here below, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth
the other.</p>
               <p>This I conceive is plain, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
evident from the 10th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> where an
Angel comes to <hi>Daniel</hi> (who had
spent three weeks in mourning, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; praying) &amp; said unto him, O
<hi>Daniel!</hi> greatly beloved, understand
the words I speak unto thee; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee am I now sent, for from the
first day that thou didst set thy heart
to understand and to chasten thy
self before thy God, thy words were
heard, and I am come for thy word
sake; but the Prince of the Kingdom
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37544:85"/>
of <hi>Persia</hi> withstood me one and
twenty dayes; but lo, <hi>Michael,</hi> one
of the chief Princes came to help me,
and I remained there with the Kings
of <hi>Persia,</hi> now I am come to make
thee understand what shall befall
thy People in the latter days; for
the Vision is for many days — And
having strengthened the Prophet,
proceeded thus; knowst thou where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I come unto thee, I will return
to fight with the Prince of <hi>Persia;</hi>
and when I am gone forth, lo, the
Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> shall come; but I
will shew thee that which is noted
in the Scripture of Truth, of
<hi>Michael</hi> your Prince; thereby to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the several respective An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
Guardians or Titular Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of those Nations, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular person (as well as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Country) hath a peculiar
Angel Guardian, seems to me very
plain from the Scripture, especially
those two undeniable Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:37544:85"/>
18. 10. Take heed that ye despise
not one of these little ones; for I say
unto you, that in Heaven their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
alwayes behold the Face of my
Father. And <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 15. when the
Maid came and told the Brethren
that <hi>Peter</hi> (whom they supposed to
be in Prison) was at the Door, they
not believing her, said, It is his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel;
which plainly argues what a
firm opinion and belief the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Christians of old had in this
matter.</p>
               <p>The like stirvings and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to be apprehended of the
Guardian Angels, and chief Princes
of other Countries, Places and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
there is frequent struggling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Internal Princes, but still
the prime occasions, or first motives,
are generally given to them by mens
sinful vanities, which do move the
inward wrathful Principle of nature;
whence all those judgments and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Miseries do proceed, and which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37544:86"/>
do give oppertunity and advantage
to the evil Angels to insnare man in
a thousand Mischiefs, unheard of
Debaucheries, Idle Dreams and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Visions.</p>
               <p>For the Lord, who is a God of
Holiness and Purity, and loveth
Truth in the inward parts, doth not
visit any with heavenly Dreams or
Visions, but such as call u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and believe in his sacred Name; such
whose Temples are undefiled with
Blood and Uncleanness, and their
Hands unstained with Oppression or
Violence; such in all Ages he hath
admitted into his holy presence, and
granted unto them his good Angels
to Teach, Guard and Defend them
from Sin and Evil; but we do not
read that in former times the Lord
did ever so visit the froward and
perverse of heart, or granted them
the help of these noble illuminated
Companions, <hi>viz.</hi> the blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and good Genij, for alas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37544:86"/>
these blessed and good-natured In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers
were ready to attend
them, they instead of accepting and
attracting such their assistance, do
by wicked practises and intemperate
lewd habit of Life, and continual
Violence, drive the good Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and on the contrary, conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
to themselves evil Genij, whose
work it is to suggest and dictate
Lyes, in a spiritual way both night
and day; and such persons Dreams
and Visions are generally Lying
Phantasies, according to the nature
of their attendance.</p>
               <p>For every man in the world hath
either a good or evil Internal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
or Genius, that he adheres
unto, of the nature of that property
that he has the chief Government in
the Life; and this Genius does
mightily prompt &amp; froward all such
things as his principle, quality or
Complexion inclines him unto; and
as men alter in inclination, either to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37544:87"/>
good or evil, so their Genius grows
either stronger or weaker, according
as they shall enter with their wills
into good or evil, and became strong
therein, it may also be noted, that
what Imployment, Art or Science
soever a man strongly inclines unto
if he continues therein, and becomes
fixed, he shall obtain a proper Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
which will mightily assist him
in that Art; and the very same is to
be understood in both vertue and
vice, for as any one becomes wedded
unto, or practises either with strong
inclinations; so his Genius, or good
or evil Attendant becomes strong
and powerful, and if it be vertue,
than such a person becomes great in
the mysteries of Goodness, Vertue,
Wisdom, and the secret knowledge
both of God, and of himself, and
of universal nature, according as his
Temper and Complexion is capable;
For constancy giveth strength, and
great power, both to the Genius,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37544:87"/>
and all the faculties of the Soul;
And the like is to be said of vice, as
is most apparant in such as continue
long in the practice of Evil, they
every day grow much worse, the
Custom takes away the Conscience
of sinning, and they become <hi>Seared</hi>
as with an hot Iron, as the Apostle
fitly phraiseth it, that is, lockt up as
it were, or wholly captivated in
sordid Vanities and Impieties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they become cruel and violent
in all things, and work wickedness
with Greediness, and draw Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as with Cart-ropes, for they have
opened the gate of original Poysons,
the Bitter, Wrathful, Astringent
Spirits, which compose the inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Kingdom of fierceness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Devils dwell, being destitute both
of divine and eternal Light; this
evil center many men have so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
awakned, as shortly they have
by way of simile attracted the evil
Spirit, and Angels for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37544:88"/>
who do diligently wait
upon, and continually prompt them
to wickedness, and further exciting
of the hellish poysonous properties,
whence are generated Filthy Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Lying, obscene words and
Actions, and all kind of abominable
Discourses and Actions, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
horrid thoughts, and vile im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations,
frequent amongst the
multitude, so that if a mans inward
Eyes of his Soul were but opened,
he might easily see Legions of those
accursed <hi>Demons,</hi> fluttering in and
about such People, egging them on
to all evil Communication and
practices; it being a certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable
truth, that all filthy vain
thoughts words and works do arise
and proceed from the Hellish cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and do all carry the power of
their own principle with them, and
so incorporate with their Similes
whereever they are received, and
thence pass back again into their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37544:88"/>
own dark original Source, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
captivate the soul therein,
where they are recorded, and shall
stand forever as Witnesses of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
against them, if men
Live and Dye in that deplorable
state, and do not Repent, and turn
from them, by Regeneration, and
Newness of Life.</p>
               <p>Now from those infernal Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which beset us on all sides, both
inwardly, and outwardly, no man
is safe any longer then he fears the
Lord, and has his mind fixed on So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and Temperance in Meats,
and Drinks, Exercises and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications;
for nothing (as we have
already said, and cannot say too
often) does so much disarm, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
prevent and frustrate all evil
suggestions and ingections of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Angels, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
as those sublime vertues with
convenient Fasting, and continual
servent Prayers. For as our Lord
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37544:89"/>
and Saviour Christ saith, <hi>some sorts
of evil Spirits are not cast out,</hi> or
chased away, <hi>but with Fasting and
Prayer:</hi> and therefore the Kingly
Prophet saith, <hi>wherewith shall a young
man cleanse and defend himself from
evil Angels, and other Enormities, but
only by keeping thy Word, and being
obedient to thy Commandements;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
having a regard to that most
excellent saying of Christ, <hi>First seek
the Kingdom of God, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
thereof, and all other good things
shall be added,</hi> or given unto you in
due season.</p>
               <p>For as every man does govern
himself, and into what property he
suffers his soul to enter, such an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
or Spirit he allureth, be it either
good or evil, there being Spirits of
all Orders, Complexions and Natures
(for which should we think, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
world less peopled then the
Material?) which always are ready
and officious to exert their power,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37544:89"/>
as we read in the Scriptures of
Truth, The Lord said, who will
be a Lying Spirit in the mouths of
<hi>Ababs</hi> prophets, and presently steps
forth one, and said, <hi>I will;</hi> and far
be it, but we should believe that the
benign Spirits are as ready to secure
and defend mankind from evil, when
they incline to well-doing and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
as the malignant Ones are to
precipitate them into Error, Guilt
and Misery.</p>
               <p>If men did but believe those
things, and diligently observe and
weigh them, they would certainly
be much more careful in moderating
their thoughts and affections, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would many so much dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or be perpetually vexed with,
for, or about the Spirits of golden
mountains of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the Dust of
<hi>Guinea,</hi> the Rubish of <hi>Peru,</hi> which
do give great advantage to, and
powerfully attract the evil <hi>Demons,</hi>
who by many of the Antients are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37544:90"/>
thought to have some kind of rule
over, or affinity with those hidden
Mines and Treasures in the bowels
and dark Cavetns of the Earth, which
are the Idols whom most people
now adore, and over whom the evil
spirit <hi>Mammon</hi> is said to be Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident.
For whatsoever man does
violently taste, and set his mind and
affections upon, presently the evil
Spirits that are of that quality, do
present themselves, and are busie to
allure the Soul, and captivate it with
more passionate desires after it. For
this cause it proves hard, and very
difficult for men too be temperate, &amp;
to moderate their affections in any
thing wherein they have once run
out into, or contracted an habit of
Excess, so many Enemies there are
to circomvent and inveigle them on
every side, whose power is great,
but 'tis by reason of the greatness of
mans sins, which give them the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37544:90"/>
whereby they lead multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
into perdition.</p>
               <p>On the other side, the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and Spirits are as easily attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by vertue, as the Evil are by vice;
that is so say, they are delighted, and
conciliated by their own fair Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ces,
Purity, Love, Truth, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
Order, firm Belief, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Meats &amp; Drinks Innocency
and Silence; these are powerful
Loadstones or Magneticks that will
attract good Spirits and Angels,
even from the furthest parts of the
World.</p>
               <p>It is also further to be considered
that true Dreams and Nocturnal
Converse with good Angels and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
does afford great delight, and
true pleasure to the mind and soul;
the very thoughts of those secret
visits, chears and irradiates the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Faculties even in the day,
and causeth a desire and longing for
the night; and the more fixed any
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37544:91"/>
man is, and the more he lays them
up in a Reserved and Religious
Breast, with serious Thoughts and
Meditations on such sublime Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the nearer he approaches unto
their Beeings and powerfully invites
those holy and material Essences,
and so by degrees, even whilst he is
in the Body, becomes as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
with, or endenizon'd
amongst those Coelestial Quires of
blessed Angels and Spirits of the
Just made perfect, and to have their
Names Registred in the Book of
Life, as in the Revelations in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
               <p>For nothing comes so near those
glorious Beeings, or so effectually
engages them as a constant thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
temperance and sobriety,
but more especially Innocency, and
the Child like nature, which does in
the highest degree imitate the nature
Angelical, whence our Saviour
Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 10. admonishes his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37544:91"/>
Disciples, to take heed not to despise
Innocency, and the simple harmless
nature, which he calls one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the vertue and power of the divine

the fierce wrathful properties,
and as it were cut off the members
of evil, that is their thoughts,
words and works, and have as much

he saith, <hi>Their Angels do always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Face of my Father, which is in
Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But such as live in Uncleanness
and Riot, in Chambering and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness,
in Oppression and Cruelty,
are subect to the Tyranny and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of evil Angels, as execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
of the divine Vengeance,
which hence are called <hi>destroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi>
Thus two Angels came to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ym,</hi>
and having secured <hi>Lot</hi> and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37544:92"/>
his too Daughters, consumed those
wicked Cities, whose Inhabitants
burning with unnatural Lusts, were
justly destroyed with a shower of
Fire and Brinstone, the Lord by the
Angels of his vengeance raigning
down as it were Hell out of Heaven
upon them, such was his Abhorance
of their Abominations. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had provoked the Lord by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
the People, and thereby
shewing his Inclinations to boast of
the Arm of Flesh, rather than trust
in the Lord his God; It is said,
1 Chro. 21. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. God sent an Angel

and <hi>David</hi> lift up his Eyes and

between the Earth and the Heaven,
having a drawn Sword in his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:37544:92"/>
Hand, stretched out over <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
then <hi>David,</hi> and the Elders of
<hi>Israel,</hi> who were cloathed in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath,
fell upon their Faces. When

upon the strength and number
of his Army, had proudly Blesphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Lord
sent an Angel, which cut off all the

and Captains in his Camp, so
that he returned with shame into
his own Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 21.
which is also Recorded more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 37. 36. The Angel
of the Lord went forth and smote
in the Camp of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fourscore and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
and when they arose early in
the morning, behold they were all
dead Corps. In like manner, when
<hi>Herod</hi> had accepted the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Flatteries of the people, <hi>Acts</hi>
12. 23. immediately the Angel of
the Lord smote him, because he gave

of Worms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gave up the Ghost.
So the Angel that slew the first-born
of the <hi>Egypti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Wilderness. <hi>Neither mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
ye, as some of them murmured, and
were destroyed by the Destroyer,</hi> 1 Cor.
10. 10. For when men by imitation
do come near and sympathize with
the principle of the evil Angels,
they become incorporated with, or
swallowed up by their wrathful
dark, Nature; as the Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>David</hi> saith, Pfal. 78. 49. <hi>The
Lord casts upon them the fierceness of
his Anger, Indination and Wrath,</hi> that
is by the sending out, or granting
Commissions unto evil Angels, to
vex and plague them; for man by
his Out-rages, Gluttony, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness
and Oppressions, both to Man
and Beast, and killing of those of
his own kind, has opened the Gate
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37544:93"/>
of Gods fierce warthful anger, which
does powerfully attract the evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and give them oppertunities to
commit Evils without Remorse,
having a free access both by Dreams
and Visions, and other Spiritual
Communications, which do exert,
and inwardly stir up man ever, even
in the very center of his Life to
Evils, whence those numberless,
&amp; strong lewd Immaginations, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Words, &amp; ungodly Works do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
so that a rational man would
think that no thing, or Creature, that
is cloathed with the humane nature,
could be so much depraved and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
into Error and all kind of
Ungodliness. Therefore well may
the Angel of the Lord in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
cry, woe unto mankind, or
the Inhabitants of the Earth, for
the Devil is cast out of Heaven, and
is come down on the Earth in great
Wrath and Indignation, that is
into the wrathful or evil part of the

Adamical Earth, and not into the

things therein, do consist both of
Good and Evil, Light and Darkness,
Love and Hate; but into the good,
the Devil, that is, evil Angels, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
cannot enter, as being contrary
to their <hi>Vbi,</hi> or Beeing; the Light
being set in an eternal opposition to
Darkness, and <hi>Satan,</hi> and all his

of the poysonous f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where persons give themselves,
up unto Oppression, Violence, Envy,
Back-biting, Gluttony, Drunkenness,
Swearing, Lying, Lustful Frothy
Romancing Discourses, and vain
foolish Jestings, all which do arise,
and are generated from the fierce
poysonous wrath, both inward and

outward, wherein <hi>Belzebub</hi> has his
Throne, to and with the souls and
spirits of such men, the evil Angels
have free access, and a ready Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
because they are nearly ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their original principle; <hi>Ahabs</hi>
Prophets were before false and lying
Prophets, and had made a Trade
of soothing up that wicked King in
his Idolatry, with counterfeit Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Flatteries; and therefore it
was that an evil Angel was so ready
to offer himself to be a lying Spirit
in their mouthes. It was the Sin of
<hi>David</hi> that drew down the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
destroying Angel with
his Sword in his hand against <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
and when <hi>David</hi> and his
people repented of their misdeeds,
then presently the Lord commanded
the Angel to put up the Sword of
wrath; for by such their Repentance,
the principle of Indignation was
weakned; and on the contrary, the
principle of Light and Love was
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:37544:95"/>
thereby strengthened and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
which did discuse the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>particles,</hi> or cause the destroying
Angel to disappear, &amp; attracted the
presence and assistance of the good
Angels, who have their <hi>Vbi,</hi> or are
conversant in the good part of this
world, as the evil Angels are in the
dark maligne part thereof; and as
men enter either into Good or Evil,
so do they contract a familiarity
with the one or the other, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
good or bad Guardians, which
do powerfuly stir them up either to
vertue or vice.</p>
               <p>Hence we read, <hi>Gen. 48. 16.
Iacob</hi> acknowledging Gods divine
hand of providence, saith to his Son
<hi>Ioseph, The Angel which hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me from all evil bless the Children;</hi>
as also the same sacred Scripture,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. declares that the Lord
wrastled with <hi>Iacob</hi> all Night, in a
Vision or Dream by his good Angel,
and <hi>Iacob</hi>'s <hi>Spirit</hi> or Soul was in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37544:95"/>
good earnest, and strove so with the
divine power, or good Angel, that
he would not let him depart, untill
he had blessed him, which did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<hi>Iacob</hi>'s firm Faith, and inward
acquaintance with, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods goverment by Angels,
which of late Years has hardly any
being in the Heads or the Hearts, in
the Understandings or Desires of
men.</p>

               <p>VVE have before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
that during the

so that both Joy and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is essential unto it, and the Soul

evil Angels and Spirits can most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
and familiarly communicate
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37544:96"/>
with the Souls of men in sleep; for
then the Soul is near unto their <hi>Vbi,</hi>

between them; but when the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally-ports
of the Senses wide open, to let in
outward material<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Objects, the Soul
is cloathed with a dark, heavy, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
sensual vesture, which does as
it were wholly captivate and chain
this incorporeal Essence; and as
those Communications, Revelations,
Sights, or whatever else does hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to the Soul in Dreams and Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
seems as nothing to the Body
and Senses after waking (which is
one main cause so many slight
Dreams) so what is translated
through the Senses, or in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
material World is nothing to
the Soul in Dreams; but the Beggar
has as lofty Representations, as the
King, and the poor Captive as free
Enjoyments as his Judge; therefore
we should consider the vast differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37544:97"/>
between the internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
principles, and their respective
Inhabitants, and that the external
Eye can see only into its own Birth
or Original; that is, into the Things
and Light of this outward material
World, as receiving its Light from
thence, for nothing can see further
than its own principle whence it
proceeded.</p>
               <p>For this cause no mortal man can
see and communicate with Angels
and Spirits by sight, and under the
perfect Exercise of their outward
Senses; therefore when the holy
Prophets and Antients received
Visions, and the good Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Spirits Communicated their Secrets
unto them, it was alwayes in
Dreams, Extasies or Raptures; not
knowing (as the Apostle saith
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2.) whether they were in
the Body, or out of the Body; and
therefore the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> saith,
that in the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Vision before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37544:97"/>
                  <hi>he had not the strength of a
man,</hi> that is, his senses and natural
understanding, was during that time
of the Vision, weak, dead, or as it
were asleep, and did not see, nor
know any more of the mystery or
divine sight, than men do of their
common Visions of the Night, which
are as nothing to the Body and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for every Eye sees into its own
Radix, that of the Body into the
Principle of this World, as being
generated from the Light thereof,
and being it self Corporeal, sees,
apprehends and comprehends all
Corporal things; but the Eye of the
mind and soul is Incorporeal, and
therefore it can well see, apprehend
and comprehend things Incorporeal
and Spiritual, especially when it
shakes off, and as it were quits it self
of the Chains and heavy Fetters of
its earthly Tabernacle, and the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Facultites of the external palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
as comes to pass in Visions
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37544:98"/>
and Dreams; for the Soul has an
eternal and Coelestial original pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the Intelligible World,
and therefore when it is freed from
Darkness, it can well see into, and
communicate with the internal and
heavenly Spirits and Angels; But
the Senses and Body take their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
from gross palpable matter, and
therefore depend upon sublinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
consequently subject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and coruption.</p>
               <p>The Body is a dull heavy Trunk,
but the Soul is quick as Thought,
and nimble as a Beam of Light; and
therefore, when freed from the clog
of the Body and sensual Power, 'tis
capable of entertaining and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all things, be they either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
or immaterial.</p>
               <p>But here it must be noted, that it
is common for Persons in Dreams to
be presented with various Figures,
Forms, and Shapes of material things
belonging unto the Animal, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37544:98"/>
and Mineral Kingdoms, which
do signifie, or often times fore shew
or denote Prosperity, Adversity,
Health, Sickness, the Death of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or Friends; others have vocal
Calls, Voices, or Blows before Death
or Sickness; Now all this variety of
Nightly Representations or Dreams
proceed from the variety of each
mans Genius or Angel, and are true
or false, according to its Nature,
and the vertuous or vicious Lives of
the Persons.</p>
               <p>But certain it is, that many men
have certain and assured signs, or
premonitions given them of the
Death or Well-fare of absent Friends
and Relations, as also of their own;
of which were it needful, numerous
Instances might be given; and this
as it is very strange and wonderful,
so I see not which way it can come
to pass otherwise than by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the internal and superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Intelligers or Genji, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37544:99"/>
amongst the wise and sober Antients
was more frequent then of late
years, <hi>viz.</hi> when men fearing the
Lord, believed that he governed
the world by Angels, and when men
lived in Sobriety, Temperance, and
Cleanness, which doth wonderfully
prepare men for, and render them
capable of receiving true Dreams
or Oracles. For external as well
as internal Purity, and to be free
from Violence, and the defilements
of Blood, and of unclean Meats
and Drinks is most necessary; for
all who would be worthy of this
sublime Knowledge and Gift of true
Dreams, must keep a pure undistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
and undisquieted Spirit and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
&amp; friendly compose the
same; for an unclouded Spirit is like
a clear Glass, or calm limpid spring
of water, wherein you may behold
the true Images of things, but if the
same be troubled, stirred or agitated,
then you perceive nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37544:99"/>
Figures; so the Spirit being
discomposed apprehends nothing as
it ought to do, but as long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erene and tranquil, it lets in
the true Lights of distinguishing &amp;
understanding, and presents the real
Figures and Notions of things to
such as are of a sound and healthy
Body &amp; Mind, not dulled with Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
nor made sad by Anger,
nor provoked to Bitterness and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
by Covetousness; but when at
peace with God, and all its innocent
Creation, you quietly go to Bed, and
fall a sleep, then the Soul being loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from hurtful thoughts, and freed
from the heavy body, and sensual
Spirits, does freely Communicate
with divine Angels and Spirits, and
far more certainly, clearly and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
behold and enjoy wonderful
things; and oftimes is then instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, and taught many abstruce
Secrets and Mystries; for the good
Spirits being diffusive and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:37544:100"/>
do invite the Soul to their
Society by the opportunity of the
Sleep of the Body &amp; Sences, and the
nocturnal solitariness, nor will they
be wanting to such when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
if they shall square and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
their Lives and Actions by
the measures of wisdom, and rules
of Piety.</p>
               <p>On the Contrary such whose Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies
and Spirits are dull, and as it
were unpolished, and who languish
under distemperatures of mind, and

and degenerated from their

and Violence; But the Inhabitants
of the infernal World have the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest

secret sympathitical Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
suggest and dart into the Soul
many Lying Fantasies and Mischevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dreams, and teach them sundry
vile pranks and evils.</p>
               <p>For there is as great a variety of
Spiritual Creatures and Beeings,
good and evil, clean and unclean
Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> respectively in the two
grand Fountains or Principles of
good and evil, as there are material
Inhabitants in this internal or visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  </gap>ngs) for all this wonderful variety
of the Animal, Vegetative and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Kingdoms, are but a Figure
and Similitude of what is in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Spiritual World, whence all
those proceeded; and the internal
Spirit and Power is still the true
cause of all motion, growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and Life in all Creatures and
things contained in the said three
Kingdoms, and no internal Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
Power, Spirit, Angel, or
Genius, whatever can affect us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than as we draw near them in
Spirit, and so by degrees awaken
their predominant property or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
by which they have power to
influence us either in good or evil.
But for the most part, it happens in
the Evil, because most men live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dominion of the evil princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and properties of Nature. For
a man hath both inward &amp; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tward
helps in whatsoever he inclines to,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37544:101"/>
more especially if his propensions &amp;
desires be fixed and strong; his inward
helps towards vertue are the good
Angels and Spirits, who readily
meet, embrace and rejoyce at the
drawing near of men to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
whence it is said, that there
is Joy in Heaven at the Conversion
of a Sinner; and to encourage them
in well-doing, they by almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible
wayes afford them assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
and reveal many wonderful
secrets to them, both by day and
nightly Visions; and his outward
Helps are innocent Living, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Cleanness in Meats,
Drinks, Exercises and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with good sober men; and
those latter helps being practised to
conciliate, and promote the former.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, men evilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
have also two Spurs to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
viz. <hi>inwardly</hi> by the sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of bad <hi>Doemons,</hi> whose work
it is to prompt men to viciousness;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37544:102"/>
and <hi>outwardly</hi> by Covetousness, Pride,
Drunkneness, Vain-Glory, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Intemperance, evil Words,
Works and Communications with
evil men</p>
               <p>Likewise, as every man is endued
Radically with the two grand Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
or Principles of good and evil,
which every one in the World is
more or less sensible of by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
operations, and that continual
Strife, and as it were open wars
there is between them in the Centre
of his Soul, so every man thence
comes to have two Genij or Spirits,
that alwayes wait upon, and attend
him, <hi>viz.</hi> one good, which answers
to the good friendly principle of
Light and Love; The o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her evil,
refering to the fierce, wrathful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
which two do continually
and fiercely contend for Victory,
and oft-times cause great trouble &amp;
perplexity in the Soul; but when
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> good overcomes, then there is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37544:102"/>
Joy, Concord and Pleasure, or an
intire Satisfaction of Mind.</p>
               <p>It is further to be noted, that
there are great numbers of Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirits, which are of a middle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
some of which do dart and
gleam into some persons whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
are not exalted above
their Principles or Elements; These
only busie themselves in foolish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckey
ridiculous prankes, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of pretty mischiefs; whereby
they often promote idle jesting, vain
laughter, wanton love stories, and
the like; but they generally attend
those people that have poor, low,
beggerly genius, whose understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are very little elevated above
Bruits; for this Infantry of Spirits,
or lower graduated Spectrums have
no communication either with men
of vertue or prudence, nor yet with
those that are Exalted in the highest
degrees of evil; for these Lemures,
or Terrestrial or Watery Spirits are
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:37544:103"/>
as they chiefly inhabit woods Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
or unfrequented Valleys, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and Lakes, so they come nearer
to the nature of some sorts of Beasts
then of man, unless of such men only
who have base low beastial complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for with such they have a simile
of this sort. The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> seems
to speak, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 21. where he
mentions <hi>Ziim</hi> and <hi>Ob</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the <hi>Satyrs</hi> which should dance in the
ruins of <hi>Babilon,</hi> they are unclean
sorts of inferiour Spirits, and their
conversation does ill become the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Race of Mankind.</p>
               <p>But for the good Superiour An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
their converse is very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
and therefore ought by all
lawful means to be courted, and
conciliated, and the discoveries made
by them to be highly regarded, and
concealed, for its a great and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
error for People to tell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
their Dream, and the secret
communication of their Souls with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37544:103"/>
Angels and good Genij, and so
highly to prostitute them to every

they were of no worth or value, this
is very common amongst most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but it is a greater evil then most

                  </gap>e they have been sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, but found them as hard to be

when by evil courses, and sin he had

in vain with tears, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more offends the good Angels,
then mens light behaviour, and vain
talking of them, as on the other
side, nothing doth more please and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37544:104"/>
allure them, then for men to look
up their secrets in religious and
thoughtful Brests, and to abscond
them from the vulger and profain, as
we read in <hi>Ezra,</hi> Thou shalt deliver
these books that contain the secret
Law of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> unto the wise
men of thy people, whose hearts thou
knowest can comprehend them, and
keep these secrets; Therefore it
was usual amongst the Philosophical
Ancients to hide their great secrets,
and vail holy mysteries in abscure
Characters and Hieroglyphicks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they should not be known to
and profaned by the wicked. So
we read of <hi>Theodorus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the Tragick
Poet, when he would have referred
something of the mysteries of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Scriptures to a certain fable, he
was depraved of his sight. Tis also
reported of <hi>Theopompus,</hi> when he
began to translate something of the
divine Law into the Greek tongue,
he was smitten with a kind of Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37544:104"/>
or extraordinary trouble of mind,
and desired of God to make him sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
wherefore that calamity was
fallen upon him, received an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in a Dream, that it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had basely polluted Divine
things, by setting them forth in
publick.</p>
               <p>Our Lord Christ himself, whilest
he lived in the humane Nature,
spake after that manner and fashion,
that only the more intimate Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
should understand the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Word of God; but to
others he spake onely in Parables;
he also commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>that holy things
should not be given to Dogs, nor Pearls
cast before Swine;</hi> Therefore, saith
the Prophet, <hi>I have hid thy Word,
in my Heart, that I might not sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Thee.</hi> And <hi>Mary,</hi> the blessed
amongst women, when the Angel
Saluted her, and told her what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things should happen unto
her, it is said, that she laid up the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37544:105"/>
sayings in her heart, and pondered
them in her religious mind; which
reverence, and serious meditation
on these wonderful things, which
the Angel communicated unto her,
was well pleasing to the blessed Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
whence every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

God, and his great Divine Law in

to follow a pious Soul after death,

them, and endeavors to do them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,

wholely ceased; the Reasons why the

               <p>BUT notwithstanding all those
numerous instances we have
produced from sacred Scripture, of
the frequent Apparitions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
of good Spirits &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in Dreams and Visions, to pious
and holy men in times past, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
and admonishing them,
and revealing divine mysteries unto
them; the same will be of little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
or incouragement to us, if
that vulgar opinion be true, that
although they were so usual and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in former Ages, yet now they
are wholely ceased, and no such
spiritual assistances or converse to be
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:37544:109"/>
expected; but as this opinion is not
founded on holy Scripture, so there
are divers reasons which sway with
me not to imbrace the same; its
true, the Text saith, That if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
from Heaven shall preach any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctrine, that is contrary, or
derogatory unto the Gospel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, he ought to be rejected
and accursed; for thereby it would
plainly appear, that he was an evil
Angel, since God in any of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations
is never contrary unto
himself; yet this hinders not but
good Spirits may afford us good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and give us notice of impending
Dangers, and defend us from the
assaults and incurrances of evil Doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and be the Ministers of God,
whereby he may be pleased to make
more clearer revelations of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
to those that fear him; for the
blessed Creator is the same as ever he
was, and as near unto mankind as
he was in former Ages, whence the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:37544:110"/>
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the divine Word,
or holy Principle of Gods eternal
Light and Love is near thee, in thy
Mouth, and in the Center of thy
Heart; and therefore whatsoever
was by divine appointment or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of this nature, common to
the Prophets and holy men in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages, its reasonable to believe
that the same should not only be
continued in these later times, but
increased, and far more illustrated
since the great work of redemption
and divine manifestation in the flesh,
who was welcomed unto the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature by the holy Quires of
Angles.</p>
               <p>Its under this Gospel dispensation
that the holy Prophets have foretold
should be far more glorious irradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and discoveries of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
that all should be taught of
God. That their Sons and their
Daughters should Prophecy, their
young Men see Visions, and their old
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:37544:110"/>
Men dream Dreams. The current
of the Scripture bears Testimony
to a greater Light to break forth in
the latter dayes, wherein the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Lord shall cover the
Earth, as the Water cover the Sea;
and why then should we abridg or
reject any of those ways wherein
God hath formerly vouchsafed most
usually to discover his will in the
mysteries of his Kingdom to the
Sons of men.</p>
               <p>The good Spirits are inflamed
with the same Zeal for spreading
the Glory of their Creator <hi>now,</hi> as
in former times; they have still the
same ardent Charity and Good-will
towards men that persue and seek
after Vertue and Piety, as <hi>heretofore;</hi>
and <hi>we</hi> have as much need of their
aid and assistance, as any of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients;</hi>
why then should we think
all entercourse out off between us
and those blessed Spirits? why should
we with a stupid neglect lose the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:37544:111"/>
benefit of such powerful Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
That evil Angels are dayly
contriving our temporal and eternal
ruin, that they do by various ways
and means cast stumbling blocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us in the Paths of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
endeavour to seduce us by multitudes
of temptations, is generally agreed
by all professors of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and if so, I desire to know
why we should not believe the good
Angels to be as diligent to protect
or instruct us, as ready to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us in well doing, as the other
are busie to circumvent and debauch
us, and prompt us on to sin, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and misery.</p>
               <p>Its evident the ever blessed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
has since the woful fall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
of mankind, readily
heard the prayers of those that in
sincerity have called upon his Name,
and live in obedience to his holy
Law, and that he hath in various
manners appeared to them in Visions
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37544:111"/>
Calls, Voyces, Dreams, and the
like; which was continued and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
in an extraordinary manner
after the great Light appeared, <hi>viz.</hi>
Christ Jesus cloathed with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, as appears by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scriptures before
mentioned, and if the same be now
discontinued (as some people would
have us believe) of which, as there is
no mention in Scripture, so 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Principles of God in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to suppose any such Chasm or
interruption of communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
superiours and inferiours, in
the state of created beeings; and
beside what a miserable and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
state must man then now be in;
for amongst the Ancients, if the
Spirits of the Lord did withdraw,
and cease from communicating, and
manifesting the secrets of the great
Creator, by some of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wayes, they looked on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a sad and deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37544:112"/>
as we may see in the case of
<hi>Saul</hi> and others? Whereas now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to these opinions we are not
only debarred of all those celestial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviens
and communications, but
also exposed to all the rage and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of evil Spirits, without any
assistance from the good Angels,
which our Fore-fathers so plentifully
enjoyed.</p>
               <p>But the Truth is, if we by vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
lives prepare and fit our selves
for the converse of holy Angels, we
have no more reason to dispair of
their aid, for the Lord doth never
with-draw his holy Spirit from man,
except man do first by sin and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
separate himself from his
Maker; but on the contrary the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Principle of love doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
strive with man against the evil,
as our Saviour said, <hi>I would have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
you, even as a Hen gathereth her

that which was lost.</hi> And elsewhere
the Scripture saith, <hi>As many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

became the sons of God, or of Light;</hi>
and the great Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who
was illuminated by divine Vision
saith, Whatsoever may, or can,

were so frequent before our Saviours

that this most illustrious Light
should put a total stop to all those

reason or occasion why Visions,
useful Dreams, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of good Angels are ceased to
many nominal Christians, is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity

living in the Power of that pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

as into its Mother, where there is
neither <hi>Place</hi> nor <hi>Time,</hi> but near

               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:37544:118"/>
For the Soul in <hi>Dreams,</hi> when the
Body and sensual Powers of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
elemental grosness are <hi>asleep,</hi>
or <hi>dead</hi> (which is all one during
the sleep of the Body) is as it were
already in Eternity, and swims in
the great Depth, or <hi>Abysses,</hi> and
sees with an eternal Eye or Sight
in the same measure like its Creator,
whence it had its birth, and whose
Image it beareth.</p>
               <p>For this cause the Soul is busied
in Dreams and Visions, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
not only really actuated,
but present, as if they were already
done, or at the same time accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
for all things, whether past,
present or to come, appear present to
the Great Eye of the Eternal beeing,
and the same (in proportion) is to be
understood of the Soul in its separate
state; that is to say, dead, asleep, or
loosed from the chains and dark
clouds of the body and sences, of
outward composition, for the Lord,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:37544:118"/>
sees and knows all things; for unto
him, there is neither time nor place,
night nor day, but all is essencially
present; for things in Eternity goes
not on bydegrees, or by progressions,
as they do in time; the like is in its
kind to be understood of the Soul
in Dreams when it swims out of
the grosse sleepy Body, more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
after Death, in which state all
the mystries of that Principle into
which the Soul had entered and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morsed
its self in the time of its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
with the Body, whether
Good or Evil, and also all its works
do follow, attend and are present,
naked and bare unto each Soul;
hence the Scripture saith, Blessed are
those that dye, &amp; are Comprehended
in Gods Love, for their works follow
them, that is, are Essensually present
with them, as their Figures and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
are in Dreams, so the
same divine Scripture saith of Christ,
that he was a Lamb slain from the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:37544:119"/>
Foundation of the World; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the same was not accomplished
according to time in some thousands
of years after.</p>
               <p>And as in Eternity all things and
time are present, so it thence follows
that it comprehends all times, and is
not capable of being measured or
divided, much less comprehended;
so the Soul of man being inspirited
by the eternal divine Principle of
Love and Light, and thereby ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of having its Conversation in
Heaven, and taking its Flight into
Eternity, for every thing is capable to
reascend as high as its first Fountain
whence it first descended; in which
state it is capacitated, according to its
Gifts to see things either actually
past and Transacted, or as yet to
come, and to be Transacted in time,
both as still or already actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
for so they all stand in Eternity,
there being no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yesterday, nor to
Morrow, but tis always the same

Yesterday, to Day, and for Ever,
there being in him no Turning, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
nor Shadow of Change.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Moses</hi> saw the Transactions
of the Creation, the Fall of man,
the Flood, and all those several
Actions done in the World to his
own time, as we may find it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
to us in his Five Books.
2 <hi>Esdras</hi> Chap. 14. 21, to the end;
<hi>Esdras,</hi> Likewise by the Spirit of
the most high, dictated to his Scribs
the lost Bible, for it is said in the 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
verse, <hi>They wrote the wonderful Visions
of the Night; as for me</hi> (saith <hi>Esdras)
I spake in the Day, and in the Night I
held not my Tongue</hi> v. 43.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> having a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Vision declared to him, was
ordered to set up a watchman, and
he to declare what he saw, Chap. 21.
and amongst other things he saw a
Chariot, with a couple of Horsmen,
and he answered and said, <hi>Babylon</hi> is
<hi>Fallen</hi> is <hi>Fallen.</hi>

               <p>

against <hi>Babylon,</hi> and saith, <hi>Babylon
is suddenly Fallen;</hi> as if her Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Isaiah,</hi> after the same manner
spake of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the present Tense,
<hi>Chap, 44. v. 29. Cyrus</hi> he is my

saith the Lord to his Anointed, to

altho the fall thereof was seen
and represented as already done in

Vision, which is about sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

fit to observe, from that which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, from his own experience
may find True, that Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things in Dreams are alwayes
actually present, not past, or future,
whereof the judicious Reader may
from these hints I have given, deduce
several notable Remarkes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But here 'tis probable, some may
be apt to inquire,</hi> If there be so much
in Dreams as you seem to teach, and that
some Dreams, are so useful and instuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
above others: Can you show us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
method box we should procure such sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:37544:121"/>
Dreams and retain them, and
come to understand their true signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations?</p>
               <p>I answer, those Inquirers do it out
of pride, vanity or curiosity, desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dreams, and the understanding
thereof, that they may vapour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and seem some-body in the
World, or to get money thereby,
and the like devilish intentions;
then neither I, nor any man else
can possibly contribute any thing to
the satisfaction of their desires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they act in a contrary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and these mysteries are Sealed
up from them, and all that are of
their Spirit; but to the Meek and
the Humble, who drives on no foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
design, but the glory of God in
the first place, their own and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Happiness, so far only as it may
be subservent to that, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a few considerations, which
may somewhat tend to their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:37544:121"/>
Since True or Prophetical
Dreams are a kind of Revelation of
a divine power, unto the Soul, and
that this sublime state of the
minde, is much advanced or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
by Temperance or Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
Vertue or Vice, it follows
that the first step to all true wisdom
is the fear of the Lord, which teaches
all men Sobriety, Temperance and
Cleanness; therefore all such as are
desirous to arrive at that supream
state of the Soul, and to be rendered
capable of the Communications of
Good Angels and Spirits, and to
receive true and profitable Dreams,
ought to be Chastly and Devoutly
disposed, and in an especial manner
to observe Cleanness in Meats and
Drinks, and not to over-charge Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with to great a quantity; for
such surplussage does strangely dull
and becloud all the intellectual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of nature, so that the Soul, can
neither Communicate with good
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37544:122"/>
Angels, or separated Spirits, nor
of herself see or penetrate into any
Celestial thing.</p>
               <p>But Wisdom which is derived
from, and joyned to Sobriety, Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Temperance, in that
which rightly fitteth and disposeth
both the Body and Soul, and Spirit,
and advances them to a divine puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for Abstinence and cleanness in
Meats, Drinks, Imployments and
Communications, have a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
power to fortifie all the Observers
thereof against all sorts of Vices
and Temptations of the Devil, who
continually goeth about seeking
whom he may invegle to Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Gluttony, Lying, Coveteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Pride, and the like, to all which
enormities, Excesses opens the Doors
and Windows, and so it is easie for
him to enter, finding abundance of
prepared matter for his Suggestions
and Temptations, to work upon,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:37544:122"/>
whereby many Thousands of Poor
Souls are destroyed.</p>
               <p>The contrary is to be Understood
of good Angels and Spirit, who by
Temperance, Chastity and Purity,
are drawn and conciliated to our
Assistance; therefore let all that
would have their Souls and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
adopted for such divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
keep their Bodies and Spirits
pure and unincumbered, and not
overwhelmed in the commerce and
affairs of this World, and the flesh;
to which purpose nothing does more
contribute then a strict observation
of the rules of Temperance, both in
quality and quantity, words and
works; avoiding all irregular
Passions, Violence and Oppression,
both of men and beasts, and to
bound their desires to the necessities
of nature; for the things that polute
and encumber mens Souls, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
their Bodies, are not needful;
our ever Blessed Creator having in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37544:123"/>
his infinite mercy given us all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things in abundance, which
are also neer us, and easily attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but those that are not needful,
nor of use to us, are hard to come at;
and mens so eager pursuit after
them, do but shew and manifest his
depravation and fall from his first
innocent Estate; for the more things
man fancies himself to need, the
more is his <hi>Turba;</hi> that is, the more
strongly he awakens the wrathful
powers of his Soul, or first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and the less he needeth, the
more like he becomes to his Creator,
who giveth all things, and receiveth
nothing.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain mans soul is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
breathed out of the grand
Mystery, or Abyssal Fountain, or
Eye outof the All-seeing; a Ray of
the eternal Sun, and therefore when
it becomes purified through Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Sobriety, Temperance, and
the Fear of the Lord, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:37544:123"/>
them all; that is, when sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the gross fumes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of the Flesh; then is it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ascending, receiving and
communicating with good Angels
and Spirits, and attaining unto won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things in a moment; even as
<hi>David</hi> was of a Shepherd made a
Prophet, and expert in divine things;
or as <hi>Soloman,</hi> in the dream of one
night, was filled with the knowledg
of all things in the Created World;
so <hi>Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
holy Prophets and Apostles
were taught; and the truth is, the
Soul when purified and united by
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to its divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
can without long tedious studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or seeking, without the toil of
Logical demonstration, or perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Syllogisms and Problems see
into, and apprehend, as far as is
convenient, all divine and natural
mysteries; nor is there any thing
that does more contribute to the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37544:124"/>
good Complexion and Tranquility,
both of body and mind, then these
abstaining vertues, which we have
always celebrated, but can never two
much recommend.</p>
               <p>But besides, clean innocent Meats
and Drinks, such as may extenuate
all superfluous matter, and prevent
Crudities, there ought to be observed
a due natural <hi>Fasting,</hi> for that not a
little conduces to the making of the
intellect sound and vigorous, and
mostly preserves the Spirit from clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
thickness and suffocation, as all
the holy Seers and sage Phylosophers
of old have observed, who keeping
an abstemious and sober Table, did
protract there lives in all sobriety &amp;
temperance, whereby they preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Generation of all superfluous
matters, that might dull the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie;
for none can obtain the high

the divine and holy mysteries of
God, and live in his innocent Law,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37544:124"/>
but only such as do by abstinency
prudently moderate every extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
motion, of the Mind and
Body.</p>
               <p>Hence some of the wise Antients
would not admit any into their
society, but such as were abstinent
from strong drink, flesh, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Vices; saying, <hi>That none could
know themselves, or their Creator, but
such as do fervently and constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to imitate him by a divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and that the cleanness and
purity of a mind devoted to God, does
make such a mans Soul a perpetual
Temple for the divine Majesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is also highly requisit, for such
as would be capable of this excellent
Gift of true Dreams, to withdraw
from the multitude, and from the
variety of the gross outward Sences,
Affections, Imaginations, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Passions, which are the
torturing Distempers, and Sicknesses
of peoples minds; for the simple
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:37544:125"/>
Truth cannot be understood nor
witnessed, except a man first live
in the opperation and practice of
the divine power and innocent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Gods Love and Light prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
these sublime Gifts and noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal
Communications are to joyn
unto Abstinency, Sobriety and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude;
for by <hi>Lonesomeness, Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Silence,</hi> the mind is made
fine, and as it were loosened from
the cords &amp; perturbations of worldly
affairs, and is thereby the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and the more at leisure to
receive the spiritual Gifts, and free
Communications of the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of God. So <hi>Moses</hi> the Law-Giver,
and grand Prophet abstracted
himself (after he was learned in all
the knowledge (or Phylosophy) of
the Egyptians) from the voluptuous
charms of <hi>Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hurry of the World, and went into
the vast Wilderness of <hi>Midian,</hi> or
<hi>Ethiopia,</hi> when, keeping of Sheep,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:37544:125"/>
(an emblem both of innocency, and
of his further conduct of the people
of God) he applyed himself to the
sole contemplation of divine things,
which pleased the Lord so well, that
he suffered him to see him, as it
were, Face to Face, and endued
him with a wonderful power of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as the Scriptures of Truth
do testifie. Many other wise men
and Phylosophers have by Solitude
and Abstinency obtained many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
gifts, &amp; the true knowledge of
divine and natural things. We ought
also avoid the haunt or scrutiny af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all such kind of curious abstruse

               <p>
                  <hi>Charity</hi> is absolutly necessary to a

<hi>giving of Almes</hi> (which is but <hi>one,</hi>

Angels by dreams, or any other
ways, ought above all things to keep
silent, and constantly conceal and
lock up such sublime secrets in their
religious Breasts; for nothing drives
away, and offend the divine Powers
&amp; good Angel Guardians more then
to publish mysteries to the profane
multitude; for this cause our Saviour
Christ, when he lived on Earth, spoke
after such a manner and fashion, that
only the more intimate Disciples
should understand the Word of
God; but the multitude should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive the parable; he likewise,
on the same ground, commanded
that holy things should not be given
to Dogs, nor Pearls be cast before
Swine; therefore well saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>I have hid thy Word in my heart
that I might not sin against thee,</hi> and
it is said of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of
Christ, that after the Angel had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
her that she had found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in the sight of the Lord, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:37544:127"/>
should bring forth the Saviour of the
World, she laid all these things up in
her heart, and she did not divulge
what was discovered to her by the
Angel.</p>
               <p>The thrice Great Hermise, or
Mercury of <hi>Egypt</hi> avers, that to
publish, to the knowledge of the
Rabble, a Speech, filled with the
Mysteries and Majesty of the Deity,
is a sign of a irriligious Spirit; and
<hi>Plato</hi> Commandeth, <hi>that holy Secrets,
and Religious things should not be
divulged to the Common People. Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorus</hi>
injoyned his Followers to a
<hi>Religious silence,</hi> for so many years.
<hi>Orpheus</hi> also did, with a certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Religion, exact an Oath
of silence from those whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiated
in holy Rites; and in <hi>Esdras</hi>
we read this precept concerning the
Cabalistical Secrets of the <hi>Hebrews,
Thou shalt deliver these Books to the

the Antient <hi>Egyptiaens</hi> had certain
Characters for their secrets and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
which might not be easily
known to the vulger, and these are
therefore called <hi>Hieroglyphicks;</hi> and
<hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, that <hi>the promise of
silence is</hi> due to Religion, so we
Read of a certain Greek Tragedian,
that when he would have Transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
somewhat out of the Jews Laws,
to supply one of his Fables with;
was struck Blind. And <hi>Theopompus,</hi>
who beginning to Translate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
out of the divine Law, into the
Greek, Tongue, was presently
troubled in mind, and afterwards
earnestly desiring God to let him
know the occasion of that Judgment,
received answer in a Dream, that it
was because he had poluted divine
things by Setting them forth in
publick.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Indian</hi> Brachmans, the
<hi>Persians Magi;</hi> the British Druids,
the <hi>Greek</hi> Phylosophers, <hi>Pythagoras,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:37544:128"/>
Socrates, Plato,</hi> &amp;c, always were
nice and diligent in keeping secrets
to themselves and their qualified
Sectatores, and never to discover
Mysteries without a vail. Certain
it is that as in Heaven there is an
everlasting Stilness, and sweet Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
so all heavenly wisdom is
strengthened by Silence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
but publication and discord,
distroys good Effects, and drives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
holy powers from us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such as would reap Fruit, by
what we have before taught; must
hide, and lay up those secrets in
their religious breasts; for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Fools, and incredulity, are
the two grand hinderances, that
disturb and obstruct the good effects
in every thing, that tends towards
the Illumination of mans Soul; for
those sublime vertues require in a
man a wonderful dignification, self-denial,
and that we should leave

               <p>Let us therefore remove all Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
possible, and wholy apply
our selves to Contemplation, and
innocency of Life; that is, doing
unto the whole Creation, as we
would be done unto, and turn our
Eyes inwards, for there is, even in
our own selves the apprehension of
all things, but most men are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by Self-conceit, prejudices of
Education, Custom, vain Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and the like, from enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the benefit of this in-born Light,
so as few enjoy those Heavenly Gifts;
for Opinions, Customs and Passions
do continually oppose us, even from
our birth; but if those vain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,

immoderate Affections,
violent Desires after what is not

furnishing and fitting a mans
Soul for the fore-mentioned subline
converse, and also for the abtaining
the Knowledge and Conversation
of the Good Genius, before treated
of, let these following Rules be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
               <p>1st, Let your Meats and Drinks
be Clean, and of a simple Nature
and Operation.</p>
               <p>2d, Have a care the quantity be
not too great.</p>
               <p>3d, Remember to let your quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be sutable, and agreable to your
Nature and Constitution.</p>
               <p>4th, Let none of your food be
attended with the dying Groans of
of the innocent Creatures</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:37544:130"/>
5th, Consider the first state of
man, and what Foods were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for him, <hi>viz,</hi> none but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Herbs, Seeds, Fruits and
Grains.</p>

from what Principle
Killing and Eating of Flesh did first
arise, and do proceed.</p>
               <p>7th, Consider also the Nature,
Shapes and Forms, of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that by Nature incline to eat
Flesh.</p>
               <p>8th, Note that all the Wilde Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
of the Desart, in whom
the Principle of the fierce Wrath
does predominant, are formed, by
the same Principle which the fierce
Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:37544:130"/>
has the dominion in the Center of
their Lives.</p>
               <p>9th, Consider further, <hi>Man</hi> the
finest and most innocent and noble
of all others, and Governor of the
whole Terrestial Orb; view and
mark well his Form, Shape and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Symmetry, how Curiously,
and yet withal how innocently he
is made, and particularly, that his
all wise Creator has not furnished
him with any Weapons of Violence;
so that he is thereby rendered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
uncapable of tearing Flesh off
his Fellow Creatures; and if he
were not, by the seeking out of
many Inventions, faln from his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Furnisht by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

with the Weapons of <hi>Mars,</hi> he
would scarce be able to kill, and feed
upon the inferiour Graduates of the
Creation, who are his equals in all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> outward Elements, for would
it not be hard for a man of kill a
Cow, an Hog, or a Sheep and Tear
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:37544:131"/>
it to pieces, and eat it as Dogs and
Wolves do, but what the fierce savage
Creatures can do with the Wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Weapon of nature, that most
men do by invention, and the helps
of the dark fiery Art, whereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as many humane lives have
been destroyed, as by the common
course of nature, or diseases.</p>
               <p>Therefore, upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
such as would have the free un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed
converse of Good Angels
and Spirits, and the advantage of
real Dreams, let them endeavour,
and with equal constancy and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
pursue after purity, both of
mind and body, to avoid all excess
of food or drinks, either in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or quality, to eschew things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from violence, and therefore to
be considerate in eating of Flesh or
Fish, or any thing, not procurable
but by the death of some of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Creatures; rather let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves with the Delicacies
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:37544:131"/>
of the Vegetables, which are full as
nourishing, much more wholsome,
and indisputablely innocent; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
avoiding all Gluttony and
intoxicating Liquors, as strong
Drink, Brandy-wine, and the like;
and fumes, as those of Tobacca, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,
and the like Poysons; let
them make little or light Suppers;
viz. of Bread and Water, Bread and
Raisins, or the like; for the fewer
the Body is from supperfluities, and
the Head from vapours, and the
mind from perturbations; the brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
are the natural Spirits, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and consequently, the Soul has
a clearer Light, and is more near the
divine Power by Affinity, and more
susceptible of their influences, and
communications; but above all, let
them at their going to Bed, divest
themselves of all worldly Cares, as
well as of their Cloathes, and with
an ardent Faith, and intire Charity,
commend themselves to God the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:37544:132"/>
Giver of every Good and Perfect
Gift, and the Revealer as well as
Auther of all divine Secrets; and
then, if it be convenient for thee,
doubt not but thou shalt have such
Discoveries as thou art capable of.</p>

APPENDIX
Shewing
The Cause of Madness;
AND
Several Observables
relating thereunto.</head>
            <p>§. 1. THere being an Affinity
or Analogy between
<hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Madness,</hi> so
that the understanding of one will
somewhat illustrate the other; for
Madness seems to be a <hi>Watching</hi> or
<hi>Waking Dream;</hi> I have therefore
thought it might not be unfit to
subjoyn here certain Considerations
touching <hi>Phrensie</hi> and <hi>Distraction,</hi> its
Causes, Nature and Effects; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:37544:133"/>
because the same has very
barrenly been handled, as far as I can
learn, by those that have undertaken
to treat thereof.</p>
            <p>I shall not insist upon the several
sorts reckoned up by Authors, as
<hi>Phrensie</hi> which they define to be <hi>An
Inflamation of the Brain, and its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
with a continual raving, and
sharp constant Feaver, caused by
cholerick Blood, to which is joyned
also excrementious Choler: <hi>Mania,</hi>
or <hi>Madness,</hi> which is a loss of the
wits, <hi>with raging and fury, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Feaver, being a cold and dry Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper,</hi>
which they say, <hi>arises from
adust, or burnt-black Choler;</hi> And
<hi>Melancholy,</hi> which is a <hi>doting,</hi> or
<hi>Delirium, without a Feaver</hi> (and so
different from a Phrensie) but <hi>with
fear and sadness</hi> (whereby it differs
from madness which is accompanied
with boldness and Fury.)</p>
            <p>As all those, and others, varying
in Symptoms, are but several <hi>Species</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:37544:133"/>
of <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>raction,</hi> so though <hi>Galen</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
constituted four <hi>Humors</hi> in the
Body, &amp; laid it down for a Principle,
that from the excess of some, or one
of them, all Diseases do proceed,
and consequently, was bound to
assign these as causes for such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers;
yet more <hi>narrow Searchers</hi>
into the <hi>Mysteries of Nature,</hi> have
long since discarded that Doctrine,
which seems to consist meerly in
<hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> rather then <hi>Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
and do conclude that most
Diseases arise, either from Irregular
passions of the mind, or poysonous
ferments, occasioned by ill Dyet,
or inproper <hi>Physick</hi> in the Body.</p>
            <p>§. 2. The truth is, <hi>Madness</hi> and
<hi>Phrensie</hi> do generally, and for the
most part (for some other few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
causes we shall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of by and by) arise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from various Passions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Inclinations, as <hi>Love, Hate,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:37544:134"/>
Grief, Covetousness, Dispair,</hi> and the
like, which do too violently awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
or stir up the <hi>Central Fires,</hi> or
<hi>four first Forms</hi> of the original of
Nature, which thereupon do break,
forth, violate and destroy the <hi>five
inward Senses of the Soul,</hi> whence
the outward Senses do arise; So that
the Soul loseth its distinguishing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and then the <hi>Imaginative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi>
and <hi>Soul's Power</hi> becomes ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,
unbounded, or as it were
without a Guide, and consequently
such a Soul is unchain'd, or set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
from the dark Confinements
of the grosser <hi>Senses</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> even
as men in Dreams; for whatsoever
in this state, is represented unto the
Soul by the uncontrolable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
Imagination, is essential un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, whether it be good or evil.</p>
            <p>For it is evident that in Madness
persons are not deprived of their
grosser Senses of the outward Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
As Seeing, Hearing, Tasting,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:37544:134"/>
Smelling and Feeling, for those
they retain as well as before, but
they are bereft of the <hi>inward Senses,</hi>
or distinguishments; and whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this happeneth to any, then the
Soul is unclothed, and all its Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies
and Imaginations become as it
were substantial unto them, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
things are to those that are in
their prefect Senses, and under the
Goverment, of Reason.</p>
            <p>§. 3. For when any shall forsake,
and slight the counsel of the <hi>voice of
Wisdom,</hi> and suffer their wills and
desires too violently to entertain, and
enter into any of the fore-mentioned
passions, then presently the <hi>Saturnine</hi>
and <hi>Martial</hi> Poysonous Fires are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened,
whence does arise such an
Hurley-burley, Confusion, Strife and
In-equality between the properties
in the <hi>Seven-fold W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eel of Nature,</hi> as
will in a moments time subvert the
government of the inward Senses and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:37544:135"/>
Spirit of Wisdom, and puts Reason
under Hatches, and all its Faculties
into a Tempest and Confusion; so
that the Soul is left either without
<hi>Pilot</hi> or <hi>Rudder</hi> in this outward sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
World. And being thus depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of its true Senses, and friendly
Guide, or Moderator, viz. <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
implanted Light,</hi> then the first
Forms of the Original nature muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and make War one upon the
other, a sullen wrathful property
being exasperated, powerfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and endeavours to compass all
with a certain <hi>in-drawing Power,</hi> and
this is called the <hi>first Form,</hi> or <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
Property,</hi> which gives a Body,
or Covering to all Spirits, according
to the nature of each Thing or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The second Form is called <hi>Mars,</hi>
viz. The high lofty out-going, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
fierce fiery Property, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure to be much holden, or
captivated by the attractions and
in-drawing Property of <hi>Saturn,</hi>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:37544:135"/>
whence does arise in the Soul a most
terrible Contest, and annoying Heat;
for the <hi>Saturnine Property</hi> does most
powerfully draw <hi>inward,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to encompass and captivate
all; but this the fierce high lofty
property and martial bitter Fire
cannot endure, it being contrary
to its Nature; so that in this
intestine Civil War or Agonous,
State, there is a terrible dark brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stony
or sulpherous fire generated,
which does so disturb all the inward
parts, as if Nature were all on Fire,
even in the Center. The Heart
akes, the inward Body seems to
swell, and becomes too little for the
Soul, which in this Combustion is
so terribly afflicted, that it will no
longer be confined to the Body and
outward Senses, but ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Reins of Government, and lets <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>

off Bit and Bridle, and thrown his
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:37544:136"/>
Rider, ramble confusedly whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Imagination shall hurry
it; or else sometimes breaks off whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all Commerce with the Body, and
separates its self in Indignation, and
so the Life its self is destroyed; this
being the great and immediate cause
both of Distraction, and of Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Drowning, and various other
sorts of <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> which are
too frequently commited in the
World.</p>
            <p>§. 4. The truth is, <hi>Pride</hi> may
justly be said to be the chief <hi>Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarick,</hi>
or remote original cause of
<hi>Madness;</hi> for an abusive Self-flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Perswasion, Credulity, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of Falshood, do at first Seduce
a person into <hi>Presumption,</hi> and a
despising of others, or into an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of <hi>Self-Love, Anger, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi>
or Wrathfulness, towards his
Neighbour; from whence proceeds
<hi>Irreligion, Vnbelief, Superstition,

impenitent Arroganc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>sottish Carelesness.</hi> For
as <hi>Faith</hi> is the Gate unto <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
which is the Truth of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
Understanding, so a credulous
esteem or judgment of Falshood is
the entrance of Presumption and
Arrogancy, and the <hi>first madness of
the Soul.</hi> But other Disturbances,
as <hi>Love, Desire, Sorrow, Fear, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
&amp;c. are especially stirred up by
extrinsical occasion, and therefore
they do produce their effects, not
only in the Soul, but in the Body:
For all passions do in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
take away <hi>sleep,</hi> weaken the
Appetite and Digestive Faculties,
and impress <hi>dark Idaea's</hi> upon the
Spirits, and at length through a
long immoderate, strong, or sudden
inordinacy, those Idaea's do infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the <hi>Archeus,</hi> subvert the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the Soul is, as it were,
shaken out of its place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:37544:137"/>
§. 5. Now when the five inward
senses of the Soul are weakened or
destroyed, then they can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
present before the Judge the
<hi>Thoughts, Imaginations</hi> or <hi>Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
but they are all formed into
<hi>words</hi> as fast as they are generated,
there being no controul or room for
Judgment to censure what are <hi>fit,</hi>
and what are <hi>unfit</hi> to be coyn'd into
Expressions: For this cause <hi>Mad
People,</hi> and innocent Children, do
speak, forth whatever ariseth in their
Phantasies; but on the contrary, all
those that attain to Maturity of
Years, and the knowledge of good
and evil, their inward Senses of the
Soul being unviolated, especially
such as adhere to the coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>el of the
<hi>Voice of Wisdom,</hi> they let no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
or Imagination be formed
into words before it be presented by
the <hi>five Counsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

the Judge, which keeps its Court,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:37544:137"/>
and Seat of Justice, in the <hi>Center of
Life;</hi> for if this were not more or
less observed, would not every man
in the world seem to be <hi>Mad,</hi> or
Distracted? For what wild, inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,
absurd, ridiculous notions
should we hear from the most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
people, if they should continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Speak, and form into words
the various Imaginations, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
that do continually arise
from the <hi>Magie</hi> or <hi>Generating Wheel</hi>
of the seven <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which
never standeth still, or ceaseth from
working and generating; the Soul
of man, and all the Faculties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being a compleat Image of its
Creator, <hi>who slumbereth not, nor
sleepth,</hi> but his generative, and
wonderful creating power is always
active; for never hath any man
ceased from <hi>Imaginations</hi> one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an hour in his whole Life, or
indeed one moment, no, not even
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:37544:138"/>
when the Body &amp; Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>For though man can cease from
speaking, and may attain the Gift of
<hi>Silence,</hi> as any shall give their wills
thereunto, yet they cannot cease
from <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>Conceptions,</hi> either
good or evil, according to what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

of the Properties; for all
Material and Immaterial were and
are brought into Manifestation first
by Imagination, Desire and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
For the Imagination and the
Desire have a most wonderful deep
and hidden Original; and if its
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:37544:138"/>
mighty property were not captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
darkned, and as it ere chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Clouds of gross flesh, and
dark Powers of the outward and
corporeal Nature, it would do
wonders.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Therefore it is not perhaps
alwayes so very deplorable an estate,
as some suppose, to be deprived of
<hi>common Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> (as they
call it) especially, to be a <hi>mad inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
that is, if the property of
<hi>Friendliness</hi> have dominion in the
Soul; For when men are so divested
of their <hi>Rational Faculties,</hi> then
they appear naked, having no <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
Vail,</hi> or <hi>Figg-leaves</hi> before
them, to hide themselves in, and
therefore they no longer remain
under a Mask or Disguise, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
even as they are, which is very
rare to be known in any that retain
their <hi>Senses</hi> and <hi>Reason;</hi> for those
two serve to cover and hide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:37544:139"/>
Thoughts and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which continually are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the various Properties and
Centers in man, which in innocent
Children, as soon as they have the
use of their Tongues, and in mad
people, is not done, but all Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are promiscuously formed into
words, as they are generated, there
being no Judge nor Councellors to
advise or determine whether they
are fit to be divulged, and Coin'd
into Language, or to be stiffled and
suppressed.</p>
            <p>§. 7. The truth is, as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of evil is mans fall, so if this
sort of <hi>Madness</hi> were practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all men that have the use
of <hi>Reason,</hi> and their <hi>Senses,</hi> it would

Are not all these Intemperances, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
Oppression, Murder and savage
Evils, and Superfluities deservedly
to be accounted the worst Effects
of Madness? As also, Lying,
Swearing, vain Imaginations, and
living in and under the power of
evil Spirits, more to be dreaded
than the condition of those that
want the use of Senses and Reason;
and therefore are esteemed Mad?</p>
            <p>§. 8. As for the <hi>Species of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
they are as <hi>various</hi> as men are

to what Principle and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whether good or evil, does go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the Life, in the time of their
retaining their Reason and Senses,
such a property does more clearly
manifest it self when the Reason
and Senses are broken to pieces;
for this cause, some who have seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very Religious, and soberly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:37544:142"/>
as long as they retain'd their
Senses and outward Reason, as soon
as they become deprived thereof,
the bitter envious fierce wrathful
proud Spirit appears in its own form,
and has its operation without let or
hindrance, which was before by
the cunning Reason and sensual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
kept in, that it could not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
it self; for some men have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
so much outward government
over this bitter Spirit, that they can
at one and the same time cry <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna,</hi>
and <hi>Crucifie;</hi> say, <hi>God bless
you,</hi> and in their hearts wish your

to be <hi>Mad</hi> or deprived of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Sense and natural Reason,
then they discover the Savage Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that ruled before in the Center
of their Souls. But others, who in
the time of their sound Senses, were

accounted harsh and moross, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
their Tongues not so smoothly

they <hi>speak</hi> as they <hi>think,</hi> and do not
play the Hypocrites, by retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subtil Reservations, or saying
one thing, and at the same time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
on another; such, I say,
though many of them did not seem
to be so fair and good men as the
former, yet they are really more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and have far better Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
within, than the others, who
made use of their Natural Faculties,
to hide and cover the subtil bitter
Spirit; and therefore when these
latter plain sort of people happen to
be distracted, they appear more calm
and friendly than the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the good property had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dominion in the Soul.</p>
            <p>§. 9. Every person when distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:37544:143"/>
in his Senses and Reason, then
the distinguishing Faculties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does variously appear in proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Qualities, differing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which of the seven Forms
Nature did carry the upper domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Complexion. Therefore
<hi>Mad People</hi> vary as much in their
inclinations and passions of <hi>Love</hi>
and <hi>Hate</hi> as they did in when in their
<hi>Senses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Example; If the first, or
<hi>Saturnine</hi> Property did preside in the
Soul, and be not corrected, moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
allayed, and made friendly by
<hi>Wisdoms Voice,</hi> whilst they remained
in their Senses, then such will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
themselves when <hi>Mad,</hi> in sullen,
dogged, mischievous Melancholy
dispositions and Inclinations, with
blasphemous words, apt to hurt, and
be injurious, with <hi>Sour</hi> evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
and Looks.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>lovial Properties</hi> had the
uppermost Governments in the time
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:37544:143"/>
of their Reason, then such, when
out of their wits, are for the most
part affable and friendly, using no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruel words, nor so apt to do hurt, or
be churlish, or dogged.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Martial Property</hi> be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
in the Complexion, such
when deprived of Sense and Reason,
become <hi>furious, blasphemo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> apt to
all mischief and violence, great Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers,
and very unruly, fierce, turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and raging.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Solar Property</hi> do bare
Rule, such have great and high
thoughts, and lofty Imaginations,
fancying themselves to be <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Princes,</hi> and that all are in subjection
to them; and between while, they
are very unruly fierce and boisterous,
when they think th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
or humoured according to
that Quality they have assumed to
themselves.</p>
            <p>So where the <hi>Venereal Property</hi>
swayes in the Complexion such are
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:37544:144"/>
between whiles friendly, apt to
laugh, and be merry, often discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Love affairs, and will sing
and dance, but sometimes are little
out-ragious, though not like the
former; for these people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> do
any hurt, nor are they subject to
Cursing Swearing, or such like evil
Speaking.</p>
            <p>Where the <hi>Property</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi>
does bear sway in the constitution,
there is a strange mixture of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
they are apt to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very cunning, extraordinary
free and frolicksom, with their
Tongues running out of one thing
into another, prone always to talk
too much, and very furious bold and
raging, but calm at certain Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</p>
            <p>Lastly, where the <hi>Lunar property</hi>
predominates, such people are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
unconstant, fierce, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
never at any certainty, but
roaming out of one thing into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:37544:144"/>
And not only this last sort,
but all other <hi>Mad people</hi> are better
or worse, according to the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Influences, Configuration And
Aspects of the Coelestials, and thier
benevolent or malevolent Rayes,
towards the Ruling Constellation of
each mans Complexion, because all
people that are deprived of the use
of their Reason, Sense and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Faculties, are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
subjected to the outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Government and Influences of
the Stars and Elements. And you
may perceive a sensible alteration in
their Humours, Dispositions and
Inclinations, as the Coelestials alter;
which as they have Influence upon,
and do vary and change all things,
so more especially do they opperate
upon those that have lost the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the <hi>Will,</hi> which is the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
Mobile</hi> of mans Life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is observed, that distracted
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:37544:145"/>
people are more subject to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Influences Coelestial, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
by the progress and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations,
that the <hi>Moon</hi> has
with the other <hi>Erraticks</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations,
she being the Mansion-house
or <hi>Magazine,</hi> which receives
all the Influences of the greater
and higher Bodies, or Stars: And
therefore persons bereaved of their
Wits, are in our English Laws
called <hi>Lunaticks,</hi> from the great
power she hath upon such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>§. 10. By Custom, Sense and
Reason, most men do hide their
inward Inclinations, Dispositions
Complexions, and what property
carries the upper dominion in their
Hearts and Souls, so that the same
may by several means be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> which is a kind of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:37544:145"/>
               <hi>short Phrensie,</hi> or <hi>Temporary Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which make people appears
in various <hi>Moods</hi> and <hi>Dispositions;</hi>
for those that seemed of a <hi>Malan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Complexion,</hi> seem <hi>Sanguine;</hi>
and the <hi>Sanguine, Malancholy;</hi> for it
renders men to be that outwardly
which they are inwardly; for this
cause, some that are counted, and
seem to most men to be <hi>Severe</hi> and
<hi>Austere;</hi> when drink has opened
the <hi>Sanguine Gate of Nature,</hi> are
found to be very familiar, friendly
and kind in their words and works:
But on others, it hath a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
operation, <hi>viz.</hi> such who
carried themselves very affable and
friendly, when overcome with <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi>
grow Cruel, Quarrelsom,
Devilish and Uncivil, which does
clearly intimate, that the <hi>Saturnine</hi>
and <hi>Martial</hi> Principles did predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in the Soul; for drink makes
people appear in various Forms,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:37544:146"/>
because during the operation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they are really deprived of the
Exercise of their Right <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ason</hi> and
<hi>Sences</hi> of true <hi>distinguishments</hi> of
things, whereby they are uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as it were left naked (as
<hi>Noah</hi> was, after he had drank too
liberally of the fruit of his new
planted Vines) And so the inside
appears as it is, in its own <hi>Form</hi>
and <hi>Nature,</hi> which does most truly
discover the Complexion and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Inclinations; and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
does govern essentially in a
man; for then all glosses and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
are removed; whereas whilst
a man is <hi>himself</hi> (as they use to call
it) Shame, Reason and good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put a Restraint upon those viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Inclinations, lurking within
and suffer them not to appear;
but when they are deprived of their
Senses and Reason, then they have
no power to use those subtil Arts
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:37544:146"/>
of <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> but what form soever
has the predominancy does display
and manifest it felt in its own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
And therefore as soon as
they recover their Reason, and
come to their Senses, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of what they did, and by
Reason, and Breding, endeavour
to hide these Defects and Ill Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which rule over them. And
thus not a few through <hi>Wit</hi> and
<hi>Subtilty</hi> appear as if they were Saints,
but in truth they remain but little
better than <hi>Devils;</hi> so great is the
power of mans Wit and contrived
Understanding that he can appear
with two faces to deceive others
first, and himself at last: It is
therefore a very difficult matter for
any to judge of mens Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or real Inclinations, except God
have endued him with somewhat
of the universal understanding of
the nature of things, and of the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:37544:147"/>
signatures of nature; for the form
or figure of each thing, does to the
enlightened Eye discover the inward
Properties thereof.</p>
            <p>But this is more evidently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in <hi>Phrensy</hi> or <hi>Midness,</hi> the
same being a real turning of the
inside of all the natural Properties
and Faculties of the Soul outward;
so that whatever mad people do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
in words or actions, the
very same other Folk do inwardly
in thoughts and Imaginations;
and the difference is only this;
The one speaks and forms every
thought into words: having not
the Bridle of sense nor Reason to
restrain him; the other often times
cuts off such and such thoughts
and Imaginations in the Budd,
or at least shuts the grand Gate,
the <hi>Mouth,</hi> and keeps those shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unruly Stragglers in, not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the Organs and Properties of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:37544:147"/>
Nature to form them into Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Expressions.</p>
            <p>§. 11. It is also further to be
noted that all, or most <hi>Mad Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
are far stronger, and more
able to endure Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dship, Hunger,
Cold, and the like inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
although many of them are
naturally of weak <hi>tender</hi> natures,
and during the continuances of
their Senses, and Reasoning Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
did indulge and enure
themselves to tenderness; yet when
once they become Mad, they are
so strong and powerful, that some
of them must have two, three
or four men to hold and rule
them; and as to their enduring of
Cold, it is wonderful, for even nice,
tender Gentlewomen, who Screen
themselves all the Winter by lusty
Fires, in warm Beds, and close Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with choice Foods,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:37544:148"/>
and cordial Drink, are no sooner
deprived of their Reason and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but they leap over all these
things, and endure hardship, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
without prejudice to
their health, even beyond the stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
constitution; the reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, because when people, by any
of the fore-mentioned Accidents,
and Passions, fall into Distraction,
the whole Systime of Nature being
put into a tumultuous unequal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the same does in a moment of
time rouse up or awaken the deep
or great Original Fierce, Poysonous
Fire; or the four first Forms
of Nature. Now when these tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
Fires of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi>
have obtained the dominion, and
sole Government in the Soul,
they with a rapid motion destroy
the Government of the <hi>Divine
Light,</hi> and also of the <hi>humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which are and ought to be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:37544:148"/>
the <hi>Moderator,</hi> and <hi>Allayers</hi> of the
aforesaid original poysonous Fire,
and the true Distinguishers between
what is good, and the contrary,
and thus the Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it being alwayes
as upon a <hi>ferment,</hi> and uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
motion, it warms, strengthens,
and oftentimes does as it were put
a new life into the very Element
of the Body, whence a strong vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
strength and agility of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and a Defence of Cold, <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
and the like inconveniences does
proceed.</p>
            <p>This is further demonstrated by
all sorts of people in <hi>Passion,</hi> of
either Love or Hate, or when sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,
or in <hi>Sudden Frights,</hi> are
they not Generally under such
Circumstances of far greater Spirit,
stronger and more active Bodies,
and rendered more able to <hi>Lift, Run,
Carry, Fight,</hi> or any other thing
Good or Evil, then at other times,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:37544:149"/>
and have aboundantly more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and they can attempt and
perform many wonderful things
without the least suspition of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which at other times they
tremble to think of, and would not
for the greatest rewards be preswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to undertake.</p>
            <p>Nay, when the Soul-Fires are
kindled in the poysonous Root, a
man can whithout Dread and Fear
lay violent hands on himself, so
wonderfully great is its power, for
this is a madness of the highest
degree, since <hi>no man,</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
said) <hi>hates his own Flesh, but
loveth and cherishes it,</hi> which ought
well to be considered by all Jurors
concerned in such cases.</p>
            <p>So likewise when men are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with <hi>Drink,</hi> the spirituous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the strong Liquor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in too great a quantity, do
by <hi>Simily</hi> incorporate with the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:37544:149"/>
Spirits of Nature, in the Elements
of the Body, so that it inkindles
the Original fierce Fires, and puts
the whole Frame of Nature into
a tumultuous state of Inequality,
and during its operation, <hi>Reason</hi>
it captivated; and men in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
may truly be said to be in
the worst kind of <hi>Madness,</hi> as
clearly is manifested by their idle
leud Discourses, and mischievious
Actions.</p>
            <p>Likewise <hi>Malancholy</hi> people, when
grievously oppressed with its taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
Properties, are in a degree
deprived of their natural Sences
and Reason, and the Soul becomes
as it were <hi>Spiritual,</hi> so that it
Imagines, Sees, Hears, and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
wonderful things, which,
though to others appear as meer
fansies, yet to them are real, and
<hi>essential.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:37544:150"/>
§. 12. As for the <hi>Original Seed,</hi>
or Spring of Phrensies or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Body, it must be noted,
besides what hath been already
said, that there is in the Pipe of
the Artery of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> a vital
Faculty of the Soul, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaming
of Rayes of Light into
the <hi>Heart,</hi> so long as it is in a
good state, but when through
Passions and Disorders it behaveth
it self rashly, or amiss, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
Heart-burning, Fainting,
Giddiness of the Head, Appoplexes,
Epilexsies, Drousie-Evils, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Madnesses, Head-akes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vultions,
&amp;c. by the means we
have herein before described are
sturred up. And since the stomach
is the Seat of the Concupiscible
Faculty, and from whose fumes
both sleep and watchings are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
and since that <hi>Alienation of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:37544:150"/>
mind</hi> chiefly pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceeds from irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
desire, it may rationally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the Prime <hi>local Spring,</hi>
or Seed of Madness is in or near
the stomach, or its neighbouring
parts, the <hi>Midriff and the Spleen;</hi>
though afterwards it displays its
male-influences upon the <hi>Brain;</hi> for
a man forms his Images in the
<hi>Midriff;</hi> as well those of the <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscible,</hi>
or Desiring, as those of the
<hi>Irascible,</hi> or Wrathful Faculty,
so that Madness is therefore not
undeservedly called, <hi>Hipocondria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi>
for the prime Efficacy of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances consisteth in the <hi>Spleen,</hi>
and therefore perhaps Antiquity
hath counted <hi>Saturn</hi> the principle of
the Starry power, and highest of
the wandering Stars, to wit, that
which should cast his influence
downwards on the rest, but that
the rest should in no wise reflect
upwards, because they are believed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:37544:151"/>
to conspire for the Commodities of
sublunary things, but not on the
contrary upwards; and therefore,
though they called the same <hi>Saturn,</hi>
the Original of Life, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Conceptions, or Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet they also named him,
The <hi>Devourer</hi> of his own <hi>young
Children,</hi> as thereby intimating,
that as the <hi>Images</hi> or Ideas framed
by the <hi>desirable</hi> Faculty do make
Seed fruitfull, so also the Inns of
Digestion in us, when they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant,
consume the new and
tender <hi>Blood,</hi> and bring many <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases</hi>
upon us.</p>
            <p>§. 13. But besides the before-mentioned
most usual Causes of
<hi>Maedness,</hi> from the <hi>Passions,</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not but sometimes other things
received in from without, may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<hi>alienation</hi> of <hi>Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Biting of a Mad-Dog
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:37544:151"/>
conveys a Venom impregnated with
its own raging Idea, which is soon
communicated to the Spirit of
man, and produces in him that
wilde foolish conceit, called, by
Physitians <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> or a fear of
Water, in which the Person affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by an error of his imaginations
seems to see the Image of a <hi>Dog;</hi>
and in time, if no Remedy be
found, grows raving Mad, and
dies, so also those that are Bit with
the <hi>Tarantule,</hi> a venomous Beast,
or Infect, seen sometimes in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and other forraign Parts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
disposed to a certain kind
of skipping or <hi>Dancing</hi> Phrensie,
which at last proves Mortal: So some
by ignorance of Apothecaries, who
have taken <hi>Henbane</hi>-Seed insteed of
<hi>Dill,</hi> have immediately become
Mad, Stupid and Foolish, so that
they could not utter an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
word, for all which there
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:37544:152"/>
are distinct Reasons in Nature,
but too tedious here to be related,
and somewhat unnecessary, because
these Cases very rarely occur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us.</p>
            <p>§. 14. As to the Cure of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in general, the Schools com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
prescribe <hi>Blood-letting,</hi> and
<hi>Sleep procuring Medicines,</hi> but with
how much success daily experience
witnesseth, they mistake the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>use,</hi>
and therefore blindly combat with
the <hi>Effect;</hi> and for the latter, let
such as intend to cure Distractions
by <hi>sleepyfying</hi> things, take notice
that <hi>stupifactive Medicines</hi> do scarce
procure sleep unto mad persons by
a four-fold Dose; and when all is
done, they increase the <hi>Madness;</hi>
for <hi>Madness</hi> is nothing but an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Sleepifying Power,</hi> because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Madman dreameth waking;
and therefore <hi>Stupefactive Dreams</hi>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:37544:152"/>
are thereby added unto <hi>doting
Dreams</hi> in waking, and so the mind
more disturbed then before. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
undoubtedly, the sealing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in a Madman, presupposes
a restoring of the hurt reason;
and a correction of the Poyson by
its Antidote, but not another stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefactive
Poyson to be added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>And as Supifying Medicines are
of little value, but rather prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
so, much more mischievous
is too much Company, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and especially, the Teazing
of such distempered People with
unnecessary Questions; on which
score, as I must acknowledge that
Gallant Structure of <hi>New Bethlam</hi>
to be one of the Prime Ornaments
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Monument of <hi>Charity,</hi> so I
would with all Humility beg the
Honorable and worthy Governours
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:37544:153"/>
thereof, that they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to use some Effectual means,
for restraining their inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
from admiting such Swarms
of People, of all Ages and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
for only a little paltry Profit
to come in there, and with their
noise, and vain questions to disturb
the poor Souls; as especially such,
as do Resort thither on Holy-dayes,
and such spare time, when for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
hours (almost all day long)
they can never be at any quiet, for
those inportunate Visitants, whence
manifold great inconveniences do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise.
For,</p>
            <p>First, Tis a very Undecent, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
thing to make, as it
were, a <hi>Show</hi> of those Unhappy
Objects of <hi>Charity</hi> committed to
their Care, (by exposing them,
and making too perhapes of either
Sexs) to the Idle Curiosity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

               </gap> Boy, petulant Wench,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:37544:153"/>
or Drunken Companion, going
along from one Apartment to the
other, and Crying out; This
Woman is in for Love; That Man
for Jealousie; He has Over-studied
himself, and the Like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This staring Rabble
seldom fail of asking more then an
hundred impertinent Questions. —
As, what are you here for? How
Long have you been here, &amp;c.
which most times enrages the
Distracted person, tho calme and
quiet before, and then the poor
Creature falls a Raving, and too
probably, a Cursing and Swearing,
and so the holy, and tremendous
name of God is dishonored, whilest
the wicked people, who think it
a rare Diversion, instead of Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
themselves really Guilty, as
the Occasion of all these Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
fall a Laughing and Hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:37544:154"/>
and so the poor distracted
Creatures become twice more fierce
and violent then ever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As long as such Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
are suffered, there is little
Hope that any Cure or Medicine
should do them good to reduce
them to their Senses or right Minds,
as we call it, and so the very Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
end of the House is defeated.
Certainly the most hopeful means
towards their Recovery would be
to keep them with a Clean Spare
Diet, and as quiet as may be, and
to let none come at them but their
particular Friends, Grave sober
People and such as they have a
kindness for, and those to, not
alwayes, but only at proper times,
whereby discoursing with them in
their Lused Intervals Gravely, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
and Discreetly, and humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in little things, shall do
much more, I am Confident, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:37544:154"/>
their Cure, then most of the
Medicines that are commonly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred;
But to come home to
the Cure we must Consider that a
mad Idea, imprinted on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Life, cannot be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but together with the Subject
that hath closed it; therefore a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is to be found out, which may
Slay, take away, or obliterate that
Image of madness, or the Blot so
characterized; just, as 'tis said, a
<hi>Blemish</hi> imprinted by the <hi>longing
Mother,</hi> doth by the moving of the
hand of a dead <hi>Carcase</hi> (that was
killed by a lingering Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
on it, until the cold thereof
shall pierce the Blemished part, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
away for the future of its own
accord.</p>
            <p>After the same manner the Idea
of madness ought to be put to
flight, whether it be done by the
<hi>death</hi> of the said Idea, or by in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:37544:155"/>
generating an Idea of equal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailency,
or one that over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the foolish Idea; for from
hence it comes to pass, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for Madness hath hitherto
been dispaired of, because the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and properties of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hath not been searched for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the excesses of <hi>first Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
Nor can it be but the scope
of cureing must be difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not only the Idea of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
imagination, and a <hi>sealy-mark</hi>
and blemish is introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the innermost point of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
but also, because the
restoring of the <hi>inbred Spirit</hi> is
hardly to be effected, since the
sweet Government of the <hi>divine
Principle</hi> is cast of, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is now no longer able to turn
his <hi>Will</hi> thereunto, or to hearken
unto the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> for help;
but <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> is never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:37544:155"/>
to those that truly seek him in
<hi>Humility,</hi> that with Bowels of <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
towards their Neighbour; to
such God, the Giver of every good
and perfect Gift, will in his own
due time reveal and communicate
a <hi>proper</hi> Remedy; for Medicines
have with a success been admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
wherein a <hi>Symbole,</hi> or Mark
of Resemblance doth inhabite;
that is the firmental imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a founder judgment. For
truly as there are Poysons of the
Mind, causing the allienations
thereof, for sometimes, or for
the whole space of Life; to wit,
such as do introduce a proper
Phantasie into us, as a <hi>Mad Dog,</hi>
the <hi>Tarantula</hi> &amp;c. So also there

for a <hi>Mad brain;</hi> not that
the poysonous and hurtful qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
doth reach unto the <hi>Head,</hi>
but because it unloads the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff</hi>
and the <hi>Spleen,</hi> the original
Seats of this distemper, and so
by consequence relieves the <hi>Brain,</hi>
which was affected by a secondary
Passion.</p>
            <p>§. 15. For such as have been
<hi>Bitten</hi> with a <hi>Mad Dog,</hi> the Dutch
(as I have heard) do prevent the
Mischief, by applying to the
place a raw Herring salted, for
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:37544:156"/>
three dayes space, every day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed;
but if that had been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and the party begins to
dote, and fear the water, (which
is one of the first symtoms of that
kind of Distraction) then they
get him on ship-board, strip him,
and tye him to the end of the
Sail-yard, and lifting him first on
high, <hi>plung him down headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea,</hi> and let him remain a
little while under water, and so
a second, and third time and then
take him down, place him on a
smooth place with his back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and his head declining,
or as it were hanging over some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and so will cast up all the
water received into his stomach,
and thence forward be perfectly
cured.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Vanhelmont</hi> witnesses, that
such plunging over head and ears
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:37544:157"/>
is a <hi>Cure,</hi> not only in that case,
but in <hi>other</hi> inveterate <hi>Mania's</hi> or
<hi>Madnesses,</hi> and in fresh water as
well in the Sea; He sayes, he hath
often tryed it, and was never
deceived in the event, but when
through fear of drowning them,
he drew the <hi>Mad</hi> persons too soon
from under the water.</p>
