         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

neyther doe common diſpoſitions
keepe fitte or plauſible conſort with iudiciall and ſimple
honeſtie, nor are idle capacities comprehenſible of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate
Poeme. My Epiſtle dedicatorie before my ſeuen
bookes, is accounted darke and too much laboured: for
the darkenes there is nothing good or bad, hard or ſofte,
darke or perſpicuous but in reſpect, &amp; in reſpect of mens
light, ſleight, or enuious peruſalles (to whoſe looſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
any worke worthily compoſde is knit with a riddle)
&amp; that the ſtile is materiall flowing, &amp; not ranke, it may
perhaps ſeeme darke, to ranke riders or readers, that haue
no more ſoules then burbolts: but to your comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; in it ſelfe, I know it is not. For the affected labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
in it, I proteſt two morninges both ended it and
the Readers Epiſtle: but the truth is, my deſire &amp; ſtrange
diſpoſition in all thinges I write, is to ſet downe vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and moſt profitable coherents for the time: yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remoued from abhorde affectation, then from the
moſt popular and cold diſgeſtion. And I euer imagine
<pb facs="tcp:6496:6"/>
that as Italian &amp; French Poems to our ſtudious linguiſtes,
win much of their diſcountryed affection, as well becauſe
the vnderſtanding of forreigne tongues is ſweete to their
apprehenſion, as that the matter &amp; inuention is pleaſing,
ſo my farre fetcht, and as it were beyond ſea manner of
writing, if they would take as much paines for their poore
countrimen as for a proud ſtranger when they once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it, ſhould be much more gracious to their choice
conceiptes, then a diſcourſe that fals naked before them,
and hath nothing but what mixeth it ſelfe with ordinarie
table talke. For my varietie of new wordes, I haue none
Inckepot I am ſure you know, but ſuch as I giue paſport
with ſuch authoritie, ſo ſignificant and not ill ſounding,
that if my countrey language were an vſurer, or a man of
this age ſpeaking it, hee would thanke mee for enriching
him: Why alas will my young mayſter the reader affect
nothing common, and yet like nothing extraordinarie?
Swaggering is a new worde amongſt them, and rounde
headed cuſtome giues it priuiledge with much imitation,
being created as it were by a naturall <hi>Proſopopeia</hi> without
etimologie or deriuation; and why may not an elegancie
authentically deriued, &amp; as I may ſay of the vpper houſe,
bee entertayned as well in their lower conſultation with
authoritie of Arte, as their owne forgeries lickt vp by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
All tongues haue inricht themſelues from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
(onely the Hebrew &amp; Greeke which are not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
amongſt vs) with good neighbourly borrowing, and
as with infuſion of freſh ayre, and nouriſhment of newe
blood in their ſtill growing bodies, &amp; why may not ours?
<hi>Chaucer</hi> (by whom we will needes authoriſe our true en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh)
had more newe wordes for his time then any man
needes to deuiſe now. And therefore for currant wits to
<pb facs="tcp:6496:7"/>
crie from ſtanding braines, like a broode of Frogs from a
ditch, to haue the ceaſeleſſe flowing riuer of our tongue
turnde into their Frogpoole, is a ſong farre from their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
of ſweetnes, &amp; a ſin wold ſoone bring the plague
of barbariſme amongſt vs; which in faith needes not bee
haſtned with defences of his ignorant furtherers, ſince it
comes with mealemouth'd toleration too ſauagely vpon
vs. To be ſhort; ſince I had the reward of my labours in
their conſummation, and the chiefe pleaſure of them in
mine owne profit, no young preiudicate or caſtigatorie
braine hath reaſon to thinke I ſtande trembling vnder the
ayry ſtroke of his feuerie cenſure, or that I did euer expect
any flowing applauſe from his drie fingers; but the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and delight that might probably redound to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
true louer of vertue I ſet in the ſeat of mine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and contentment; and if there be any one in whome
this ſucceſſe is enflowred, a few ſprigges of it ſhall bee my
garland. Since then this neuer equald Poet is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
and ſo full of gouernment and direction to all
eſtates; ſterne anger and the affrights of warre, bearing
the mayne face of his ſubiect; ſoldiers ſhall neuer ſpende
their idle howres more profitablie, then with his ſtudious
and induſtrious peruſall; in whoſe honors his deſerts are
infinite: Counſellors haue neuer better oracles then his
lines: fathers haue no morales ſo profitable for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as his counſailes: nor ſhal they euer giue them more
honord iniunctions, then to learne <hi>Homer</hi> without book,
that being continually conuerſant in him, his height may
deſcend to their capacities, and his ſubſtance proue their
worthieſt riches. Huſbands, wiues, louers, friends, and
allies, hauing in him mirrors for all their duties; all ſortes
of which concourſe and ſocietie in other more happy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb facs="tcp:6496:7"/>
haue in ſteed of ſonnets &amp; laſciuious ballades, ſung his

endeuours: for talke our quidditicall Italianiſtes of what
proportion ſoeuer their ſtrooting lips affect; vnleſſe it be in
theſe coopplets, into which I haue haſtely tranſlated this
Shield, they ſhall neuer doe <hi>Homer</hi> ſo much right, in any
octaues, canzons, canzonets, or with whatſoeuer fuſtian
Epigraphes they ſhall entitle their meaſures. Onely the
extreame falſe printing troubles my conſcience, for feare
of your deſerued diſcouragement in the empaire of our
Poets ſweetnes; whoſe generall diuinitie of ſpirit,

            <l>Such crownes ſuffice the free and royall mind,</l>
