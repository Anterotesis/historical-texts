            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

is true of mens laws,
for they are intended onely to puniſh grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Law proceeds to the very leaſt <hi>iota</hi> and <hi>apex,</hi>
and puniſhes our fayling in any one point
or circumſtance. <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 10. Yea, if we ſhall
obſerve the Devills wiles and methods, we
ſhall find that the Devill ſeldome aſſaults
any Chriſtian inlightned, with great ſinns,
ſuch as waſte the conſcience and all the
World cryes ſhame of at the firſt daſh, but
hee begins inſenſibly with leſſer ſinnes, to
<pb facs="tcp:94027:3"/>
make way for greater, he tries the ſpirits of
men firſt with ſlighter temptations, hee
makes them firſt to ſwallow gnats, to make
way for Camells afterwards, till they put
no difference betweene ſinne and ſinne, but
grow to be paſt feeling, and to commit all
manner of uncleanes with greedines. And
moſt true is that of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 10.
Hee that is faithfull in the leaſt, is faithfull
alſo in much, he that is unjuſt in the leaſt,
is unjuſt alſo in much: hee that willingly
takes liberty to himſelfe to adventure upon
the leaſt violation of Gods righteous Law,
will without all doubt upon a greater
temptation, make bold with any daring
ſinne.</p>
            <p>The conſideration whereof hath made
mee to weigh a little the railing about the
Communion Table, ſo violently preſſed
and ſtrictly injoyned over all the Land in
theſe latter times: For indeed in common
eſtimation this ſeemes to bee a very ſmall
matter, and very many wonder why any
Chriſtian ſhould make any ſcruple of it,
or trouble himſelfe about it in theſe times,
<pb facs="tcp:94027:3"/>
wherein groſſe idolatry &amp; image-worſhip
is openly practiſed, the morality of the
Lords day is contradicted and prophaned,
and many new-fangled complements, and
meerely humane, that I ſay not diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
inventions in Gods worſhip are urged
and impoſed. But all theſe have been happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſed, &amp; witneſſed againſt by others,
both godly, judicious, and learned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the rail about the Communion Table is
ſlighted &amp; waved of all ſorts, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding

wiſely conſider with what eagerneſſe
this addition of rails hath bin inforced, and
Communicants every where preſſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper at
the rail, and no where elſe. Indeed what
I ſpeake in this kind is out of wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
for I have ſuffered my ſelfe heavy
things, waſted my eſtate two whole yeers
together in the high Commiſſion Court,
and at the laſt was ſentenced to be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from my Miniſtery, to beare the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

a recantation and baſe ſubmiſſion in the
Court for the words ſpoken by me, and
the Lord hath beene pleaſed to leave mee,
to try me, to know what was in my heart,
and I have baſely and wickedly yeelded to
their impoſitions; I will not plead the
greatneſſe of my temptations by which I
have been overcome, but do humbly crave
pardon of God and man (whoſoever have
beene offended by me) and upon the Lords
opening of mine eyes, and raiſing me up,
yea and ſanctifying this my great fall, I have
thought it my duty, to enquire into this
myſtery of iniquity, to rake this dunghill,
and to lay open to the view of the World
the wickedneſſe incloſed in, and couched
under this innovation of the raile, deſiring
the LORD that my fall may be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
both to my ſelfe, to heale that and other

The Major or the firſt propoſition may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by all thoſe learned writings that have been
publiſhed to ſhew the unlawfulneſſe of high Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
amongſt which that ſet forth by the B. of
<hi>Lincolne</hi> hath great ſtrength in it. But let me adde
moreover that place <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10. to evince the
ſame, the words are theſe, Wee have an Altar
whereof they have no right to eate that ſerve at
the Tabernacle; from which place theſe two
arguments may be framed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 Chriſtians are to have but one Altar (1. Chriſt)
therefore they muſt not have any more Altars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Mede,</hi> as in this whole argument hath
written a collation moſt unworthy of his worth
and learning, ſo in expounding of this place of
the Apoſtle <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. where he makes this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I know (ſaith he) what you will bee ready
to except, namely that by the Altar here named
is meant Chriſt, which I (quoth he) for my part
would willingly admit, ſo that it be underſtood
with this caution, Chriſt as he is to be eaten in the
Euchariſt, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of an Altar
to be eaten of, which is not the materiall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or ſeat, but the Sacrifices uſed thereupon.</p>
               <p>In which words hee would not have Chriſt
ſimply conſidered, but Chriſt as eaten in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt
to bee the Chriſtians Altar. <hi>Contra,</hi> Firſt
take what he grants, if Chriſt as eaten in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt
onely bee our Altar, then have wee no
Altars of wood or Stone, for that Chriſt is but
one, but the other altars are innumerable, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
acknowledges but one only altar among Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtians.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94027:6"/>
Secondly, let us compare ver. 15 with the tenth.
By him therfore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe
to God continually; whence I reaſon thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſt by whom our Sacrifices of praiſe are
continually to be offered, is the Altar there meant
by the Apoſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that Chriſt, is Chriſt ſimply underſtood without
reference to the Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c. ergo.</p>
               <p>As it was by Gods appointment among the
Jewes, that no ſacrifice could be accepted, but
that which was offered up upon the Altar of
burnt offering, ſo no Sacrifice (be it of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
or prayer, or whatſoever other ſervice)
can ever pleaſe God unleſſe it bee offered up by
Chriſt. But now will Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> ſay, either
that wee muſt never offer up the ſacrifice of
thankſgiving to God but at the Euchariſt; or that
we can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually offer up our ſacrifices by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
as eaten in the Euchariſt? muſt wee alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament, when we offer up our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
unto God? or doe we receive the Sacrament
continually, <hi>i.</hi> daily? for the daily ſacrifice
among the Jews was called the continuall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
but it is very obſervable, that the Apoſtle
ſaith (by him, not upon it) let us offer, &amp;c. inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
plainly the perſon of our Lord and Saviour,
and not an Altar of Wood or Stone; and it is
ſtrange that he ſhould being this place to prove
Altars lawfull in the times of the <hi>N. T.</hi> which is
moſt expreſſe againſt it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is an other argument in the
ſame place, <hi>i.</hi> They have no right to partake of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94027:7"/>
that Altar, (1: Chriſt) that ſerve at the Tabernacle;
who are they that ſerve at the tabernacle, but the
Prieſts and ſacrificers under the Law? or ſuch
as bring in Jewiſh ceremonies in the time of the
Goſpell, (as ſome of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
wrote unto, did) ſo the meaning of the place
muſt be this; They that bring in or obſerve Jewiſh
ceremonies in the times of the Goſpell, have no
part or intereſt in Chriſt, they have no right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: but they that ſet up Altars in the times
of the new Teſtament, doe plainly bring in Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
ceremonies; therefore ſuch have no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with Jeſus Chriſt; for ſurely they haue no
right to him, and none hath any communion
with him, but they to whom God the Father
hath given right unto him; and this agrees with
that place, <hi>Gal. 5. 2. Behold I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you,
that if ye be circumciſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing,</hi>
and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Altars are every whit as dangerous as
Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>For the further illuſtrating of this argument,
it will not be altogether unprofitable to conſider
the ground of the Apoſtle, which was this, That
there was to be by Gods own appointment but
one Altar only for ſacrifice amongſt the Jewes
(which one Altar the Apoſtle in that place makes
a cleere type of Chriſt) <hi>Levit. 1. Deut.</hi> 12. 13. 14.
hence it was that when the <hi>Reubenites</hi> &amp; <hi>Gadites,</hi>
and halfe tribe of <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> had erected an other
Altar by the banke of <hi>Jordan</hi> the reſidue of the
12. tribes thought that offence to be ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
diſpleaſing unto God that <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. it is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94027:7"/>
called a turning away from following the Lord, yea
rebellion againſt the Lord, and to bee compared
with the iniquity of <hi>Peor,</hi> and for which they
thought that God would be wroth with the whole
congregation, yea, they intended to purſue the
ſinne with open hoſtility, and to fight againſt
them in battell for it. And though they were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
touching the end and ſcope of that Altar
of witneſſe (it being ſet up onely for a civill monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not for ſacrifice) yet thus much is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Zeale of the nine Tribes and halfe,
and the anſwere alſo and apology of the other
Tribes, that there muſt be but one Altar for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
amongſt the people of God; and that (ſaith
the Apoſtle) is only Chriſt amongſt Chriſtians.
Thus alſo 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 13. when as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had ſet
up a new Altar, the Lord himſelfe did oppoſe it
by a ſpeciall meſſage, ſeconded by a ſpeciall mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
forbidding the Prophet either to returne the
ſame way, or to eat bread in that place, thereby
implying that they were not worthy of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
To the ſame purpoſe the prophet <hi>Hoſeah</hi>
rebuketh the degenerate Iſraelites <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. ſaying,
becauſe <hi>Ephraim</hi> hath made many Altars to ſinne,
therefore Altars ſhall be unto him to ſin, <hi>i.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſhall bee given up to their idoll Altars,
or elſe that this ſhall be a moſt heinous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
ſinne: and that we might know the riſe and
ground of this ſinne, it is added in the next words,
I have written to them the great things of the law,
&amp; they have accounted them ſtrange things, as if
he ſhould ſay, It is not ſtrange that they ſhould fall
to ſet up Altars, that ſwerve from the onely rule
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94027:8"/>
of worſhip, the word of God.</p>
               <p>All which proves that the Apoſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi>
alludes to the Commandement of God in the law,
that becauſe there was but one Altar of burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the Law, ſo there is but one Altar among
Chriſtians, that is Chriſt, who is both the Prieſt,
and Sacrifice, and Altar alone; &amp; more eſpecially
the Altar did typifie his Deity, which only made
the ſacrifice meritorious, for the altar did ſanctifie
the gift <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19. Now what could ſanctifie
Chriſts Sacrifice, but his Deity? which is alſo clee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. where Chriſt is ſaid, in reference
to this type of the Altar, to have offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by his eternall ſpirit without ſpot to God,
where by the eternall ſpirit, wee muſt underſtand
the Godhead of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſee the practice of theſe times, they will
have Prieſts not Miniſters, Altars not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Tables, Sacrifices not Sacraments: they
will bow, and cringe to and before their Altars,
yea, they will nor indure any man to enquire after
what manner Chriſt is in the Sacrament, whether
by way of conſubſtantiation, or tranſubſtantiation,
or in a ſpirituall manner, yea, they will have Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and Books never uſed, empty Baſons and
Challices there, what is this but the Maſſe it

for the proving of the firſt propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Aſſumption or the ſecond propoſition, (that a

Firſt, by Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, railes about the
Lords Table, whether of wood or ſtone were never
commanded to bee ſet up, but ſince the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of Altars, and the idoll of the Maſſe, and
Tranſubſtantiation was adored; and after Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
was in his Pontificalibus. I might alledge
out of <hi>Binius</hi> diverſe acts of popiſh Councels to
this purpoſe, eſpecially it was ſtrictly injoyned
in one of the Councells of <hi>Megara,</hi> which was (as
may appeare by all the acts of it) a moſt Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

               <p>Secondly, it may appear by all the Cathedrall
churches, in which only high Altars have beene
continued ſince times of Reformation, all which
alſo have been railed in, and all the Communicants
made to receive kneeling at the rails, and no where
elſe; from whence now ſince the Altar-worſhip

This proofe is built upon this ground, that
kneeling at the receiving of the Sacrament is a
falſe, idolatrous, and will-worſhip; for the
proofe whereof I ſhall not ſay much, becauſe
that others have done it ſufficiently to thoſe that
will receive ſound and wholſome Doctrine. But
for preſent ſatisfaction take theſe few things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To leave the imitable example of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and to follow the practice of idolaters, is
a falſe worſhip, an idolatrous worſhip, a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to kneele at the Sacrament is to leave the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and to
follow the practice of idolaters,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The proofe of the propoſition is manifeſt <hi>Ephe.</hi>
5. 1. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. where the ſame ſubject is
handled, that we have in hand.</p>
               <p>Now that kneeling is a leaving of the example
of Chriſt it is evident <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 20. whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
alwayes binds as long as it is conſtant,
and not varying, as it is in the particular caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But our Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
neither ſate, nor ſtood, but lay downe rather; for

The word ſignifies to ſit downe and is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily

It was indeed a ſitting after the Jewiſh manner at
meals, which was a ſitting with a kind of leaning
downe upon the arme; which kinde of geſture or
mixt ſitting being peculiar to the Church of the
Jews, ſitting without leaning is juſtly received
in reformed Churches.</p>

was an occaſionall geſture by reaſon of the
Paſſeover joyned with the inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and therefore Chriſtians are no more
bound to it, then they are to other occaſionall
circumſtances, as that it was then received at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
yea, in a private houſe, by men and not by
women, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tis true indeed, that thoſe were all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionall,
but the ſame cannot be ſaid of ſitting
at the Sacrament, for it is evident, that after the
Paſſeover was ended, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 4. our Saviour roſe
up from it, and afterwards ſate down again to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
and adminiſter his laſt Supper, ſo that this
geſture was not taken up by occaſion of the
Paſſeover, but it was a geſture purpoſely appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, which I may alſo further prove by
this argument.</p>
               <p>If ſitting at the Sacrament hath a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
ſignification, then that geſture was not
taken up by occaſion of the Paſſeover, but is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
and purpoſely inſtituted by our Lord
and Saviour.</p>
               <p>But ſitting at the receiving of the Sacrament
hath a Sacramentall ſignification, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This may be cleerly proved by the words of
Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 27. &amp;c. where imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the inſtitution of the Lords Supper,
our Saviour interprets this to be the meaning of
ſitting at the receiving of it, that it ſignifies the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
communion and fellowſhip that believers
have with him here in Grace, and ſhall have with
him hereafter in the Kingdome of Heaven: as in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94027:11"/>
all Feaſts, which Princes and great Potentates do
make and invite us to, if they ſhall admit us to ſit
down with them at the ſame Table, they teſtifie
a great deal of friendſhip, familiaritie and neere
ſocietie with us; and this is taught us not onely by
<hi>Muſculus, Rainolds,</hi> and <hi>John Alaſco,</hi> but even by
the Papiſts themſelves, even <hi>Thomas Aquinas part.

                  <hi>Now to proceed to the ſecond branch of the former

is an imitation of the practice of Idolaters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may be proved by teſtimonies, Kneeling
was not uſed for many hundred yeeres after
Chriſt and the Apoſtles time, for it was brought
in for the worſhip of the breaden God, <hi>Beza epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol.

by Eccleſiaſticall Stories, ſo that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts
and Patrons of kneeling at the Sacrament
cannot find or bring forth ſo much as one writer
before the 1000 yeere after Chriſt: yea, it is cleer
that it was the brood of Reall bodily preſence,
having <hi>Honorius</hi> the third for the Father, <hi>Anno</hi>
1220. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third for the Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured
to eſtabliſh it by fire and faggot, <hi>Anno</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94027:11"/>
Adde to this the blaſphemy of that plea that
is uſed by the Patrons of kneeling in the defence
of it, when as they ſay that it is the more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
geſture of receiving: then belike that uſed by
Chriſt and his Apoſtles vvas not ſo reverend, or
the Prelats and their creatures in Kneeling are
more reverend then Chriſt and his Apoſtles: and
is not this horrid blaſphemy?</p>

            <div n="3" type="argument">
               <head>Thus much alſo for the ſecond Argument.
The third Argument.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which is an occaſion or invitation to idolatrous
bowing and cringing to Altars, is idolatrous, and
to be abhorred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the raile is an occaſion to Idolatrous bowing and
cringing to Altars,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The proofe of the former propoſition.
It may appeare by this, becauſe that bowing
towards or before the Altar is Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe to worſhip electively towards or
before any creature or invention of man without
warrant from God is idolatrous: for I demand
elſe why may wee not as well worſhip electively
towards or before a Crucifix or Popiſh Image as
before or towards an Altar? the Papiſts will ſay,
that they are not ſuch Sots as to terminate their
worſhip upon a ſtock or a ſtone, no more then our
Altar worſhippers doe upon a piece of wood, or a
Joyners frame; and can wee think that when the
Iſraelites kiſſed the Calves, and worſhipped the
Altars at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> that they chiefly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Images and Altars in that worſhip, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
their worſhip upon them? nay but, ſayes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94027:12"/>
                  <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> this is thy God oh <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that brought
thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he means, that theſe
did but repreſent the true God that is worſhipped
at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he it is that I would have you to
bow unto, though you bow before his Image, and
ſo <hi>Aaron</hi> ſaid of his Calfe, <hi>Exod</hi> 32. and yet that
is called an Idoll, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But did not God command to bow and
to fall downe in worſhip towards the Temple?
Did not <hi>David</hi> ſay, And in thy feare will I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
towards thy holy Temple? and why may
not Chriſtians worſhip an Altar, as well as
the <hi>Jewes</hi> worſhiped towardes the Temple?
<hi>Anſwere,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> had a warrant from God to
worſhip him towards the Temple, and the holy
of holies, but wee have none in this caſe; for
have we any ſuch Temple now as the <hi>Jewes?</hi> It
is evident that the Temple at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was
one of the greateſt types of Chriſt in all the
booke of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. For did not the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Godhead dwell in him bodily, <hi>Col.
2. 9. i.</hi> in a glorious manner, as Gods glory
did of old in the Temple, and that typicall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
was the ground of all their adoration
towards the Temple: but now the body is
come theſe ſhadows, are vaniſhed away, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.
16. and to bring in ſuch ſhadowes now, is a flat
denyall of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly this is moſt wicked of all the reſt,
when as bowing is practiſed at ſuch times when
as the Sacrament is not adminiſtred; for Chriſt
being equally preſent at both Sacraments, &amp; alſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94027:12"/>
preſent in the ordinance of preaching in a ſpeciall
manner, why ſhould wee not as well bow to
the Font, or to the pulpit, as to the ſuppoſed
Altar?</p>
               <p>Shall wee ſay as that great Arch-Prelate
ſaid at the ſentence of Maſter <hi>Burton, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt
ſaid of the one onely <hi>hoc eſt verbum meum,</hi> but of
the other hee ſaid, <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum;</hi> but doth
not this ſtinke of Popiſh tranſubſtantiation? had
his holineſſe forgotten, or never read that of
AVSTINE, <hi>accedit verbum ad elementum &amp; fit
Sacramentum?</hi> Or is not <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,
verbum meum?</hi> hath not the Sacrament all
his fealing vertue from the Word? how was
that great miracle wrought upon him (which
hath beene confidently reported as from his
mouth) that when hee was Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi>
and falne into a dangerous ſickneſſe, hee was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out of it meerly by the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?
Was it by the meere vertue of the
Bread and Wine, or the outward elements?
(but this might have been had in a Taverne, and
Vintners might turne Phyſicians, if this were all)
or was it by any vertue of the word of inſtitution
or promiſe annexed to the Sacrament? if it was,
why doth hee not aſcribe as much or more to the
word then to the Sacrament? nay, why did not
his Highnes make that Chamber-table at which
that Sacrament was conſecrated and adminiſtred
an high Altar too? Doth hee ſtill performe that
homage and obeyſance to that Table, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he ſees it? or doth his ſucceſſor in the ſame Sea
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94027:13"/>
do the like? Nay, will it not follow hence that
whenſoever any private Communion is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a corner, (as in caſe of ſickneſſe is enjoyned
in the book of common Prayer) that ſuch Tables
are ever after holy Tables and Altars, to which
Gods ſpeciall preſence is tyed in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and towards which all the Family and others
are bound always to adore, and to proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
or if they think this to be ſuperſtitious, let
them tell us their juſt reaſon, why ſuch Tables
ſhould be ſo adored in Churches, and not alſo in
private Chambers? where the cauſe is the
ſame, why is not the effect the ſame?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Our Church accounts the elements
to be in uſe but common Bread and Wine after
the Sacrament is ended, and leaveth them to the
Miniſter to uſe at his pleaſure; why then ſhould
the Table have more reverence then the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
elements have when the ſupper is ended,
ſo as to reverence the one and not the other?
Why but doth not the Scripture ſay that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
doth conſecrate the gift and ſacrifice, and not
on the contrary the ſacrifice the Altar? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Altar is rather to be adored, then the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
or the outward elements? But ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
ſpirits in theſe dayes ſay the contrary, that
their ſacrifice ſanctifies their altar, and Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
really preſent in the ſacrifice this makes their
altar to be ſo holy and ſo worſhipfull ever after,
that it makes it worthy to be bowed unto: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſacrifice or outward elements ſhould
much rather be adored after the Sacrament then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94027:13"/>
the Communion Table: thus they are contrary
to themſelves, but I ſhall conclude this with the
ſaying of our Lord and Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 23. 26.
When they ſhall ſay unto you, loe here is Chriſt,
or there is Chriſt, (as they ſay of the Altar, and
Maſſe, and Sacrifice) go not forth unto them; let
not any that feares God, or loves his own ſoul,
ſtep out of doores to ſee the Maſſe-Chriſt, or
to altar-Chriſt, much leſſe to bow down to him.
Thus far of the Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Now for the aſſumption, that a raile about the
Communion table (or ſuppoſed Altar) is an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
or invitation to idolatrous bowing is clere
by daily experience; the more that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tables are dect and adored and ſequeſtred
from the reſt of the Church, the more the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of inherent holineſſe in the Table is
nouriſhed, and ſo much the more perſons
ſuperſtitiouſly addicted will ſhew unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
reverence to the Table, yea let mee tell
you what I have ſeene my ſelfe, at the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sir <hi>Thomas Fanſhawes</hi> Chappell in <hi>Ware</hi>
parriſh, being Miniſter of the place, I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Biſhop to bee preſent by all
meanes, being there I ſaw the Biſhop himſelfe,
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and diverſe others, that bowed to,
or at the leaſt towards the Table being railed in,
before that any Sacrament was adminiſtred at it.
Was it not a worſhipfull joyner, that made ſuch
a worſhipfull Table, yea, that ſuch great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
ſhould do ſuch obeyſance unto? ſurely the
adoring and railing in of the Table was a ſpeciall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94027:14"/>
invitation to this adoration, which otherwiſe they
will not doe to a common table in a Parlor or a
joyners ſhop, no nor a table in a Church not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in. Thus much of the third argument.</p>

chap. 9. 1.—11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where firſt that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
is called a wordly Sanctuary; ſo it is in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the times of the new teſtament, eſpecially
in reſpect of that heavenly Sanctuary provided
for us: it is for worldly, ſenſuall, and carnall hearts
to ſet up ſuch a Sanctuary now. Secondly, verſe
8. 9. the firſt Tabernacle was a figure for the
time then preſent, a figure of things revealed in
the Goſpell, and a meere type and ſhadowe, but
now the body being come, the ſhadowes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
away; againe it ſerved onely for the time
then preſent, <hi>i.</hi> the times under the Law,
whilſt the Leviticall prieſthood laſted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now hath no further uſe in the Churches of
Chriſt. Thirdly, verſe 10. they were carnall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94027:14"/>
impoſed onely till the times of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<hi>i.</hi> till the comming of Chriſt, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
ver. 11. in a word, when the veile of
the Temple rent from the top to the bottome,
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sanctuary ceaſed, and what will any
man now dare to ſow up the veil again, by making
a new Sanctuary? or is not this to deny the death
and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt? Fourthly, how is that
to be meant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. Whom God ſet forth
to bee the propitiation for our ſins? the word
ſignifies a mercy-ſeat. The <hi>Iewiſh</hi> mercy-ſeat in
the Holy of Holies was always ſhut up, and none
of the people might enter into it: but Chriſt is
ſuch a mercy-ſeat as is ſet forth openly to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and people, that all ſorts may lawfully and
freely repaire unto; which was one of the greateſt
mercies that ever God beſtowed upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for ſo indeed Chriſt is called the gift of
God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 10. there is no other gift of God to
be compared with this. But what a curſed ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is this to lock up the mercy-ſeat againe?
yea, ſo to lock it up, as that neither Miniſters, nor
People ſhall enter in: for truly ſo they doe in
effect by their railing about of the Communion
Table, the people are excluded out, it is an Holy
of Holies to them (as M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

truly they are lockt up within the railes,
and goe to their ſuppoſed Altar; but they that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94027:15"/>
ſerve at the Tabernacle (as was ſaid before) have
nothing to do with the Altar Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that
as our Saviour charged the Scribes, and Phariſe,
and Lawyers, <hi>Mat. 23. 13. Luke</hi> 11. 52. You
have taken away the key of knowledge, you ſhut
up the Kingdome of Heaven againſt men, and
neither enter in your ſelves, nor ſuffer thoſe that
would to enter in; as they dealt with the written
word, ſo deale our Prelates both about the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word and the word incarnate too, they keep
away the word faithfully preached from the
people, and will neither preach it themſelves,
nor ſuffer others that would to preach it, or heare
it, they keepe away Jeſus Chriſt (the true Altar)
at leaſt in his ſimplicity as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
2. and will neither partake of Chriſt themſelves,
nor ſuffer others to partake of him: They are
like dogs ſleeping in a manger, that will neither
eate oates themſelves, nor ſuffer the horſes to
eate them that would. Thus far of the former

                  <p>This propoſition may be cleered by the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sanctuary, given to us in the
Scripture, for what is the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sanctuary, but a
moſt holy place, where Gods glorious preſence
eſpecially dwels, whither it was not lawfull for
any to goe but only for the Prieſt, ordinarily once
a yeere, and upon ſome extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
and doth not the railed Table inferre all
this? that it is the holy of holy place, where God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94027:15"/>
is more eſpecially preſent then in any other part
of the Church, or upon the whole earth beſides?
is it not the place whither the Prieſt only and not
the people may enter? they muſt ſtand (or kneel
rather) as the people at the foot of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
and none may goe within the raile or range with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great prophanation, and all this too, when
the Prieſts doe enter, it is mainly once a yeere at
Eaſter: and then forſooth ſome of the Prieſts are
ſo devout, that they make Religion of it, to put
off their ſhoos from off their feet before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
within the rails; for ſay they did not God
command <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo to doe in the like caſe, ſaying,
put off thy ſhooes from off thy feet, &amp;c. The
Sacrament is appointed indeed for Chriſtians
communion with Chriſt, and among themſelves,
yea, and the people have as much right to draw
neer to Chriſt, as the Miniſters have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.
and therefore to draw neer to the Table too: but
the Prieſts would ſeeme to be holier then all the
reſt, and the people, if they will have communion
among themſelves they may, but the Prieſt is in
his Cloſet and Cloyſter by himſelfe, and muſt
have no communion with lay or carnall people,

                  <p>The <hi>major</hi> or firſt propoſition is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Churches of God ſhould be done decently and in
order, which place is ignorantly alleaged by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts
in the defence of Ceremonies, for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
Ver. 37. tels the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the things
that hee wrote unto them were the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God: he doth not leave it to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
or any other Church, to invent what they
pleaſe themſelves for order or decencie, but hee
doth ſtrictly binde them to the commandements
of God, and hee charges them, that even the
things commanded by God ſhould be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
and in order, now the commandement of a
Magiſtrate, or any Church-governours, doth not
make a thing to be decent and orderly becauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94027:16"/>
they command it (for then if they command the
worſhipping of Images, or Crucifixes, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
elſe though never ſo wicked, ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be decent and orderly by vertue of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement)
for that is orderly which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
orderly, and which is according to the
rule of order, and that is decent, not that man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
ſo, (for that which is decent and highly
eſteemed amongſt men is an abomination in the
ſight of God) but that is decent, that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
decent, and which is according to the rule
of decencie, which is not the will of any man
upon earth, but the revealed will of God alone;
but here we ſee that whatſoever occaſions diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is contrary to the Apoſtles rule: Again <hi>ver.</hi> 26
of the ſame Chapter there is an other rule, Let
all things be done to edification; now that which
breeds unity and uniformity in ſin, doth not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
but deſtroy, and make men like unto Devils,
for they have ſuch an unity and uniformity, their
Kingdome is not divided among themſelves; ſee
alſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 2.</p>
                  <p>The aſſumption or ſecond propoſition hath
been proved already in the former Reaſons, for
ſurely that which breeds uniformity in Jewiſh
and Popiſh ſuperſtition is uniformity in ſin and

                  <p>But I adde for further proof of the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That which breeds ſcandall and offence to all

conſciences, breeds rather diſorder then order.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the proof of the propoſition, ſee <hi>Rom. 14.
1 Cor.</hi> 8. the whole Chapters are ſpent in this,
<hi>That ſcandals are carefully to be avoided in the Church,</hi>
1 Cor. 10. 32. <hi>Give no offence to the Jews or Gentiles,</hi>
or to the Churches of God. <hi>Aquin. 2. 2. qu. 43.
art. 2. Scandalum activum ſemper eſt peccatum in eo qui
ſcandalizat, vel quia ipſum opus quod facit eſt pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
vel etiam ſi habeat ſpeciem peccati, dimittendum
eſt ſemper proximi, charitatem, ex qua unuſquiſque
tenetur ſaluti proximi providere, &amp; ſic qui non

ſcandall is always a ſin in him that gives offence,
either becauſe that the worke that hee doth is a
ſin, or alſo if it hath a ſhew of ſinne, it is always
to be omitted for the love of our neighbour, by
which every one is bound to provide for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his neighbour, and ſo hee that doth not
omit that which is ſcandalous ſins againſt chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and this agrees very well with that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
1 <hi>Cor. 14. 15. Such as give offence to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
walk not charitably:</hi> and it is a ſhame for us
that Papiſts ſhould be more charitable in their
judgement, and tender over the conſciences of
poore Chriſtians then we are. Yet it is a received
definition of a ſcandall among the Schoolmen,
that it is <hi>dictum aut factum minus rectum praebens oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionem
ruinae,</hi> now though an action be not evill
of it ſelfe, yet if it hath an appearance of evill, it
is leſſe right then it ought to be, becauſe it is
done inordinately, and is an occaſion of ſinne,
and falling to another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94027:17"/>
Now for the ſecond propoſition, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
to receive at a raile cauſe offence to
Chriſtians experience ſufficiently proves, there
being but few Congregations in this Kingdome,
where ſome have not been offended and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
by the rail, and this new injunction of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at a rail.</p>
                  <p>Two things only are replyed in this caſe. Firſt,
that this is a ſcandall taken not given, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in ſuch caſes not to be omitted for ſuch a
kind of offence, as our Saviour himſelf regarded
not the offence of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
told him, <hi>Mat. 15. 12. Knoweſt thou not that the
Phariſees were offended after they heard this ſaying,</hi> our
Saviour anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Verſe 14. Let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
they are blind leaders of the blind, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they ſay that Magiſtrates are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
likewiſe by the refuſall of, and not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the ceremonies, as well as weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are offended by the practice of them, and
whether of theſe, thinke you, in this caſe is to be
moſt regarded, a Magiſtrate or a weak Chriſtian?</p>
                  <p>To the firſt of theſe I anſwer, that though it
were granted that the offence here ſpecified is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
onely and not given, yet even paſſive offences
are many times to bee avoided, as namely, when
the things are not neceſſary (as the preaching of
the truth by our Saviour was, at which the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
were offended) though they be otherwiſe
commendable; the brazen Serpent was a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſet up of <hi>Moſes</hi> by divine inſtitution and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
yet <hi>Hezechias</hi> brake it in peeces and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94027:18"/>
called it <hi>Nechuſtan,</hi> or a piece of Braſſe, becauſe
it was not a neceſſary monument, and now the
People ſtumbled at it, though there was no juſt
occaſion of offence given to them; ſo <hi>Gideons Ephod</hi>
was onely a monument of a great victory, that
God had wrought for him, yet the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went
a whoring after it, and abuſed it to idolatry, after
the death of <hi>Gideon,</hi> and it became a ſnare to his
houſe <hi>Jud.</hi> 8. 27. yea it is a common principle of
nature, that we muſt hurt no man, and therefore
we muſt doe nothing whereby any man may be
hurt, or grieved, or wounded, this was ſignified
by thoſe judiciall laws <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. when the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
were commanded to make battelments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the tops of their houſes, leſt they ſhould bring
the guilt of blood upon them, and <hi>Exodus</hi> 21. 33.
he that diggs a pit and covers it not, if an Oxe,
or an Aſſe fall into it, the digger of the pit ſhall
make it good: the like Divines by good reaſon
gather in caſe of danger to the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>But now the argument is yet ſtronger, if that
which had not an appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of evil (as the brazen
Serpent, and <hi>Gideons</hi> Ephod) yet was to be taken
away &amp; deſtroyed, being a paſsive ſcandal onely,
how much more that which hath an apperance
of evill, as the preſent additions to Gods worſhip
have, for then it is not onely a paſſive ſcandall
that proceeds from his weakeneſſe only that falls,
but alſo active in reſpect that it gives occaſion of
offence.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond I anſwere, that it is a vaine plea
to ſay that magiſtrates are offended by the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94027:18"/>
of ceremonies, as well as weake Chriſtians
by the injoyning of them, for that is not to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an offence that is taken by any mans diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to an unjuſt command: might not <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
alſo have made this plea, when thoſe three
noble <hi>Jewes</hi> would not worſhip his golden image?
And <hi>Jeroboam</hi> likewiſe when the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
and godly <hi>Iſraelites</hi> refuſed to go up to <hi>Dan</hi>
and <hi>Bethell?</hi> why, theſe Puritan Miniſters, and
People, regard not the offence of the King and
State, but all they ſtand upon, is that themſelves
are offended and ſcandalized, belike then they are
more to be reſpected then governours themſelves;
againe it is a ſilly pretence, that they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of offences, that have power to reform them
and to take away the occaſions of them, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
damage to themſelves, as Magiſtrates may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doe by their command.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond pretence for railes is, leſt that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

ſome ſpeciall reaſon. It were a ſenſeleſſe reaſon to
ſay, that a King becauſe he is a man ſhould have a
guard attending upon him, his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellors of ſtate,
his pallace, his power to call Parliaments, to
preſſe Souldiers, &amp;c. if this were a good ground,
then every man, becauſe he is a reaſonable creature,
muſt have all theſe royalties: or to ſay, that a
garden, becauſe it hath trees, and herbs, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
therefore it ſhould be incloſed, or fenced and
walled in; nay but there is a ſpeciall reaſon for
both theſe; Kings have ſuch great priviledges, and
State, becauſe God hath given ſuch power unto
them, and becauſe of the great charge that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them above other men, and the ſafety of all the
people ſtands in their preſervation and ſafety, ſo
gardens are incloſed and fenced in, becauſe of the
ſpeciall fruitfulneſſe, uſefulneſſe, and vertue that
is in them, above common fields; here is now a
ſpeciall reaſon for the ſpeciall and peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
both of the one and of the other; ſo in the
caſe in hand, there muſt be found ſome peculiar
reaſon why the Communion Table ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
rather then other parts, or inſtruments of wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip
in the Church, for the rule of Logick holds

                  <p>All theſe pretended diſconveniences of annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94027:19"/>
are common to other inſtruments or uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils
about Churches, as to the Font, to the Pulpit,
to the Bible, or reading-ſeat, &amp;c. for why ſhould it
be a greater annoyance, for Dogs to fowle, or
boyes, or men to lay their hats, or to tell money
upon the Table (after the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper is adminiſtred) then it is for the ſame or
the like anoyances to bee done to the Font or
Bible, or Pulpit, or reading ſeat? It was indeed
a reaſon of a great Prelate of this Land given to
my ſelfe for the ſetting up of rails; Why ſaid he,
What if there ſhould be Cows in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
if the Church-dores be open, is it fitting or
decent, that the Cows ſhould come and play the
beaſts at the holy Table? but what would not
this filthineſſe defile other parts of the Church, as
well as the holy Table (as he called it?) or ſhould
we therefore ſay, that every part of the Church
ſhold have a particular rail about it, or rather that
the whole Church ſhold be railed about, that one
rail might ſerve for al, for fear of ſuch defileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts?
But the truth is, that our Prelates have ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
myſtery of ſpeciall holineſſe in the Table a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
other parts of the Church (as was ſpecified
before) but that is utterly ungrounded in the
Word of God, and unreaſonable, and ſtinkes of
the breaden and dunghill God, and is odious ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
and therefore to be abhorred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third pretenſe for rails refuted, that they doe
make for the Miniſters eaſe, it being trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to him, to goe with the elements from ſeat to
ſeat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94027:20"/>
                     <hi>If the obſervation of Chriſts owne inſtitution be far
more eaſe to the Miniſter, then can come by the
ſetting up of rails, and the peoples repayring to
them to receive, then by their own plea the former
is better then the latter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the obſervation of Chriſts owne inſtitution is
far more eaſe to the Miniſter, then can come by
the ſetting up of rails, and the peoples repayring
to them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not need to prove the former propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the conſequence; for let this be granted on
both ſides, that that courſe is to be obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, that
may breed the moſt eaſe and the leaſt trouble
both to Miniſtery and people.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I will come to the aſſumption, to
prove that the inſtitution of our Saviour Chriſt
will bring more eaſe and leſſe trouble both to
Miniſtery and people. For the cleering of this
I will ſhew that Chriſt never ordained that the
Miniſter ſhould goe about to every Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
to deliver the Bread and Wine unto him,
much leſſe that the Miniſter ſhould ſay a prayer
to every Communicant in the delivery of the
elements of Bread and Wine. For firſt Chriſt ſaid
in the plurall number, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Take yee, eat yee,
drinke yee all of this,</hi> but hee never practiſed, nor
commanded to ſay, Take thou, eat thou, drinke
thou, &amp;c. ſo <hi>Fenner</hi> in his doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſaith, that this ſpeech in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is moſt fit to ſignifie the communion and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
of the Church in this worke, ſeeing Chriſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94027:20"/>
by his Miniſters exhorts all the Communicants,
as it were with one expreſſion of common love
and charity, that they ſhould rejoyce and eat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the ſame ſpirituall food of faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But it will be ſaid, that Miniſters muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to every one in particular the promiſes of the
Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, but muſt they therefore deliver
the elements in particular to every one, <hi>i.</hi> cannot
the application be made but by changing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of adminiſtration appointed by Jeſus Chriſt?
When the Miniſter preaches the Word, hee doth
particularly apply the promiſes of the Goſpell,
yet he doth not go to every man in particular in
the Congregation, ſo as to go from ſeat to ſeat,
from man to man, to ſay, believe thou &amp; then, &amp;c.
all believers apply theſe things to themſelves by
faith: yea, but in the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Miniſter changes the words of promiſe
into a prayer, ſaying, <hi>The body of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt that was given for you, &amp;c.</hi> true they have
theſe words, but in the Canon of the Maſſe (for
there is the riſe of them) and they doe not utter
them to the people but to God, as intending ſome
oblation to him, or as if it were a great impiety
to diſtribute the elements to ſuch as kneele de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly,
before they have uttered thoſe words
charm-wiſe to conſecrate the Bread and Wine to
every one in particular, which is all one, as if
when thanks are given to God at meals for a
company met together, ſome Zelot ſhould goe
and give thanks for every man in particular.</p>
                  <p>Again, when as Chriſt ſaid, take and eat, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94027:21"/>
meaning is not, that hee gave to every one of
them that ſate at the Table in particular the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Bread and Wine, no, though it be ſaid
hee gave to the Diſciples, for ſo, <hi>Marke</hi> 6. 39-41.
our Saviour commanded the <hi>Diſciples, that all the
multitudes ſhould ſit downe by companies upon the green
graſſe, and they ſat down in ranks by hundreds and by
fifties, and when he had taken the five loaves &amp; two fiſhes,
he looked up to heaven, and bleſſed and brake the loaves,
and gave to the Diſciples to ſet before them, and the two
fiſhes divided he among them all,</hi> and yet it follows
not that either Chriſt or his Diſciples gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
and particularly to the five thouſand
men, but they ſet them before them; ſo in this
caſe: and this even Jeſuits, <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
and with them in this particular, <hi>Beza</hi> and
<hi>Piſcator</hi> doe agree, and it may cleerly alſo be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the commandement of Chriſt, when hee
delivered the Cup ſaying, Divide it among your
ſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 17. Some anſwer indeed, that
thoſe words are to be underſtood not of the Cup
in the Lords Supper, but of the Cup uſed in the
Paſſeover; for of the cup in the Lords Supper our
Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. But I anſwer that in
both Verſes our Saviour ſpeakes of the ſame cup,
but that this precept of dividing it among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
is meant of the cup in the Euchariſt, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the proteſtation ſubjoyned in the next
Verſe, <hi>But I ſay unto you, That I will not drinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more of the fruit of the Vine, &amp;c.</hi> but the ſame
proteſtation in the other Evangeliſts, <hi>Math. 26. 29.
Mark</hi> 14. 23. is added touching the Lords Supper:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94027:21"/>
beſides if hee had made this proteſtation of the
paſchall cup that hee would not drinke any more,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> He would not have afterwards drunke of the
cup in the Euchariſt. But on the contrary, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts
<hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> ſay that after he had
reached forth the Cup in the Lords Supper, hee
proteſted that hee would no more drinke of the
fruit of the Vine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore hee had already
drunke of it. Now to gather up this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if our Saviours courſe of holy inſtitution
might ſtand, that the Miniſter ſhould deliver the
outward elements to one or two that were nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
unto them, and the communicants ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the reſt among themſelves, might not the
Miniſter have more eaſe and farre leſſe trouble
without any raile? Yea, would not this prevent
that intollerable protracting and lengthning of
Sacraments, when there is a great multitude of
Communicants, (which is occaſioned by a raile,
and the particular diſtribution of the elements,
and forme of Prayer joyned with it) as it falls out
in many popular Congregations, ſo that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
laſt many times two or three houres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?

and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c. and that thou enquire not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

their Gods? Thou ſhalt not doe ſo to the
Lord thy God: for every abomination to the
Lord, which he hates, have they done to their
Gods; whatſoever thing I command you, that
obſerve to doe it, thou ſhalt not adde thereto, nor
diminiſh from it: therefore, 2 <hi>Chron. 13. 9. Abijah</hi>
reproves <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his army, that they had
made them Prieſts after the manner of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

but becauſe upon the diſlike of rails pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

               <p>Oh the patience of our good God, that endures
ſuch blaſphemies to be daily belched out in theſe

againſt Heaven! Belike then his Highneſſe edicts

equall binding force with the Commandements
of Almighty God, and his raile is of like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with the pattern that God ſhewed <hi>Moſes</hi> on
the Mount, and the heavenly figure of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle;
yea, ſhould a man ſpeak againſt the flax or

even in thoſe dayes, beſides in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> days,
the Idoll of the Maſſe, and unbloudy ſacrifice was

friends, thus far I yielded, and truly very baſely
and timorouſly, I deny not, I will not goe about
to plead now for that accurſed fact, nor excuſe
my ſelfe by the greatneſſe of my temptations and

truth of Chriſt, and been aſhamed of him in this
adulterous and ſinfull generation, worthy alſo to

the Lord, not to lay this ſin to my charge, and
his people to forgive the ſcandall of it, or rather
not to take offence at it; and do willingly to make
up this breach, forgoe all the certaine comforts
that I had upon the earth; onely let this be added,
which I muſt needs ſpeake for caution to others,
that I perceived evidently whilſt I was confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable

the Lord be thanked, that though I was a ſervant

               <p>It is then (I hope) upon farre other, and far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

then that I yielded upon at the firſt; this I did raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
