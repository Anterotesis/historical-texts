            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now bycause their giftes be diuerse, some more, some lesse, according to the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and measure of Gods spirit, thereafter is oure portion: and yet all that are lawfullye called and orderly qualifyed, are the vndoubted Ministers of the Lorde: and (howsoeuer you wyll answere the contrarye) it is as truely sayd of a Pastor now, as it was euer of any Prophet or Apostle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth you receiueth me, &amp; the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">

               <p>Two principall notes doe arise by due consideration of this that I haue sayde. Firste, that againste flattering falsehode, we vse faithful flatnesse.

the number of graces, whiche concerne a Steward, without the which he shall doe his maister but simple, small, and very slender seruice. Wherefore séeyng one Christe is the soule &amp; substance of all Scriptures, the only marke of both Prophets and Apostles, and the onely matter of all their doctrine: as <hi>Paule</hi> curseth all aftercommers that shall Preach any other Gospell, yea though he be an Angell: so he pardoneth no predecessor that hath broched any other doctrine, though he were a Prophete. Let vs then with Trustinesse (the first note) ioine Wisedome, the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d also, as two legges to goe withal, or handes to labour in the haruest of the Lorde. I am not héere to giue out anye rules, or to prescribe preceptes of wisedome, for I am not so skilfull to teach that way: I had more néede learne a great deale. Neither is it my purpose to reprehende anye of my bréethren, for I knowe no such cause, and if there were, yet as this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12018:5"/>
place is vnméetest of any, so is my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vnfyttest of all: only this I saye at a venture, I would we were al as wise as I hope we are faithfull: and howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we excuse our selues before God, we can not iustly be accused among men, no not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carping enimie himselfe, who commeth for the same nonce, can conuince vs the contrary, but that wée kéepe touch with the veritie written, &amp; speake wisedome, not of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> Oracles, nor inuentions and fables of mans brayne, but the infallible truth of the holye Ghost. Wisedome is to deuide &amp; cut the word kindly, to breake this bread skilfully, to giue euery man his portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a good disposer, to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counsaile his part, to the weake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte his, to the wicked correction hys, to the obstinate condemnation his, for so the word is profitable, and the word is plentiful, euen for euery sore a salue. And howsoeuer I shall deale in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I am sure I am well ynough for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12018:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the choosing of my texte, for while I thought to fytte a plaister for the féete, I saw the head diseased, and finding the whole body in the same pickle, I knew not what to doe: full fayne I woulde haue deliuered anye péece of scripture rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, but I could not so ridde my handes of it, till it hadde passed my mouth: turne whether I would, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place was lyke vnto it and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expounding it, so that whylest I soughte a texte, I founde a Sermon, A Sermon of the Prophete Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye to Israell. I praye GOD make it a profitable Sermon to London. Amen.</p>
               <p>Giue me leaue therfore to be plaine I praye you, for I professe no other thyng, and if I could otherwise, yet of purpose I would deceiue all such curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commers, as neyther hunger nor thirst after righteousnesse, but with it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching eares delighte themselues wyth stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge things which are forespoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in

the .2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. And it shall be a good note for me now, and for al my bréethren for euer héereafter that are planted in thys Citie, to be knowen by this marke of playne speaking: not that familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in you hathe bredde contempte in vs, for there is no suche cause but that your contempte of God shoulde bréede boldnes in vs which are his ministers: and there is such a commaundemente, and therfore as we sée more than other, so are we bound to say more, except you would haue vs sée all and say nothing. And though héere I shall say nothyng, but that that hath bin sayd, yet that is no shame to me. But I woulde fayne knowe of all that hath bin sayde, what hathe bin done, whiche is, or may bée a great shame for you.</p>
               <p>Desperate were the dayes of Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, wherein superstition and sinne (as two scorpions) were growen so ranke, that high time it was for the very safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods remnant, that the sounde

               <p>It is lamentable (my brethren) that the husbandmans corne can fynde no good ground, but the enimies tares not sowne but shed and scattered, doe yet take roote, prosper and preuayle, to the vtter choking and smothering of the Lords haruest.

Let him that hath a gift to tarry, praise God for it, and let him not triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him that hathe it not: and yet I woulde euerye man were as he.

And here I haue a sute to your honours, I wyll not spare to speake, howsoeuer I speede, I shall discharge my conscience yet, and the burden shal be yours: it is to renewe my petition, whiche once I made to your predicessor, for poore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned prisoners: make no such poste hast I beséech you, that you da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger their soules with their bodies. They are cut off to saue their soule, but &amp; you make no care of that, take héede that you haue not as short a warning, and a more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne departing your selues. God hath giuen you faire warning, by many late and lamentable examples, euen of your own Cloke. I discommend not due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Iustice, it is no piece of my meaning, but mercy is alwayes better

than Sacrifice. Wherefore let it euer ioyne with your iustice, or else there is no difference betwéene damning &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning on your part: the olde Poetes had a blind saying, (<hi>Dimittamte orco</hi>) Ile sende thée to hel, when anye man was don to death: but Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter phrase (I trow) &amp; I truste they go to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wel, to draw toward a conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with you which are our honorable gouernour and <hi>Maior</hi> of this Citie, you must remember that you are chosen in the time of a plague, and therfore in the time of sinne: you are come to a sicke &amp; a sore citie, you must therfore play both the Phisition and Surgeon, you muste awake out of <hi>Endimions</hi> sleepe, and thrust dilligently your sword of iustice in, to launce out all corruption and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage which is gathered in the bowels, we stoppe not our nose so at the plague, as the Lord doth stoppe hys nose at our sinne: the stincke of London is come vp before hym, God hath a worke to doe

by you, do not the Lordes worke negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, for feare of a curse: <hi>Tully</hi> true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayde (<hi>Magistratus virumindicat</hi>) au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie doth declare a man, whether he Loue superstition or religion, whether he loue Iustice or brybes, whether he be inclined to mercy or to crueltie, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be couetous or liberal: and if hee be a Lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his pawes: or if he be a Wolf, his iawes wil soone bewray him: the cry of the Orphane &amp; oppressed wil Hunte him and finde him out.</p>
               <p>It co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes to my minde, those three ships, se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to <hi>Mar.

To thys end I tell you thys, bycause wee haue more than thrée shippes ful, by oddes. I
<pb facs="tcp:12018:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wyl not saye, the Cittie is ful: but sure adulterers and Harlottes, théeues and Uacaboundes do swarme in most pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the same, and no marueyle, for Dicing houses, Daunsing schooles, bowling-aleyes, Alehouses, are almoste lawlesse in euery place: me thinkes the policye were as good to note on those places (<hi>LORD HAVE MERCIE VPON VS</hi>) as on infected houses, &amp; more néede to, euen at this time, if there were due searche, you shoulde finde my words true. Seruice or Sermon, all is one to them. I leaue to tell the ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, contempte of God, and of good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, blasphemy and vilanous spéeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee rather Diuels than Christians. You cannot haue all of me nowe, giue eare to other when they come, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séeche you, and in anye case despise not the leaste that the Lorde doeth sende: so shall you shewe in youre yeares
