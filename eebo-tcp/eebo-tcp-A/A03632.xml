            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The whyche kynde of iniury, doubtles the Lorde

Therefore, against this kynde of iniurye, he spake

my fayth also mooste humbly to be iudged by your
Maiestie, your most honourable Counsel, with the
godly assemblaunce of your maiesties most hyghe

by sinister report, and false slaunder of Gods word,
to the conscience of any of your maiesties subiectes.
For I am credibly infourmed that many false, and

mooste humbly my selfe and my faith to be knowne,
and iudged bi your maiestie, after the worde of god.
I protest before god, and your maiestie, I wryt not

it were not onely synne, but also the very parte

therof, seing all godly men haue estemed more
the true worde of God, then theyr owne mortall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
The seconde cause, that toucheth youre Mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and your mooste honorable Counsell, is because
vpon credyte, and good opinion, and partly by expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rience,
that your maiestie had both of my true fayth
and godly zeale: appoynted me (amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other of your

of those that a Kynges maiestie shall appoynte to
preach, and would not be glad, both for Gods sake
and his kyngs, to remoue such vngodly bruites, yf
he can, for the peace and quietnes of their subiects.

in me, I do by this Protestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my fayth, cal him
to repentaunce. And incase any man stand in doubt
of myne opinion and meanyng in religion: Let hym
not damne me before time, but vse the meanes with
me that the .x.<note place="margin">Iosi. xxii.</note> Tribes of Israel vsed wyth the Tribe
of Ruben, Gad, &amp; halfe the tribe of Manasses, that
buy it at their returne to their possessions, an aulter
vpon the borders of Iordane the whych fact was
lyke to haue ingendered great warres. But it was
stayed by the meanes of consultation, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
had with those that buylded it: and theyr
myndes knowne, the dissention was ended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased.
Euen so I wold desyre my christe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to vse me (for I haue built no aulters of ydolatry) if
they be in doubt of me in any thyng, &amp; not to kyll by
hearesay, nether before they haue heard me speake.
Thus I pray God, both thei and I may serch
alwaies to liue in his feare, to obeie oure
Kinge, and to be profitable, and true
members of this Realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.

wyl speake accordyng to the doctrine

punishmentes of euyl, lawful domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

without which a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth maye
not endure. Thei haue condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the ministery, and ministers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes

and charitable loue, they confounde.
Thei vse the ministerye of the churche

them selues to be of such perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            <p>And the other they vse wyth suche

Nowe I wyl declare my fayth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that heare
the gospell of Christ and vse his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
as he hath instituted them. In
the whyche congregatyon the spyryte
of God worketh the saluacion of al be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers,
as saynte Paule sayeth:<note place="margin">Rom. i.</note> The

it is hearde and beleued, the mynde is
chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged by the vertue of the holy gost,
from the loue of synne, vnto the loue

of euerlastyng life. And these
two markes, the true preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of gods

               <pb facs="tcp:18426:26"/>
Vnto the which churche, I woulde all
Christian men shoulde assosiate them
selues, although there may happen to
be some things desired in maners and
discipline. For no church as touchyng
thys parte, can be absolutely perfecte.
But where as the doctryne is sounde,
and no Idolatry defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that church
is of God, as farre as mortal man can
iudge. And wher as this doctrine and
right vse of Sacramentes be not, ther
is no church of Christ, though it seme
neuer so holi. For in the blessed virgins
time, the Pharisies, and bishops, wer
accompted to be the true church: yet by
reason their doctrine was corrupt, the
true Church rested not in them, but in
Simeon,<note place="margin">Luke. i. ii.</note> zacharye, Elisabeth, the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes
&amp; other. The same doth saynte

The other marke is the right vse of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes,
wherof were two in noum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
wyth the fathers, in the ministerye
of the church, and so many yet be wyth
vs in the ministerie of the churche, and
haue annexed vnto them the promyse
of eternal saluation, and also of eternall
damnacion if they be contemned, and
may be lawfully hadde. In the lawe of
Moses was Circumcision and the Pas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>call
Lambe: &amp; in theyr places we haue
Baptisme and the Supper of the Lord
dyuers in externall elementes, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remonies,
but one ineffect misterie, and
thing it selfe, sauing that theyr Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes

ours declare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> graces of God to be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in Christe that is alredye come: so that
the Sacramentes be not chaunged, but
rather the Elementes of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes.
And euerye of these Sacramentes
<pb facs="tcp:18426:27"/>

of all gods Sacramentes in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the churche. And of Baptisme
because it is a marke of our Christian
church,<note place="margin">Roma. iiii.</note> this I iudge after the doctryne
of Saint Paul, that it is a seale and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

his obedience ar his, wherof baptisme
is the signe, seale and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For
although frely by the grace of god our
synnes be forgeuen: yet the same is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by the Gospel, receiued by faith
and sealed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacramentes, whyche

               </gap>s that saye
Circumsicion was the seale, not onely
of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s acceptation freely into the
grace of God by faith, but also of hys
obedience and proper iustice: I beleue it
not to be trewe, for. S. Paul confuteth
it, in the same place as an errour, sayi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g wherof he mighte

<pb facs="tcp:18426:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confirmed that he gaue him, &amp; not that
he found in him, for S. Paul saith, that
Circumcision was the seale of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith, &amp; not by workes.
They be out of the way, that haue the
lyke opinion of baptisme, for S. Paul
disputeth not in that place, whether
works plese god,<note place="margin">Rom. iiii. ix.</note> but sheweth that our
saluacion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by grace, and not bi
workes. Ther be other that think Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
to be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of our fre acceptacyon into gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
by fayth, but also of our obedye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
towardes God hereafter. And because
Infantes and young babes, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse
obedience, nor put of the olde man,
nor put on the newe, thei would exempt
and defraud the young chyldren of bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisme.
Saynt Paule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth also this
opinion in the same place.<note place="margin">Gen. xvii.</note> Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saith
he, beleued God, and it was acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to

professed obedience. Therfore God
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed his owne infallible truth and
<pb facs="tcp:18426:28"/>
promises to Abraham by circumcision,
and not Abrahams obedience. For if he
had, he had confirmed the weke and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>certayn
infirmitie of man, and not hys
own infallible truth. For Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth
all hys obedience was infyrme and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perfect
wythout Christ, Yet was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to work in a godly life. As for those that
say Circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Baptisme be like,
and yet attribut the remission of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
synne to Baptysme, whyche was
neuer gyuen vnto Circumcision, they
onelye destroye not the similitude and
equalitie that should be betwene them:
but also take from Christe remission of
synne, and translate it into the water,
and element of baptisme.</p>
            <p>As for the supper of the Lord, which
is the other Sacrament, whereby the
church of Christ is knowne, I beleue it
is a remembraunce of Christes death, a
seale &amp; confyrmation of his preciouse bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
geuen vnto death, wherwyth we are
redemed. It is a vysyble word, that pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth

            <p>I be leue that this holi sacrament hath

most, &amp; teacheth Christ contrary or and

wyth all my herte to se the churche
