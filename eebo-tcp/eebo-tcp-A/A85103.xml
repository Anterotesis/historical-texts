         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Phanatique
LEAGUE and COVENANT,
Solemnly enter'd into by the Aſſertors of the
GOOD OLD CAUSE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E Ignoble men, Barbers, Coblers, Colliers, Draymen, Grocers, Huckſters, Malſters, Pedlers, Sowgauters, Tinkers, Taylors,
and Mechanicks of all ſorts, being of the Fanatick party within the Kingdomes, (formerly ſo called) of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, living under, and Submitting to onely the Government of one Prince, Belzebub Emperor of the Infernal Region,
and having laid before us the advancement of his Scepter, with the utter deſtruction of all Earthly Kings, and National
Powers whatſoever, calling to mind the many coutrivances, and earneſt indeavors of the moſt of the people of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to reduce that ſtrife and confuſion, which we have been ſo many years in working, into Order and Vnity again, we
do now at laſt (after many in ſucceſſeful plots and fruitleſs attempts, for the preſervation of our Good Old Cauſe, and the
deſtruction of our enemies) reſolve and determine, after the example of our dear brethren in Germany, under <hi>Muntzer, Hof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and <hi>Knipperdoling,</hi> to enter into a mutual confederacy by a ſolemne Proteſtation and Engagement, whereto we all
ſubſcribe, and each with hands poynting downwards, and a heart devoted to his Infernal Majeſty, doth ſwear:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. THat we ſhall from the very root of our corrupt hearts and conſciences, endeavour by all means poſſible, in our ſeveral capacities, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
and aboliſh all Decency, Order, and Form whatſoever, in the Government of Church or State, in the three Nations of <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Territories thereunto belonging; and that we will with all vigor poſſibly contend for the utter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of all Magiſtracy, Miniſtry, Univerſities, Schools of Learning, and all civil Decorum and Diſciplines, whereby we may be in any
thing reſtrained from our ambitious, malevolent, and moſt peſtilent Deſignes and Undertakings; or whereby the world may be ſo far undeceived,
as to diſcover what Miſchief and Confuſion we aim at, by the Pretence of Spiritual Gifts, and New Lights: And furthermore do, Declare, That
there is nothing more Hatefull and Abominable in our ſights, than that our Deſignes ſhould become manifeſt to Malignants, and the wicked of the
World.</p>
            <p>II. That (as we do in general hate all Reformation and Oder in all Affairs, either civil or Eccleſiaſtical, ſo) moſt eſpecially do we from the very
ſink of our ſouls deteſt, and abominate that Miſtris of Iniquity, Prelacy, as that whereby all our damnable projects are moſt in danger to be fruſtrated,
the thing called the ancient Church in all ages, and Nations of the world, having been thereby, and thereby only (as to outward means) preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
inviolate from the Sacriledge and glorious attempts, of the moſt renowned Hereticks, and ſervants of our good Lord, who alwayes rul'd in
the hearts of the diſobedient.</p>
            <p>III. We ſhall with a moſt perverſe obſtinacy, to the hazard of our lives and fortunes, aſſert our own intereſts and right of conqueſt, we had
uſurpt over the three Nations, againſt all pretended Priviledges of Parliament, Liberties of the People, and any general good whatſoever, that ſhall
ſeem to obſtruct our deſigns of Liberty, to domineer over the three Nations, by virtue of that Text, <hi>The Saints ſhall poſſeſs the earth.</hi> And we do moſt
inveterately devote our ſelves to the deſtruction of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the whole family of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> by whoſe introduction we are in ſo much
danger of that damnably abhor'd compoſure of all differencies, both in Church and State. And we will by all means poſible, contrive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of that potent enemy, General <hi>Monk</hi> and his Army.</p>
            <p>IV. We ſhall with all ſincerity to the hazard of our Eſtates and lives, endeavour the mutual ſupport of one another, whether under the Notion
of Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Fift Monarchiſts, Ranters, &amp;c. And notwithſtanding we differ in judgement from our ſelves, as well as from all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Chriſtians, yet we will make it appear to the world, and to the Author of that model of a Commonwealth, call'd the <hi>Rota,</hi> that we are a
Wheel, whoſe Spokes, though divided in the circumference, yet concenter in this, <hi>viz.</hi> A total extirpation and ſubverſion of all Government, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
and Civil.</p>
            <p>V. We do declare, promiſe, and proteſt againſt a thing, called, <hi>A Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> hatcht in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and brought over into <hi>England,</hi>
taken and ſubſcribed by many thouſands, but hitherto kept by few, which Covenant is now again revived by the preſent Parliament, and Ordered to
be publiſhed and placed in all Pariſh Churches and Chappels, as a main hinderance of our Schiſmatical deſignes, and prevention of the building of that
<hi>Babel</hi> of <hi>Confuſion,</hi> which we ſo earneſtly labour to accompliſh: And that we will to the utmoſt of our abilities, endeavour with all violence to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Juſtice, right or wrong, upon all thoſe who ſhall oppoſe our intereſt, by endeavouring to bring about that ſo much talkt-of <hi>Union</hi> in the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
between Prince and People, or the People with one another.</p>
