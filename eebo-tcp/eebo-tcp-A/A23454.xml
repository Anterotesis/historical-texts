            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>With thys aunſwere they of the league parted out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court to theyr lodginges, and ſhortly after to their houſes, and ſo to theyr Lordes, and from that time forth the warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne.

The enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Auguſt, after they had prouided the paſſage of Ratiſbone with .ii. C. Hackebutters. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprice was to them very Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, but more i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>portunat it might haue been: if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when they parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Auguſt thei had gone to Rattiſbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e

for then they ſhould haue found the Emperour ſo diſpurueyde, that hys remedy had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue gone down by the ryuer of Danubia, out of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, for as yet were not come the bendes vnder the conducte of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drucho &amp; of George. But the Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyardes of Hungarye came to the Emperour alone, and his number whych is worth much in Germany. Thys was our army, ordynaunce we had none, but we taryed for that whych ſhould come from Viene, ſo that al thynges wer vnprouyded, ſo that yf the enemyes had come, they ſhould haue obtayned theyr purpoſe without any withſtondyng. Thys was theyr fyrſt errour.</p>
            <p>At thys tyme the Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Launtgraue wrote a letter to his mageſtye. The ſumme whereof
<pb facs="tcp:340:13"/>
was, that they dyd vnderſtand that he would chaſtice certayn rebels ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to theyr deſertes, and that they wer much deſyrous to knowe becauſe thei would be ready to ſerue his Mageſtye. And yf he founde himſelf greued in any thing againſt any of them, they would be ready at his commaundement to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faccion according to reaſon.</p>
            <p>To thys letter his mageſty made no aunſwere, for not aunſweringe therto was his aunſwere. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wrote this letter, a great parte of their Campe was on foote, and had ſente to the Cities and Lordes of the League to ſende their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre according to their pomiſes. And Sebaſtiane Exartel, was now go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e from Auguſte to Inſburg, &amp; from thence to Tonauert, as the names

had byn lyght, for they had lefte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge at their backes to deſturbe them, but one bande of footmen ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge in Rayne.

Thys was theyr ſeconde errours, that they came not together to Ratiſbone, but went to Ratyn, whyche was to them gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen without any battarie, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred the garniſon to departe wyth Baner &amp; armour, and left one other of theirs: and came to Newburge, where thei pitched their Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe.

Maieſtie myght haue byn encloſed in Ratteſbone, for they had then bin in place where none of hys coulde haue come to Ratteſbone, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniardes &amp; I talians muſt nedes perforce haue come that waye. And likewiſe the Almayns from Silua Negra, &amp; they might haue left the place fortefied and turned agayne to Rattiſbone. This done, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a ruynous caſe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was very erneſt to prouide agaynſte this perell, and in perſon went to defende the towne, toward the which was ſet forth all the force and ſtrengthe of the enemyes. He lefte in Ratteſbone .iiii. M. Duche men and a Baner of Hiſpanyardes with the artilerye and munycyon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came from Viene. And geuing the charge thereof to Peter Colona.
<pb facs="tcp:340:17"/>
His maieſtie remoued with the reſt of the campe: and in two lodginges thei came to Landſen, he woulde not lodge within the towne, but he determined there to tarry for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and for the footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wer come out of Italy (if thei might come in time.) The newes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies coming encreaſed dayly, with knowlage that thei wer paſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulſtat. The Emperour hearyng theſe newes, ſent abrode for his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the meane time he choſe a place for to fight: for this was his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacion to do, ſith there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy, or els to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main peaceably, the whiche his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty determined that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer do. For I haue heard hi diuers tymes ſaye, (in ſpeakyng of this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible warre,) that dead or aliue he
<pb facs="tcp:340:18"/>
would tarryin Almayne. And with this determinacion he abode for the enemies, in whoſe parſon and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew was al our truſt. And knowing that Ratteſbone was ſette in place where thei coulde not paſſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues and tarried. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, camping and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining Minique and Ingulſtat in the meane time.</p>
            <p>¶ The Duke of Saxon and the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue ſent a page with a tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet to his maieſty, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> page brought a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a rodde, as it is the cuſtom of Almain, when one maketh warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an other. Thei wer called to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Aluoy captain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

puniſh none but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> make defaut, geuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proclamacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their baniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in print y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt their maſters. This me think was a direct anſwer. His ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ieſtye woulde not ſee the letter to the ſhame and rebuke of the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, to whome he had been good mayſter in tyme paſte. About thys tyme the footebende of Italie came vnto Landſen. It was one of the fayreſt bendes that euer I ſawe come out of Italy. They wer. x or xi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> M. footemen, and .vi. C. lyghte horſes, theyr general was Octauia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Farneſſe, neuew to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope. Alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Florence ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ii. C. light hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; one hundred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duke of Farrer, to ſerue his maieſty. At this tyme came in the Hyſpanyardes of Lumbardy, excellent ſouldyers,
<pb facs="tcp:340:19"/>
and a litle after, the good olde ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Naples. So theſe .iii. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were the flower of the old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Spayne.</p>
            <p>¶ Now the Almayns of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled in Silua negra, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming at hande, but thei had gone a great compaſſe, and many tymes they haue ſkirmiſhed with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by the way. Nowe there was in our camp the fourme of an army: for his mageſty had then with them in Ratteſbone .xvi. M. Almains, which wer receiued at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paye xx. M as thei be wont for to haue emongſt their footebandes. Thei wer about viii. M. Spaniardes, &amp; .x. M. Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and now came in .vi. C. horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the marques John from Boeme. The marques Alberte had viii. C. the maiſter of Pruſe had .ii.
<pb facs="tcp:340:19"/>
C. for al the other of the marques Albert, and of the Archduke might be .iiii. M. not yet come to the ryne, which was kept with the enemyes. Now his maieſtie, with the menne that he had broughte out of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with his court, and with .ii. C. horſes of the Archdukes, he had .ii. M. armed horſes. But as to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fote men, to my iudgement, I neuer ſaw the lyke. I did ſee the Almayns that his maieſty brought to Viene, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went againſt the Turke. I. dyd ſee the Spanyardes whiche were there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And likewiſe I did ſe the Italians, but none like vnto theſe. I did ſee the Almaynes, Hiſpany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, &amp; Italya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that his maieſtie led to Tunezey, &amp; thoſe that he lead after i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to ꝓuince, &amp; thoſe that he had whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he toke Gilderland, &amp; made the
<pb facs="tcp:340:20"/>
Frenche kyng to retyre with his campe from Camberſey. But as I thynke there was none of theſe like vnto this. Lykewyſe ſaye they, whiche were with his maieſtye in the warre of Sandaſier, and haue ſeen that campe, they ſaye that they were not lyke vnto theſe, although they were well choſen, the which I haue not ſene, I beyng abſent. After that al theſe were come together, he parted from Landſen, and went to Ratteſbone for to take his artillery and menne that he there lefte, and from thence to goe to ſeke hys ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes: and beyng at Ratteſbone, he commaunded to ſette forth ſixe and thyrtie peces of artillerye, leauing three banners to kepe the reſte. Then with his campe he tooke the waye to Ingulſtat, where the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
<pb facs="tcp:340:20"/>
entended to campe. It is from Ratteſbone to Ingulſtat .ix. leagues, whiche .ix. were deuyded in foure iourneys, ſo he came with his campe to a place vpon Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia called Newſtat, there was a bridge, but he cauſed two other to bee made of the barges whiche he brought in his campe, for he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to paſſe the riuer in any wiſe.</p>
            <p>¶ His maieſty being thus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, he was enfourmed that the duke of Saxon and the Lantgrane with al their campe, vpon the other ſide of Danubia, had taken the way to Ratteſbone, an enterpriſe well vndertaken. His maieſty ſent foure hundred Spanyardes, hackbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters horſed, &amp; .ii. baners of Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the whiche by their diligence the ſame nighte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were ſente,
<pb facs="tcp:340:21"/>
entred into Ratteſbone, the whiche was now ſure. For yf the enemyes came not, it was ſafe. And if thei came, they might defend vntil thei might haue reſcu fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p, which might wel be had, (Danubia beyng betwixt vs and our enemies.) But they ſeing that Ratteſbone was pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided, or becauſe thei perceiued that his maieſtye would paſſe the riuer, and lyi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g at their backes might take away theyr vitayles, beyng within iii. leagues of Ratteſbone, thei gaue a turne toward Ingulſtat, makyng great haſt to be out of the woodes &amp; ſtreyte paſſages, where it was thought they might haue bene well ouertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But we hauing no know ledge of the countrey, ſo that they with extreme dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did geat the playne field, ſo that when our lyght
<pb facs="tcp:340:21"/>
horſemen had paſſed the wode: they wer nere into Ingulſtat. His ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty in two daies paſſed the riuer, and lodged his campe in a valley, vpon a litle mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayn nere vnto the riuer, and this lodgyng was two myle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ingulſtat. This paſſage was of great importaunce, for it did not onely cauſe the enemyes to bee aduiſed: but alſo to be drieuen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to goe lyke Lordes in the fields as thei had done. For this ſhewed them that his determinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was to fight when tyme and place might ſerue. There our campe was fortified with a litle trenche, for the duke of Aluoy had ſo take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it neded not to make any other. There was alaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although it was not true, our ſouldiers were ſo well ordred that it might bee euidentlye
<pb facs="tcp:340:22"/>
ſene, how willyng they wer to fight.</p>
            <p>¶ At the ende of two dayes the Emperour parted from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hadde newes that the enemyes were lodged on the other parte of Ingulſtat ſixe myles. Wherfore he made ſpede to take theyr lodgyng that they had lefte the daye before that he departed from his. Nowe it was conueniente, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhould make haſte towarde Jugulſtat, and not to leaue it in peryl to be taken with the enemies: For why, from thence they myght lightlye haue diſtourbed monſuer de Bure from ioynyng with oure campe, or elles they myght haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theyr lodgyng betwixte it, and the place where we hadde lodged. But the Emperour conſyderyng howe muche it did importe, beeyng
<pb facs="tcp:340:22"/>
now ſo nere vnto the enemies to be euer their ſuperiour in lodgyng: he ſente to viewe two lodgynges, the one was a league from Ingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat, (whiche I haue ſpoken of,) and in oure waye. And the other neare vnto Ingulſtat vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſyde, for it behoued to take that nexte vnto the towne before the commyng of oure campe, the other in oure waye was good to be taken. Before that his maieſtye ſhoulde ſette foorth his campe, his intencion was to haue theſe two, ſo that if he mighte not occupye that nexte vnto Ingulſtat, yet that he myght lodge in the other, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the daye before, he hadde ſent John Baptiſta Gaſtaldo, may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Campe generall, for to bee particularlye viewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
<pb facs="tcp:340:23"/>
he with al ſpede that might bee, the next daye in the mornyng remoued his campe, the whiche went in partz vawarde &amp; battayle. The baggage and artillery vpon our left hand v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riuer ſide. Our horſmen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ryght hande, and the footemen i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the midſt. The duke of Aluoy did leade the vaward, and the Emperor the battayl. With the Duke we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the marques Albert and his horſemen, and the maſter of Pruſe. And with the Emperour, the Duke of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriche, and the prince of Pyemont, &amp; the marques John of Brande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge. The Hiſpanyardes, Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Italyans, moued confyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably to the order that was geuen them: ſo they went in the vawarde &amp; in the battayle. The Emperor mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, approched the firſte lodgyng
<pb facs="tcp:340:23"/>
that I haue ſpoken of, and there he reſted a litle, whyleſt the batail was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng. For now the vaward was euen at hande, and there he toke the duke of Aluoy and .xx. horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with hym, and rode vnto Ingulſtat for to be holde the other lodgyng nere thereunto.</p>
            <p>¶ It is nedeful particularly to know, that the ſame day the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the duke of Aluoy, the prince of Salmona, and Don Antony de Tolledo, with part of the light horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and two hundred hackbutters Hiſpanyardes horſed, for to haue knoweledge of the enemies, (with whom they had a fayre and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſkyrmiſh,) the enemies being come forth therto with great ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. But the ſkirmiſhe beyng the one parte &amp; the other retired: they turned again
<pb facs="tcp:340:24"/>
and came foorth, increaſing ſo theyr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> number in Eſquadrons, that the Emperour was certified that they wer comming with al their campe, to battayle, ſo it was neceſſary to ſet al thinges in order. The Emperor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the duke of Aluoy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould take hede in al pointes to the proceding of the enemies. He tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where he had ſtaide the vaward and the batail in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging aforeſayde being in the waye choſing a place mete for to fight. He ſette the footemen in place conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and the artillerye and horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where thei ſhould ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And ſo they ſtode loking for the comming of the enemies, which made countenance y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei would fight. I thinke vnder correccion of better iudgement, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if thei had come y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daye to fyght with

vs by the way, they might haue put all thinges in greate auenture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we had taken a place fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ynough for oure auauntage. But it ſemed to the Emperour that thei would not fight that daye, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng that thei had differred the tyme ſo long, for it was ſomwhat late: but the duke ſent him worde for to ſtay, for he thought the enemyes made a greate muſter to paſſe forwarde, but inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent he ſent hym word to kepe on the waye with his campe, for the enemyes beganne to retyre vnto theyrs. This varyaunce was a cauſe of the late departure. For the Emperoure ſeeyng howe muche more he ſhoulde aduenture in tarrying, then to come late that nyght, and howe muche he ſhoulde geue vnto his enemyes to geue

The duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy cauſed to be cloſed vp with gret diligence, the moſt part thereof. It was thought, if the enemyes hadde come the next daye, it myght haue turned vs to gret trouble. But they had ſuch a confidence in their great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; ſo ſtoute, that thei thought al times &amp; places might haue ſerued for to achieue their enterpriſe. For
<pb facs="tcp:340:25"/>
the Launtgraue had promiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the league, that he woulde dryue the Emperour out of Germanye in iii. monethes.

And ſo he caried .iii. or .iiii. ſcore thouſande footemen and moe. Then .x. thouſand horſemen, &amp; one hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred and thirty peces of artilery, but that night thei ſtyrred not with any horſes abrode in the fyelde.</p>
            <p>¶ The next day the Emperour prouided for al thinges neceſſarye, agaynſt ſuche thinges as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes myght take in hand: but that day they made no mouyng nor ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng at all.</p>
            <p>¶ The other daye folowyng, he went to view theyr ſtrong lodgyng
<pb facs="tcp:340:26"/>
aforeſayde .vi. little Italian miles from oure lodging, in a ſtronge place: for vpon the righthande and on the fronte, they hadde adepe ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and a marriſh kept with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid riuer, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr backes a great woode, vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſyde a mountayne, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had layde theyr ordeinaunce. There was at this view a ſkirmiſh but it was of litle effect.</p>
            <p>¶ The next day after, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſet forth their horſemen &amp; fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in arraye, it was thought that they would come to our campe, but it was not but to take the muſter of their folkes. When thei had taken it, they returned to their lodging, ſithe the next day after they rayſed theyr campe from thence, and came with in three myles of ours, in a ſtrong

            <p>¶ The duke of Aluoy conſulted with his maieſty, and ſent Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaro de ſand, &amp; Arze, with one.

But the enemies began to ſet vpon our menne in a barne, nere vnto the woode, and there was that daye a ſkyrmiſhe, but it came not to paſſe as it was purpoſed.

There was on both partes ſlayne and taken.</p>
            <p>¶ Theſe two Campes beyng but three myle a ſunder, and beyng

            <p>¶ At this time the enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan for to approche, ſhoting of their artillery, &amp; with the order that they had taken to girde in our camp, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marriſh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was vpon the left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as it wer the half of the plain fielde lying vpon oure right hande, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſhoting ſo nere, that many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theirs, &amp; eſpeciallye thoſe that lay vpon the right hand, did ſhoote within .vi.

His maieſtie had bene round about the campe, and dyd ſee what order
<pb facs="tcp:340:29"/>
the duke of Aluoy had ſette. And horſed and armed as he was: he tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned agayne and dyd ſtande before our Eſquadrons, and ſometimes he went amongeſt the Almaynes. On y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one ſide &amp; the other there was great ſhoote of artillery, which was litle regarded, ſeeyng his maieſtye emongeſt them. There it myght clearely be ſeene in ſuche thynges, howe muche is worthe the preſence of a prince that hath a good oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion emongeſt his ſouldiers. The enemyes hadde approched ſo nere, where they thought they myghte beate vs at theyr pleaſure. They made a ſtonde with theyr horſemen and footemen, and began to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt on al partes with al theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerye, and to beate vs ſo nye, and with ſo great furye, that verelye it
<pb facs="tcp:340:30"/>
appered to be a ſtorme of pellettes, for in the trenches and eſquadrons there was nothing ſene but Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and pellettes. The duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy ſtode with the Hiſpaniardes at the poynt of the campe, where the battery of the enemyes was nereſt at hande. A pece wherof toke away a ſouldier ſtandyng next vnto him, as he was prouydyng for euerye thing neceſſarye. They made cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce openlye two tymes to ſet vpon vs. The duke tooke an order with the hackbutters to bee aduiſed not to ſtyrre, vntyll the enemyes ſhoulde bee two pickes of length from our trenches, for in this forte none of the ſhote of our hackbutters which wer many and good, ſhoulde be loſte. And yf they ſhould ſhote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre of, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part ſhould be i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vain

Alſo he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the firſt ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt, ſhould be at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The enemies did euer beat ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſemed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again: they ſette forth &amp; auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced their eſquadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, our artillery was ſhotte: but as I haue ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſpoſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did helpe ſo much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was no great hurte done emongeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So hath it ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed god to preſerue vs, ſo manye as hath bene ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, inſomuche that nere to the Emperor there hath fallen many Gunſtons &amp; pellettes. Inſomuche that many left lookyng to their own peryll for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor. Eſpecially one pellet was ſo ſtreight &amp; ſo nere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the peril was manifeſt, but it pleaſed god y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth before his fete. An other pece kylled one of his garde, all other brake a ſtanderd, other .2. killed .2. horſes.
<pb facs="tcp:340:31"/>
This was the hurte that was done about his maieſtie .vi. peces of ours dyd breake that day, one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led .vi. ſouldiers Hiſpaniardes, and hurt two.</p>
            <p>¶ The enemyes preaſed vpon vs ſo muche, that they thought to diſlodge vs with their terrible ſhot of artillery, in geuyng ſhotes with their fury infernal. And for all thys fury y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer ceaſſed, there was not one ray broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor any ſouldier that ſtirred his head to loke if there wer any more ſafe then he. This battery continued .viii. houres, when it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the enemies wexed wery, and to take an other way and not to come to battayle with vs, ſeing that we were more ſtoute then they had thought we had bene. His maieſtie parceiuing this, &amp; ſeing now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:340:31"/>
began to fagge: he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to retier into their campe, &amp; to be al ready if neceſſitie ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to returne to the trenches on fote. Here it may bee aſked, to what purpoſe horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be entre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched To aunſwer this: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trenches were made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night before, &amp; ſo low that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſmen wer ſet in place where they lacked. And wher y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of armes of oure enemies mighte enter, there ſtode ours, for ſo it was ordeyned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they came to fyght, there we were redy to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Al the tyme of this ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tery, the duke of Aluoy had ſet forth certain hackbutters Hiſpaniardes: which ſkirmiſhed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kepte their artillery, whiche did lye nere vnto a gret houſe prepared for to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .vi.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo that at one ſelf time they did
<pb facs="tcp:340:32"/>
beate with their ordinance, and our ſouldiers ſkirmiſhed with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that kept their artillery. Nowe had they continued .ix. houres and began to retier nere vnto the houſe, and the litle riuer aforeſayde, where aboue nere vnto a mylle, they had ſet their tentes and pauillions. Now beyng late, thei withdrew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfes where thei had pitched their campe, ſo that the point towarde the marriſh was viii.

            <p>¶ This night the Launtgraue being at ſupper toke the cup (after the maner of Almayn:) and dranke to Exertel, ſaying theſe woordes: Exertel, I drink to al thoſe that we haue killed this day with our artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. Exertel anſwered, my lorde, I

               </gap>rtel was of opinion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day for to geue vs battaile at our tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, but the Lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue would not &amp; as I think he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, for in ſuch thinges be manye aduentures, chaunces. And for to iudge according to reaſon, the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour had there, would not haue bene lightly diſlodged, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue did know verely by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we had bene ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouſly beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that he could perceiue no kind of weakenes in our campe. For our ſouldiers ſtode not only at defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but thei alſo ſtepped foorth &amp; ſkirmiſhed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. So it is ſayde that the duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celled to geue vs battaile
<pb facs="tcp:340:33"/>
the other day at our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng. But in the ende they tooke an other order, and that night it was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the cartes in the field ſhould bryng faggotes to raiſe the repares of our trenches, and euery ſouldyer did labour in their quarters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mornyng the campe was fortifyed, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might be behynd them ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended. And moreouer with this, the duke of Aluoy e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>larged our trenches with takyng in parte of the field, and ſet therin ſure watche and warde.</p>
            <p>¶ The next day y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemyes let reſt their artillery, &amp; ſent foorth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne hackbutters ſcattered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to ſkirmiſh, ſo we ſent forth ix. C. hackbutters, Spanyardes, they ſkirmiſhed with their enemies in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>field. The ſkirmiſh was ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:340:33"/>
that our enemies were conſtrained to ſet forth a M. horſmen in fauour of their hackbutters, &amp; theſe came in .iii. eſquadrons. The firſt myght be. C. horſes whych wente loſe dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, the other two came in order one after another. Our hakbutters were .iij. or .iiij. C. ſcattered abrode, And in the rereward came. 5 .c. The hundred horſes of our enemyes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming loſe, ſet vpon our firſt hacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butters: puttyng their truſte in the plaine fielde, in the whyche, for the moſt part, horſmen haue aduantage againſt hackbutters. But ours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them in ſuche ſorte, that they made them to turne fliyng, ſo that of neceſſity, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d eſquadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came to ſuccour with a ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred of Guels, gyuing the charge vpon our hacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butters. But they gaue them ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:340:34"/>
ruſh, that they did breake in the mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deſt and turned with the firſt. And ſo our hackbutters euer chargyng, came the thyrd eſquadron bearyng a ſtandred aſure, but they were ſo re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued with our hackbutters, that they brake &amp; turned theyr backes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ward into theyr trenches. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny taried behinde, horſe and horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the field. A thyng to be lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, It was praiſed of his maieſty, for verely it was not egal, horſmen againſt hackbutters, ſo the ſkirmiſh made an ende of al that day.</p>
            <p>¶ That nyght the Duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy cauſed the laborers of Boeme to the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of two thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which be called the beſt laborers that can be founde in the worlde, to make a newe trenche, the whyche deuyded, drawyng towarde the houſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde
<pb facs="tcp:340:34"/>
wythin foure hundred paces, ſo that the cabbyns of the one parte and the other myght reache. Thys trenche had helpe by a certayne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the grounde, ſo that the laborers myghte be couered out of dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. They had alſo fortifyed &amp; trenched the houſe aforeſayd. Wyth our trenche was charged Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaro de Sand, wyth hys hackbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Hyſpaniardes, a woorke vnto the enemyes verye noyfull ſeeyng we came ſo nere, they were lyke to be dyſpatched wyth the contynuall ſhoote that we ſent from thence.</p>
            <p>¶ At thys tyme the Duke of Aluoy conſulted wyth hys Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtye takyng an order for to ſende the Marques of Marnano and Maderucho wyth hys regyment, and Alonſo Biuas wyth his terce,
<pb facs="tcp:340:35"/>
for to kyl and degule .iij. M. Suy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheners whyche were lodged in the Suburbes of Newburge, for to kepe the towne &amp; certaine artilerye left there by the Duke of Saxon &amp; Lantgraue, but they were ſent for that day, &amp; ſo ſeaſed the enterpryce. Another daye the enemyes in the ſame ſelfe order as before, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fielde and ſet forth theyr arty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and furiouſly beganne to beate our campe, how be it not ſo nere as the firſt day: for the newe trench be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde the houſe cauſed them to haue a more reſpect then they had before. Theyr battery was in moe partes, but they did not ſo much hurt. The Emperour heard Maſſe that daye in the trenches, and brake hys faſte amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt the ſoldiors of Lumberdy and Naples, in whoſe quarter he
<pb facs="tcp:340:35"/>
was. The enemies did ſhoote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, but not muche to oure da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, being wythin our rampyers where hys maieſty was. There di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one becauſe hys haulberde was ſtricken out of hys hand with a pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, whych haulberd kylled one that ſtoode by. Thys day, his hal, &amp; bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber was ſhot thorow of his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t where he lay. Thus the enemies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinued theyr batery vntyl it was. 4. of the clocke. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duke ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forth Alon ſo Biuas wyth .v. C. hackbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his terce, to ſcyrmyſhe wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whych the enemies had ſet forth. He ſcirmiſhed ſo wel, that he gat the firſt of theyr .ij. trenches, and after he turned vpon them that were in the houſe, he ſcyrmyſhed with them vntil it was late, and then he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to oure Campe in good order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:340:36"/>¶ This nyght there was geuen to the enemyes ſodaynelye a larum as they hadde manye ſythe theyr commyng, ſo that they were kepte wake, and dyſquyeted that daye wyth ſcyrmyſhes: and in the nyght lying in theyr harnes (as we hadde knoweledge by the pryſoners,) ſo that theyr impituous furour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne for to ſwage. For nowe we hadde gathered them ſo nere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that theyr horſmenue that were wont to ride within two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces of our ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe to ſpye, came not nere by a thouſand and fiue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces, for our hakbutters pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them ſo nere, and our trenches and repayres beyng ſo ſtrong, that they were nowe forced to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and to kepe them wythin their
<pb facs="tcp:340:36"/>
Campe. And moreouer our newe trenche went forewarde, for hys Maieſtye woulde dyſlodge them in anye wyſe. Here it myghte bee ſeene that he that came to dyſlodge, was hym ſelfe diſlodged. Now the trenche was driuen to the houſe the whyche we haue nowe gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we myght eaſylye beate al theyr Campe: that there was no remedy but awaye from thence. The Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te Palatine ſent at thys tyme thre hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſes, whyche ſerued amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the enemyes vntyll wythin a ſhorte tyme before that they were broken. He excuſed hym ſelfe, and ſayd, that he ſente them to the duke of Vertemburge as he was bound by a promes and a league made in tyme paſt, and not agaynſte the
<pb facs="tcp:340:37"/>
Emperour: and that he cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go parforce. Let it be as it was, for the greater nomber that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt hym, ſo muche more was the victory that God gaue him. Many ſcirmiſhes wer made in theſe daies, and many thynges done by party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>One day early in the mornyng, they began agayne wyth theyr arti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lerye to tempeſt and beate our ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe, but more at large the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had done before. Thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued vntyl it was late: then in their retier they gaue a notable peale. It is to be knowen, that in theſe daies they had ſent vs pelletes innumerable, of the which there were many loſt and fallen in our campe, but thoſe that wer fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about the tent of the Maiſter of the ordenaunce, were one M. &amp; .vi. C.
<pb facs="tcp:340:37"/>
Thys night they had ſuch a larum, that they were all nyghte in araye. This was ſo ordinary that larums were loked for, the going out of our tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che was the entering into theirs. Now had they loſt manye horſes &amp; ſoldiors dead and ſlain. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer then thys, our horſmen tooke theyr victuales in al partes, ſo that they lyued in great trauaile &amp; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, and we neuer ſuffered them to reſt, but ſome tymes in the nyght, &amp; euer in the day, they kept theyr bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle ray. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they determined for to diſlodge ſeing ther was no other remedye. The next night they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed priuelye ouer a lytle ryuer wyth theyr great artilery and caryage, &amp; wyth ſo great diligence, that in the mornyng there could no tentes nor pauilions be ſeene, but onlye theyr
<pb facs="tcp:340:38"/>
horſmen whyche beganne to paſſe, for they had ſent theyr footemen be fore, and deuided theyr horſmen in xiij. or .xiiij. partes, wyth certayne fielde peeces which went in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rereward. In this order thei made towarde Newburge. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſent out lighthorſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſe what they woulde do: &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the duke of Aluoy &amp; other knightes, he rode to marke theyr faſhions, whych to my ſyght was this. They ſent their great artilery and fotemen before, and theyr horſmen inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent after. It was a maruelous beutiful ſight to ſee all the fyeldes couered wyth eſquadrons of horſemen and foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ray, and ſo in two lodginges they came to Newburge.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe the Emperour hadde newes that the Earle of Bure had

paſſed the Ryne in deſpight of their enemyes, whoſe Captayne was the Earle of Aldamberge ſent by the Duke and the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence therof. After thys paſſage the Earle of Bure made toward Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k fort, his ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe was of power to with ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rine, but not to reſiſt, they being ioyned wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the leage. Therefore his maieſty ſent to enforme him how that he had diſlodged the duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, and that they had taken the way toward Newburge &amp; Tona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, which wai the Erle ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to come. It was thought beſt to gyue him warni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g therof, he being ſo nere vnto Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfort, douti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies wold haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame way.</p>
            <p>¶ The Earle of Bure brought thre. M. horſmenne at hys charge
<pb facs="tcp:340:39"/>
and .iiij. M. which wer come to him belongyng to the Marques Albert of Brandenburge, &amp; to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Pruſe, and to the duke of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtriche. The which not bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to paſſe the Ryne, they tarryed for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the erle of Bure, which brought .xxiiij. baners, good Soldiers of the Netherlande, and iiij. baners of Hiſpaniardes which had ſerued the kyng of England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Frenchemen, &amp; ij. of Ita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lians from the ſame warres, wyth ii.

The erle of Bure ſet ouer v. M. ſol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diers one night .iii. leages aboue the enemyes, &amp; dyd take a towne ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vpon the ſame paſſage, where
<pb facs="tcp:340:39"/>
al the reſt of the armye myght paſſe wythout any diſturbance. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at Frankforte was foughten a great ſcirmyſhe, where many of the enemyes were ſlayne and dryuen into the towne. Theſe newes came to the Emperour, but not wythoute great difficulty, ſo many townes of the enemyes being betwene.</p>
            <p>The Duke and the Lantgraue beyng .ij. dayes in Newburge, in which tyme diuers newes came to the Emperour, ſome ſayd they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Danubia to enter into Bauer.

And at the end of two daies they moued they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:340:40"/>
to kepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town. Here was one other great errour, for there they had one great, &amp; a ſtrong lodgi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, with wood water, &amp; al maner of virtuals, with the bridge at Newburge vpon the riuer of Danubia, a great countrei of villages &amp; forages for horſes, &amp; al at libertie throughe Bauer vp to Minique, thei were ſure of Lico the riuer of Anguſt wyth the towne of Rain, ſo that if we ſhuld haue gone thither, we ſhould haue had Newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our backes: nether could he haue gone to Anguſte, but they woulde haue bene there before him: nor to Vlme, for they ſtande in the paſſage, but they looked not vppon all theſe qualityes, or paraduenture they had a reſpect to other thynges. They went to Tonauert, and as it
<pb facs="tcp:340:40"/>
is thoughte by many to theyr great loſſe.</p>
            <p>¶ The Duke of Saxon and Launtgraue, beyng at Tonauerte two or three dayes the Lantgraue went to a towne of the Duke of Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers, two leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tonauert, called Limbygane, whyche was to hym yelded. He ſet there Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for the prouiſion of vyctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, he tourned to Tonauert where they hadde ſtrongly pytched theyr campe.</p>
            <p>¶ In al this time wrot the Lant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>graue vnto the cities of the league, geuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte of all thinges that was done, putting them in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of moe thinges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was done, in boſting of their ſkirmiſhes, with killinge and takinge manye of the pryncypalles (and thys he fayned:)
<pb facs="tcp:340:41"/>
but in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> end of hys letters it was euer more for mony, which I think vnto them was not much agreable, for now the tyme drewe nere, that he had promyſed to dryue the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour out of Germanye, or for to take hym. But they parceiued hys buſynes, order and facultye, not to be as he had promyſed them, nor as they had thought.</p>
            <p>At this time the Emperour had knowledge that the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue had taken the waye to Bendengan, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte the Erle of Bure, for ſo it was ſayd in the Campe of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes that he wold do. He ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gides of the ſame Country for to conduct the Erle to hys maieſty by an other way, and it was determined, that if thys might not be, for to folowe the enemies, and for to encloſe them for
<pb facs="tcp:340:41"/>
the one or the other was the reaſon of the warre, and not to ſuffer the Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe of the enemies to go agaynſt the erle of Bure.</p>
            <p>Nowe his maieſtie turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the principall Cities whiche were lefte prouided by the Duke of Saxone and the Lantgraue, for it ſhould haue bene a thing in vain to beſiege them, and a greate parell to hazarde the principal part of our ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mie againſt the nomber in the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe of the duke of Saxon &amp; La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue, being now ioyned wyth the .xxxvj. baners whych had beene in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Ryne, &amp; as it was thought the enemyes erred yet in this, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> being at Tonauert al this time and had paſſed Daunbia with .x. or xij. M. fotemen and certayne peces of artilery. Thei made a forte vpon
<pb facs="tcp:340:42"/>
the riuer of Lico nere vnto Rayne, they lodged there as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would make an ende of the warre, in the place that they had taken. For with the paſſage of Lyco, they were ſure of Auguſt, and with Tonauert vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Danubia thei wer ſure of Vlme: but they content therewyth, conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a greate ſpace in ſpendyng of tyme in theyr lodging. At this time the Erle of Bure had paſſed Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, he came by Rotemberge and nere Noremberge, out of the waye and daunger of hys enemies. Hys maieſtie abode in Ingulſtat for the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Earle of Bure, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hys commyng, he rode into the fieldes to his ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe, which was faire and well furnyſhed wyth horſemen and footemen.</p>
            <p>¶ After that he had bene there
<pb facs="tcp:340:42"/>
two daies, he determined to folowe the enemies, &amp; firſt to Newburge, for he woulde not leaue ſo ſtrong a towne, ſo wel prouided at his backe eſpecially ſtanding vpon Danubia: a principall ryuer and ſo neceſſarye to ſerue a Campe. Wherefore he woulde go hym ſelfe to vewe it, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng with him the light horſmen, &amp; a nomber of hackbutters Hiſpany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes. So early in the morning he ſet forthe and went to Newburge, where he lyghte on foote to take the vewe thereof. They ſent pellettes but to a lytle effecte.</p>
            <p>¶ The nexte daye in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, he raiſed his campe, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed brydges to be layd ouer Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, ſo that in ſhort tyme he paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer &amp; lodged. j mile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ingulſtat, in the wai to Newburge, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys
<pb facs="tcp:340:43"/>
daye forewarde, our Campe went in an other order the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we had gone: for we had gone but in two partes, vaward and battaile: becauſe if we ſhould haue made a rereward, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the .iij. had bene to weake for our enemyes, they beyng ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in number. Therfore our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde &amp; battaile, went in euery one of them .ij. eſquadrons of fotemen, and .ij. of horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for to be the more ſtrong whatſoeuer myght chaunce. But after the coming of the Erle of Bure, we made arerewarde. In this ſort his maieſty tooke the waye towarde Newbrocke, where at the firſt comi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, the Burgemaſters did yeld vp the toun. And the captaines therein, ſet by the Duke of Saxone and La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue, it was yelded to his maieſty to do wyth the one and the
<pb facs="tcp:340:43"/>
other according to his pleaſure. It was muche to be thoughte that ſo ſtrong a hold and ſo wel prouyded, hauing the paſſage &amp; reſcue ſo nere, did ſo lightely ſurrender.</p>
            <p>At thys time the enemyes haue forſaken Rayne, onelye ſuſtainyng the forte vpon the riuer of Lico. Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore thys tyme there hath beene dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers opynyons that hys maieſtye ſhould not ſet foorth toward New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocke being ſo ſtrongly defended, but he was determined therein. He left two baners of Dutchmen, and ſer the men of warre in an Ile nere vnto the Caſtel for that nyght.</p>
            <p>The nexte daye hys Maieſtye wyth the order that he had taken, lodged in the orchardes &amp; ſuburbes of Newbrocke, and there was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the armoure and weapon from the
<pb facs="tcp:340:44"/>
ſoldiers, where he myghte as well haue taken theyr lyues beyng Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles to theyr Prynce, he toke their othes and let them go. He dyd the ſame to the Captaynes ſaying: he dyd knowe that they were begyled. They aunſwered, not onelye begy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but alſo enforced.</p>
            <p>¶ Hys maieſty being thre daies in Newbrocke, he made a generall muſter, in the whych he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. ir. M horſmen, &amp; .xxix. M. footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How be it, they had bene a greater no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, but they were nowe mynyſhed by hurt, ſlaughter &amp; infirmiti. After he had taken the fidelitie of the towne, he ſet a garyſon there, and after he would ſeke the enemies, for his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion was to finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in place where he might geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> battaile. He deter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mined to pas Danubia by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bridge
<pb facs="tcp:340:44"/>
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame town, for to make toward Tonauert, for it was ſaid that they had ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ped, &amp; that there they woulde make an end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warre, in .ij. daies, his maieſti aproched within a leage of their ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe, where he came to a vil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lage called Marqueſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the diſtance was not much, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difficulti was more, becauſe of a thicke wood ſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding betwene the .ij. ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pes, hauyng no other paſſage but .ij. or .iij. cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. This wood bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at our ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe &amp; extended vnto theirs, his maieſty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to vewe the ward, to ſee by what poſſibility an army myght paſſe, &amp; whether by the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the place the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe might lye ſo nere the enemies to make vs lords of the wood. He ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the duke of Aluoi with a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of hakbutters which wer de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wood, as it was thought
<pb facs="tcp:340:45"/>
Then he wyth .xxiiij. horſes paſſed thorow the woode, ſo nere vnto their trenches, that he was wythin the ſhoote of a ſaker. The Duke tooke wyth him thre or foure and went on foote, where he dyd ſee the ſcituacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our enemyes, they were ſo buſye in labour, that they had no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde. There the Duke perceyued that the wood ſtretched ſo nere their campe, that there was but a lytle playne of .iiij. or .v. paces, and at the vtter part thereof, one ſteppe going downe, and a lyke goyng vp. And vpon the toppe of the banke they made theyr trenches ſo, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the left hand it ioyned wyth the woode. This vallei ſerued as a ditche. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ryght haud they were fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Danubia, ſo that there was no place to lodge our campe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:340:45"/>Wyth this relation he turned to the Emperoure, who ſeeyng that it was not poſſyble to aproche our ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies for the cauſes aboue ſayd: hys maieſty imagined by what meanes he might remoue them out of theyr ſtrong lodging, for being there and the woode betwene, it coulde neuer be brought to paſſe, but this warre ſhould be euer at large. Then he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded that we ſhoulde go with our campe on the right hand towarde a towne called Bendengen, leauing our enemyes vpon the right hand.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is to be vnderſtande that the Emperou hath trauailed muche in Germany, wherby he doth not alonlye knowe a greate part therof, but moreouer he hath a diſcreſcion and a vniuerſal knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

ſo dyligently and wyth ſuche ſpeede, that it woulde neuer haue bene thoughte that the Almaynes, whych ſeme to beſlouthful &amp; heauy, would haue made ſuche ſpeede, but we haue ſene the experience in thys warre, that they can warlyke rayſe theyr ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe in good order, &amp; their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage together with their artileri in place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at al times whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nede ſhal require. And ſeing that I haue ſaid ſo much, I wil ſay more of that we haue experience of thys nacion. This it is, they can rayſe their ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe (as I haue ſayde) and chonſe ſure &amp; ſtrong lodging, haing a reſpect to al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities that may be for a ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe. yet ther is an other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that I note muche in them, that in their ſkirmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, they come out ſtronglye &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier warrely, beginning with theyr
<pb facs="tcp:340:49"/>
lyght horſes which they cal blacke, taking the name of theyr blacke har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes which they beare with ſieues of mayle, ſhorte dagges of. ij palmes of length, and iauelyns, with which they are very handſome. And as for theyr footemen, they keepe good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take great adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage wyth artilerie. They can breake victuals from theyr enemyes, ſet emboyſes, and other lyke feates of warre to good purpoſe. Thys was the dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our enemies by the help of the night, &amp; after of the miſt. Nowe his maieſty had ſeene our campe in order, and when it was cleare day, the duke of Aluoy came and certy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied hym, that he thought they wold geue battaile, for he had ſene them in order, &amp; ready for that purpoſe. To the which his maieſty aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb facs="tcp:340:49"/>
In the name of god. For yf the enemyes would fight, ſo would he. Theſe wer his woordes in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on horſebacke, for becauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goute, he might not ſtand on foote. He did take his curates &amp; braſelets and moued the campe in this ordre.</p>
            <p>¶ The duke dyd leade the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp; with hym y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Erle of Bure, with al his horſemen and foremen. In this vaward went al the foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Spayne, and ſhortly after wente his maieſtie, the horſemen of hys houſe and court, and the bendes of Flaunders, which went with theyr ſtanderdes. There went the prince of Pyemont, to whom his maieſtye had geuen charge in thoſe warres, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſquadron of his houſe, and the court. There went alſo Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian the prince of Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>garye, with
<pb facs="tcp:340:50"/>
al his horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The marques Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Brandemburge with his. The foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the battaile wer the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Madrucho and the Italy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: the rerewarde was conducted by the great maiſter of Prence, and the marques Albert, the regimente of George of Ranſpruge. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward did leade ſixtene or ſeuentene thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thre eſquadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; thre thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d horſes. The rereward might be .viii. thouſand fotemen, &amp; ii. M. horſemen in one eſquadron. The horſemen of theſe three partes wer deuided co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmably for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſitie, ſetting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> black harnes in place conueniente, &amp; the menne of armes with their launces in their places. The rereward &amp; the battayle went, (as it wer) egal: for why, his maieſty would honor the captaynes whiche
<pb facs="tcp:340:50"/>
wer willing in ſuch a day to mete y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enmies in fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; not to be left behi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</p>
            <p>¶ It is to be vnderſtande, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the breaking vp of the myſte, the Prince of Salmona hadde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne a ſkirmiſh with the enemies at the commyng of the Emperour. It was ſo hote, that his maieſty ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Earle of Bure with his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne, to bee nere vnto the riuer, whatſoeuer might chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges being in theſe termes, now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battail of his mateſty, had made egal with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vawarde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhore. And ther he toke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Aluoy, &amp; other captains, &amp; we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where he might ſe what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies did. In ſome thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges ther it did appere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei would accept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battel, &amp; come down into the plain, lying betwene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hils &amp; the riuer. To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche they were
<pb facs="tcp:340:51"/>
muche procured on our part, with a new ſkirmiſh of back butters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer ſent ouer the water. But they kepte the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines going toward Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and now their vaward had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their lodging. His maieſty made the campe to ſtay, but now the Erle of Bure had proued the paſſages, with certaine horſemen, but it was ſtreyte, &amp; trauelous to be done late and farre of the day. But this day it had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foughte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without any dout, if the miſte had not couered the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo long time vntyll they had paſſed the ſtreightes &amp; paſſages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd, feding vs with ſkirmiſhes to their aduauntage, for our horſes could not paſſe the ryuer in any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; our fotemen wadi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g through the water, ſhould haue foughte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with great trauaile, but they tooke an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:340:51"/>
counſel: for they dyd take a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging eaſy to be kept, with leſſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then they hadde, but nowe as I haue ſayd: it was late, and tyme to turne vnto our campe, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes in the mountaynes, dyd the ſame. This night they loſte manye ſouldiers &amp; cartes which our horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did take.</p>
            <p>¶ The other day his maieſtye thought beſt to rayſe his campe, and to goe nere vnto the enemies, and ſo in the ſelf and ſame order as the day before, he went ouer againſt them &amp; toke a place for his lodgi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g one mile and an half fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr campe, where the ſame day was foughten a ſkyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh of horſmen. In the which the marques John of Brandenburge with .xxx. of his horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did fyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dukes of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>zwique
<pb facs="tcp:340:52"/>
which came with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> campe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he was hurt &amp; after died of his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des at Norling, &amp; other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theirs which wer hurt &amp; ſlain y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, &amp; ſome of ours likewiſe.</p>
            <p>¶ His maieſty bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g there lodged certain daies, ſeki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g by al meanes to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in chaſe, but thei wer ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to their purpoſe for vitailes, that he did know it was neceſſary for to moue the reaſon of the warre, and not to lye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ping and leſing of time without anye profite agaynſte the enemies whiche were ſo ſtronglye lodged, that for to remoue them, it behoued rather to vſe pollicye then force: &amp; ther about he was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to worke. And thought whiche way he might take awaye from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Danubia, the which was ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry for both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> campes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:340:52"/>
a great parte of the victory did conſiſte in the geatting thereof, for the townes ſtanding therupon, be of great importance to be lordes of the bridges, for to goe into Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and Sueuer. And at this time, the enemies hadde al thoſe betwixt Vlme and Tonauert, and ſo they were lordes of great plentye of vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles For thei had the paſſage of Anguſt at theyr pleaſure, then he ſeeyng, that the geattyng of them ſhoulde bee to their greate detry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſaduauntage, and that moreouer he myghte haue places neceſſarye bothe agaynſte Anguſt and Vlme, two principal heades of the league. He conſidred what was beſte to be done, and ſo he deuyſed in this ſorte. He commaunded a muſter dayly to be made agaynſte
<pb facs="tcp:340:53"/>
our enemies. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſent one night duke Octauian, with the horſemen and fotemen of Italy. And Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge with his Almayns and .xii. peces of ordinance: with al dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Tonauert, from our campe .iii. leagues, geuing them inſtruccions what was to be done Wherby with great diligence they came vnto the towne earely in the morning, where they began to beate, without ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pire or trenche. And ſo with open ſtaling they entred. There went out fleyng ouer the bridge two baners of fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which wer ſet there by the duke and Launtgraue.</p>
            <p>¶ Now I haue thought good for to declare one thyng, whiche the readers may deſyre to knowe. How many ſouldiers be a banner .ii. or. iii becauſe I haue ſpoken ofttymes of
<pb facs="tcp:340:53"/>
banners, and not of the number. A banner of Dutchemen is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly of .iii. C. men or aboue. This towne gotten, they left theyr two banners, the reſt returned to the campe. The enemyes had no knowledge of this vntyl the next daye in the mornyng, for although they lay nere vnto our campe, it was done with ſuch dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that they had no vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therof. This was of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, by reaſon of the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the place. In one day his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtye rayſed his campe, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to Tonauert, and there lodged and the towne at his backe, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the left hande Danubia. That daye the enemyes moued not, for to geue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye diſturbance in our way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue maruayle, beyng ſo gret a noumber of horſemen, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
<pb facs="tcp:340:54"/>
the countrey, and the paſſages ſo muche oute of order, for in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng we haue bene oftentymes in ſtaye and looſyng of tyme: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bee ſubiecte to manye incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences. Howe bee it, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtye hadde prouided agaynſte all ſiniſter chaunces. He ſette the hackebutters Hyſpanyardes and Italyans, in a place apte for theyr purpoſe. The rerewarde was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, accordyng to the diſpoſicion of the waye, whiche gaue no place, but to goe in range. At lengthe he came to Tonauert, and from thence to Tillingam, aboue vpon Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, which is a towne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Anguſt. There is a good bribge and a plaine waye, hauyng Danubia vpon oure lefte hand, and vpon oure righte hande, a greate
<pb facs="tcp:340:54"/>
thicke wood, ſtanding betwixt vs and oure enemies, euer folowyng, vntyll we came to the ryuer of Prence, whiche is three myles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llinga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; entreth into Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubia: and ſo we went, leauing the wood vpon our ryght hand. In the whiche there bee two wayes from Norling to Tillingam. His maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtye takyng that wayes, there came to hym to bee ſurrendred, the towne of Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hſcot, with a ſtronge Caſtell ſtanding vpon Danubia. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe was ſurrendred the towne of Tillingam, whiche was taken from the Cardinall of Auguſte, wherin was a banner of garde, but thei fled when thei heard of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. He lodged that day betwene Tillingam &amp; Londgingue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There
<pb facs="tcp:340:55"/>
is a brydge vpon Danubia, and a ſtronge holde reaſonablye fortyfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There wer three banners, and that whiche went out of Tillinga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They were ſyted by the duke of Aluoy, for to yelde. They aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtoutelye that they woulde not, for they truſted to bee reſcued the nexte daye, by the duke and the Launtgraue. But ſeyng the batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye prouided, they tooke an other counſayle, and in the nyghte they wente from thence, and tooke the waye to Anguſte. The Burgemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſubmitted themſelues wyth one excuſe that they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned by menne of warre, and not willingly, to do any thing agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt his maieſtye.</p>
            <p>¶ At this tyme the Emperour had knowledge that the duke and
<pb facs="tcp:340:55"/>
the Launtgraue were commyng ſtreight toward Lodgingen: to this he gaue credit, in ſo muche that the menne of warre whiche had bene there, looked for reſcue. He cauſed the campe to bee in order, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn paſſage to bee taken, where the enemyes muſt of neceſſitie fight or turne backe agayne. If they woulde fyghte, his maieſtye hadde the place for aduauntage. And yf they woulde turne backe, they ſhoulde looſe theyr labour. Then for doubte of the one or the other, they ſette theyr enterpryſe aſyde. But al thinges beyng at this point, the towne of Langinguen came to ſurrender to his maieſtye, it was knowen of them, that not onelye they looked for ſuccoure from the duke of Saxon and the Launt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue,
<pb facs="tcp:340:56"/>
but moreouer that Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell hadde beene there that nyghte, and that he hadde fetched awaye the fowre banners to Auguſte. Shortelye after Longinguen, came into a towne called Gunel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inguen, ſtandyng vpon the ryuer Prence. The Emperor comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded John Babtiſta Sabello, with the Popes horſemenne, and Alda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dano Aguilera, to purſue Exertell, and theſe foure banners with their two companions, and Nicholas Seco with his Italians, which by great diligence dyd ouertake Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertell, where they hadde a greate ſkirmiſhe: wherein was taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye ſouldiers with three peces of or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinaunce, whiche they carryed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Longinguen to Anguſte. With this, John Babtiſta Sabello tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:340:56"/>
to the Emperour, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame daye lefte in Longinguen two ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, the Emperour lodged with al his campe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the riuer of Prence, in a village ſtanding therupon called Sulten, three leagues from Vlme: for hys maieſtie woulde goe to Vlme, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to take the townes, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vpon Danubia, for he beeing there afore the enemies, yf they woulde come to reſcue, the battayle myght bee to his aduauntage. The whiche he was ſure they woulde procure to doe, except they would loſe it: So he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded the next day to part fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. But when the Campe was riſyng, certayne lyght horſemenne whiche his maieſtye hadde ſente the daye before, certyfyed that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes were in gate. And then it
<pb facs="tcp:340:57"/>
was neceſſarye to knowe: whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon they woulde determyne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that his maieſtye ſhoulde dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge hys campe. He ſente foorth other to ſee what waye they woulde take. They hadde gone that daye a long iourney. Our horſemen had not diſcouered them, for being ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers in the countrey, it was longe before that they coulde fynde the right wai. Some Almains brought newes, but they agreed not all in one, vntyll the enemyes wer ſo nere that our ſcoutes hard their dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes, and one part of their menne appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>¶ At this time the enemies were come ſo nere, that the duke of Aluoy being abrode, he hard their dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes and dyd ſee ſome of theyr folkes. He certified his maieſtye, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:340:57"/>
wente vpon a mountayne, where he might ſee the vawarde of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes, with greate ſtrength of horſemen, and the footemen nere vnto a wood ſide, with certain held peces, wherewith the Launtgraue profeſſeth himſelf to be a great doer I doe not knowe to whom a manne ſhould geue the thankes, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t graue or to his captaynes. But this I can ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath bene diligentlye beſtowed, as I haue ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After that the Emperour had ſeen the trade of the enemies, he perceiued that they would take the way toward Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane, ſtanding a league from oure campe. He returned to his campe, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enmies to their lodging. There was at this tyme, a ſkirmiſh, but of litle effecte. It hath bene thought by ſome that day, that it had bene good
<pb facs="tcp:340:58"/>
to haue geuen them battayle, but al thynges counted and debated, the trueth is, that we had no ſpace nor tyme to haue ſette foorth our menne in eſquadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, becauſe of the wodes, and the ſpedye takyng of the yr lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginges. And eſpectallye the riuer of Prence being betwene both ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pes: and if there wer a faulte, the faulte was this. That our enemies were found after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the dede ſhould haue be done. And this was through dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers relacions of the ſkoutes: for when the trueth was knowen, the time was paſt.</p>
            <p>¶ I haue conſidred one thing in this warres, whiche I haue diuers times ſene, that for the moſt part, we haue lacked good guides, although thei haue bene naturallye borne in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, yet of a trueth we haue
<pb facs="tcp:340:58"/>
gone groping as menne dooe in the darke, by coniecture, and all for lacke of good guides and ſkoutes, I cannot ſaye what is the cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it he as Ceſar ſaid by Conſidio, a valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſouldier and of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Ceaſar ſente hym for to haue knowledge of his enemyes. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio roode foorth and dyd ſe menne, thinkyng that he had ſene the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies He returned to Ceaſar, and ſayd that he had ſene his enemyes. And that the mountayne that he hadde appoynted Labiano to take, was taken, and occupyed wyth the Frenche menne, and that he hadde ſeene theyr banners and armes. This erroure of Conſidio, was the cauſe that Ceaſar was all that daye in a ſtaye, and dyd nothyng vntyll the enemyes hadde tyme
<pb facs="tcp:340:59"/>
to mende theyr lodgynges. So Ceaſar ſayeth, that Conſidio being afrayde, he thought he had ſeen that thing that he hadde not ſene. Now this is to our purpoſe, for oure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerers, eyther they haue not ſene their enemies, or when thei haue ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, thei haue had litle regarde, to ſay the trueth.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperour being in his lodgyng, the enemyes muſtarde certayne eſquadrons of horſemen ouer agaynſte hym, hauyng a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſkirmiſhe as I haue ſayde, they retourned vnto theyrs, the whiche although it was deuided by ſlackes and runnyng brookes, yet they had a ſtrong lodging for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>¶ This nyght, his maieſtye ſpake of goyng to Vlme, but after
<pb facs="tcp:340:59"/>
many oppinions. Finally, the nexte daye he did take reſolucion for the mouing of his campe: for why, he was certified that the enemyes had ſente vnto Vlme, thre thouſand ſuichiners, and xv. C. ſouldiers of the ſame countrey menne, ſufficient to defende that citie. The whiche ſo being, it was no reaſon to goe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agaynſte. Leauyng one armye at oure backes of foure ſcore and .x. thouſande menne, for it is cleare, yi we hadde left our lodgyng, they woulde haue been ſhortelye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, where they myghte eaſily haue taken awaye oure vyctualles, for they coulde not come anye other waye. They ſhoulde haue been Lordes of all the townes vpon Danubia. Therefore the goyng to Ulme was reuoked, by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:340:60"/>
of theſe particulers afore ſayde. For the manour of the warre ſhoulde haue turned from lodging to lodgyng, and euerye daye ſkyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, where unto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enmies came continuallye. The duke of Aluoy appoynted to make them a ſkyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe, more then ordinarye. So the nexte daye in the mornyng, he made an Imboyſhe of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande hackebutters, in a wood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the enemyes ſtandyng vpon Prence. He ſente the prince of Sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mona with certayne of his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne, to geue them a bayghte nere vnto theyr campe, and there he ſette vpon the Straglers, there came oute in groſſe after theyr cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, ſome looſe, ſome in Eſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and the prince withdrewe
<pb facs="tcp:340:60"/>
hymſelfe towarde the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. There was a greate ſkyrmyſh with horſemenne and hackebut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there were many ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and laye alonge in the fieldes, with the bendes of theyr coloure. In this ſkyrmiſhe they dyd much helpe themſelues with theyr artyllery, but oure hackebutters hadde the vpper hande, by the helpe of oure lyghte horſemenne. Howe bee it, thei charged ſtoutelye in groſſe, but there were of the principal horſes of all the nacions that ſerued his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty. But the order y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the duke had taken the night before, dyd not fully take effecte, becauſe of ſome negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. His maieſtye commaunded the ſkirmiſhe to retyre, to the which the enemyes were ſo wyllynge,
<pb facs="tcp:340:61"/>
that the retrayte was all at once.</p>
            <p>¶ Hys maieſtye parceyued his enemies to be ſo lyghtly prouoked: he entended to geue them a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble onſette. So he appoynted on a daye the lyghte horſemenne to aſſayle theyr trenches, ſo that by ſkyrmiſhes, they myght be brought abrode. He deuyded the Dutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne couertelye in tenne partes of the woode, and lykewyſe the Hyſpanyardes, and Italyans hackebutters, and all the reſte to bee in a readineſſe, if nede ſhoulde requyre, and moreouer certayne peces of artyllerye to bee layde ſecretelye. He alſo commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Prynce of Salmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na with hys lighte horſemenne, to dooe accordyng to the order that was taken. Whyche was to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
<pb facs="tcp:340:61"/>
the enemyes out of their camp. as he hadde done the daye before. There came foorth of theyr campe two greate Eſquadrons of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne, whiche woulde not for anye thyng that coulde be done, departe from theyr artyller. Aynd thys I thinke was for one of theſe two cauſes, eyther they had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what order we hadde taken: or becauſe they hadde been ſo ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſkirmiſh paſt, that they durſte no more come in the place where theihadde ſo much loſte.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperour ſeing there coulde no other thyng bee done, becauſe their campe was ſo ſtrong, he procured to prouide for the night, a Cameſado, in the whiche he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the footemen Hiſpaniardes
<pb facs="tcp:340:62"/>
and Madrucho with his charge. The great maſter of Prence, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marques Albert with his horſmen. With this Camiſado the next nyght the duke of Aluoy made towarde theyr campe. The Emperour was abrode ſecretelye in a place, for to haue knowlage from the duke what was to bee done. But when the duke was within halfe a mile of the campe, he perceyued theyr watche to bee reforced. He commaunded them to ſtaye vntyll he hadde far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge, for then ſhortelye he dyd parceiue that they hadde warnyng, for theyr linkes might be ſeen from one warde to an other. Then the place conſydered, and howe it was fortifyed and prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it was not thoughte good for
<pb facs="tcp:340:62"/>
to hazarde vpon ſuche a chaunce. For after, we had knowledge that thei hadde warnyng fowre houres before oure commyng, by an eſpye out of oure campe. So the duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned to his lodgyng before it was daye, and the Emperoure at the ſame tyme. Nowe it ſemed that this warre was newe to beginne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, for the enemyes were ſo ſetteled, they coulde not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.</p>
            <p>¶ Then the Emperoure began to ſearche an other entrye, but in the meane tyme we hadde continuall ſkyrmiſhes with takyng their vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taylles, and killing their forragers with larums in the night, which is a thyng noyful vnto all nations.</p>
            <p>¶ At this tyme his maieſtye
<pb facs="tcp:340:63"/>
tooke an order, that the Prynce of Salmona with his light horſes, and the Lorde of Brabanſone, knyghte of the order of the golden Flece, Flemmyng, with the Erle of Bures horſemenne, ſhoulde goe in a ſkoute, as the enemyes dyd. They mette with two great bendes of horſemenne, not farre from their campe, where was ouerthrowen, ſlayne and taken, a greate parte of them, a ſtanderd, and the ſtanderd bearer was taken. There was a chaunce, whiche I haue thoughte good to bee wrytten. It is ſo, that the ſame horſemanne that dyd take the ſtanderde, was belongyng to mounſure de Bure, whiche the ſame daye in twelue monthes, had kylled a ſtanderd bearer, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a ſtanderde from one whyche
<pb facs="tcp:340:63"/>
was brother to this ſame ſtanderd bearer. This done, the Prynce retourned to the Emperour, after that he hadde ſlayne and taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of the enemyes, bryngyng a greate noumber of horſes &amp; cartes, whiche turned them to great hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce, loſſe, and detriment.</p>
            <p>¶ At thys time the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure determined to chaunge his lodging for diuers cauſes: one was becauſe of the greate infyrmitye and ſickeneſſe amongeſt oure ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers, and alſo it was ſo full of mudde and mire, that oure artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye was welnere immouable, ſo that we coulde not helpe our ſelues therwith: wherfore it was thought moſte conueniente to retourne to Longinguen, as to a place moſte mete for al thinges neceſſarie. In
<pb facs="tcp:340:64"/>
this lodgig died y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coronel George o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Rauſburge, which in al the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors warres had done good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. At this ſame time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinal Ferneſe, nenew to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, returned to Rome.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperour departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this lodging of Sultan, with the order accuſtoined, and came to Lau gingam. This daye the enemyes made no ſhew, but with one eſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of .iiii. C. horſes. There haue bene diuers oppinions, that yf the duke and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue had woulde thei might haue geuen battayle to their aduauauntage, for thei had inforced their campe with .xv. M. men of Uiertemburge whiche they call choorles, but ſuche choorles as thei bee, they haue of late geuen an ouerthrow to .xxv. M. Suichiners
<pb facs="tcp:340:64"/>
Nowe thei bee in ſtrength and we lacking, for the Almayns of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerland and of the netherlande bee fallen in ſickenes, and of the Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. There could not be founde .iiii. M. Italyans, for the reſte were dead and gone vnto their countrey, but as I haue ſaide, the enemies made no demonſtracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to take any aduauntage of any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie that thei mighte haue for to fight. After y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor departed from Sultan, and was lodged at Laugingam, he had newes from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges brother, that he had the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in Saxony, &amp; that he &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Morris hadde taken the moſt part of the eſtate thereof, the whiche for to be more ſpedelye ſignyfyed vnto our enmyes, or for becauſe thet did knowe that we hadde knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:340:65"/>
there was ſent a great ſalutacion of artillery.</p>
            <p>¶ All the tyme that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure was lodged in Longyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen, he rode daylye aboute the campe, (as it is his ordinarye cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in all hys warres,) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fieldes, for to beholde where the enemies mighte occupye anye place agaynſte hym, or he againſte them. Thei hadde been two or three times ſpying aboute a caſtell in the keping of the Hiſpanyardes, a myle from oure Campe, (but euer at ſuche tymes when they coulde not bee ouertaken.) When the Emperoure hadde diligentely conſidered all thynges, he ſoughte for to haue an other lodgyng, ſo that hys dooynges hence foorth
<pb facs="tcp:340:65"/>
might take better effecte. He found one for his purpoſe, and after he tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to his campe, which was ſo full of mudde and mire, that our men of war were ſore trauailed &amp; weryed. Wherefore there wer diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but al agreed that hys maieſty ſhould diſlodge and to auoyde hys me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by garyſons, and ſo for to make the warre, but he was of a contrarie opinion, and that was to folow the warres, and thys was the beſt as it hath proued ſince by experience.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe being in our lodging ſo foule and myrye, that our cartes nor yet wagones could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in wyth victuals, he determined to remoue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, which he had afore ſene, leading the campe in twoo partes, the footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and artilery in the one parte, and in the other part the horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb facs="tcp:340:66"/>
toward the enemyes. This day I thinke that the enemyes myghte haue geuin vs battaile, for they had the plaine fieldes to come aga ynſte our horſmen, our footemen &amp; arty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery farre of. I dooe not knowe the cauſe, except they did not know our paſſage, in the which the Emperour was forced to deuide by partes, as I haue ſayde. The waye was of ſuche ſorte that this muſte nedes be done.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperour being lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (as it is ſaid) it was a great plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure to al the army, in ſo muche that it was called in prayſe, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours lodging, for it was diffarent and dyd excede that whiche we had le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t: for there was muche wood and water, a ſtrong place and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorte of victueles, commodious: A
<pb facs="tcp:340:66"/>
mountayne vppon the fronte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte our enemyes, muche lyke vnto the woorke of handes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon we layd oure artilerye, from whence we myghte ſhoote into the fyeldes. Vpon the ryghte hand we hadde a Marrys, and vppon the lefte hande a greate woodde, the whyche dydde extende vppon oure backes: Wee were ſo nere vnto the ennemyes, that oure warde and theyrs ſkirmyſhed ordinaryly. The Emperour commaunded to cutte theyr vyctualles, the whyche was done by ſuche dylygence by the lygh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> horſes and hackbutters, that all the waye goyng to Norlyng, Tynckeſpoole and Vlme, dydde lye full of deadde menne, broken cartes, and vyctualles ſcattered. And of oure part there were geuen
<pb facs="tcp:340:67"/>
ſo many ſkirmiſhes in the daye, and larums in the night, that they could neither eate nor ſlepe in reſt.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe our campe being lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in thys place, called the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours lodgig, our adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage began for to appeare, &amp; our enemyes to be more ſlowe in ſkirmiſhes, for they came not out with ſuch vigour, nor ſo luſtely as they had done, but our men aſſayled theyr trenches, out of the whyche they came but ſeldome times. Thei ſhewed only with their artilery what wyls they had to ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſh, for now with their go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes thei begynne to make a forte, and many times priſoners wer taken nere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr campe, &amp; they were not only oppreſſed in thys, but they began to be in great penury for lack of bread inſomuche that dyuers pryſoners
<pb facs="tcp:340:67"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed that they had bene .v. daies wythout it. And moreouer that thei were in great feare, ſeeing that they had thought that the Emperor had bene gone afarre of, and yet he was returned more nere at hand then he was before, and with his campe he determined to put them to flyghte, the which they might wel perceiue, ſeing the place y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had taken. And becauſe he would the more oppreſſe them, he cauſed a mount ouer them for to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely be beaten in al partes. At thys tyme the citye of Norling intreated to yelde, the which hadde: there did nede no other aduantage for to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge the enemies, for one Gariſon beyng therein, theyr victuals might be taken, whereby they might be in famyne more harde and ſharper
<pb facs="tcp:340:68"/>
then any artilerye.</p>
            <p>¶ At thys tyme the Duke of Saxon and the Lantgraue wer at a conſent for to write a letter to the Marques John of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>denburge brother to the Electour, the whiche ſhoulde be written in the name of a knyghte, ſeruaunt to the Electour. The ſubſtaunce whereof was, that the knyghte ſhoulde pray the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques John, that he woulde ſpeake wyth the Emperour, and ſaye vnto hym: ſeeyng that he was a Prynce enclined vnto all reaſon, he thought it ſhould be good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by ſome meanes peace mighte be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ounde, laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym the wealthe of Germany. And to thys they offered certayne capitulacions touchyng relygyon, whyche were to the great aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Catholiques, but not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:340:68"/>
great as hys maieſtye by the help of God dyd entende. Thys letter was wrytten by thys knyghte, cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led Adam Trope, chaunceler to the Electour of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>denburge, it was brought by a trumpette to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ques John, whereof he made rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Emperour, and by hys conſent it was anſwered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if the Duke and the Launt graue would put theyr parſones and eſtates into hys handes, he would be content to ſpeake of peace, or els not. They hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s aunſwere, wrote agayne, ſaying: that the affayres touchyng parſons of eſtate, required delybera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion, wherefore they thought it good that he and the Erle of Bure, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke, &amp; the Lantgraue, might como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together in ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e place apointed. The Marcas wrote vnto them agayne
<pb facs="tcp:340:69"/>
by the Emperours conſent, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame wordes as he hadde before wrytten.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe they of Norling ether by diſſimulation, or for becauſe they wer not of power to put out of their Citye the banners there lefte by the Duke and the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue, they trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo long, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Emperor thought beſt to take the vpper hand, and for to diſlodge the enemies parforce for being there it could not be done, but he was determined in anye wyſe it ſhould be done. So the next day we rayſed our campe. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded theyr campe to be beaten, for ſythe that Norling did ſo tracte the time, he would take an other order. This was in the latter ende of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, in which time was taken the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues brother in law, by his other
<pb facs="tcp:340:69"/>
wyfe which he had taken, for ſo they kepe the lawes which they fynde in theyr goſpels.</p>
            <p>¶ At this tyme the Emperour had newes that the enemyes were vp and going, but this was aboute the middeſt of the day, for the Spie (although he was natural of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) had loſt his waie, therefore we had no knowledge, vntyll they had hurnt their lodginges, and ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t theyr cariage and great ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce before. And at midnight theyr footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to marche, leauing in the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward theyr horſinen and ſmal arty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, which were wont to go before. The Emperour hearyng of this, he ſent certaine light horſmen for to be clearelye certified of theyr parting. The certificacion was, that theyr campe was altogether forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The
<pb facs="tcp:340:70"/>
Emperour rode foorthe wyth the horſmen of Monſure de Bure, and commaunded the Dutche menne to come after, and the footemen to be in order and ready at the ſending for them. He commaunded ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred Hiſpaniardes hackbutters to be ſet forth as ſpedely as myght be and then with the horſemen that he had taken, he rode to the campe of the enemies, there they had left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſicke me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for of a truth that made great haſte. Then he commaunded the horſmen to followe, and to keepe them in ſkirmyſh. The Duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy deſyred the horſmenne of the Earle of Bure for to folowe after. But nowe the horſmenne whyche were ſent to kepe them in ſkyrmyſh, turned agayne, wyth the ſtraglers whych they had taken of theyr rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
<pb facs="tcp:340:70"/>
but theyr campe dyd keepe on the way, geattyng of ground to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde a hyll, where they hadde one thouſande hackbutters, theyr horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne paſſed ouer on the other part all excepte twoo ſtanderdes, which taryed thereuppon wyth the hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butters. But when they dyd ſee his Maieſtye commyng wyth his horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne, bothe theyr Hackebutters and the horſemenne dydde forſake the hyll, goyng downe towarde theyr Armye. The Duke of Aluoye dydde make all the haſte poſſyble for to take the hyll that they hadde forſaken, from whence it myghte well be ſeene where they hadde ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an other hyll a myle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nce betwene theſe two hyls, was all playne and dyſcouered.
<pb facs="tcp:340:71"/>
They did lay vpon that hyl .vj. pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of artilery, with the whiche they did beate al the plain fieldes. Now they being gone downe into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and the Duke of Alnoy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hyl aforeſaid, theyr footemen might be ſene marching along, leauyng a great wood vpon theyr right hand. Their horſmen wer deuyded in the plaine, in .viij. or .ix. partes. Oure light horſmen did begin for to ſkyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in the valley, then one banner of blacke harnes was ſent down by the Duke for to engroſe hys ſkyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſhe. This was at the commyng of the Emperour with other horſes, but the enemies with a hye trot, had gotten ground on the other ſyde of the hyl, vnder theyr artilerye. Then they began to ſhoote of at our men in the valley, theyr hackbutters at
<pb facs="tcp:340:71"/>
the corner of the wood, made away for to be with the footemen, whyche kept the ordenaunce vpon the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne aforeſayde.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe the Emperour wyth a fewe horſmenne came to the hyll, whiche we had taken, for the other came after as men of armes might come. He abode there for to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe what might be done to kepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there, but nowe the daye was farre paſt, and the enemies being vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hyl aforeſaid, began to kindle theyr fyers in many places. And hys ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty ſeing that it was not poſſyble, for to ouer take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that day for lack of warning, as it is aforſayde: he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termined to take the other hyll, and to leaue the Duke of Aluoy wyth his horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there. And when it was late, he returned to the other lodgi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
<pb facs="tcp:340:72"/>
for to ſet forth the footemenne that night, becauſe the enemyes ſhoulde haue no time for to diſlodge. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours determinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was for to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in chaſe, ſo that he might finde one place to geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a brake, and vtterlye to breake their campe, or els to driue them from lodgyng to lodging, as he euer had done.</p>
            <p>¶ Foure times in theſe warres the Emperour hath dyſlodged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; as it ſemeth to be, ij. tymes by arte and twoo by force. Firſt at Ingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat (as they confeſſed them ſelues) they were conſtrayned by force for to retier. The ſecond tyme at Tona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uert, by arte in the geatti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:340:72"/>
he put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other time bi arte: for his maieſty did take from them Tonauert, and gat al the cities and townes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Danubia vnto Vlme.

            <p>¶ Nowe to tourne to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Emperour returned to his lodging, and becauſe he woulde get tyme for the next day, he cauſed the footemen and artilery to be ſpedely in order, and then after a litle colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion he parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence in a darke

it had bene a greater honour to the Emperour to deface his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, hys armye being whole then wyth any loſſe thereof.

for they roued farre about, and out of the waye, but his Maieſtye came ſtrayghte vnto Boſingane. The Burgemaſters came forth agaynſt him, to yelde vp their towne, and a Caſtel ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding aboue it, belongyng to the Erles of Ottingame, and the men of warre therein yelded to hys maieſty, howe be it they had made a litle brabling before.</p>
            <p>¶ The next dai thei of Norling came to geue vp their towne, for the campe was ſo nere, that there was no other thing to treat vpon. He put therin .iiij. baners, for the. ij baners which were left there by the Duke and the Lantgraue, were gone that night to a caſtell, a myle from Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, where they found other .ij. ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging likewiſe to the Erles of Ottingam.

The Earle brought the .iiij. ſtanders to the Emperour, let the ſoldiers go free, they woulde haue ſerued the Emperour, but he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them to folow the duke of Saron &amp; the Lantgraue. Nowe Norling being ſurrendred, and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre therein, he made gouernor of the countrey of Ottingame, a bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther of the ſaid Earles, which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, he left the Cardinal of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſt in Norling for certayne proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ſhoulde be made there. He went from Boſingame to Tinkeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole, a towne imperyall and of the league, they muſter to hold faſt, but

the Duke of Aluoy was ſent by the Emperours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tilerie, &amp; certain Hiſpaniardes and Almaynes. He gaue monicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the towne, and if the artilery wer laid agaynſt them, they ſhoulde be geuen in ſpoile to the men of warre, then they gaue vp the towne. The Duke brought the Burge maſters before his maieſtye then being nere vnto the towne, and there being one day, he left two banners of Garde. He remoued thence, and in .ij. daies he came to Rotenburge wyth great labour and trauaile, the weather be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing ſo foule &amp; roughe. They of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburge came out againſt his ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ieſty the daye before hys commyng thither, offering theyr towne to him ſaying: that they neither ſent menne nor mony againſt hym, and that is
<pb facs="tcp:340:78"/>
truthe.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperour had knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that hys ennemyes were not farre from thence, and they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue the Lordſhip of Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konia, and therfore he made greate ſpeede to Rotenburge, where the waies might be beſt foreſet, where the ennemyes intended to paſſe: for now it is neceſſarye to vnderſtande that when his maieſtye was at Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingane, the weather was ſo rygo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wyth froſte and ſnowe, that it ſemed to be intollerable. Wherfore the moſt parte of his campe, and of hys Captaynes (as al of a vowe) ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyſed hys Maieſtye to lodge hys campe in Norlyng, &amp; other townes whych he hadde gotten vppon Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubia, and about Vlme &amp; Auguſt: &amp; to this they layd ſufficient reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
<pb facs="tcp:340:79"/>
His maieſtye was of an other opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, differing from his Captaines and to chooſe a way more importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which was to defend Franckonia, and to lye before the enemyes, that they ſhuld not lodge at Auguſt nor Vhne, for why thys was an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, that if it myghte be obtayned, althinges might be done wyth more facility afterward. But if thei ſhuld be ſuffered to come together, and to recouer ſtrengthe in Franckonia, it ſhuld haue bene hard to haue come to any ende, becauſe the cities were yet in hope, ſeeing that their campe was not yet altogether broken, ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore notwithſtanding al theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties offered, at this preſent he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termined to cut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their waye, or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrain the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take an other, where by they might be dryuen in ſunder,
<pb facs="tcp:340:79"/>
and diſperſed. And this was a good forecaſt, as it hath ſence apeared by experience. For the enemies hauing knowledge that the Emperor was in Rotemburge, they left the way to Franckonia for to take an other on the left hand, and with a great rode, they made thorow the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines, where of neceſſitie they left parte of theyr great ordinance, deuyding it by cariage into the Caſtelles of the Dukes of Viertemburge, beyng there by, ſo that when his Maieſtie came to Rotemburge, they wer. 24. mile from thence, being but. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. the day before. They go now ſo broken that theſe two heades, their guydes parted them ſelues, the Lantgraue went with .iij. C. horſes toward his houſe: and paſſing by Frankeforte, the gouernours of the towne came
<pb facs="tcp:340:80"/>
to ſpeake wyth hym, as to a neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and captayne generall of the league, &amp; aſked him counſayle what he thoughte was beſt to be done, in time of ſo great neceſſity. He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red them ſaying: this that I thincke beſt is, that euerye Foxe keepe hys owne tayle.</p>
            <p>¶ Lykewiſe the Duke of Sar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on did take an other way, gathering vp the reliques of the fyelde that he coulde catche. Wyth a great code he went towarde hys countrey, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding wyth Albies by the way, taking of them money to paye hys Soldiours, for therefore they folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed hym.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperoure beyng at Rotenburge, and ſeeyng the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes ſo altered, and that the tyme and place ſerued not to ouertake
<pb facs="tcp:340:80"/>
them, he determined for to geue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Earle of Bure, for to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tourne into Flaunders wyth the campe that he hadde broughte, and that he ſhoulde go to Frankeforte, and procure by force or otherwayes for to get the towne, whych is great and ryche. Then the Emperoure parted wyth the reſte of hys armye, where the buſynes hadde beene in tymes paſte, but the great reputaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the vyctorye, nowe made the warre in Germanye for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure. At thys tyme dyuers cytyes ſent to Rotenburge their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours for to yelde, &amp; other began for to intreate to doe the ſame. Hys maieſty remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the cityes and townes imperial vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ryne, and ſome of Suauer came for to yelde them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:340:81"/>¶ The Emperor parted from Rotemburge: and in .ij. lodginges he came to Hale in Sueuer, one of the cities geuen vp, and of the moſt richeſſe of the prouince, and one of the league: and there, for the indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſition of the goute, he taried longer then he had thought to haue done.</p>
            <p>¶ At this time the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tey Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine began to treate as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe he had ſhewed himſelfe againſt hys maieſtie. Theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe and rogacions, were ſo ſet forth, that his maieſty amitted hym to his clemencie: for at the ende this is the vertue of Ceaſar: ſo they ſaide at the beginning, that it might pleaſe him for to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber al thynges but theyr offences. The Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te Palatyne ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to Hale to his courte, a day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palace, he was

brought into a chamber where his maieſty was ſet in a chayre, for the indiſpoſicion of his fete. The Earle came in with great reuerence, and began for to knowledge his faulte, and that he hadde offended, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did muche repent. His ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtye aunſwered, ſaying. And vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye I haue lamented in extreme, that in youre laſte dayes, and beyng of my bloude, and broughte vp in my houſe, that you haue ſhewed youre ſelfe ſo agaynſte me in fauor of my enemies, in the aide of theyr campe.

The Emperour for this reſpect, or for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whiche he oughte for to knowe better then thei that knowe no other thing but that which toucheth their handes: he toke vpon hym the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of this eſtate, and ſent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Aluoy before with the Hiſpany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, and the regimente of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drucho, and the Coronell Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, and the Italians that were left, the whiche were ſo fewe, that I make no number, and to my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, the cauſe was this: that the continuall trauayle in oure campe, made that there lacked many ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of al theſe nacions: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer then this, the ſlowe paymente of wages, which ſith the commyng from the riuer of Prence, had euer e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>creaſed in our ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue
<pb facs="tcp:340:85"/>
hauing enforced his, as it is ſayde, yet gaue vs no battayle, as he had ſo ofto promyſed to them of the league.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe the duke of Aluoy is gone with the parte of the armye, whiche I haue ſpoken of, with the Dutchehorſemen, and the thre hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> late come out of the realme of Naples. His maieſtye came after with the reſte of theyr horſmenne, &amp; the regimente of the Almaynes, whiche of late hadde bene in the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duite of George of Ranſburge, and nowe at the leadyng of the Earle of Maſſoulte. Thei went ſtreight to Alprime, a towne imperiall and of the league, ſtandyng vpon the entrye of the three wayes that goe to Viertemburge, the waye to that towne is moſte open and playne
<pb facs="tcp:340:85"/>
for to carrye Campe and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. The Emperoure beyng at Alprime, the duke of Viertem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge beganne for to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye his buſineſſe, for by the waye dyuerſe townes were come vnto the duke of Aluoy, for to yelde. And goyng forewarde, they came in to obedience all, excepte ſome ſtronge holdes, whiche by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſicion of their Scituacion, were inprenable. But the Duke of Viertemburge, takyng a more holeſome counſayle, was refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to all thynges that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure dyd demaunde, and gaue hym three of his ſtronge holdes, whiche ſhoulde pleaſe his maieſtye to take, and theſe were Ahſbridge, a greate Caſtell full of ordinaunce and vittayles, Ruramberge, which
<pb facs="tcp:340:86"/>
hadde prouiſion for manye yeares. The thirde is called Porendorſe, whiche was prouided for two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande menne for manye yeares, of ordinaunce and vittaylles, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the ſame. In theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes were founde muche artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of the Duke of Saxons and Launtgraue, the whiche they had left there, becauſe they might make the more haſte: and in eſpecially in this towne, beyng Ladye and the keye of the entrie into that eſtate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gaue vnto his maieſty, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſande Duckettes, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng to be at his commaundement, nothing except.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperoure hauyng in ſhorte tune thus ſubdued the Duke of Vierte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burge, hauing theſe fortes
<pb facs="tcp:340:86"/>
in his power, and the countrey aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, he hadde knoweledge from the Earle of Bure, that Franke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde was geuen his maieſtye, and that he was therein with twelue ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners. Two dayes after, came the Burgemaiſters of the ſame citie, whiche he receiued accordyng, and with like condicions as the other, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeruyng it to the conuenient wealth of Germanye. The nexte daye after, came ſeuen cities together, al of the league, emongeſt the whiche were Menengam, and Quintain, ſo that before his partyng from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prone, al the Cities of Sueuer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte Auguſte, were come to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedyence: for as I haue ſayde, the victorie of the Emperour did fyght for him in Germany.</p>
            <p>¶ His maieſtye parted from
<pb facs="tcp:340:87"/>
Alprone, &amp; did take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way to Vlme paſſyng through the Duchie of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertemburge, and in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vi. dayes he came thither, but thei of the citie had ſent vnto their Borders and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines with a greate companye of embaſſadours to receiue hym: and there knelyng in the fielde, they made hym an oracion in ſpaniſhe, becauſe they thought it (as they ſay) moſte reuerente to be ſpoken in the tongue whiche moſt naturally was his, and more tractable then theirs, they offred him their citie with their bodyes and goodes, as men deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for to ſerue their prince. He aunſwered them in Spaniſhe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, as they ſaye, ſhewyng them ſelues well contente, and ioyous to beare good wyll, to the which now they be come generally in all Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.
<pb facs="tcp:340:87"/>
In ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre call hym commonlye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vnſer fater, that is to ſaye, Our father. Theſe woordes were ſpoken one day by a priſoner of the enemyes, brought in by the Dutchemen before his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty. He aſked him it he knew him: he ſayd yea, I knowe you, ye be our father. Vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his maieſty ſaide: ye be villayns, ye be not my ſonnes, theſe good menne that ſtande about me be my ſonnes, and I am their fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther. This was a great rebuke to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priſoner, and a ioy to the Dutchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtode about him. Moreouer then this, with all other he is loued and deſired, for they that haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte hym in the warre, moſte parte offer to proue, that thei haue bene begyled, and not to bee of knowledge to goe agaynſte hym,
<pb facs="tcp:340:88"/>
inſomuche that there is amongeſt them a principall Earle, which hath ſtricken hymſelfe ſeyng his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulte, and no meruayle of this, for the force of vertue is ſo muche, that it moueth them that be euyl to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell well: and ſo nowe all menne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme muche more to bee in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, then for to ſaue theyr goodes, whiche without hym may be loſt. I write as I haue ſene and know.</p>
            <p>¶ His maieſtie being in a town belongyng to Vlme, came to hym embaſſadours from Auguſte, for there had bene geuen the earneſt of our Campe: yet although they ſent for to yelde them to hys maieſtye, it was in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions ſuch as he would not excepte. For theyr ſupplicacion was for to haue pardon for Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb facs="tcp:340:88"/>
Exertell: and yf that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hym not, yet at the leaſte, hys Caſtels and townes myghte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne vnto his chyldren. But hys maieſtye woulde not graunte vnto this. They declared vnto him that Exertell was in Auguſte, and that he hadde two thouſande menne and a great parte of the citie, with ſuche ſtrength, that they wer not able for to deliuer it. His maieſtye aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they ſhoulde not nede to trouble themſelfe with that, for he woulde bee there ſhortelye and dyſpatche that matter. When they were retourned to theyr citye, with this reſolucyon from hys maieſtye, the people were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde, that they gathered together concludyng for to yelde: and they of
<pb facs="tcp:340:89"/>
the Senate being in the halle of the citie. Exertell came in and ſayde vnto them. Lordes, I can tel wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon you treate, it is to be at a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſicion with the Emperoure, but becauſe you ſhall not lette for me, I am determyned to goe myſelfe, for parauenture in ſo doyng, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges that I thynke for to doe, maye bee a meane for to obtain my pardon. Theſe wordes ſpoken, he went to his houſe as ſecretelye as he coulde. It is ſayde that he tooke the waye to Suiſa. They of Auguſte came to Vlme at the days and howre appoynted, they were brought before his maieſtie ſitting in a chayre with all the ceremonies imperial accuſtomed. Thei kneling vpon their knees, one of them ſpake in this maner, fyrſte ſeyng the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarye

            <p>¶ We of Auguſt hauing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our offences, and lyke ſo to the correccion that we haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but knowyng by experyence your clemency to be ſo much, that al thei who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For theſe thinges, &amp; other like, he woulde take his reſte for a certayne tyme in Vlme, for to purge himſelfe there with the Pale of the Indes, that for his Goute is wont to be profitable.</p>
            <p>¶ The duke of Viertemburge

This conſidered, the Emperour departed from Vlme, when he had prouided for the footemenne of Spaine, to parte from their lodgyng with the ordinaunce that he had in Vlme.</p>
            <p>¶ The duke of Viertemburge becauſe of his infyrmitie, myghte not come when he was appoynted: but nowe beyng amended, he came the ſame daye that the Emperour

The Emperour paſſed by, but he ſaw him not, but the duke dyd beholde him ſtyll. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure dyd ſette hym downe with the Ceremonies accuſtomed.

            <p>¶ At this time John Frederike duke of Saxon had encreaſed his campe, and began to be a lord ouer all, for he had taken the Marques Albert in this ſorte. The Marques was in a place called Rockeles, for
<pb facs="tcp:340:97"/>
they which kept the warres againſt the duke John, were ſet in fronte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Duke Morres was in Frayberge, the king of Romaynes in Treſſon, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marques Albet with x. baners &amp; .viij. C. horſemen in the place aforeſaid. Moreouer they had furniſhed Suybiſa and Lipſia, the which had bene a litle before aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but it was ſo well defended by the ſoldiers, that his aſſaultes were al in vayne. This towne of Rokelez was belonging to a Lady, widdow and ſiſter to the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche did entertaine the Marques Albert with daunces &amp; bankettes after the cuſtome of Almayne, ſhewyng ſo great amitie, that he became more neglygent then a good Capytayne oughte for to be in the warres. And on the other parte ſhe aduyſed the

duke of Saron being in garde .iij. leagues from thence, wyth .j. bende of horſmen, and ſyxe baners of foote men, whych on the other daye dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye and earlye in the mornyng came vpon the Marques Alberte, which would in any wyſe fyghte in the playne fieldes, and there he was taken fyghtyng more lyke a valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt knyghte then a politique Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne.</p>
            <p>¶ There haue beene dyuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, for ſome dooe ſaye that the place might not be defended.

but for al theſe opinions it came to this, that he loſt .v.

            <p>¶ Nowe after thys victorye, it was thoughte that he woulde haue gone againſt the Duke Morres, he being ſo nere at hande: but leauyng them in Frabrige, he began to haue a reſpect concerning the affayres in Boemia: he ſent Thumſern with vj.

<pb facs="tcp:340:102"/>
They entered into Boeme, for to come ouer the mountaines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is al enuironed, and to ioyne with the Emperour in Egner, but the Boemoſe made a muſter then of their inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cions, declaring that the great truſte was not in vayne that the Duke of Saxon had in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he extended ſo that it was the cauſe of manye opinions, whiche I dooe not wryte, becauſe I dooe not know ſo much of a truth as it requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth to be wrytten.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe the Emperour beyng iij. iourneys from Newremberge, there came a Gentleman from the kynge of Romaynes wyth knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſithe that the king &amp; duke Morres were entred into Boeme with theyr horſemen and footemen: A knight of the countrey had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:340:102"/>
a great nomber to cut down the woodes in dyuers partes to ſtoppe the paſſages and the waies, by the whyche the kyng was purpoſed to come to Egner: wherefore he muſt go about thorow the mountaines &amp; the caſtels belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the knightes there being with him. Wherefore he required a nomber of hackbutters Hyſpanyardes for to paſſe more ſtrongly, and for to haue the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp of the wood. The Emperoure prouided for al thinges conuenient, albeit that after it was no neede to haue the Hyſpaniardes in thys paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, for the knightes of the country whyche were come to ſerue, didde ſo muche, that they wer al broken and diſparſed. Thys knyght of Boeme came not wyth the men whyche he had aſſembled, hys name is Gaſper
<pb facs="tcp:340:103"/>
Flucke, a principal man in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in tyme paſt the king had taken landes and goodes (and notwithout deſeruing) and ſence li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally he gaue them to him again: but it ſeemeth that he hath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred more the takyng then the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thankes for the gyfte, for it is euer the fyrſt poynt of ingratitude, to forgeat benefytes receyued.</p>
            <p>¶ It is ſayd that theſe knightes whyche mette together for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende thys paſſage, hadde made a bancket, and after caſte lottes who ſhoulde be theyr Captayne Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. They dydde take ſuche an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it fell to Gaſper Flucke, and not for that he was more apte then the other for thys charge, but becauſe he was moſte in power for to furnyſhe wyth men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
<pb facs="tcp:340:103"/>
or elles it myghte be that they dydde it, becauſe that if theyr enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe ſhoulde not haue good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, euerye manne woulde rather ſee the paryll vppon the head of an other, then vppon hys owne. But let it be as it was, for the moſt parte of that kyngdome made a ruynous demonſtracion againſt their prince.</p>
            <p>¶ Now is the king of Romaines paſſed by the Caſtels aforſayde, the Emperoure was commyng three leagues from Egner, the which is a citye of the kyngdome of Boeme, ſtanding vpon the borders of Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni, but it is out of the mountaines: for Boemeis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed about wyth great &amp; thicke woods, but towarde the parte of Morabia, it is more plaine: for on all other partes, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that nature hath fortyfyed it:

The people thereof be naturally valiant and of good diſpoſicion. Their horſmen in armes be like to the Almaines, the footemen dyffer, for they keepe not lyke order to the Almaines, nor thei vſe not like weapon, for one beareth a halberd, an other a Jauelin, other ſtaues of one faddame and a halfe of length, with great pykes of iron, other beare ſhorte handgo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes wyth brode hatchettes, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych they caſt .xx. paces very ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſomli.

            <p>¶ The Emperour nowe being at Egner, thither came the king his brother, duke Morres, &amp; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques John of Brandenburge ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to the Electour, for now hys father had taken an order wyth the kyng for to ſerue the Emperour, &amp; ſo ſent his ſonne for to ſerue in this warre.

            <p>

            <p>¶ All the countrey of Saxony
<pb facs="tcp:340:106"/>
borderyng vppon Egner, is full of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines, woods &amp; mariſhes: but after wee came to a towne called Plao .vij. leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Egner, there the countrey begynneth to be more open &amp; playne, there be faire fieldes and meddowes, with many caſtels and townes.

At thys time the Emperour with al diligence made ready towarde the enemies, for his deſyre was to finde them in the fielde with al their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe thei ſhould not take theſe iiij. ſtrong holdes, which be Vierte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, Got, Sonobalde, &amp; Eldram, the which he had taken a litle before from the Earle of Manfelte, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueriche

one of theſe was of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, &amp; ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for to prolong the warres many yeres: wherefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with al diligence, did take the wai to Meſſene, a town of the duke Morres, taken by the duke of Sar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, and therein dydde lye wyth his campe, for that was a place apte for whatſoeuer he woulde apoint to be done, for there were bridges vppon the ryuer of Albys, and nere vnto Boeme, from whence he looked for to haue great ayde of horſemen and footemenne, and lykewiſe for to goe to Viertemberge, if neede ſhoulde requyre. So beyng in thys place, and the Emperor folowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, diuers townes there about came in for to yelde, and alſo the companyes whiche the duke of Saron had lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged abrode in theſe partes were in

            <p>¶ In this time the Emperor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched Meſſene wyth hys campe, and beyng at hys lodgyng, there came newes that Thumſerne was but one league and a halfe from

The enemies being on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other part of the riuer, the waye long and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges lacking, it ſemed to be a greatlet. But the Emperour wolde in any wyſe that his determinacion ſhould take effecte, &amp; commaunded the artilerye, and the barkes of the bridge to be ſpeedelye ſet foorth that day, and the footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hiſpaniardes at midnight, and ſhortelye after the regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Almaines, and all the horſemen in the order accuſtomed: but in the morning there fell a very thicke miſt, ſo that there was neuer a part of the army did ſee how other did go, and of this the Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

He had with him .xxi. peeces of artilery and he was well aſſured and dyd know, that if we wold go and paſſe by Meſſene, he might tarry or go where he wold: &amp; where as he was, it was hard for to paſſe, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bredth and the depenes of the ryuer beyng in his keping vppon the other ſyde, with a town and a caſtel (although they were not ſtrong,) yet they wer

ſufficient to kepe the paſſage. Nowe the lodging of our campe being ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; deuided by quarters at the em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perours comming about .viij. of the clocke in the mornyng, he comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the horſmen to be in order, and not to lodge.

Now the Emperour, the king and Duke Morres, after a litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation taken in a houſe thereby, at theyr commyng foorthe, goyng to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the enemies, came the duke of Aluoy, and ſayd that he had knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leddge by a manne of the countreye, that coulde bryng hym to a forde, the name of the place where the Emperour came forth, is called Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemeſer, whiche is as muche to ſay, wade, it was not farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forde. They on the other parte hadde ſette foorthe and deuided theyr artilerye &amp; hackbutters vpon the ſhore, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the defence of the paſſage, &amp; at the bridge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was brought &amp; made of barkes the which they had made

of three peeces to bring down with them more at eaſe. The diſpoſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the paſſage was in this ſorte.</p>
            <p>¶ Their riuage in the keeping of the enemies was muche ſuperior &amp; aboue oures, with a diche where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with theyr hackebutters myght be couered, our part was ſo plaine and diſcouered, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euery floud dyd flowe ouer. They had the towne and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel aforeſaide, but we had no couer but the plaine fieldes, except a fewe litle trees ſtanding by the water, &amp; where the forthe was thought for to be, it was .iij. C. paces brode. And al though the ſtreame ſeemed for to be ſlowe, it had a vehement courſe: ſo that thorow al theſe thinges that I haue ſpoken of, there was ſo greate difficultie, that the helpe and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacion of the Emperoure was
<pb facs="tcp:340:112"/>
nedefull with art and force. An or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was taken that certayn peces of artillery ſhoulde be layd emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the trees, ſtanding nexe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; .viii.

For although it was diſcouered, harde and pery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for to be done, yet of neceſſitye it muſt be done.</p>
            <p>¶ At this tyme the enemyes had layde hackbutters in their barkes, whiche were commyng downe by the ſtreame, ſo that it was nedefull for our hackbutters to goe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen banke, the which ther dyd ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently that many of them entred into the riuer vp to the breſte, and
<pb facs="tcp:340:113"/>
charged ſo harde vpon them in the riuer and in the barkes, and killed ſo many, that thei did forſake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ew that ſtode at defence. At this time the Emperor was preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and this was the ſkirmiſhe on the one parte and the other: all their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilery, and hackebutters were dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged vpon vs, but our hackbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters although the place was note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall: they preaſed ſo nere, that the aduauntage myght bee perceyued on our parte, for the enemies began to ſlake and to ſhoote ſlowly. Then the Emperour commaunded to bee ſente one thouſande hackebutters Hyſpamardes, with the Archemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter de Campo of Lumberdye, for to a Taulte the enemies yet more liuely, and ſo the ſkirmiſhe wente ſo hotely on the one parte and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:340:113"/>
ſo that it might bee called a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutacion of hackbutters. The duke of Aluoy certifyed his maieſtye, that the forde was founde, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we myght paſſe. The Emperour was fully determined for to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daye, and not to geue anye tyme to the Duke of Saxon, for to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye theſe ſtrong holdes before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Thei being ſufficiente for to delate the warres manye yeares. The Emperoure came to the forde when thei were hearyng a ſermon, after the cuſtome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lutherians: but when they harde howe it was, I think thei tarryed not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to here their preacher, but to prouide, which profited litle againſt him that came agaynſt them.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperor withal ſpede co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded the horſemenne to paſſe,

The enemyes ſet fyre on ſome of their Barges, other wer forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in ſome other, the ſouldiers did lye along to be out of peril. At this time
<pb facs="tcp:340:114"/>
the bridge was come to the ſhore: but the riuer being ſo brode, our bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges might not ſuffiſe, therfore their bridge was nedefull to be gotten, &amp; like as agaynſt ſtrength and vertue there is nothyng diffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le, ſo all theſe difficulties of the Albeis haue not been impoſſible.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe the enemyes goe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riuer, for thei may no longer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer to be there, but a few which ſtode at the defence. The Emperor ſeyng that their bridges muſte nedes bee had, he commaunded the hackebut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be diligent. Then ſodaynlye x. Hiſpaniardes ſtripped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; with their ſweordes ouerwharte in theyr mouthes, thei did ſwimme to the barkes of the enmies, and after thei had kylled the kepers, thei brought them to our ſhore. There were alſo
<pb facs="tcp:340:115"/>
thre Hiſpaniardes horſemen which dyd take the riuer, but one of them was drowned. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bridge was gotten, and our hackebutters ſtanding vpon the banke, theyr heartes began to fayle them. All the horſemenne came to the water ſyde, but the Emperoure commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded .ix. banners of Almaynes to kepe the fyelde, of euery regimente thre, and, xv. hundred horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, two hundred and fiftie of the marques Albertes horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which wer come from the ouerthrowe of their lorde, to the kyng. He commaunded the horſemen Hungarians, the whiche with the Emperours horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now began to paſſe before the enemyes wente out of the towne aforeſayde. They hadde made a litle ſkirmiſh,

but oure hackebutters entred into the water, and defended ſo lyuelye with ſhootyng of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o thicke, that our horſemenne were as ſafe vpon the other ſyde as vpon oure part. But when the enemyes beganne to breake, there was no more hope to kepe them foorth: then they made towarde a town called Troga, and if they myghte not take this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they might not haue tyme to dooe one of theſe two thinges.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperour did take an order, and commaunded the Duke of Aluoy, that the Hungarians and the Prynce of Salmona with hys lyghte horſes, ſhoulde take euerye eche one a hackebutter

behinde him, and to paſſe ouer with the menne of armes of Naples, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with hym duke Morris, for theſe were the horſemen of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. Then the Emperoure and the kyng of Romayns with theyr Eſquadrons came to the riuer. The Emperour rode vpon a darke dun Spaniſhe horſe, preſented by mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure de Ry, knyght of the order, and his firſt chamberlayne, he rode in white armour gilt, hauing no other apparell, but a brode bende of Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fata Crimſen, and a dutche murri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, a Demilance like a iauelyng in his hand. He rode as thei wryte of Julius Ceaſar when he paſſed the Ribicon, ſpeakyng theſe notable wordes, and without any doubte it was a proper compariſon to vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng there, to haue the repreſentacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of the ſight of Ceaſar, paſſyng a ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer armed, and with an oſte armed, and on the other part not for to treat but of victorie, for the paſſage of the riuer was onely with this hope and determinacion, ſo that with the one and the other, the Emperor did take the water, folowing the milner who was our guide. He did take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waye more vpon the ryght hande aboue in the ſtreame, then the horſemen whiche were paſt before: the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de was harde, but the depe was aboue the knees of the moſte of the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne, and in ſome places they did ſwyme a lytle ſtretche.

<pb facs="tcp:340:117"/>
nowe the bridge was made with our barkes, &amp; thoſe whiche we had gotten of our enemies, and the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniardes began to paſſe, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter the Almains according to the order that the Emperour had taken, and nowe the Hungarians ſette downe the hackebutters whiche they hadde ſette ouer the riuer, and rode before to ſkirmiſh, &amp; to intertain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies which made great haſt without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of any ſouldier in Milbrucke, as it was thought at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt he would haue done: &amp; this was one of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes, for the paſſage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hackbut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters with the lighte horſemen. But with their ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe, thei dyd geat euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduauntage of the ground, parting their fotemen in two eſquadrons, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one greater then the other, &amp;. ir. ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>¶ The Emperour with a hygh trot as men of armes might ſuffer, folowed the way after his enemies, in the which way he founde a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix ſtanding, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:340:118"/>
vawarde was verye great, and the eyre did driue it in our eyes. The Emperour rode vpon the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and this was for two cauſes. One was for to haue ſyght at libertie, the other to prouide for ſuch perylles as we haue ſeen in our tyme folowe when Eſquadrons goe not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as it is ſene by experience, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde broken the battaile loſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not ſet in order as it ought to be</p>

            <p>¶ Now the duke of Aluoy with his menne in the vawarde, ſkirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

To this the Emperoure anſwered: Now ye call me Emperoure: thys is an o her name then ye haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me in tymes paſt. And this he ſayd: for when the duke of Saxon and Launtgraue did leade the campe of the league, they dyd wryte hym in theyr letters, but Charles of

            <p>¶ The daye before the partyng of the king, the Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>garians came to

kyſſe the handes of the Emperoure with ſupplicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it might pleaſe him to haue in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of Hungary, they made an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion according to the time of their fortune.

garmentes of crymyſon after their faſhyon, and to eueryche one .xxx. crounes, wyth the aduauntage of their banners.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperor being come vnto Hale in Saxonye, which is a great towne ſtandyng in the dyoces of Madeburge, although duke John had taken it for his owne. His ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie lodged in the houſe of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and there determined to put in effect, that the which by the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the electors, it had pleaſed the Emperour to conſent. The condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons general whiche to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce be theſe.</p>
            <p>¶ Firſt that the Lantgraue ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit hym ſelfe into the handes of the Emperour with al his poſſeſſions, &amp; to ſwere fidelitie to his maieſtye, to giue the .iiij. principall townes that
<pb facs="tcp:340:141"/>
he hath, and for to be caſt downe at his commaundement.</p>
            <p>¶ He dothe geue to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure .v. C. and. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thys is the pointe whiche is to hym ſo muche voorthe, that not for to come there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:340:142"/>
pardoneth hym his lyfe, and taketh away the Vande imperial, whyche was proclaimed againſt him, &amp; like wyſe remitteth him from perpetual priſon. Before the commyng of the Launtgraue to Hale, there was a great queſtion and bebate betwene the Hiſpaniardes &amp; the Dutchmen: it was ſo farre forth, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour put him ſelf amongſt them. It was a neceſſarye remedye, for none but only he might ſuffice, howe be it that it was not without peril which might haue chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, being betwene ij. parties ſo furious, which now be ganne to be blynde.</p>
            <p>¶ At thys time the Emperor dyd geue licence to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Embaſſadours of Boeme, ſaying vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſumme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wold make interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if the realme was greued in

any thing, it ſhould be diſgrauated. But thys was to be vnderſtanded co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming firſte into the obedience of their king in doing their duty, and if not, his maieſti could do no leſſe, but to take the affaires of his brother as his owne proper. This was in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me hys anſwer, how be it in hys letters they were anſwered more at large.</p>
            <p>¶ Now the day is come that the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to Hale with one hundreth horſes: he dyd lyght at the lodging of Duke Morres hys ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne in lawe, nowe Electour. The nexte day at the houre apoynted, he came to the pallace accompanyed wyth theſe two Electours. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was in the haule wyth the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies accuſtomed in theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. There were manye lordes and knightes of Almme which came to ſe that which they thought neuer to
<pb facs="tcp:340:143"/>
haue ſene in the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came before the Emperoure, he did take of hys bonnet, and kneled downe vpon his knees, &amp; his chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>celour lykewyſe: the whyche by the name of his lord ſaid theſe wordes. ¶ Right high, moſt mighty &amp; victo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious prince, Emperour and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, Phillip the Launtgraue of Heſſene hathe greuouſlye offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your Maieſtie beyng in theſe warres, and geuing a cauſe of iuſte indignacion for the enducing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parſons to fal in the ſame fault, wherfore your maieſty may vſe al ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gour in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> correccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his deſeruing.

any thing to the contrary, for to be al his life a meke and obedient ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in knowing of the great benefite of thys pardon obtayned at your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, for the whiche he deſyreth and ſhall deſier al hys lyfe to ſerue wyth thankes, as he is bound in ſuch ſort, that your maieſty may know in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, that the Lantgraue &amp; his ſhal kepe and obſerue as they be bounde by the articles, by the whyche your Maieſties pleaſure hath bene for to graunt. Theſe were the woordes of the Lantgraue in effect.</p>
            <p>¶ The Emperoure commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one of his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel Almane who ſayde theſe woordes. Hys Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty (pyteful Lord) doth vnderſtande what the Lantgraue hath ſayd: that although he hath confeſſed and hath greuouſlye offended, ſo that he hath
<pb facs="tcp:340:144"/>
deſerued al puniſhment, thoughe it were the greateſt that might be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whiche is to all the worlde well knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Notwithſtanding, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty hauing a reſpecte that he hathe ſubmitted him ſelfe at his feete, and by his clemency accuſtomed, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at the interceſſion of the pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which haue intreated, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take awaye the baniſhment iuſtlye declared agaynſte hym, and not to punyſhe hym wyth payne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall as he hathe deſerued for the rebellyon committed agaynſte hys Maieſtye, nor with perpetual prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne, neyther yet wyth the confyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion of hys goodes: but hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorthe to be contente wyth the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycles in the Chapters, whyche hys Maieſtye hathe graunted.
<pb facs="tcp:340:145"/>
He receiueth him into his grace and mercye wyth the ſubiectes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of his houſe, ſo that he acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhe al that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in his chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters, ſo that he doth not go directlye nor indirectly in any thyng againſt them. And that his maieſty doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue and truſt that the Lantgraue and his ſubiectes wyll deſerue the great mercy and pitye that he hath vſed towarde them. Theſe be the wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anſwer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue.</p>
            <p>¶ Al thys tyme the Lantgraue kneeled vpon his knees: but when he did ſtand vp, his maieſty touched not his hand, nor yet made vnto him any ſight of curteſy. It was a thyng notable to ſee hym kneling a pryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; the duke Henrique of Brunz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wique which had bene his priſoner, at lybertye, ſtandyng by one foote.
<pb facs="tcp:340:145"/>
Here might bee ſene the chaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſucceſſe of man. This finiſhed, the duke of Aluoy came vnto hym, and ſaid: you muſt depart, deſiring the two electors to ſupper with him. So the Lantgraue was led out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palace vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtel where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke did lie, &amp; after ſupper he appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a lodging in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtel, &amp; commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Don Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de Gneue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶ At the fyrſte the Launtgraue did take his impriſonmente vnpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlye: for of a trueth, he thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:340:146"/>
Almayne in buſines and quarrels, that in the ſelfe ſame, he is come for to write agaynſt himſelfe, with hys owne hande, intreating of no other thing, but to be a priſoner perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or temporall, at the diſcrecion of him, into whoſe handes he hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf, and ſith is come to knowledge that his mouth hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken againſt hym. He beganne to quiet himſelfe, and to take his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with more pacience: ſo he that prayſed hymſelf ſo muche in buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it is come to paſſe, that he is loſte in trouble and buſineſſe. The Duke of Saxon whiche hath prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hymſelfe to be a man of warre, and of ſtrength, it is come to paſſe that he hath loſte hymſelfe in the warre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:340:146"/>¶ Theſe twho heades of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therans which haue ſo muche dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted al chriſtendome, nowe god hath geuen them into the handes of the Emperour, with ſo honourable meanes, to hym and his fame ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as the worlde ſhall endure. And ſithe for to ſpeake of theſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I thinke it ſhall not bee farre from the purpoſe, to ſay what euery manne may iudge in them. The Duke of Saxon is a manne of a greate courage, eloquente, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete. And in his manours he hath a grace in all thing that he ſayth or dooeth. He is liberall, and for theſe good qualities, he is muche beloued in Germanye and well frended. He is more quyete then the Launtgraue, by whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:340:147"/>
counſaile, as they ſaye, they beganne the warre this yere paſt. The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue differeth muche in condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this: for why he is vnquiete in extreme, a great frend and main tayner of quarelles and ſtryfe. He is not of ſuche effabilitie, nor ſo light of ſpeche in his practice and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacion, but rather a light witte, and as to his ciuilitie he is not of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion emongeſt folkes, nor lyke to the Duke of Saxon: but becauſe he hath gone more diligentlye aboute this buſineſſe paſte, and being cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne generall of the league, he hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more occaſion to ſpeake of him then of the other, although the duke hath been more of aucthoritie.</p>
            <p>¶ In the citie of hale came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his maieſtye a great greting and congratulacion of this victorie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:340:147"/>
the Pope. And in his briefe that he wrote vnto hym, he ſette hym foorth with the renowme of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, with mighty names as wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued as geuen. Theſe thinges done, his maieſtye parted from hale when he hadde prouided for the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng of Gotte, the artillerye was broughte to Francfort, and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from all the fortes of the Lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, excepte one that his maieſty left him.

            <p>¶ Nowe the Emperoure hath broughte to paſſe all theſe thynges in Germanye, whiche haue been ſo hyghe in the toppe of pryde, and with ſo greate power, that it ſemed to the heades of them, that theyr pryde was no preſumpcion, but all reaſon, and withoute anye doubte theyr power was ſo greate, that it ſemed to all menne, that there was not ſtrength in the reſte of chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for to reſyſt. But he that may dooe all thynges, hath ſuffered the Emperour to haue the victorye, for the whiche his name ſhall remayne more cleare then anye of the other Emperours of Rome, conſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the greate dedes and the
<pb facs="tcp:340:151"/>
cauſes wherefore, ſo that al prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be bounde, whiche ſtande in the determinacion of the churche, as the countye Palatyne, the Duke Morres, the Duke of Viertem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, the marques of Brandem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge Elector, and all they of their names. And they of Almayne, whiche ſemed to bee moſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the ſelfe Launtgraue, with other princes, and ioyntlye all the cities of the Empyre, from Auguſte, where his maieſtye kept the diet. He ſente with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Trente large relacion to his holines.</p>
            <p>¶ The greatnes of theſe warres, deſerue a relacion more at large, then this of myne, but I with thys briefe remembraunce, maye helpe them whiche write more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlye:
<pb facs="tcp:340:151"/>
but ſurely this I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when Ceaſar had conquered Fraunce in x. yeres, he filled the world with his Comentaries. And Rome made ſupplicacions to the gods, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei had paſſed the Ryne, and had been x. dayes in Almayne, he thoughte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſuffiſed to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie &amp; the dignitie of the people which gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the worlde. The Emperoure in one yere, hath ſubdued this braue prouince, witneſſe the Romayns of our tyme. Charles the great in. xxx yeres ſubdued Saxony. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in leſſe then fowre monthes was lorde of all the whole prouince. The greatneſſe of this warre is woorthye a greatter ſtile then mine is: for I cannot write but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> naked trueth, without anye affeccion, but yet the remembraunce may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb facs="tcp:340:152"/>
according to the deſeruing of the greatnes of the enterpriſe, the whiche, and of the yere paſſed, hath been gouerned by the Emperour ſo ſtreight, that if it had been guyded otherwayes, it hadde not come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ende that we haue ſene it: for at al tymes when it hath bene nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be gouerned by arte, the order hath been obſerued to that effecte neceſſarie. And alſo when it hath bene conuenient to woorke by force, the determinacion hath bene ſo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with ſuche courage &amp; ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, as hath bene nedeful. Wherfore his fame is worthy to bee ſo muche ſuperiour to the other Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayns in time paſt, ſo much as in the vertue &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he is to them all.</p>
