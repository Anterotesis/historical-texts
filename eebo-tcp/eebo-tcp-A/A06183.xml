            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The commenter vpon <hi>Aristotles</hi> Book <hi>De animalibus</hi> telleth a storie to this purpose: A certaine husbandman nourished an Aspis in his house, féeding him daily at his own table, and chearing him with his owne meat; it fortuned a little while after that hée brought forth two yong ones, the one of which poisoned the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmans sonne, and brought sorrow to his houshold: The old bréeder considering this (in the sight of the father) murthered the offender, and as if ashamed of his ingratitude, departed the house with the other. Behold sence of benefite in a Serpent, and will man be vnthankfull? The Lion that was healed by <hi>Andronicus</hi> in the wood, did he not saue his life in the Theator? Man consider this, and to bring thée the more in hatred with this fiend, weigh this one example of <hi>Seneca</hi> written in his fourth Booke <hi>De beneficijs:</hi> A certaine sould for indangered by ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, and floating (for the space of twentie daies) on a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mast in a sore tempest, was at last cast a shoare in a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Lordship, by whom he was reléeued with meat, clothes, and monie: This Nobleman comming to <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon his King, and encountring a little after with this vnthankfull souldier, was by him accused of false Treason: and so much for the time did iniquitie preuaile, that not only he indangered the Noblemans life, but possest his goods likewise, by the beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

of the King: notwithstanding truth (which according to <hi>Seneca</hi> in <hi>Oedipus, <hi>adit moras,</hi> hateth delay</hi>) being at last discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the king assertained of the wretched souldiors ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he branded him in the face with a burning yron, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiling him of his ill gotten goods, restored the other: so deale you by this Diuell of our age, and beware of his subtilties, for if once he proue an intelligencer, he will helpe to hang you.</p>

The second remedie is, to fatten this inclosure of our hearts with the vertue of charitie; for of it it is said, That it couereth the multitude of sinnes. To conclude a sea of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a short circle of admonition, refraine lust and her proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie for these causes, First it destroieth the infused graces of God, and the gifts of the holie ghost: Secondly, it consumeth the foure cardinall vertues: Thirdly, it weakeneth the body, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>féebleth the spirit, and hardeneth the heart against all deuotion.

                  <hi>It hindreth the iudgement and vnderstanding, least it should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne truth:</hi> and for that cause the Deuill behaueth himselfe like a cunning fisherman, who purposing to catch and insuare the fish more cunningly, troubleth the waters, to the end, that blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their sight, they may the sooner fall in his net.

pollicte of the Deuill to blind our vnderstanding with wrath, least we would discerne his villany: thirdly, Ire shorteneth life, as may appeare in beasts, which being naturally chollericke, haue but short time of continuance; as namely, in the dog, and that in <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> it is approoued, where it is said, <hi>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10173:42"/>
and litle will in such sort créepe and attaine to the feiguurie of the heart, that by no meanes or medicine it will be vuseated therefrom. The heauen (said <hi>Gallen</hi>) hath so much fauoured me, that I had a iust, good, and courteous father, &amp; no waies oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with passion and choller; whose good precepts and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I haue euer retained: for at no time, in what choller so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he hath béene, haue I séene him transported so farre, as to strike any man, but (which more is) hée had alwaies a custome to reprehend those, that beat and stroke their subiects and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. But if I were fortunate in a father (said he) I was lesse fortunate in a mother, for I had one the most chollericke and troublesome woman liuing vpon the earth, shée was alwaies at the staffes end with my father, to whome shée was no lesse troublesome, then was earst <hi>Xantippe</hi> to her <hi>Socrates:</hi> she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceased to raile against him, continually filling the house w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tumult, yea, choller had such power in her from her youth, that when she entred into any discontents, she finng, stampt, strooke, yea so far forgot her selfe, that she strooke her chambermaids. The same author saith like wise, that the first time he began to detest that vice, was, that being a young lad he beheld a man seased with this passion, who was so far disguised by choller, that hée séemed rather a monster then a man, for hée had his countenance changed, his eies staring, his haires bristling on his head, his lookes furious, and all the rest of his body trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and agitated with fury; he cried, he stamped, he threatned, he fomed at the mouth like a bore, and to conclude, he shewed such strange, insolent, and prodigious countenauces, that hée gaue manifest euidence that this brutall passion, brings a man besides himselfe, and makes him like vnto beasts. Thus farre <hi>Gallen,</hi> by whose counsell if wée propose vnto our selues the image and picture of a distempered and wrathfull man, no doubt but the obscene, filthy, and lothsome behauiour which he vseth, will bring vs in detestation of his vice, and determination to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid and conquer such like perturbations and affections.</p>

All philosophie will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse vnto me, that the more a man stuffes and chargeth his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, the more he gréeueth it; for first of all it is necessary that he surmount and excéed the nutriment and meat, and digest it also; and in the surmounting he must striue, and in striuing he wearieth himselfe, and in wearying himselfe he waxeth féeble, and in waxing féeble he finally consumeth, and then his cooke (I meane his stomacke) vnable to worke or boile, it followeth of necessity that he must die.

The ordinarie seate of this humor is in the sensualitie of the heart: With this weaknesse of spirit was <hi>Anthonie</hi> the Romane seasd, who séeing the increases of <hi>Caesar,</hi> when his meanes of resist were sufficient, retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his Timoneum, leauing both <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and his busines, as destitute of all hope, before the assurance of his danger: mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall is this sinne if it bée accompanied with the consent of the will, the Apostle writing to the Colossians saith, Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke not your children vnto indignation, least they become weake in mind, and loose their courage, (according to the Syriak:) noting hereby, that this infirmitie accompanieth for the most part those that are of the weakest abilitie and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

he seaseth one body: the first is <hi>Idlenesse,</hi> (slack to performe any thing, and a poison that confoundeth many men;) the second is <hi>Slownesse,</hi> that deserreth to follow vertue, or conuersion from sinne: the third is <hi>Tepiditie,</hi> which causeth a man do his worke coldly, without courage or feruor in his busines. This fiend haunteth most commonly among those sort of men, that are too much subiect to their flesh, and being bondslaues to their sensual lusts, haue their reasons obscured, and their desires dulled: they hate Musike, despise Arts, accounting their excellence to be in ignorance; if they speake, it is so abruptly and lothsomly, as it mooueth not; and if they be silent, they rather looke like some blind statues of marble, then liuing and moouing men. If they write, it is <hi>Inuita Minerua,</hi> so coldly and without conceit, as they (like the vntunable ring of Bels) rather fill the ears with iarring and noise, then delight or reason. Many &amp; too many are possessed with this spirit, and this spirit is incarnate in them. For they only like beasts respect present things, hauing no care of that which is to come: you shall sée a slouen sléeping in his bed, that for want of rising loseth the commodity of preferment: another so cold in his enterprises, that he is vnfortunate in all busines. Whatsoeuer commeth from such men, séemeth to be enforced, (so is the eie of their iudgements blinded in percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that which best behooueth them.) I knew one of this factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Oxford, who (after he had studied seuen yeres, &amp; often beaten ouer the Predicables,) at last thanked God y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he had a litle sight in <hi>Genus:</hi> This was as slouenly a lout as euer I lookt vpon, who often found in his heart to loose his breakfast for want of fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: come into his study, you should still sée him sléeping ouer his booke. In all exercises he was alwaies the last: &amp; in all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations so cold, &amp; duncicall, that neither any man vnderstood him, nor he, himselfe. With this spirit was those two Seruing men seased, the first of which being asked by his master sitting at dinner, what hée had brought from the Sermon? In faith Sir, (said he) your hat and cloake, and nothing els. The second examined in the like manner, answered thus: Faith I markt not the beginning, I was asléepe in the midst, and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before the end. This is a daungerous fiend wheresoeuer
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10173:54"/>
he gets footing, causing men to make shipwracke of their time, which being short and swift once past is irrecouerable, &amp; which lost (saith <hi>Bias</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi>) a great treasure is lost. This made certaine discontented (as <hi>Timon</hi> and <hi>Apermantus</hi>) waxe<note place="margin">Plutarch</note> careles of bodie and soule, fretting themselues at the worlds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and giuing ouer all diligent indeuor, to serue the fury of their vnbridled minds. The stories registred by learned men are full of men thus affected, and who so considereth the most pollices and Common weals of Christians, shall I fear me (and let me write it with griefe) find more oportunitie lost by cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, slacknes, and delay, then consideration can remedy with many yeares heart break and studie. By delay and protraction, enemies wax strong, and lingering hate giueth preuention a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenter eie; and though <hi>Affricanus</hi> admitteth not officious dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, yet am I so contrarie to him, that I dare boldly auow, that the most stratagems that are done happily, are done sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly: yet desire I not to bée misconstrued in this, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore action, I admit counsel, and secresie: But matters once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I hold all time lost till they be executed; for delay giueth the enemie oportunitie of intelligence, weakeneth the heart of the souldior, generally more feruent in the first exploits; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth the heart of the gouernor till the issue be discouered. To conclude, as waters without stirring &amp; mouing, wax corrupt; so without diligence all affaires are either lost or weakened.</p>

with dust for want of looking too, his garments fall in pieces for want of amending, his haire ouergrow his shoulders, for want of barbing, his face couered with durt for want of washing, and he walks generally vntrust, not for exercise sake, but for idlenes: he is still thinking and deuising on things, but he executeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and (like a lunaticke person) runs into strange imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and only speaks them without effecting them: he defers in al that he doth, and thereby loseth the most of his thrift; and in neglecting to sollicite his friends, hée loseth &amp; smothereth his fortunes; so that <hi>Occasion</hi> may rightly say and crie to him out of <hi>Ausonius,</hi>

Wherevpon in the Gospell it is said, To be in the heart of the earth: For as the heart is in the middest of a creature, so is Hell in the middest of the earth. At the last hée is made bald and spoild of his haire, that is, depriued of his vertues and graces. And where it is said, <hi>Ionas</hi> sléeping the winds arose; it implieth thus much, that a man sléeping in idlenesse, negligence, and carelesnesse, the winds and stormes of temptations suddainlie and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie arise: For then are wée most suddainlie surprised with error, when wée are most intangled with improuidence and negligence. And as <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Senate house was assailed when hée least suspected, by his conspirators, so men in their securities are soonest subdued by the assaults of wickednesse; which conspireth the death of the soule. The Poets faine thus of the Syrenes which haunt about Sicily (and of late daies haue appeared in the Sea in India) That with their swéet tunes they draw the Marriners asléepe, that whilest they sléepe soundly, they may sincke their ship.

A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine King (saith hée) hauing thrée sonnes, and being well kept in yeares, resolued to make his Testament, certify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his children, that which of them was most slothfull, on him hee would bestow his kingdome; to whom the first said, to me belongs the kingdome, for I am so sluggish, that as I sit by the fire I rather suffer my shinnes to bée burnt, then to draw them from the flame: the second hée said, the crowne in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son belongs to mée, since I am farre more slothfull then thou art, for hauing a rope about my necke, and being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to bee hanged, and a sword in my hand, suficient to cut the same, yet am I so slothfull, that I will not stretch out my hand to saue my life: after him the third stept vp, and in these wordes m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

these thrée sonnes are thrée sorts of idle persons; The first that cares not for fire, signifieth him, that being in the companie of euill and luxurious men, will not forsake them: The second, (knowing himselfe hanged in the snaro of the Deuill, as the couetous man) yet hauing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sword of Praier sufficient to cut the rope, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hée will not vse it: The third (that will neither turne his eie to the right or to the left hand) signifieth him that neither considereth the paines of Hell, nor the rewards of Heauen, So that neither for feare of punishment, nor hope of reward, hée will rise againe from sinne: On him the Deuill his father (who as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, is the King euer the children of pride) bestoweth the kingdome of Hell, where no order but continuall horror inhabiteth. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the iole and slothfull person Hell doth most iustly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine, because hauing eies to sée his infirmitie hée blindeth them; a mind to vnderstand his remedie, hée disdaineth it; and times made for labour, yet refuseth it: but as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>
                     <hi>Omnis piger in egestate erit,</hi> The sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man shall liue in pouertie,</hi> and Hell iustly shall bée his inheritage that negligently forbeareth to labor for heauen.

               <p>Hauing alreadie heard the deformities of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, now at the last let vs consider the ren edies against him.

Primitiue Church) mortifie our earthly members, and follow him in the like exercise: secondly, (in that this sinne of Idlenes hindreth both soule and body, and by that meanes is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of many mischiefes, as well corporall as spiritual.) It hath bene as well detested both in holy scriptures, as in fathers of the Primitiue Church, as appeareth by <hi>Iohannes Clymachus,</hi> where he saith, <hi>Idlenes is a dissolution of the spirit, an abiect feare in all good exercises, an hatred and griefe of any godly profession.</hi> He saith likewise that worldly men are happy, he speaketh til of God, accounting him cruell, and without humanity; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man astonished in heart, and weake in praier; more hard then iron in the seruice of God, &amp; both slothfull and rebellious to trauell with his hands, or to do obedience. Behold the right effects of deuilish <hi>Astaroth:</hi> consider likewise what fruites spring from this cursed fiend. Thirdly, one of the best meanes to resist the craft of this fiend, is to trauell and to be alwaies doing somewhat, to the end we be not surprized suddenly, as <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> counselleth.
