         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

discovered, and born Testimony unto what it is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it consisteth, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AFter various reports and upbraidings, and insultings of
divers men in my hearing, of a certain great pillar and
a leading man among the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> who it was said
had relinquished his errors, and had conformed, and also
written and published a Book for the convincement of all others
to Uniformity and Conformity: also the Weekly Intelligencer
willing to take advantage sometime when there is little or no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
doth signifie to the whole Nation in his Newes-book of the
Conversion of a great Nonconformist, for the strengthening and
supporting of those desires only in People who is willing to make
shipwrack of all Faith, Hope, Religion, and whatsoever also that
is of the greatest moment, for a little ease and liberty in the flesh,
and the imbracement of this present World, is willing to joyne
with that which is the uppermost, and to sail with wind and tide,
not minding the Harbour, nor the way which they are passing, but
only present enjoyment; and such whose faith is builded upon
men and not upon God; and chuses rather to run with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to do evil (then with a few despised and afflicted who keep
faith and a good Conscience) such flashes and airy ungrounded
rumours staggr'd their mind, and makes them afraid and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
when there's no cause. At last this great and magnificent
piece of Conversion came published in the Newes-book boasted
on by the Clergy and divers other great Mountains of Earth, came
to my hand providentially unlooked for, unsought for, or desired,
which is titled, <hi>An Epistle to the several Congregations of the Non-formists,</hi>
subscribed by Captain <hi>Robert Everard;</hi> as he stiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Member of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; which Book hath been
spread up and down the Counties it seems, as some rare, weighty,
and great matter to induce others to be of the same mind. But
why the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> should extoll this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50701:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and rejoyce in this great Convert I know not, except they have a
a mind to shake hands with the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and to receive their
Catholick faith so called and unquestionable; but Deceit loves to
sport it self, and to make merry and triumph over any who do but
relinquish the seeming appearance of truth to turit into the
common road of darkness, they hug such a one for a while, and
sets him out as an ensign to glory in, and over against others.</p>
            <p>After the said Book came to my hand amongst divers others, I
was willing to take a survey, and to make inspection into those
things contained in it, and to see what demonstrative grounds,
and solid and weighty matter was contained in it, which I have
diligently weighed, and without a prejudiced spirit read, finding
the matter in it chiefly to set up a Council of men to be absolute
Judge of all matters of Faith and Doctrine, though never so
repugnant unto the Doctrine and practice once delivered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and walked in by the Saints, seting up this, both above the
<hi>holy Spirit of God which is the only</hi> and sole <hi>trier of all Spirits;</hi> but
also above the <hi>Scripture;</hi> wherein I have taken notice his own eye
being blinded he would captivate all others, and make them blind
also, and lay wast the Spirit of God, and its office the Scriptures,
and their translation, making them as uncertain as much as in him
lies as the <hi>Turkish Alcbaron;</hi> and all solid and weighty arguments
and reasons that hath been produced this many years by many
godly and moderate Dissenters in divers Ages, from the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> this he strikes over all by whole sail, labouring to set
all a jarr, and to make every thing look with a face contrary way
to represent them uncomely; and at last he hath concluded that
the Catholick visible Church is the absolute judge and director,
both in matters of Faith and Doctrine, without distinguishing of
their abiding in the faith, or falling from it, as though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God had been intailed to a certain place as <hi>Rome,</hi> or to a
certain sort of men that may call themselves <hi>Peters</hi> Successors,
and Ministers of Christ, though they walk as far wide both in
Doctrine and practice as Heaven is from Earth from [<hi>Peter</hi>] and
would assume the title of name and office for honour and profits
sake, but do none of <hi>Peters</hi> work, feeds not the Flock of Christ,
but worries them, and kills them that Christ feeds, and sheares
off the Wool from off their backs, and pulls off the skin too, and
instead of saving have destroyed hundreds of mens lives in <hi>Europe</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50701:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>America;</hi> some under the name of Hereticks, and some under
the name of Infidels have been most mercilessly and cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by the power of this holy visible Church, as <hi>R. E.</hi> calls it,
as the true Chronologies of Ages past doth testifie, so that the
Nations have been made like <hi>Akeldoma</hi> by that <hi>mystery Babylon
which hath drunk the blood of the Saints, and slain the Prophets and
Martyrs,</hi> under the name of Hereticks, quite out of the Doctrine
of Christ, and erred from his infallible Spirit, <hi>who came not to
destroy mens lives but to save them, and to save people from their sins:</hi>
But this false visible Church hath destroyed their lives under the
name of Heresie, and so hath destroyed them in their sins if they
count that Heresie be a sin. But of this something more afterwards
may be said if God permit.</p>
            <p>But it is a great piece of confidence in <hi>R. E.</hi> that after fifteen
Hundred years as he saith this Church hath continued as a Judge
and a Director unto, which all Christians are to submit, <hi>page 20th.</hi>
that he that is but a man of yesterday should be so stout a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
as to make a flourish, and seem to over-ride all the weighty
things that hath been spoken by the blessed Martyrs and sufferers
for Christ, and Righteous dissenters from this <hi>Roman Church</hi> at
one clap; and again to exalt his own feeble things that he hath
brought forth and exhibit them so confidently to all <hi>Nonconformists</hi>
as unanswerable matter, or how he judged in himself that his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or arguments should be of that weight to convince or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
any, seeing he hath rendered himself, and they that knows
him can testifie he hath always been a changable man, and unstablt
in all his ways, tossed up and down like the Waves of the Sea, and
now at last fallen into the black gulf of darkness; but it seems by his
own writing in his Epistle, that it hath been his former method,
being filled with a scribling humour in the days of his ignorance,
as he saith, when the vail of pride and folly hung between his eyes,
which appears to hang there yet, (for any thing I can see) having
condemned himself, and also repented as he saith for being in the
head of a Troop of the rebellious Army a Captain: and yet after
Conversion and illumination and repentance as he saith, subscribes
himself, Captain <hi>Robert Everard;</hi> argues both pride and folly, and
gives but a small shew of repentance, but rather argues faned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and flattery, and him to be a time-server, and a man-pleaser.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50701:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And whether he intend by his Epistle to all the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or all the Non-conformists to
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is doubtfull, for then the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
hath to conform in part, as well as others, though I believe
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will claim a good part of her Discipline to
be theirs, only it wants the formality of Language: something
might largely be spoken, as in return of answer to the things
contained in the said Book, but that it may be supposed some of
those people with whom he hath formerly conversed, which he
now calumnates with notorious error, will not receive his Epistle
as an infallible and Heavenly <hi>Oracle,</hi> but rather will return him
some publick answer for the vindicating of their own Principles,
and also shewing him his weakness, how soon he was turned aside
with, and for a thing of nought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also that he should be so
bold as to turn in a moment their Instructer and Teacher, when
he hath but newly learned within a year or two the Principles of
his own Religion, which he saith he adores God in, and so is but
a novis, and unskilfull in the word of righteousness, though his
web be very long of Linsie Woolsie, and his words be many,
which will pass away as wind, and have small effect, I hope of
gaining many Proselites, to be Members of that visible Church,
which hath ruled over Nations, Kindred and Tongues, which are
the Waters upon which the great Whore sits.</p>
            <p>I take my self little concerned, or that people with whom I
am joyned in the fellowship of the Gospel of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who
are Non-conformsts to the World, and ever resolves to be, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Apostles Doctrine) and to all Hypocrites and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Time-servers, and them that serve not our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,
but their own bellies,</hi> of which this Generation is full, who will
transgress fon a morsell of Bread, and conform to any thing, and
every thing for the smiles of the World, ease and liberty in the
flesh, but the followers of Christ-hath not so learned Christ, for
who so will raign with him, must suffer with him.</p>
            <p>Neither should I have said much, if the quarrel had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal,
or about some circumstantial matters, which a Man may be
with and without, and they neither add to, nor diminish from
his goodness and vertue, but seeing it is a quarrel not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us that are alive, but against the faithful sufferers, who laid
down their lives in flames of Fire, and the very Foundation of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50701:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God, which is the most sure thing is struck at, and the spirit of
God turned out of doores, in regard of its office, of certainty
and infallibility, and the Scriptures of truth laid aside as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
thing, except the Interpretations of Men be added to
it for its authority, and the constitutions of fallible and erring
Men set up for rules, and Men as Men set up as Law-givers and
Judges over Mens Conscientes, and Lords over Faith, and to be
the most certain thing for any Christian Man to rely upon, and to
believe, as the old phrase is, as the Church believes, to pin ones
faith upon others sleeves, and to hang ones hope of anothers
shoulders, to put ones eye out that God hath given them to see
with, and then see by anothers, may be led into any hole or ditch,
and this to be published with such confidence, as the only infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
guide, to which all Christians are to submit, world make a
<hi>Man</hi> half dumb to speak and stammer forth some thing as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against such palpable error, and manifest darkness: put off
with such confidence, and usher'd in among Christians in such an
age as this, when Light and life is broken forth as a morning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cloudes in <hi>Goshen,</hi> where <hi>Israel</hi> the true Seed Inhabits, I
could not but say something in vindication of that certain, sure,
everlasting truth which the Devil is out of, by which the Saints
are made free indeed in their inward man from sin, and Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
to the World, its error, wayes and worship, and also
to shew the mistakes of the Author, and how easily he hath been
drawn aside to lean upon a broken Read, all his particulars which
are of any weight or moment shall be considered and weighed in
the righteous Ballance of equity, and answered in their due place:
for the confirmation of them that do believe, and for removing
the stumbling blocks out of the way of them that doubt or stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
least they fall in such dark Pits as these, (<hi>viz.</hi>) as to deny the
spirit of God to be a sufficient guide, and take away its infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and place it in Men that have erred, do erre, and may erre:
and call them the only sure infallible guide for all Christian men
to follow.</p>
            <p>But to speak something to the seeming weighty matter which
weighed down <hi>R. E.</hi> his Judgment, and cast the Scales so far
as that all his hope, faith, foundation, &amp; religion was weighed down
at one draught, and by such feeble things as put him to silence,
which he heard from his Laycatholick, as he cals him, argues a very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50701:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weak &amp; a poor foundation &amp; a sandy, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was so soon driven away;
but one thing is to be minded, because he hath minded it himself
of his Conversion, as to matter of time; this Conversion hath
happened to fall out since the happy Restauration of our <hi>Gracious
Soveraign</hi> to his Crown and Dignity, as he saith; this to some will
render his Conversion somewhat suspicious, whether (he name)
this time as only accidental, or the Restauration of the <hi>King</hi> the
cause somewhat of his Conversion, I shall not determine; but
however he having been behind before in Conformity resolved to
make a good step to, before the next time to avoid suffering loss
and reproach. But to speak a little as to the Discourse which <hi>R. E.</hi>
hath published as the weighty matter whereby he was convinced,
their Judgments now it seems becoming one, the Lay <hi>Gentleman</hi> he
mentions and himself speaking to one speaks to both.</p>
            <p>First, Whether that any can be certain that the <hi>Christians</hi> in
general is more true then the <hi>Turkes, Jewes,</hi> or any other, and
whether any can be infallibly assured of this that it is not possible
for one to be mistaken in this; and again the answer amounting
to no more then this, you conceive you are in the right, you hope
and believe, you are not mistaken; but it is possible you may be
mistaken in this, for every <hi>Man</hi> is a Lyer, and every <hi>Man</hi> and all
Men and every Church is fallible and subject to error; and with
these and the like words <hi>R. E.</hi> was extreamly troubled as he saith,
and knew not how to answer without shuffling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> The true Christian Religion stands not only in name,
nor in words, nor in conforming, or transforming to this or that
outward practice, which the Disciples of Christ were exercised
in, which divers in the latter days in their old corrupt minds not
having their hearts renewed, have taken on the outside, and have
got the form, and wants the life and the power, and are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the Divine nature of Christ, and such a bare profession
as this has no certainty, nor infallibility in it, neither the assurance
but that they may be mistaken and may be subject to err as well as
<hi>Turkes</hi> or <hi>Jewes,</hi> or any other, but the true Christian Religion
indeed whom Christ will own as true Worshippers of Him, stands
in power, in life, and in being, obedient unto his living commands
and precepts, which he giveth forth unto his Disciples, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth
by his Spirit, <hi>his Sheep hear his voice, and know it from the
voice of a stranger:</hi> And he giveth the knowledge of his will to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50701:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all that believe in the measure of his eternal Spirit, <hi>which he hath
given every one a measure of to profit withal;</hi> and by it to be guided
into all truth, out of all error, and this Spirit is infallible and
gives certain assurance to all that receive it, that they are in that
way which is acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> and they feel comfort unto their
souls coming daily from the presence of <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the Rock
of Ages, and the sure foundation upon which his holy Church is
founded, <hi>which is the pillar and ground of truth;</hi> and they that are
living members are not grounded upon a fallible certainty, or
upon a conjectural supposition, or a vain hope which is without
bottom, but upon that which is sure and stedfast, lasting and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting;
and all men in the unregenerate estate are lyers, but they
that are born from above are of the truth, and lie not, and are not
subject to mistakes, because the seed remains in them, and walkes
in the <hi>pure Religion which keeps unspoted of the World;</hi> and they that
have no other ground for their Religion but only without them,
and from the report of others are short of the true foundation,
for that may be truth in it self indeed, which is not true to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor he truly partakes of it, and here is all the supposing
conjectures and mistakes and fallible certainties, which it seems
<hi>R. E.</hi> and his lay <hi>Gentleman</hi> too, when the axe is laid to the root
of the tree indeed, and not withstanding all the laying claim
to infallibility and certainty its but grounded upon a report with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and the traditions of men from Generation to Generation;
For them that believe but only because of the true report with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and cometh not to witness the thing assured in their own
hearts by the Spirit of the Lord, these will not be long of that
faith, 'tis true many did believe because of the Apostles Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and report, but at last came to feel the witness of God in
their own hearts testifying the self same, in so much that they
could say and truly too, though we have believed through your
words at the first, yet now we have heard him our selves, and
that which giveth perfect assurance which admits of no doubts
nor fallibleness, for such evidence all true Members of Christ's
Church have in themselves, which carries divine authority and
satisfaction in it to every particular Believer, and so I say with <hi>R.</hi>
E. in this it seemes unreasonable to perswade any to receive this
or that for a truth, when they that so perswade are uncertain in
themselves, neither dare say their judgment is infallible, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50701:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is that old Protestant Principle indeed, and also the Principle of
many Sects who differs from the pretended Catholick Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> who persecuted one another about outward things even as
the Heathen about their Idols, and yet will need sit as Judge in
Mens Consciences, with their fallible spirit, though I speak not of
every individual person, neither can I justifie the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church so called, who layes claim to infallibility; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they judge to be Heresie must be reckoned as such, though
never so manifest a truth; and to place infallibility in men that
may err and have erred from the spirit, I like not neither; for this
is to give that to men that belongs to God, and to make the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of fallible men above the Judgment of the infallible spirit
of God; and this I look to be great ambition and pride, in any to
lay claim to the greatest things, as infallibility and certainty of
assurance, and the most free of error, and yet falls the shortest of
it of any, as hath been made appear by many learned and grave
Men of former ages; and also if a necessity were, might be made
appear, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> who saith she cannot err, have
been as uncertain both in their Doctrine and Worship as any, yea
more; one <hi>Pope</hi> contradicting and throwing down that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
did establish; and one <hi>Council</hi> decreeing, and another disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling;
as I could easily make appear, but that I would not be
tedious to the Reader in things that have been so manifest; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I desire to wade out into diversity of matters, in so short
a Discourse. But that which <hi>R. E.</hi> and his Catholick instructer
calleth late, wild, and loose opinions, that men of different faiths
may be saved; and this countenanceth schisme, and breeds rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
as it is said; 'tis true, faith is but one, which is saving, and
there is no differance in that, for the difference is among Men
where that is wanting, and only have the words and name of faith,
and want the life and power. Neither am I so narrow spirited as
<hi>R. E.</hi> and his Catholick, as to exclude all out of the faith, who
may differ in their perswasions in some Circumstantial things, if
yet they hold Christ the head: and what makes <hi>R. E.</hi> so verilent
as to judge all in error, and to be out of the true faith, seeing the
Protestants and all sorts of separates professe Justification and
Salvation, only through faith in Christ Jesus, as well as the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and it were unreasonably judged in me if I
should conclude a man to be no man, because he is not so tall as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50701:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
another; but I see <hi>R. E.</hi> and his Catholick would have all Shoos made
by their Last, though they will not fit every mans feet. Faith is
the gift of God, there are divers degrees and measures according
to the mind and good pleasure of the giver; so that he that hath
received any measure or degree, must not be excluded as having
no faith, though he attain not to that degree that some do enjoy;
and the Apostles Doctrine was, <hi>that every one should be perswaded in
his own mind, and if any was otherwise minded,</hi> they were to be let
alone <hi>till God revealed it to them.</hi> And whatsoever people or
Church (though they claim infallibility) that teaches a contrary
Doctrine unto this; we have good reason to suspect it, to be that
hasty driving and overdriving spirit that would force a faith,
where God hath not given it; (not to be the infallible spirit of
our Lord Jesus Christ) of which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath given
a vehement cause of suspition, by their cruelty and tortors they
have exercised towards them, who could not receive their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and own their Judgment in all things: But <hi>R. E.</hi> the Lay-Gentleman
blinded thy eye, when he made thee call into question
the truth of Scripture, and that it proceeded from the infallible
Testimony of Gods spirit, and if thou had a certain feeling of the
same in thy self, and in thy own Conscience to let this go and make
this void as an insufficient ground to receive Christianity upon, &amp;
to lean to a prop without thee, and to be judged by men, who
have been as fallible and changable in their Judgments as the
Moon; which have assumed the name of Catholick Church, whose
Testimony thy Instructer I perceive told thee, ought to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
concerning what as is pretended to be revealed or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by God, yet all must be obliged to stand to their Judgment
though never so repugnant to the Doctrine of Christ, and practice
of the Church of Christ in the first Primitive times, truly so called;
yet it is granted that the Church of Christ are the dispersed
Members through the World, though not of it, agreeing in one
faith, being in the power of God, and being led and guided by
the Holy Ghost, their Judgments ought to be received, which
cannot (as lead by the Spirit) fail, in giving true Judgment in
matters of faith, which pertains to Salvation, but as men they
may fail, and as erring from the spirit they may fail; and infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is not intailed to the persons of any men, but as they continue
in the grace of God, and walk in the spirit, and bring forth the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50701:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fruits thereof, nor to any place or City, but as they continue in
Covenant with God; for the promise of God was to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> and to many other places and people in divers
Cities, where the glory of God once appeared, but now through
their Apostacy and unbelief, and disobedience they are desolate,
as to the presence and power of God, and their Sun is set, and
they are covered as with the shadow of a Cloud; but this true
Church whereof I have spoken, was seen <hi>to fly into the Wilderness
for time, times and a half,</hi> and that since the Apostles days, and
then was she not so visible and universal as she had been before; <hi>and
the man child was caught up unto God;</hi> now if thou reckon the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church to be this true Church; <hi>shew the time, times, and
half a time, wherein she fled into the Wilderness;</hi> and how long she
hath been there, and when was the time of her return, and if ever
she was there, how that will hang together with your assertion,
that she hath been visible, and so universal this fiften hundred
years; and if this could be proved that <hi>Rome</hi> hath been so, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth it not rather demonstrate her to be the Whore that sat
upon the many waters? which waters are Nations, Kindreds,
Tongues and People, and what Church? instance if thou can, doth
lay claim to the Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People to be
yours, and to rule over so many Kings of the Earth, as you lay
claim to be universally of your faith, and of your Church, which
gives us a shrewd character to believe, that indeed you are <hi>mystery
Babylon;</hi> besides the blood of the Saints that have been shed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> by this visible Catholick Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Nations this twelve 100. years, doth give clear evidence
that it can be reckoned or imputed unto none but you. But I
would not grate too hard upon thee, being but a new convert; but
when thy instructer had made thee doubt of thy own state, and
question the foundation whereupon thou hadst received christianity,
the next thing he labours to make void, is the Spirit of God its
Testimony, which thou did lay claim too, but I feel had little
portion in what thou said, at last he makes thee doubt of the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of this spirit W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thou had spoke on, might for ought thou
knew be the spirit of error, and thou not able to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the spirit of God in thy self, which is infallible, and the
spirit of error, nor to distinguish betwixt their opperations, he
perswaded thee that all was uncertain, and therefore no confidence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50701:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be given to any spirit or faith in ones own particular, which is
the most absurd and ridiculous thing in the world so to judge:
For if there be no certainty or assurance given to any man, or
means to every man, wherein he may be assured of the certainty
of Gods will, then whither should any go or upon whom should
any lean, seeing that no credit can be given to any thing that any
man believes; and this were but tossing up and down men from
mountain to hill, that they might never have rest for their souls:
And as for <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. and <hi>Eccles. 9. Rev. 3. The heart of man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,
&amp;c. No man knows love or hatred, &amp;c. And because thou say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, &amp;c.</hi>
These Scriptures was brought unto thee to make thee more blind;
the first is spoken of the degenerated estate, where deceit bears
rule, and not truth; the second is spoken of visible enjoyments,
which are common to all; and the third was spoken to one, who
had erred from the spirit, and was exalted in pride, because of
external performances, but having lost the power was miserable,
&amp;c. But what of all this? doth this any whit at all detract from
the certainty and assurance of the <hi>Spirit of God in them that hath
it?</hi> what shall we reason thus because some have been led aside,
and are deceived by their own hearts lusts, that therefore all may
be deceived, even them that have the spirit of God, (God forbid)
and we have some what more to answer an <hi>Arian,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a
<hi>Turk,</hi> if they should urge the like knowledg and feeling with the
like confidence, to prove they were in the truth and Christianity,
a delusion; and thy instructer said, what would you reply to
them?</p>
            <p>We have more to reply in such Cases then time will permit
now, or the state of the case require; seeing it is but a suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and we take no thought what to answer the gain-sayers of
truth withall, but relyes upon the <hi>promise of the Father,</hi> and <hi>of
his Son Jesus Christ, who said to his Disciples, take no thought for
it shall be given you what to answer in that day,</hi> which promise all
that are true Disciples shall find true to the end of the World:
but somewhat more we have to say, it may be then thou said
when thou suffered thy self to be made blind and carried captive
with another Mans Judgment, and neglected the measure of Gods
spirit in thy self at home, through which alone the secret things
of God is revealed, and in which true certainty and infallibility
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50701:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is witnessed, and not in Men who is fallible and changable. If an
<hi>Arian, Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> should urge their own interpretation of
Scriptures (which is of no private interpretation) contrary to
the mind of him that gave it forth; I would say he perverted
the words of the Scripture, which is in harmony and unity one
with another, as to the states and conditions they were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to, and are plain, and are only read by that spirit that gave
them forth: except it be in some Historicall or Chronology or
Genealogy of Names and Generations which might he; some ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from other hands, and different hands taking notice of
them as to record them, there might be some variation, yet the
substance of the report is true, but what is Calculation of yeares
or dayes or reckoning up of Genealogies, as to the matter of
Salvation, and what if we had never had them, no more then we
have, other Histories and things that fell out among the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
but if there be any contradiction for ought I know, we may
blame the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the most of any; who will needs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
they received all or most of the things from the Apostles;
and if the translations differ, or be somewhat uncertain, what have
they been doing this fifteen hundred yeares, with their infallible
spirit, that they could not have rectified them according to their
first original? and if any of the foresaid Sects, should pretend
the certainty of the spirit, and yet not have it? I should answer,
the spirit is known by its fruits, and the <hi>fruits of the spirit are
manifest,</hi> and they that pretend to it, and bring forth contrary
fruites, are manifest to be deceivers and deceived, but their
states are different, and therefore requires different answers,
which time will not now permit to insist upon: but over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all other arguments to perswade any man to, or from any
thing, the witness of God in the party unto whom he speaketh,
is to be reached, and that is beyond the understanding of man, and
greater then it, and more convincing then any arguments that
can be used without; and he that cannot speak to this, is not skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the word of righteousness.</p>
            <p>That Christ was an infallible guide, (who is the way, the
truth, and the life) is granted by all Christians, and that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
received the promise of the Father, and the infallible spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God which led them into all truth, and this infallible assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
the Christians had that lived in the Apostles time, this is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50701:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
granted, and the Apostles were infallible guides, not as Men
meerly, but as Men full of the holy Ghost, and as Men who were
filled with the spirit of God, and therefore the Apostles said, <hi>be
followers of us as we are followers of Christ;</hi> and if any controversie
did arise, as some there did, and doutes among the then Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> meeting together in the power of the
holy Ghost, did write their mindes and Letters to the Christians
to pacify all; and good reason that they that had believed through
their word, should submit unto the Holy Ghost, and unto them
by whom they were begotten unto God by the word of Life, for
the ending of strife about wordes and shadowes and outward
things, and they whose mindes were outward then, in ages since
and now, ran into contention about outward things, and such
for the most part do erre from the spirit of God in themselves,
but I would have thee to take notice of this, and all you Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Members so called, <hi>the Apostles of Christ only did exhort, and
did not force their Decrees by penal Statutes, and to be observed under
the penalty of loosing life or limbes,</hi> as since, their pretended suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
have done, who have erred from the spirit, and have got
the Saints words, and turned against the life and power: but
the Decrees, as you call them, are not many nor burdensome,
which the Apostles wrote at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as the many <hi>Counsels</hi> since
have made, they are so endless and numberless and burdensome,
and so contradictory one to another in divers things, who will
but look into the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Counsels</hi> since the Apostles dayes,
that we can find little certainty in any of their Decrees, but rather
as thy Instructer saith the Sword of the flesh, and not the spirit
hath been the rule and law to Christianity; but the Masters of
great wit and power and Interest, have framed and made parties
unto themselves, and hath not Warres been raised among your
selves about deciding your controversies, hath not the <hi>Pope</hi>
Warred against the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the <hi>Emperour</hi> against the <hi>Pope,</hi>
was not Wars raised about the Decrees when <hi>Pope Eujenius</hi> was
deposed as a Heretick by the Counsel of <hi>Bazill.</hi>—and one while
the <hi>Pope</hi> must be infallible as <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successor, and above all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and Churches, another while the <hi>Counsell</hi> is above the <hi>Pope,</hi>
excommunicates him as a Heretick and excludes his Infallibility,
and now where is the certainty, and whether should one go or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
for true judgment? so, though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> boast of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50701:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unity, yet how hath one Nation made War against another, and
yet professing the same faith at divers times and in sundry ages.
And to tell thee plainly, and to speak the naked truth, according
to the Apostles prophesie, after their departure there was a great
Apostacy, and a great falling away from the faith, and a giving
heed <hi>to lying seducing spirits, and doctrine of Devils, and many were
subverted from the faith,</hi> by them that spake lies in hypocrisie, and
took up the Priests office for filthy lucre, and they went out into
the world, and the world wondered after them, and they had the
form, and the sheeps cloathing, and the Saints words, but were
enemies to the Cross of Christ, and to the power of Godliness;
<hi>and the Kings of the Earth were bewitched with their Sorceries,</hi> and
then forced all and compelled all to receive and believe such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and such Articles, as was then set forth by a pack of those
Hirelings, who minded their own profit, and their own bellies;
who mingled their own Inventions and traditions with the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of Christ, and brought the Scripture for a Cloak, and the
Apostles practice for a president, and could say falsly, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
said in the truth; It seems good to us and the Holy Ghost
that these our Decrees be observed, for God hath placed us as
Judges and directers, as them that are appointed of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
To which, all Christians are to submit and none to question,
and if any do question or will not obey, it is the Kings and Princes
duty in every Country to cause all to submit to these our Decrees
and orders, or else to be punished as Hereticks with death, for we
are the Apostles successors, and we are the elders of the Church,
and we have the infallible Spirit; and though we make Decrees
contrary to what the Apostles made in their day, yet none is to
question that, the Church was but in its <hi>Infancy then, as unwasht,
and unswadled, and in Persecution;</hi> but now she is grown up to a
greater stature and power, and indowed with greater privilege,
and that may be necessary now, that was not necessary then; and
last of all called themselves the <hi>Clergie,</hi> which signifies the Heritage
of God, and so excluded all others but themselves: And these
things are true and certain, and have been made good by many
sufferers for Christ; and this kind of <hi>Clergie</hi> or Heritage made
the Heritage of God indeed, <hi>to fly into the Wilderness, who had the
infallible spirit, and the witnesses to prophesie in sackcloath,</hi> and then
<hi>Mystery Babylon began to sit a Queen,</hi> and to gild her Cup, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50701:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to fill it full of abomination, and brought in Judaisme and the
practise of the Apostles, and their own Inventions, and patched
up an endless kind of worship and service, consisting of out-side
things in a great part, in postures and gestures, and meates and
drinks, and dayes and times, and vestures and Bonnets, and
Caps and Coules, and such other like trumpery; which they made
the Nations drunk with, and greedy after: and if any scrupled
at any of those things or any other, the Holy Catholick Church
hath decreed it, and she cannot erre, for she is infallible: though
the errors thereof cannot be numbered: and this <hi>R. E.</hi> thou
rests satisfied in as thy only rule and judge and director, and thou
hangs all thy faith here, and saith, thou shall not scruple to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
what authority teacheth thee to be revealed by God, no
more then if thou heard God himself speaking; I say unto thee
as the Apostle said, the Serpent hath beguiled thee, as it begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Eve:</hi> and further say, as the Prophet said, thou must arise
and get thee hence, for this is not the rest, for thou wilt see thy
self plunged into such a layborinth of uncertainties as thou never
was before, if the Lord ever open thy eye.</p>
            <p>And <hi>R. E.</hi> gives an account, that after his reading of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travertal
Books, hath made some Collections as to himself, and
also declares, that all dissenting judgments grants there must be
a way and a rule appointed to teach us, to deside all doubts, to
judge of all matters, and to teach us the true way to Heaven with
certainty; but who this rule or judge is, is not agreed upon by
all; which he hath collected into four heads; First, some sets up
the spirit to direct them, and to be this means; Secondly, another
will have every mans own natural reason to be this rule and judg;
Thirdly, others will set up sole Scripture; and the fourth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
the Holy Catholick Church to be that Judge and Directer.
Other then these, he saith, he never heard of any; for he saith, he
always esteemed the <hi>Quakers</hi> Light to be either the Spirit, or
Natural reason, (<hi>but which, R. E. doth not know</hi>) and all the four
before mentioned, he saith, he hath examined, and treateth large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon them all; wherein he goeth about and giveth grounds
and divers reason, and divers Iuterpretations of Scriptures; he
layes wast all the former three and establisheth as he thinks, the
fourth, as to be that way and rule, and Judge, and governing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to deside all doubts as that, whereby all are obliged to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50701:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto, as to Christ himself; and this was that question which
he was to gain satisfaction in; and therefore he saith, he ceased to
enquire of their Doctrine, or this, or that article of faith, and hang
altogether upon this point before mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, it is granted by all, that there must be a way
and a rule as the means appointed of God, to answer all doubts,
and to give satisfaction to every man, of the certainty of that
which he believes; and who this way and judge, and rule is, every
one ought to be satisfied; and the four heads into which thou
hath collected the whole Controversie of all dissenting Judgments
in Christianity takes up the whole as to this particular, which
have ordinarily been holden forth among Christians. But I judge
thou dealt not wisely in thy Inquisition and search for satisfaction
to hing all on this pin, but rather to have examined further as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matter of Doctrine, and matters of Faith held forth, most
especially of this party, to whom thou was so much inclined; and
see how thou could have swallowed down that Doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
and sacrifice for the Dead, and Justification by a Man's
own works, and of Bread and Wine after the words of Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Priest is Transubstantiated into the very body and
blood of Christ, and becomes whole God their Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
for these are principal things, either greatly necessary
to Salvation, or greatly unnecessary; and when thou had tryed
and found these to be so repugnant unto the Doctrine and faith,
once delivered among the Saints, in the first Plantation of the
Gospel, this might have put a stop unto thee, that thou could not
so easily close with their judgment and pretended infallibility,
who pretends to be only guids, and yet leads into the greatest
errors in matters of greatest moment. But as to the four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
mentioned, I shall not stand to trouble either my self or the
Reader, as to speak much what of that which is no part of my faith
or judgment, but only to vindicate the truth against the many
false conceptions of changable men: And first of all <hi>R. E.</hi> begins
to treat of the <hi>spirit, and perverts</hi> the Scripture at his first on-set;
and saith as touching the <hi>spirit bearing witness in secret with our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
or as he saith in plainer terms, the private spirit;</hi> this saith <hi>R. E.</hi>
I considered could not be the means to convey faith unto the
World, nor the rule, guide or judge, which I enquired after, nor
indeed the true spirit of God, which he promised to his Apostles.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50701:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, Those who pretend this guidance do not believe God,
but themselves only, and their own perswasions, which tell them
they have the spirit of God, but they can give no other account,
but they are verily perswaded so, or no other answer, but I am
sure it is the spirit of God, and I am a good man, and an honest man,
and I believe my self, but other reasons or evidence can they give
none. Thirdly, This pretending of a private spirit is against
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>That no prophesie of Scripture is of private interpretation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Man beats all together beside the Anvil, what ever
the matter is, but that he is blinded and confounded in himself, he
sets but up a shadow, and then fights with it; for instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Spirit of God not to be a competent rule, judge and
guide, and instructer in all matters of Faith necessary to Salvation;
he goes about to prove a private spirit, a pretended spirit, a spirit
of error is not a sufficient guide and Judge; and in this he fights
without an adversary, and fills the world with noise and darkness,
and the air with smoak, and would cloud peoples understandings
with multitudes of words that tend not to edification, with a
quareling wrangling spirit, which is not for peace, but I see he hath
delighted in contention, and sported it self in varience, and like the
son of the bond-woman, his hand against every man. Secondly, I
wonder why <hi>R. E.</hi> quotes so much Scripture as for the proofe of
his matter in hand, seeing that it is one of his great pleas, that it
is insufficient as to be a rule, or a guide, or a judge as to answer
any doubts, or give any satisfactory solution to him that is enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
and seeing he hath given in so many reasons against it, as
insufficient, and as much as in him lay to invaluedate and set it at
nought, and hath laboured to set it at oddes, and to make contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
in it, as to render it insufficient for matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
in any thing, which is in controversie, or how he can judge,
that others should receive them, and his sometimes false
rendering of them, or his own interpretations upon them,
seeing he denies them as uncertain, as they are translated
and insufficient, and not fit to be a rule; and who this man hath
conversed with I know not, that should ever affirm a private spirit
or their own spirits to be a sufficient rule or guide to walk by,
such I deny and leave them and thee, to quarel together about
your imaginations and thoughts, and conceptions, or else the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of other men who are as uncertain and fallible as the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50701:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
first, and shall assert the sufficiency of the spirit of God teaching,
ruling, guiding and judging all true Christian men in that certain,
everlasting, infallible truth, which is necessary and satisfaction to
the souls of all them that do believe in it, and shall deny all the
pretenders to it, who run into heaps and heads, and quarels, and
fights one with another about shadows, and can give no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
or manifestation; then, I am sure I have the spirit of God,
and I ought to be believed, and I am a good man, and the like,
which thou saith thou could never receive any other evidence or
testimony, and what though many have pretended to the spirit,
and the guidance thereof, and in the mean while have brought
forth the fruits of the flesh and their own imaginary false concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and hath put on confidence enough to say so, as thou thy
self it may be hath had a share in, in times past, shall this make the
Spirit of God insufficient and uncertain in its teachings to them
that believe in it, and have received and bring forth the fruits of
it, and have the deeds of the flesh mortified by it, God forbid.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Why hast thou perverted the Scripture, as I said at
the first onset, <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it self bears witness with our
spirits that we are the Children of God;</hi> and this thou hath put in,
in a distinct Character to be taken notice of, as though it were
Scripture, and renders it thus, <hi>the Spirit being witness in secret with
our spirits, or in plainer termes the private spirit:</hi> Thou must repent
of this, and take heed how thou calls the spirit of God a private
spirit, for it was that <hi>publick spirit</hi> which manifested it self among
all the <hi>Patriarks and Prophets, and by which they spoke forth the words
and mind of God unto the people, and prophesied of things to come;</hi> and
through it alone is the deep and weighty things of God revealed;
<hi>and was and is the only way and means by which Christ promised after
his Ascension to lead, guide, instruct and comfort his Disciples in all
truth, and that it should bring to their memory whatsoever he had spoken,
&amp; that they were to be without care or thought, for through it the Father
should give them what to speak and what to answer before Rulers and
Councils for his Names sake.</hi> And here the sufficiency of it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to any reasonable man who hath the least savour or discerning
of the things of God, and this is that <hi>publick spirit</hi> by which the
Apostles published the <hi>Everlasting Gospel</hi> of peace, and which Christ
the head of the <hi>Body (his Church)</hi> had received without measure;
and this is a private, twyning, creeping spirit of thine, who hath
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50701:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been lost in thy own imaginations, and following thy own forward
rash spirit, and hath found no certainty in thy self of Gods spirit
to stay thy mind upon, nor no patience to wait upon it, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
&amp; grasping at things in thy dark mind, &amp; last of all hath brought
in thy verdict for the devil against the sufficiency of the holy spirit of
God, its guidance amongst his people in the later days; &amp; that is thy
fond conception as to say, that the Spirit of God is expressly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the 2. of <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. which thou calls a private spirit all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long;
<hi>'tis true no prophefie of Scripture is of private interpretation,
but the holy Men of God spoke it forth as they were moved by the holy
spirit,</hi> which was <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>conversant</hi> among them, with them
and in them; and they that have it, can receive them as they are
written, and can read them, and understand them as they were
spoken, and doth see the intent of the Holy Ghost in so speaking
unto different states and conditions, notwithstanding the many
<hi>Copies</hi> thou tells on, and <hi>diversions</hi> and different <hi>translations</hi>
which thou would make a great Mountain on, and raise it up so
high to make the Scripture uncertain and low, as not fit to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice on, as to answer any <hi>doubt,</hi> or to be any <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>guide,</hi>
or any <hi>example</hi> or <hi>president</hi> for any thing that I can perceive by the
course of thy Spirit, which in the truth is fathomed and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
though it is as uncertain as the way of a Serpent upon a
Rock, yet they that have the spirit of God sees beyond all, and
hath unity with the words and minds of the Spirit of God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the many corruptions and defects in translations, and
the many foul hands it hath passed through.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The spirit of Christ is the gift of God, which he
giveth unto all that wait for his appearance, and his Sheep have
it, and they that are Christs have it, for <hi>they that have not the
spirit of Christ is none of his,</hi> and it is that which is every way suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
(and no way insufficient) and it is every way sufficient to
lead into all truth, according unto Christs promise, <hi>and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the World of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment:</hi> again, it
is that which Christ promised for a director, which was with
them when they healed the Sick, and cast out Devils, and which
was in them to consolate them and comfort them in the midst of
affliction; as it did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and made them bold who were
yet <hi>illiterate Men,</hi> and had not that sufficiency, which many looks
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50701:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon now they have, to wit natural Tongues and Languages, yet
it was sufficient in them, to give them wisedome to declare the
things of the Kingdome of God, to the salvation of many that
did believe through their words, it was sufficient to comfort
Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas <hi>when they were shut in the inner Room, and their Feet
fast in the Stocks,</hi> when there was no outward cause of joy but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of sorrow, yet they were made to sing and rejoyce because
of the great comfort and joy that the spirit of God filled their
hearts with again, it was sufficient in the midst of great conflicts
and tribulations which <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest suffered for the <hi>Gospels
sake and for Christs sake,</hi> and yet as suffering did abound it was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make <hi>consolation to super abound,</hi> to ballance the suffering
and to make it easie.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is that everlasting Covenant, which the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
by the mouth of his Prophets in former dayes, that he
would fulfill in the latter dayes or after times; <hi>that he would
write his Law in their hearts and put his spirit in their inward parts,
and that they should not teach every Man his neighbour, saying, know
the Lord, for they shall all know me from the least to the greatest:</hi> and
again in another place, <hi>I will power upon them the spirit of prayer,
and supplication, and they shall see him whom they have pierced, &amp;c.</hi>
and again, <hi>I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and my Sons and
my Daughters shall prophesie, &amp;c.</hi> and this was fulfilled at <hi>Pentecost</hi>
in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when the Disciples met together, and the <hi>promise of
the Father</hi> came to be fulfilled, and the Unbelievers said they were
filled with <hi>new Wine,</hi> and the Lord hath a care of his people
through ages, and hath not left them comfortless, nor without
a guide, and a certain and a sure one too; which spirit is manifest
among some <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> whom thou takes liberty to call
Sects, and the sufficiency of it is witnessed (praised be the Lord)
in our Assemblies, both as to convince, to convert, to save, to
judge, to guide, to instruct, to comfort; and is that alone in
which all true Christian men <hi>can worship God, in the silence of all
flesh, and fleshly motions and thoughts,</hi> it's that, that giveth assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
also, of acceptation with God, and is that which makes
the <hi>Prayers of the Saints as sweet insence in the Nostrils of the Lord;</hi>
it is that which makes the words of him like Butter, as pleasant
as Hony, or sweet Oyle; who speakes by it, through it, and
from it, whereby the hearts of many hath been <hi>pricked, and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50701:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoughts of many hearts hath been revealed, and many hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
with joy unspeakable, and filled with pure love, from the sensible
feeling of the sufficiency of its power, opperating in the inward Man,
even</hi> as when the harvest had been gatheredin, and the Press been
full of Grapes, and the Fattes had over-flowen with abundance;
so that they could have rejoyced and sung and danced for joy, as
sometimes <hi>David</hi> did, when the Ark of God was brought from
the House of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> and placed in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for joy, and all <hi>Israel</hi> was filled with gladness; what might I
say for the certainty, sufficiency and all-sufficiency of this holy
spirit of God; I might fill my mouth with arguments, and time
might fail me in speech, to speak of the excellency, certainty
and infallibility thereof, against all opposers and quarellers: In a
word it is that alone meanes; through which God conveys eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life to all man kind, <hi>and it is that rule by which all the Sons of
God were led, Rom.</hi> 8. 14. It is that only sure Guide, Judge, Way,
Rule, in which there is certainty and assurance of the love of God
to Man kind; it is that by which the deeds of the flesh are <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
and Men <hi>quickned</hi> and enlivened unto God in their hearts, in
which the Saints are <hi>accepted,</hi> by which they are <hi>regenerated,</hi> and
through which they become <hi>Heires of the promise:</hi> what shall I
say but this, let all flesh be confounded before it, and all deceit
stop its mouth, and all the sons of Men bow before it, all Councils
and Churches, all Rulers and Elders, all Reason and Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
all Words and Writing of Men, and holy Men, yea of the
Scriptures of truth, it gave them all a being, it was, it is, and is to
come, and will remain when all visible things are past away, it is
that <hi>by which God will plead with all flesh, and bring a Consumption
upon all the honourable of the Earth,</hi> and burn up the Mountains,
and make the hills to melt, and make all a plain before Him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make room, make room, make way ye potsheards, and cease
all your contending and babling, and bow to it, and learn of it in
your hearts, (which <hi>R. E.</hi> like an ignorant man calls a private spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
that your souls may be saved in the day of the Lord, and you
my escape his wrath which is to come against all resisters
of it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Your Catholick Church, falsely so called, who hath
erred from the spirit, the infallible Guide, (though you much
boast of it) both in doctrine and practise abundantly; insomuch
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50701:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that your faces seem altogether to look another way, and your
course to arive at another Haven, then the Apostles and all the
primitive Christians attained unto; to wit <hi>everlasting Happiness
and rest for their souls,</hi> and acceptation with God in their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
and sacrifices, which they offered unto him in the spirit,
of which they and all that believe in it, and have received it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
perfect assurance in their hearts, by the immediate spirit of
God; and likewise the Protestants in general, whether <hi>Lutherins</hi>
or <hi>Calvins,</hi> or other Sects known by denomination, are of so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and a <hi>pinching spirit,</hi> as that you would <hi>pinch</hi> and <hi>shut</hi>-up the
universal love of God unto all Mankind, into a <hi>narrow corner;</hi> and
monopalise the free grace of God that hath appeared to all Men,
that teaches all men that receives it, to deny all Heresie, falshood,
opinions and humours, private spirits, and spirits of error, which
leadeth from all these, and is sufficient to lead out of all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and worldly lusts, and to do that which is acceptable in the
sight of God, and this all sects, (<hi>since the Woman cloathed with the
Sun fled into the Wilderness,</hi> viz. <hi>the true Church;</hi>) and all parties
hath laid claim to, and excluded all others that were not of their
opinion, as from having any share in it, as though it were given
only to such a company of men that succeeded the Apostles, and
by arts and parts, and natural Language in the course and term of
years, and at such and such places, as the Apostles were sometime
conversant at, and other sects besides you, who have kept more
nearer in Conformity, in Doctrine and Worship, and unto the
Apostles then you have done, they have laid claim to the spirit of
God, and to the free Grace of God, only extending it self to
them under such a quallification, as though the Spirit of God, and
free and saving Grace of God, had come by Generation, or by
succession, or because of such, and such a quallification or confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in outward practice as I said, as though the free Grace of
God and the infallible Spirit of God, had been given to you, and
had been bequeathed and intailed to you, or any of you, under
such and such a denomination, and because inhabiting at such a
place, and thus you would limit the holy one of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to stop
the wind to blow where it listeth, and circumscribe the <hi>infallible
means</hi> which God hath given unto all Mankind for a <hi>direction</hi> and
a <hi>guide,</hi> a <hi>rule,</hi> and a <hi>judge,</hi> and pinch it up into a narrow corner,
and yet shut up all under condemnation, who do not believe, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50701:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet exclude all but your selves, from the sufficient meanes and
guide, and way; whereby they may believe: away, away, with
this <hi>narrow, partial, pinching spirit;</hi> for God will not be limited,
neither can be, either to Men, time, or place; but as they keep
in Covenant with him, and keeps their first love and integrity,
in the certain truth revealed in the first publication of the Gospel;
which the <hi>Roman Church</hi> above all other hath wonderfully aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
from, especially in this one thing, which she can never clear
her self of; to wit <hi>Persecution,</hi> in taking away the lives of many,
under the name of Hereticks, and suppose any had been so, as
doubtless there are such; yet we never read, that it was Christ
or the Apostles way <hi>to kill them and destroy them,</hi> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
denyed them, and warned others to beware of them, and
to have no fellowship with them, and so left them to the World,
neither that they exhorted or stired up, either Kings or Princes
to take away the lives of any, who did believe or not believe
what as they declared to be truth; but on the contrary, when
the Disciples in the days of their infancy would have <hi>commanded
fire to have come down from Heaven (as did</hi> Elias) <hi>Christ rebuked them
and told them they knew not what spirit they were of;</hi> and again <hi>love
your enemies, and do good to them that hate you:</hi> How your Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church hath kept this precept I leave all <hi>Nations</hi> to judge,
where your power hath been known; suppose real <hi>Schismaticks</hi>
and <hi>Hereticks</hi> as some such there hath been in the world, how you
have done good to them, and how you have loved them is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
except you judge that shuting them up in Prisons, racking,
tortering, and cruel torments, and at last of all death, was in love
to them, and in doing good to them, which methinks any reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man should blush and be ashamed to think or say.</p>
            <p>But an old Plea comes to my mind, which some of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath alledged to me in the days of my
youth, when I was conversant with them, and among them, in a
friendly, neighbourly, and sober discourse, of things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before mentioned; it was said unto me, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church is that Church whereby Christianity hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to all Nations, and the great Oraccles thereof delivered
unto us, and the Scriptures also came from us, by which you know
the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, and the knowledg thereof
came unto all, and all her Children ought to be subject unto her,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50701:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the true mother that brought them all forth, and if any went
astray either into Heresie, or Schisme, which might not only hurt
themselves, but also others; ought not the Mother in natural love
to her Children to correct them, and ought not they to bear her
correction, and submit unto it; and hath not she power to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
her Children when they go astray? unto which is answered,
Christianity that which is truly such, and them whom God will
own to be Christians was dispersed through the Nations by the
power of God; and we say, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Christendom into that mould and frame into which they
are now cast, more by force and awe then any sound Doctrine;
and as for the Scriptures coming from her, that we deny; We
know they came from the Apostles, and from the Primitive
Christians, according to the will of God, and have been preserved
to this day, though through many polluted hands they have come;
and we know how much your rage was kindled, that ever it should
be Translated into the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and many felt the effect of
it to the loss of their Lives, as I hope many in <hi>England</hi> doth well
consider: But suppose a true Mother have many Children, and
suppose some do swerve and go astray from her precepts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of correcting of them she shut them up in Goals, and
nasty holes, and afflict them with sundry kind of torments, and
at last of all kill them and destroy them; what Judgment will be
given by reasonable Men of such a Mother, but this, that she is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unnatural and cruel, and hard hearted, and degenerated
from the nature of a loving and tender Mother, and deserves not
to have or ever to have had any <hi>Children;</hi> and such a kind of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
hath your Church been, to all that have dissented from her;
that I may say of her as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> said, (especially in
these latter ages) the <hi>Sea Monsters and Dragons of the Wilderness
draw out their breasts to feed their young ones, but the daughter of my
people is become cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly and lastly, We know that God willeth that all Men
should be saved, and come to the knowledg of the truth, and
hath given that, and doth give that unto every man that is come
into the World, whereby every man that doth receive it is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of fulfilling the will of God, and this gift comes not by the
will of Man, nor is received in the will of Man, but in its own will
even in the will of the giver, and this <hi>free gift of God is the free and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50701:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
saving Grace of God which hath appeared unto all Men;</hi> to wit, every
man that is come into the World, <hi>which teaches all the Saints,</hi> and
would teach all Infidels to <hi>deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and
to live godly and righteously, and soberly in this present evil world.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
all are not so taught, because they heed it not, and because
they receive it not, and so they make the free gift of God of no
effect, (<hi>as to life to them</hi>) but it is their condemnation; yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
herein appears the equal, merciful and universal love of God,
who is no respecter of persons, but hath distributed a measure of
this unto all to the intent that they might have power to fulfill
his will, and keep his Statutes, and so the fault is not in God but
in them, who slight and dispise his gift, and so condemnation is
just of every one that doth not believe, and is of himself, and
this reprehends that false, erronious, narrow, pinching spirit,
which would shut it up in a corner, and tye it to one sort of Men,
or Sect, or opinion, and the masters thereof would assume it to
themselves, as though the Spirit of God and Grace of God were
only among them, and must be conveyed from them, to other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
before they have it, and the direction and guide of every
man must be sought from their mouths, as though God had not
<hi>given a measure of his Spirit unto every man to profit withal;</hi> and to
be led and taught, and guided by it into all truth, out of error,
according to Christs promise, and according to the Lords promise
in the days of old; that though his people might <hi>eat the bread of
adversity, and drink the water of affliction, yet their teacher should not
be removed into a corner;</hi> and from this quieking, enlightening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening
spirit of God, the Saints of God, and Ministers of Christ
in the Primitive times received power and authority to propagate
Righteousness, and to judge deceit, and the mystery of Iniquity,
where ever it appeared, and in this their ability stood; for they
were made <hi>able and fit Ministers</hi> by it, <hi>not of the Letter,</hi> nor of Mens
traditions, nor of foolish fopperies, which hath been introduced
since, and shuffled in among Christians under the name of power
and authority of the holy Church, and the Church of God that
had received this spirit walked in it, and brought forth the fruits
of it, whereby they were a good savour in the nostrils of the Lord,
and by which they <hi>adorned the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, by a
holy Conversation,</hi> which did manifest them to be of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and stop the mouths of gain-sayers: And thus we are bold
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50701:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to tell thee &amp; all, that the <hi>Spirit of God which is given a measure of it
to every man,</hi> and more fulness of it to them that <hi>believe,</hi> that it is
the <hi>rule,</hi> and the <hi>way,</hi> and the <hi>means,</hi> whereby all the actions, words,
and works of all Men are weighed, tryed, measured, and <hi>judged,</hi>
and <hi>Objections answered,</hi> and is the alone Judge of all matters, and
answerer of all <hi>doubts,</hi> and giveth only true and perfect <hi>satisfaction;</hi>
and therefore <hi>R. E.</hi> may blush and be ashamed to ever publish such
a thing abroad in the World, as to say, that the Spirit of God is
not a sufficient directer, teacher and Judge, but calls it a private
spirit, opinion, humour and fancy; to make the eyes of them blind
who wait for its appearance, only to <hi>trust</hi> to Men who pleads an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
and power, without verity: And further he goes on and
sayes in 22 <hi>th.</hi> page of his said Epistle, There is neither <hi>Jew, Turk,
Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi> but he may put on confidence enough, affirming
that he is taught by the spirit of God, many of all sorts doth this
and yet teach contradictions; and further saith, that it hath no
effect among them who pretend to it, and that they can no more
satisfie another, that they are guided by the spirit of truth then
many who are cast into <hi>Bedlam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, many are confident and impudent enough, but
confidence without ground, and impudence proves but little, and
he that saith he is a <hi>Jew</hi> and is not, but of the Synagogue of Satan
will soon be found out by his Doctrine and fruits, and he that saith
he is a <hi>Christian</hi> and led by the Spirit, and keeps not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Christ, neither brings forth the fruits of the spirit, is
soon discovered to be a <hi>deceiver,</hi> and deceived, and such are like
to teach contradictions, but all such are denyed, shut out with the
spirit of truth, but them that have the spirit of God, witness a
blessed effect among them, for they are turned from <hi>Satans power
unto God,</hi> and doth witness <hi>remission of sin and reconciliation with
God,</hi> and are not at difference, but at unity one with another, and
are brought out of the obstinate and perverse estate which all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
are in, and as for contradictions they are more to be seen
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then many wheres else; they who are but
pleased and hath leisure to view over the <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi>
of several <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> since he was elevated to be Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Bishop over all Christian Churches, by that heathen and cruel
<hi>Emperour Phocus,</hi> who slew his Master <hi>Mauritius</hi> to obtain the
Empire, he did gratifie the <hi>Pope</hi> so far that he might be cryed up
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50701:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as Emperour, as that he should be <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a better plea for the Pope (because the Emperour had power
to defend him, and to compell all to receive his <hi>Decrees</hi>) then that
he was <hi>Peters</hi> Successor; I say who will but look into the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
and Decrees shall find such <hi>seting up</hi> and <hi>throwing down,</hi>
and such <hi>decreeing,</hi> and such <hi>disanulling,</hi> as twenty such Champions
as <hi>Robert Everard</hi> will never be able to free his Catholick Church
from contradictions, although he is very forward to charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
though he is but a new Convert, but let him not boast
till he have put off his armour, and it is that mad <hi>Bedlam</hi> spirit of
thine that saith, that among all the Nonconformists there is no one
that can satisfie another, that he hath the spirit of God; I tell
thee yes, there are <hi>thousands satisfied in one another</hi> that they have
the spirit of God, besides he that hath it can speak to the witness
of <hi>God</hi> in another which shall testifie the same, and moreover their
<hi>works</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> shall and doth manifest unto others, that they are
<hi>born of the spirit,</hi> because the fruits of it are seen, as they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to be born of God that do the <hi>works of God;</hi> and thou must
first know the spirit of God in thy self (if ever thou look for it
there, and not hang all together upon others belief as thou doth
upon thy Catholick Church) before thou can know it in another,
and first be convinced by it and judged by it, for thy ill deeds and
ill thoughts and hypocrisie, and time-serving, and flattery, and
men pleasing, before thou can be convinced of others Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and also be convinced of the <hi>unbelief</hi> of thy own heart before
thou can believe others; but thou hath been so busie abroad in
quareling and contending about words and names, and empty
shews without substance and life, that thy mind is all over grown
with <hi>thorns</hi> and <hi>briers,</hi> scrawling and scratching, and entangling
thy self and others; so that, that which should savour the things
of God is over grown in these, and its buried, and to them that
are like <hi>heaths in a desart,</hi> knows not when good comes, neither
doth know what they enjoy that dwell in the <hi>fat Vallies,</hi> and the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> had such unbelieving hearts, though Christ was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<hi>Image</hi> of God, and did the works that never man did, yet
being without faith and without reason, they said, he was a <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,</hi>
and all his works was done by <hi>Belzebub,</hi> and would never
be convinced that any thing he did was of God, and that spirit is
near thee which would represent the fruits of the Spirit to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50701:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
delusion, and them that bring them forth like them in <hi>Bedlam;</hi> and
what though <hi>Turks, Jews, Pagans, Mahomet,</hi> and the false <hi>Christians</hi>
do pretend to the spirit and guidance by it, and yet bring forth
the fruits of the flesh, doth this make the spirit of God void? or
the certainty of it to them that believe, or do make their fruits of
none effect, God forbid, thy ignorance is manifest; but here thou
ceases not, thy tongue being thy own, and thou being at liberty,
and speaks thy own words, which in the end shall become thy
burden.</p>
            <p>Thou vapours and vaunts over them, to wit all the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
and saith, what can you say for your selves any of you, which
these <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> who have gone before you to maintain their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
but the rule and judge, and then thou concludes that which
God hath appointed to be rule and judge to all the world, and
capable of being known and heard by all, and cannot contradict it
self, nor must be contradicted by any, under pain of damnation;
if you cannot shew it to have been your rule you ought to lay aside
your folly, as destructive to humane society, and them that hath
pretended the spirit, the strongest party, and sword, upon the
vote will prove it self the most convincing spirit, and force the
weaker spirits to submit or cry, for thou concludes the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
have no other Testimony to try your contradicting spirits
in matters of greatest moment, but force and success, if you have
I pray you inform me what it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If the wind had not turned into another door, divers <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
believes we should have had another song from thee, if
time had but favoured thee so far as to have granted thee the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
of thy Troop to be Captain, which name thou holds up yet
i'th pride of thy heart, though thou have lost thy force, success,
and pay, which was the greatest plea when time was with thee,
and not long since too, which makes thee measure every Man's
foot by thy Last, and thou might have received information be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou had made a conclusion, had been the part of a wise man,
before thou had set thy self as Judge over all thy former fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
which thou fainedly pretends so great love to; and before
thou had discovered their nakedness (if it be nakedness) to all the
world in such a publick <hi>insulting bravado</hi> as this, like <hi>Goliah</hi> of
<hi>Gath,</hi> and as for what some <hi>Nonconformists</hi> both to the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> too, which thou <hi>creeping</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50701:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>sneakingly flatters,</hi> and saith its established, and therefore thou will
not meddle, thou might have said, <hi>dare not,</hi> for thy spirit is well
enough seen by them, only to have the spirit of a <hi>slave,</hi> and not a
free member of the true Church of God, and its no part of <hi>vertue,</hi>
nor <hi>honour,</hi> for thee to insult and glory over them, who are in <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
and <hi>adversity,</hi> when as thou dare not meddle with them who
are as contrary to thee as the former, this is but the spirit of a
<hi>Coward,</hi> and is <hi>ignoble and base,</hi> and ever so to be accounted by all
the Children of Light, who dare put all to venture which they
do enjoy on this side of <hi>Immortality,</hi> and to suffer the loss of all
visible things for their Testimony, and the truth which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and for bearing witness against that, which is contrary unto
their faith, as did the valiant Primitive Christians of old, and that
which some <hi>Nonconformists</hi> can say, is more then thou can believe,
although demonstrated in the evidence of the spirit of God, with
sound reason, and evident example from the Scriptures of truth,
and though thou and thy former fellowships then, and thy new
fellowships now, have made this vapour, which for ought I know
might lay your hands upon your mouths, all considering what <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
Doctrines and fruits</hi> hath been brought forth since the
night of Apostacy entered in, and <hi>all the World wondered after the
Beast;</hi>
some hath this to say, he that pretends to the Spirit, and
the thing cometh not to pass that they speak or prophesie let him
be accounted a <hi>false Prophet;</hi> again, they that pretend guidance
of the spirit as some formerly have done, and yet bring forth the
fruits of the flesh as variance, hatred, emulation, strife, contention,
heresie, false Doctrine, persecution, force and violence, let them
he counted (as truly they are) <hi>deceivers</hi> and <hi>deluders,</hi> which have
gone out into the world, and deceived a great part of Mankind,
of which <hi>Rome</hi> hath not had the least share, clear it when thou can;
Moreover, he that pretends to have the spirit of God and layes
down another foundation to <hi>build</hi> upon, in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> in
matter of <hi>Rule,</hi> in matter of <hi>Judgment,</hi> in matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
then that which the Lord of Life and Glory hath laid down, he
is a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> and an <hi>Antichrist;</hi> but <hi>R. E.</hi> hath laid down another
rule, another way, another Judge, another foundation for Faith,
and let himself make the Conclusion if he once dare joyne to true
Judgment, <hi>other Foundation can none lay then that which is already
laid, to wit, Christ Jesus, the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50701:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and of the Church of God,</hi> by which they were all builded up as a
holy Habitation for God to dwell in through the spirit: Again, the
Apostle saith, <hi>All Judgment is committed to the Son both in Heaven
and Earth;</hi> and again he saith himself, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and
the Life, and none can come to the Father but by me; and again, the
Spirit of Truth shall lead and direct his Disciples into all truth;</hi> and
sealeth unto them their <hi>Justification, Redemption</hi> and <hi>Salvation:</hi>
And this <hi>R. E.</hi> would lay all wast and void; and why? because
many hath pretended to it, and hath fallen short; therefore all
the aforesaid things must be laid aside as uncertain, and not to be
trusted unto; and a certain sort of Men called the Apostles Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
who have sought their gain and worldly Interest, and to
enlarge their Dominions, and to make themselves Lords over
Mens faith, and over Mens Consciences, whatsoever they say
though never so contradictory to the Primitive Doctrine, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Christ and the Apostles days, yet all must be received upon
pain of Damnation, as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith; and this he calls the Visible
Church, and the infallible Judge, and Rule, and Directer, and
hath laid wast the Office of Christ, and turned the spirit out of
doors, and made it ineffectual, and would perswade all others to
look to this from the true Foundation, and so is a <hi>Deceiver and an
Antichrist.</hi> Again, we have this to say, he that teaches a contrary
<hi>Doctrine</hi> then that which was once delivered unto the Saints is a
<hi>Deceiver</hi> and <hi>deceived</hi> (and this was Christs Doctrine once deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud
unto the Saints) <hi>Swear not at all, and love your enemies, pray for
them that persecute you, do good to them that hate you:</hi> And many
more precepts which this visible Guide, to wit, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
holds not, but hath made void; First it teacheth its Members to
swear, and again gives absolutions to remit them of their Oath if
she think fit, and both must be reckoned infallible, and them that
are your enemies instead of praying for them, you curse them;
and instead of doing good to them, you hate them, and stirs up
all your strength against them to destroy them, instead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
of them in love and sound judgment; Instance the days
of King <hi>John,</hi> and divers other Princes, which felt your fury and
wrath; and also <hi>Frederick</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> after he was Interdicted,
was made to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to before the <hi>Popes</hi> Palace, and to stand
bare foot and bare leg, with his Wife and Child two or three days
in Winter, waiting for <hi>Peters</hi> Successor, his Absolution: But it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50701:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may be thou wilt say this was in love to them, and in charity to
their souls; but let all unbyassed spirits judge, and whether have
not you when you have been the strongest party, made force, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and success your greatest engine and plea, to plead with all
Nations, and whatsoever people that dissented from you either
in matter or form; instance <hi>Germany, Bohemia, Moravia,</hi> and
divers other Kingdoms and Provinces; besides the <hi>Indians</hi> in
<hi>America,</hi> which you destroyed chiefly for their Gold and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
under this pretence, that they were Infidels, and forced a
faith upon some, and a belief by the violence of your cruelty and
swords, which made the Noble Man of <hi>India</hi> say, he had rather
go to Hell with the Infidels of <hi>America,</hi> as you called them, then
to Heaven with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> so cruel a people, members of your
Catholick Church, what might I speak of the King of <hi>Castile</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the poor <hi>Moors of Grandia,</hi> who were put to cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by force and violence, which is a reproach upon this sort
of Christianity unto this day, and what persecution was raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Peddamount Christians,</hi> by the force of this infallible Judg,
falsly so called; and what Massacres in <hi>France,</hi> and also in <hi>Ireland</hi>
in latter years, propagated by the <hi>Popes Nuncio,</hi> a chief Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
from the <hi>Roman Sea,</hi> to carry on that design to root out the
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> what destruction of people, in a most barbarous, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
preposterous and prodigeous cruelty, some killed in the
their beds, some knocked in the head like Oxen, some stripped
naked in cold winter and bereaved of all their enjoyments, and
driven as sheep naked to the shambles, and at last driven by scores
into Lakes and Rivers, and drowned, some burned alive in their
Houses, some tender women strangled in Childbed, and their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Infants taken from their Mothers breasts and tossed upon
Spears points; and to my knowledg license and pardons given
and sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to divers of their Emissaries there, that it
should be lawful for any servant or Catholick bondman to steal,
wast and purloyn their Masters Goods if <hi>Hereticks,</hi> for the weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and disenabling of them to resist the <hi>Roman</hi> enterprise begun;
these things and many more are legable in bloody Characters,
which I hope this Generation will not easily blot out of their
memories, so as to commit all faith, all hope, all religion, and all
infallibility and judgment, to such a degenerated Generation, as
<hi>R. E.</hi> would have us do, and with such audaciousness is not ashamed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50701:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to blow his trumpet as in the head of an host to animate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
all to come to this black Standard for <hi>protection,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
judgment, certainty,</hi> and <hi>infallibility,</hi> under no less then pain
of <hi>Damnation;</hi> and why but because <hi>Peter</hi> was sometime Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> as they say, and had given unto him the Keyes of the
Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever he bound on Earth was
bound in Heaven, and whatsoever he loosed on Earth, was loosed
in Heaven; and because Christ said, (giving answer to <hi>Peters</hi> faith)
upon this Rock I will build my Church; therefore all the <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Popes</hi> as heires apparent succeeds him, in laying claim to head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and doth none of his office, nor none of his work, and this
foolish foppery and private interpretation hath been put off at a
very great rate, for Catholick Doctrine, which brings to my mind
a pleasant story, I have sometime read of a certain poor Man meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a certain Bishop at a certain time, in great pomp and glory,
which the poor Man beholding, took up a Laughter, and being
enquired of by the Bishop wherefore he laughed? said he, that
<hi>Peter</hi> should be such a fool as to live such a poor miserable life as
he did, and persecuted in the world, and to leave his Successors so
rich, to inherit such pomp and glory: with that the Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
and said, Thou fool, I am not in this glory as I am Bishop of
such a place, but as I am Duke of such a place: at that the Man
smiled again, and said, When the Duke was in Hell for his pride,
where then would the Bishop be. But to let this pass I am sure
them that layes claim to be <hi>Peters</hi> Successors as to <hi>Patrimony and
Riches</hi> (which he was never endowed with, for sometime he said,
<hi>Silver or Gold have I none</hi>) but doth little of his work in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
of souls, or feeding of the flock of Christ and doth lay
claim unto his privilege and power, but will not come near him in
<hi>Doctrine, labour and suffering</hi> for his Members; and therefore I
say to thee in thy own words, lay aside thy folly, with the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of it, as destructive to the Church of God, to hang all
their faith upon such uncertainties, but even to humane societies,
which I have mentioned, and might instance more, but that I would
not be tedious to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Yes, some have some other Testimony by which spirits
are tryed and may be tryed to be of God, otherwise then by force,
carnal sword, a strong party, or success, that's thy own and not
ours; we have the holy Unction which is poured forth, whereby
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50701:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Saints <hi>knew all things, and tryed the spirits, whether they were of
God or no, and he that confesses not Christ come in the flesh is Antichrist;</hi>
and he that confesses that Christ is come in the flesh only, in <hi>word,</hi>
and because others hath said so, and doth not witness <hi>sin condemned</hi>
in the flesh, and turned from, and to have power over it, the same
is a <hi>false witness,</hi> and is an <hi>Antichrist</hi> also, and also we have other
things to try spirits by, we know a proud, angry, hasty, perverse
spirit, is not the spirit of God; a persecuting, Lording Spirit, is
not the spirit of God; and again they that teach a contrary Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
to the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, they have the
spirit of error; again, they whose practice and conversation is not
suitable to the practice and conversations of <hi>Christ and the Apostles
and Primitive Christians,</hi> that they are in the spirit of error; again,
they that would force a faith by any humane constitution or law
which is repugnant to the Law of God, or by force of the sword
or any carnal weapons, they have the spirit of error; for the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of the Lamb and his Followers <hi>are not carnal weapons, but
spiritual, and yet mighty through God to the beating down of the strong
holds of wickedness;</hi> and to prevail over the Powers of darkness:
again, the Testimony of God in every mans Conscience, which is
an unerring Testimony, this savours the things of God, and by
this the things that be not of God are discerned, and this will
put a perfect difference between the spirit of truth, and the spirit
of error; but what can be said to a man in unbelief that hath
closed his eyes.</p>
            <p>The next thing which <hi>R. E.</hi> saith he consider'd, was, that the
Natural reason of every man could not possibly be rule and judge,
that I sought for; for saith he, if reason were to be rule and judge,
then it would follow contrary to Scripture, that it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to please God without faith, and it would likewise follow
that every Religion would be truth, consequently contradictions
would be true, consequently there would be many Religions and
no faith at all, for reason excludes faith, as in the 26. page of his
Book.</p>
            <p>Thy tongue is thy own, and thou art at liberty, and goes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wilt, &amp; speaks what seems good in thy own eyes, &amp; hath
never yet known another to gird thee and lead thee whether thou
would not, I stand not to vindicate every mans Judgment, neither
to prove other mens conceptions, but seeing thou hath taken in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50701:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hand to lay all Mountains wast afore thee that stands in thy ways,
thou hast raised up some in thy discourse for others to stumble at,
and hath spoken many false things, without distinguishing and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a difference between Light and darkness, between Natural
reason and Spiritual reason, I could not chuse but say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</p>
            <p>Although it is no part of my belief, that the Natural reason of
any man or every man is able to be rule, judge, and guide to any
man in the things of God, yet faith is not in opposition unto pure
reason, neither is pure and spiritual reason in opposition to true
faith, but in harmony with it, and one with another, as they are
the gifts of God; but the Natural reason of all the fallen sons of
<hi>Adam</hi> is corrupted, and is too short, and too narrow, too cross, and
too perverse, as to be rule and judge in the things of God, for
the Natural man by all his endowments in the transgression per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
not the things of God, for they are spiritually discerned,
and the things of God that are spiritual and eternal are above the
reach of Natural reason, and yet thy consequence is false, for faith
doth not exclude pure reason, and faith doth not make blind the
understanding, but enlightens it; and though it is impossible to
please God without faith, yet it is impossible that, that faith should
be without reason, the Apostle desired to be delivered from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
men that had not faith, so it is manifest they that have
faith have reason, and them that have no faith are unreasonable,
and where thou hath borrowed this rule I know not, <hi>that a man
must believe that which he doth not understand;</hi> seeing the Apostle
saith to the <hi>Romans, even of the Gentiles,</hi> who had not the Law nor
the Scriptures, that, <hi>that which may be known of God was manifest
in them;</hi> for by that it is manifest they understood the mind of
God and knew him; for <hi>Paul</hi> saith further, <hi>when they knew God
they glorified him not as God, but were unthankful, &amp;c.</hi> and again,
<hi>he that believes must know that God is;</hi> for none can believe in that
which is not, for to perswade any to believe in uncertainties,
which is not manifest in the understanding, doth rather beget un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
and doubting then true faith, but thy paths are so full of
darkness I shall not traduce them, and thy consequences is false,
for pure reason teaches not contradictions, neither doth teach
that there is no faith at all, neither is faith excluded by pure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as thou ignorantly saith in the 26. page; and is it not reason
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50701:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that I should believe in him, whom I know is the Creator and
Governour of all the World, and pure Religion is so far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
faith, that they that have true faith have reason, and stands
not in opposition to faith, but this I conclude, that the reason of
fallen men is corrupted, and is an uncertain thing to relie upon,
and so not a competent Judge in matters of so high concernment,
as touching everlasting Salvation.</p>
            <p>The third thing which thou treats upon, is against them who
have pleaded that the sole Scriptures are sufficient of themselves
to teach true faith from time to time, to direct, rule and govern
us, and to be rule and judge, and to supply the place of Christ and
the Apostles.</p>
            <p>As I said, it is not my intention to vindicate other mens qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
which is no part of my faith, notwithstanding I should be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but that every thing had its true <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> and shall
not in the least detract from the price, value and true worth of the
words of truth, to wit the Scriptures of truth, which were
spoken forth by the spirit of truth, and by the holy Ghost, as it
gave utterance, but as men erring in their Judgments, runs some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the right hand, and sometimes to the left hand, and walks
not in a straight path, some men are seting them up above that
which they were intended for, and placing them in the stead of
<hi>God, Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and others are too much debasing them
and disesteeming them, as that they would set up the Judgment
of <hi>variable</hi> and <hi>changable men,</hi> who hold and teach things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the Scriptures, and repugnant to the mind of the
spirit in them that spoke them forth.</p>
            <p>But first of all, I say not against thee in this thing, that the sole
or whole Scriptures are not sufficient of themselves to teach true
faith, and give the knowledge of God without the spirit, for
many have got the words, and yet hath not received the spirit,
nor the power which the Scriptures declare of, such wrangles and
contends with the words, and opposes the life and the power;
the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Scriptures, and knew by them where Christ
should be born, and knew by them what his works should be, when
he was manifest, and yet rejected him, unto whom all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
bore witness, from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and from him to <hi>John,</hi>
and they were never intended by God, as to be set up as <hi>Judge,</hi>
and <hi>Guide,</hi> to wit the <hi>words</hi> without the power and <hi>Spirit of God;</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50701:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet notwithstanding, though I cannot set them up in the place of
God and Christ, and the Spirit, nor contend ignorantly as some
have done, that they are the author of true faith, and that they
are the eternal word of God, which the world was made by, that
they are the light, and the way, the truth and the life, and that
they are the desider of all Controversies, and sole, and absolute,
and only Judge of all matters of faith, and of all matters that
ever hath been, or ever shall be in controversie to the end of the
World without the spirit of God; neither am I of that ignorant
mind as some are, that the Letter and the Spirit is unseparable, as
that whosoever hath the Scripture must needs have the Spirit, or
whosoever hath the Scripture must needs be infallible without the
Spirit, all that are of the aforesaid Judgment are but wranglers
for the most part about words, and contenders against the power
of God and godliness, and brings the words to oppose the life,
and them that have the spirit and walk in it, for a Natural man
may read the Scriptures and yet not perceive the things of God,
neither perceive the mind of the spirit, but wrest to their own
destruction, as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, because they are unlearned &amp; untaught
<hi>(by the spirits teaching,)</hi> though otherwise learned enough in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
Tongues and Speeches.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Yet I cannot detract from them, neither undervalue
them, or disesteem them as uncertain, or of no use, or of little
use, but what ever themselves declare themselves to be, that I own
them to be, to wit, <hi>the Words of God, the words of Christ, the words
of the holy Prophets and Patriarkes, and Apostles,</hi> who were endued
with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and spake forth the Scripture as they were
moved thereby, in several ages of several things, and unto several
states and conditions, as they were led thereunto by the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi>
and they are a certain declaration of things that were done and
believed, and practised by the <hi>Jewes</hi> under the <hi>first Covenant,</hi> and
by the Apostles and Primitive Christians in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and
contain many precious and holy <hi>precepts and commands, doctrines,
examples, exhortations, admonisions, reproofs and instructions;</hi> and
are as lively examples and holy patterns for all the Saints in light
to follow, by which we are given to understand what
<hi>Faith,</hi> what <hi>Hope,</hi> what <hi>Patience,</hi> what <hi>Love,</hi> what
<hi>mercy,</hi> what <hi>long sufferings,</hi> what <hi>consolation,</hi> and <hi>what vertue,</hi>
and what <hi>inheritance</hi> the Saints in light were made pertakers
of, through faith in Christ Jesus: Likewise, what <hi>Doctrines</hi> were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50701:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
held forth, and what <hi>practice</hi> they used in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, when
they walked in the order of the Gospel, and had fellowship with
God the Father, and the Son, and one with another in the light
of the Gospel, which is the power of God, through which they
witnessed Salvation and remission of sins, and published it unto
others that they might believe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Scriptures testifies of Christ, and were written
that they might be believed, and received, and read, that there by
every one that believed might be made wise to Salvation, through
faith in Christ Jesus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and instructed in Righteousness,
that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished with all
good works, and whosoever doth teach any Doctrines contrary
unto the holy Men of God, who spake as they were moved by
the spirit of God which dwelt in them, the Scriptures are witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
against such, that they have not the Spirit of God, but are led
by another spirit which brings forth contrary Doctrine, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faith then once was delivered among the Saints, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
brings in, sets up other precepts, constitutions, orders, and
practices in <hi>point of Worships in opposition and contrary unto those
practices which were held forth in the Primitive times;</hi> and would
set up other Traditions then the Apostles delivered either by
word or writing, such are manifest to have the spirit of <hi>error,</hi> and
are innovaters and bringers in of other things, as necessary in
point of Worship among Christians, which the Apostles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ did not see necessary then, and yet they wanted
no part of the Councel of God, for <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>he had declared the
whole Councel of God;</hi> and further more they said, we have the
mind of Christ, and Christs mind is not variable.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Though divers of the Writings of the Prophets and
Apostles be lost doubtless, as is evident by divers places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet blessed be God that there are those preserved which do
bear witness of the one thing <hi>absolutely necessary unto Salvation,</hi>
and of the Ministrations that were appointed of the Lord for the
Church of God to observe, both in the first and second Covenants;
so that Christians of this last age are not left without example and
president, which all ought to have an eye unto, and a diligent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
and though there be divers Coppies of that which is called
the Original Tongues, and divers Translations, yet he unto whom
the Spirit of God is given, and waiteth in the measure of Christs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50701:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Light shall receive it, doth see and shall see the mind and will of
God in every age, and the mind and intent of the spirit in them
that spoke forth the Scripture, and can receive the matter therein
contained, as though they had heard them speak, that spoke it at
the first, and though the Translaters were Men, yet I have such an
honourable esteem of their labour, that I believe they have not
varied wittingly and willingly from the best Coppies that was
extant in their age, neither that they were altogether void of the
Spirit of God in such a good work, which conduced to the benefit
of Mankind, but were assisted by it, for so good a work, and there
be many figures and trophes, improprieties of speech, mysteries
and difficulties, yet all these comes to be made easie and plain to
them that are witnesses of the same spirit that gave them forth,
and though there be deversity of judgments and professions of
Religion, one clashing again another, and thwarting another, and
contradicting another, and all will seem to bring the Scripture for
their proofe, which yet canuot maintain and prove every thing
good, especially when their Doctrines contradict one another:
This is granted, it is only their private interpretation, and not
the Scripture; and for want of that Spirit that gave it forth, for
that alone gives the true understanding of it, and they that are
without this are like to kill one another about <hi>words and names,
and sounds, and titles, and jotas,</hi> but still wants the key that opens,
and gives an entrance into the knowledg of the things of God,
which alone is the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Last of all, <hi>R. E.</hi> after he saith the three former props which is
the basis of the whole foundation, and glided over as sleightily as
he possible could, although he hath never stated the matter right,
indeed as to remove all things out of his way, which might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in his cause which he drives so hard on in, to wit, to set
up a certain company or multitude of men visible and universal,
as he saith to be the only infallible Judge to convey Faith to the
World, and to be the certain and infallible Judge in all matters,
that either pertaines to the Worship of God, and to be believed
under pain of Damnation, as his term is all along, without
questioning at all either their Doctrine or Principles, or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them with the Doctrine of Christ or Primitive Christians,
whether they be true or false, whether they be with or against,
but all is to be received by an implisite faith, hand over head, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50701:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by whole sail, for it will admit of no examination nor doubt, but
all must be received of necessity as infallible, and upon so great a
necessity to, as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith, if you will believe him, would make it
so, that all forfeits eternal Salvation for not receiving all the
Doctrines of this Church, and consequently procures eternal
damnation unto themselves who refuse it; so that if I should say
no more, but even lay down his assertions which are scattered up
and down his Book, called <hi>an Epistle to all Nonconformists,</hi> it were
answer enough I hope to many, whose mouthes I hope would be
filled with arguments, and sound and grounded ones too, or at
least with faith in their hearts to oppugn, and not receive all these
bold assertions without examination or trial, only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of infallibility from the Universal Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> falsly
so called; but <hi>R. E.</hi> having removed away all the stumbling blocks
which is in his way, as he judges, the <hi>private spirit</hi> he hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to be this rule and judge, which I judge he hath no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
in, though he have spent much paper and time in his scribling
humour, which hath been his manner in former days, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
page the first; neither <hi>reason,</hi> nor the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are this
rule and judge, but he hath concluded the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is, but
all along he hath waved that which indeed is the only and alone
rule and judge infallible, viz. <hi>the Spirit of God;</hi> but either calls
it the private spirit, or concludes it is intailed upon the Church,
so that she cannot erre, page the 54. which I shall say something
further unto.</p>
            <p>That there hath been a Church of God, and a peculiar people
whom God hath singled out, as to be objects of his love, which
feared him in their hearts, and bore a Testimony of him, and
worshipped him according to the manifestation of his Spirit unto
them, whether by word or revelation, which was certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
unto them that received it, is granted, and this was alwaies
but little in comparison of the multitude of the fallen Sons of
<hi>Adam,</hi> and the rest of the Nations and people that served and
worshipped strange Gods, and never made such a boast of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
and visibility as this supposed Catholick Church hath done
since the Apostacy entered in, which the Apostles <hi>foresaw and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
off</hi> before their departure out of this Tabernacle, and
since, many have believed in Christ, and the <hi>Worship of the Jewes
extinguished,</hi> and a fatal overthrow of their <hi>Civil Government and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50701:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Kingdom,</hi> are two main reasons of extinguishing their Worship,
and hath been no invitation to any to turn <hi>Jewes,</hi> or holden in
their worship, seeing they have lost their Government and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and are as scattered people without privilege, and is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
for the World to joyne to them; therefore seeing the
face of that Government was demolished, and their Worship en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but only as to themselves, who remained in their unbelief,
and seeing that the Doctrine of Christ did so far prevail as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingush
it, and put out the Glory thereof in the Apostles dayes,
and sometime afterwards, and also the Gentiles Worship, and
their false Gods and dumb Idols, which they were led after, the
power of God prevailing through the Apostles, the Ministers of
Righteousness, by whom many were converted unto the Faith
of Christ, the <hi>summe and substance of all shadowes,</hi> many being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Faith, did hold forth a publick Testimony, and it
became in some reputation, and many preached him of envy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and strife, and for filthy lucre, covetousness and self-ends,
and many followed their pernicious wayes, and yet held the name
of Christ and Christianity, and thus began the mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to work, and the Devil to turn so far Christian in name, (only)
because it was in vain among many to hold forth the <hi>Jewes</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Worship, because they had an inclination
another way after Christianity, that came into more repute with
the World, and therefore suffered the name or many to profess
it, and under this name, and under this Cover, to bring forth his
works of darkness, and the fruits of the flesh, and the nature of
Christ wanting, and here was the beginning and rise of your uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
visible Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the first two thousand years before the Scriptures
were written, <hi>R. E.</hi> saith, the Church of God was this rule and
judge and infallible director, which might to some indifferent
man have been granted, but that I see which way his course bends,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the setting up of Men as judge, and rule, and guide, and
detracts from the <hi>Spirit and power of God,</hi> in which the ability
and power of the Church of God stood, and from which alone they
received this proper power &amp; right, because their understandings
were enlightened, and their judgments informed to declare the
mind of God freely, according as it was revealed, and to give
true judgment, why is not this attributed rather to <hi>the spirit and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50701:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
power of God that was manifest in them,</hi> rather then to persons, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ability stood, and their power only as they kept in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, and as any erred from that in any age, or fell from
that, they came to be blind guides, and to give false judgment, as
some such there were in all ages.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>R. E.</hi> saith, that after the Scripture was written the
Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> was rule and judge unto the <hi>Jewes,</hi> &amp; cites
<hi>Deu. 17. 8. Thou shalt come to the Priests, Levites, &amp; unto the Iudge and
enquire, and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that which they shall tell thee thou shall do.</hi> And likewise he
quotes, <hi>Mat. 23. 2, 3. The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses
Chair, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do, &amp;c.</hi> And
from thence he infers, would God direct them unto, and punish
with death for not obeying an authority which might deceive
them, and was this authority committed to them that was capable
of mistaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It seems <hi>R. E.</hi> would narrow and pinch up the Church
of God among the <hi>Jewes</hi> in a straight compass, when he would
confine it only to the Priests and Levites, and to the Judges in
those days, when as all the Tribes were called the Church as well
as <hi>Levy;</hi> again it is said, <hi>Jacob is my portion, and Israel is the Lot of
my Inheritance,</hi> comprising the whole Tribes and Families of the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> but it seems these must be no part of the Church with
<hi>R. E.</hi> he pinches narrower now then he will do when he tells us of
the vastness of the universal Church; but let that pass as by the
way, and to come to the matter in hand; the Priests and Levites
were appointed by the express Commandements of God, as to be
Ministers unto him, and to Minister unto the people, according to
that Covenant that he made in those days, and the Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
were endowed with the Spirit from God, suitable to the
Ministry and charge committed to them, and they were figures of
Christ <hi>the Everlasting High Priest,</hi> and the Law and Judgment which
was given by the Lord to <hi>Moses,</hi> was delivered to the Priests and
<hi>their Lips were to preserve Knowledge;</hi> and good reason, because
they were committed unto them, and the Tables of stone and the
Commandements were not given to the Families and the rest of
the Tribes, and <hi>R. E.</hi> hath answered himself, neither could suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Coppies have been written in any reasonable time to every
particular Tribe, Family, or person, and therefore <hi>R. E.</hi> concludes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50701:23"/>
full too hastily, but that his spirit indeed is byassed all along in his
discourse to aime toward the mark he would be at, to set up Men
above the Spirit, Scripture and Reason; but I euquire of <hi>R. E.</hi>
whether that the Priests and Levites, and Judge did tell them any
other thing, or direct them in any other way, or gave judgment
after any other manner then as was written <hi>in the Tables of Stone,
or the Book of the Law,</hi> which was written; wherein the mind of
God was contained both in point of <hi>Worship,</hi> and also in point of
<hi>Government;</hi> and why might not <hi>R. E.</hi> as well and reasonably
have concluded that, that which was given from the mouth of the
Lord concerning all <hi>Israel,</hi> was the direction, rule and guide, and
judge, as well as the Priests and Levites, and the reason that the
people or the Church having recourse to their Ministers appointed
of God, wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, because they had the Statutes and Ordinances of
God committed unto them, which was put in the Ark of the
Covenant, and in the Tabernacle; and by the way I would ask
<hi>R. E.</hi> or any of his <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks a question, seeing he saith,
that this promise is granted and intailed unto the Church (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all limitation or condition) as to be the only infallible rule,
and that they cannot err; whether that these Priests and Levites
ever did err, yea or nay? and when was the entail cut off from
them? seeing the Scripture saith, they had violated his Law, and
broken his Covenant; and again the Prophets prophesied for hire,
and the Priests bore rule by their means, and the Judges judged
for rewardes; and as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> saith concerning Israel, <hi>They
are all gone out of the way, and there is not one that doth good, no not
one;</hi> and whether were they the rule and true guides, and judges
in this revolted estate, yea or nay? although I do not question but
they retained still their places by way of office, and would claim
the same power which they had before from God, as they stood
in the commands of God, as <hi>R. E.</hi> and his Catholicks do, and will
lay claim to the office and power the Apostles had, though they do
err from the spirit the Apostles were in; and whether their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of being directers, guiders and true judges, and infallible
rule, stood not upon this condition, as they did continue in the
Covenant of God, and kept the Precepts of God in purity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
violation, which when they did not, (as sometimes they did
not) whether were they subject to err, or whether did they err,
yea or nay? <hi>viz.</hi> the Priests and Levites, Judges, and heads of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50701:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the people which <hi>R. E.</hi> reckons for the Church; and though
Christ did exhort his Disciples to hear the Scribes and Pharisees
who sat in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair, and to observe and do those things which
they from the Law before given, read and taught, and instructed
the people in, because as I said before the Law and the Statutes
was committed to the Priests and Levites, and they to read it, and
minister unto the people, by the appointment of God; and these
Statutes and Ordinances were the rule that the then Church
ought to have observed, yet Christ exhorted the Disciples to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of their Leaven, and of their hypocrisie, and said, <hi>they said
and did not,</hi> notwithstanding all the authority which <hi>R. E.</hi> saith
they had; and further saith, would God direct them unto, and
punish with death for not obeying an authority which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, or would Christ command the doing of whatsoever
should be done by an authority that was capable of mistaking; all
which makes nothing for <hi>R. E.</hi> but rather would run him upon a
harder Rock, if this should be true or granted, for then he is bound
both to believe and justifie the Scribes and Pharisees in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they did or said, of which methinks <hi>R. E.</hi> should be ashamed
of; 'tis true they that sat in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair could not err nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
nor be capable of mistaking, as they continued to keep
unviolate the Ordinances, Statutes and rule, which was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them by the command of God, but when they disobeyed and
set up the Traditions of Men, and mingled them with the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God, and neglected the weighty matters of the Law, as Justice
and true Judgment;</hi> both they that taught, and they that were
taught, came justly under reproof; and seeing <hi>R. E.</hi> reckons that
the authority of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Scribes and Pharisees could not be
deceived nor capable of mistaking, only because they bear the
name of such an authority and office; I query of <hi>R. E.</hi> again whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Scribes and Pharisees were not mistaken, yea or nay? and
whether they were not deceived, yea or nay? and wherefore
Christ should exhort his Disciples to take heed of them, and to
beware of them, and to take heed of their Doctrine? and why
did Christ pronounce so many woes against them, notwithstanding
their sitting in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair? but in what hath been said I hope
will be sufficient to convince any, that what <hi>R. E.</hi> hath laid down
for a seeming foundation makes altogether against himself, the
premises before well considered: And as for all thy Collections
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50701:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out of the Prophets of the promise of God to his Church, <hi>Isaiah</hi>
54. and 56. and of its indowments and glory, and excellency, <hi>and
of his puting his spirit in them, and of his word in their mouthes, and
that it should not depart from the seed, nor the seeds seed for ever;</hi> this
is granted, and the promise is not to Men as Men, but to the seed
which is not many but one, but <hi>Israel</hi> was this true Church then
in the time of this Prophesie, though it have relation to future
ages also; and if <hi>R. E.</hi> looks that this promise should be to <hi>Israel</hi>
after the flesh, the Church then visible and in being, he mistakes
himself, and he egragiously errs, and contradicts the Scripture in
sundry places, which saith, your house is left unto you desolate,
their Sacrifices ceased, the Glory of God departed from them;
<hi>their Prophets prophesied a divination of their own brain, and their
visions were as visions of the night,</hi> and the Lord spake not to the
most of them, yet they said falsly thus saith the Lord, in their
revolted estate, for they were erred from the spirit and gone from
the seed, and joyned to another seed, and <hi>their holy flesh was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from them,</hi> though as men they had the same flesh still, go learn
what that means; and yet notwithstanding all this, the promise of
God was not violated, neither unfulfilled on <hi>Gods part;</hi> for the
promise was not then, neither now is to Natural Generations, or
that which is born after the flesh, or to men as men, and Creatures,
but as they are the seed, and as they are Men of God, and as they
are born again and new Creatures; and if thou will have an intai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
here it is intailed, which cannot be cut off, for the Covenant
stands not to Men in such a place that carries the name of Office or
Authority, but as they are led by the Spirit the infallible Judge,
rule or guide, as they walk by this, and in this, they cannot err,
and they erring from this, they are subject to be deceived, and to
be mistaken in all things, and every thing, of which there is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
examples in the Scriptures of truth in divers ages, of them
that professed themselves members of the Church of God, and
so visible as <hi>R. E.</hi> speaks of, yea, and the greater part too, that
have erred, and their paths hath been reckoned by the Lord as
<hi>crooked and perverse, and their Habitants full of cruelty,</hi> and this is
given for an instance, the visible Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> did err and
go aside, notwithstanding all the promise of God to them, and as
they looked that it still belonged to them, because they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
profession, though they had turned their backs upon the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50701:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord, and their hearts too, and violated his Covenant, yet still as
I said, the promise of God and the Covenant of God is not made
of none effect, nor broken on Gods part, but stands with the seed
for ever, <hi>who are circumcised in heart, and who worshipes God in
spirit and truth, and in uprightness of heart, and hath no confidence in
the flesh,</hi> nor fleshly privileges, nor external performances, but
only trusts unto the gift of Righteousness manifest in them, <hi>by
which Justification comes upon all that believes, and the fulness of the
blessing of the Gospel of Christ,</hi> and the fulness of the promise of God;
but these things I know though they be holy, faithful, and true, are
a sealed Book, and hid from all eyes living in the flesh, who hath
not been baptised into the death and suffering of Christ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That Christ by his own mouth and the mouthes of
the Apostles, did promise that there should be a Church which the
Gates of Hell should not prevail against, and this Church was
established upon the Everlasting Foundation, and the Rock of
Ages, and was indued with power from an high, and with a great
measure of the spirit of God according unto <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>promise,</hi> which
more plentifully was poured forth after Christs departure, and
after his Ascension, and great gifts were given unto them, the
<hi>word of Knowledge, the word of Wisdom, the Interpretation of Tongues,
&amp; the gift of Tongues, the gift of Prophesie, the gift of discerning Spirits,
healing the sick, working of Miracles,</hi> &amp;c. and all these foresaid
gifts were given <hi>for the work of the Ministry, for the perfecting of
the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come into the
unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, and unto a
perfect man, and to the measure and stature of the fulness of Christ,
Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. And all these were instrumental (through the
Spirit of God which was with them and in them, the only means)
to bear witness unto those things that they had learned and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and to publish the word of faith abroad unto the World: and
for all these aforesaid ends above mentioned, which though <hi>R. E.</hi>
and his Catholicks will need lay claim to the succession by way of
office, yet by their Doctrine denies in part the very end wherefore
such gifts were given, to wit the Doctrine of Purgatory, for if
they did perfect the Saints, or were brought up to the knowledge
of the Son of God, and to perfect men in Christ Jesus, and to be
without sin, what need had there been of raising up this damnable
Doctrine out of the pit, to purge from sin after they be dead, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50701:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they were to be perfect men while they were alive, and the
Ministry was given for this end; but yours it seems cannot have
these effects on this side of the Grave, and therefore they must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them in the grave, and so be Ministers in another World: And
this Church thus gathered and endued before mentioned, with
the infallible Spirit of God, if any that did sometime believe and
were joyned unto it, did walk disorderly, as not becoming the
Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, they were to be admonished
and exhorted, and if they persisted in their disorder, it was to be
told to the Church, or the whole body, and if such a one would
not hear the Church, he was to be reckoned as a Publican, or a
Heathen, and to be denyed as to have any fellowship with him till
manifest repentance was shewn, but we never read that this
Church <hi>did shed any mans blood, or burn any, or give consent to destroy
any, instance if thou can, though obstinate and Hereticks too;</hi> and in
this amongst many other things the spirit of your Church is seen
to be contrary to the Primitive Church, and you out of Christs
Doctrine; but <hi>R. E.</hi> argues further and saith, but if Christ by his
Spirit doth not preserve this Church from all possibility of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
error instead of truth; I may receive such errors as may
damn me; unto which I say, Christ by his spirit doth preserve
this Church from all possibility of teaching error, if they continue
in the guidance thereof, and err not from the Spirit of Christ as
some Churches did, which were as truly Christian, and might lay
claim unto Christs promise of preservation out of error, as ever
<hi>Rome</hi> could do, and yet fix of the Seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> were
reproved by the Spirit of Christ, some of them for holding gross
error, and some for suffering it; but where was the fault, did not
Christ perform his promise to his Church, or to these and other
particular Churches? as <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia?</hi> (yes) but there
was an erring from the spirit; but all that <hi>R. E.</hi> goes about is to
prove (which he will never be able to do) that Christ is bound by
promise to make it good to them that he hath once promised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
though they perform nothing of their part in taking heed to
his direction, and thus would limit the Lord, and let men go free
without <hi>obedience</hi> to his commands; and he cites <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
how the promise of Christ was, <hi>and lo I am always with you even to
the end of the World;</hi> but he hath done as the Devil did, when he
brought it is written, to Christ, &amp; left out half the words, so <hi>R. E.</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:50701:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath left out the <hi>Conditions</hi> on the Disciples part, and that which
was <hi>their duty, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you, &amp; then loe I am with you, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>R. E.</hi> likes not obedience
it seems unto Christs commands, and yet he will needs be a sharer
in the promise, and of the Power that was given, and bind God
unto that, and he and his Church to be loose, to do and to teach
what they will; but as to all the Scriptures he hath brought and
minced them, and cut them in peece meale; and all the Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he makes, this we acknowledge without multiplicity of words,
that whatsoever was promised to the Church of Christ, and the
Disciples of Christ; As the Church of Christ, and Disciples of
Christ, the same promise of Christ, doth belong to the Church of
Christ and Disciples of Christ in every age, and stands upon the
same condition; <hi>viz.</hi> obedience unto his will, and that they still
do teach and no other thing but what he commands them, then he
is with them according to his promise; but let not <hi>R. E.</hi> nor his
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks look if they teach things repugnant to his mind
and contrary to his will, and press upon others to believe that
which Christ hath never taught, that then the promise of God
will be so intailed to them as that they cannot err, and here the
deceit of thine and your hearts hath led you aside, and this is one
<hi>of the cuning sleights of men, and craftiness whereby you lay in wait to
deceive;</hi> and by this you have deceived many; because God hath
made such large promises unto his Church, how that they should
be led into all truth, and preserved out of error, and you are their
successors and must needs inherit this promise by way of intail,
and you cannot err, you cannot be deceived, because the Apostles
was infallible, therefore you must needs be infallible; though you
err and go aside never so much from the infallible spirit, the true
guide and judge of, and in the Church of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though you
had been born to infallibility and the spirit of truth had comed by
succession; but the inward Light which thou scoffes at, and the
spirit of truth which thou calls a private spirit often, hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
you and your spirit, though thou boast of <hi>fifteen ages</hi> that
your Doctrine hath been held by the Pastours and Teachers in
your visible Church as in the 57. page of thy Epistle; suppose I
should grant the <hi>fifteen hundred years,</hi> which I neither can nor will
but I will lead thee to the sixteen hundred years and try thee and
your Doctrine that you have held this fifteen hundred year, if it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50701:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be so as thou saith; but this thou likes not, but seeing thou pleads
antiquity let us come on and joyne issue, prove us Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in the first <hi>hundred year,</hi> nay I will give thee five hundred
more, and if I gave thee five more thou would hardly prove it;
before the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> prove us the Doctrine of Purgatory
in the first hundred year, and if thou take two, it shall not offend
me; prove us the forbiding of Ministers to marry in the first hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
year, and abstenance from Meats, as though they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
which are created by God for the use of Believers; prove
us that Man hath a twofold right to the Kingdom of Heaven, as
your great <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, the one by Christ, the other by a Mans
own works; prove us Invocation of Angels, and prayer and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for the Dead the <hi>first</hi> hundred <hi>year after Christ;</hi> prove us
their selling of Pardons in Christs and the Apostles days for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
prove us seting up of Images as to put Men in mind of the
Saints deceased, and of their Works; prove us Baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
with Cream and Spittle, and signing with the Cross, and
Godfathers and Godmothers; and let us have some example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
bare report, for we dare not relie upon your infallible spirit
in these things, therefore convince us, for we are gain-sayers, and
upon good ground, and we do look upon all these Doctrines and
many more not to be of such a great age as thou tells on, neither
to have any affinity or congruaty, with the Church of Christ in his
or the Apostles time nor sundry years after, but rather look upon
them as Doctrines of Devils, and a very novelty; a further Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>R. E.</hi> urges, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. the Church of the living God the
pillar and ground of truth;</hi> and may we not relie of that pillar that
God hath erected for us saith he, and he that hears you hears me,
and go teach all Nations, and lo I am with you always, and yet if
after all these promises if the Church may not be believed except
she teacheth according to the Scriptures, and be only infallible
but when she doth her duty, then the Church hath no more privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
then the Devil hath, for so long as he teaches conformable to
the Scripture he may be believed, and so long as he teaches truth
he may be believed saith <hi>R. E.</hi> in page the 58, 59.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Church is in God, 1 <hi>Thes. 1. and is the pillar and
ground of truth;</hi> she is in the world though not of the world; and
though the members thereof be visible in the world, yet the
world that lies in wickedness, <hi>never owned them as such,</hi> neither
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50701:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
saw the glory of this Church but always persecuted it, <hi>and was so
far from owning it as rule and judge,</hi> as it altogether gainsayed its
direction, but they that did believe in the word of life, and were
separated from the world, and hated by it, were willing to hear
the Councel and to receive the instruction of the Church of God,
and the Church only medled with their own Members as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Judgment and not of the world, further then by preaching
repentance in it; for the Apostle saith, <hi>what have we to do to judge
them that are without;</hi> and this Church as in God was secure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
upon, for she had the Oracles of God committed unto her,
and every one may relie upon this pillar if they dare trust it, which
I see <hi>R. E.</hi> dare not because he likes not to be tyed to their
Doctrine declared of in the Scriptures, but would have all to
take what they say for granted without the Scripture, or the
Apostle, example or spirit, and is not this unreasonable in thee,
that would have the Church to be believed, or that which calls it
self so by name, when she teacheth not conformable to Scriptures
and to the faith which was once delivered among the Saints, and
would thou have a Church reckoned infallible and to be believed
when she doth not her duty; the Churches privileges is in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
truth and judging righteously, and the Devil was a lyer from
the beginning and is out of the truth; and where hath thou read
that he teaches conformable to Scripture, and so may be believed,
is not the promise of God to his Disciples, <hi>as they continued
to the end,</hi> and <hi>as they kept his Commandements;</hi> and were they not
known to be the Church of God and Disciples of Christ by this,
and was not <hi>the promise to them that hungred and thirsted after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and to them that did overcome,</hi> and was not the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, hold fast that which thou hast that
none take thy Crown, Rev.</hi> 3. 11, 12. Was there not a possibility of
leting go that which they had, and of loosing the Crown, or else
why is the exhortation? But I see <hi>R. E.</hi> would lay claim to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
and privileges without all condition, and will not be tyed to
keep the commands of Christ, nor would not have the Church ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to follow the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, nor will not
admit of any <hi>possibility or probability of failing or erring,</hi> nay not so
much as a mistake; but as to infallibility and certainty I have said
enough before, and the confidence or rather the impudence of
<hi>R. E.</hi> is easily seen, and to make up all, he concludes the Apostles
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50701:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as Men were subject to error in their private affaires, yet were
they by the assistance of Gods Spirit infallible in delivering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of faith, I say as they were assisted by the holy Spirit of God
they neither erred in private affaires nor matters of faith, but as
they were not assisted by this they were subject to err, for in this
stood their only ability to teach, instruct, exhort, and judge, and
as they were guided by this Spirit, they were infallible; and so
<hi>R. E.</hi> saith that the Prelats of the holy Catholick Church as Men
they are <hi>fallible in their own private actions and affairs;</hi> yet when
they are assembled in a <hi>general Council with their supream Pastor they
are still made infallible in determining matters of Faith:</hi> It is well that
<hi>R. E.</hi> will grant that there is any possibility for their Prelats to
fail either publick or private; but I say he that is not faithful in
his own actions and affaires, can never be faithful in the Lords; but
it seems a General Council cannot fail when the supream Pastor
the <hi>Pope</hi> is there, but if he be not it seems by <hi>R. E</hi>'s discourse, it is
more doubtful: the like he also judges if the eleven Disciples and
the seventy too, with the Brethren and Elders, if they had all been
to define matters of Faith if <hi>Peter</hi> had been wanting, which this
Catholick Church calls the Prince of the Apostles, there had been
some doubt of their infallibility in point of faith; as though the
promise of God and the Spirit of God had not been with the rest
of the Apostles as well as <hi>Peter:</hi> but a word or two and more
hereafter of the infallibility of General Councils, the <hi>Nicean</hi>
Council decreed flat Idolatry about Worshipping of Images, the
Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> condemned their Proceedings, and made
void their Decrees, yet both these in <hi>R. E</hi>'s account must needs
be infallible; the Council at <hi>Basil</hi> as <hi>Albertus Phigious</hi> saith decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against all reason and against Scriptures (<hi>the Council of Calcedon</hi>)
which was one of the four that <hi>Gregory the great compares to the
four Gospels,</hi> that their Decrees were as certain and infallible; yet
<hi>Pope Leo</hi> did not stick to condemn it, and all them as unadvised;
<hi>Stephanius Bishop of Rome</hi> made void the Decrees of <hi>Formosus;</hi>
and <hi>Sabinian the Pope</hi> commanded that <hi>Pope Gregory's Mass and all
his Writings should be burned; Leo the fourth abrogated</hi> and made
void the Acts of <hi>Adrian;</hi> the <hi>Basil</hi> Council determined that the
Council of Bishops was above the <hi>Pope,</hi> but the <hi>Latterine Council
under Leo</hi> determined that the <hi>Pope was above the Council;</hi> and
they decreed also that he that should think otherwise should be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50701:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
held for a <hi>Heretick;</hi> but the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> aforesaid decreed
that they that judged that the Council was not above the <hi>Pope</hi>
they were <hi>Hereticks:</hi> Innumerable more instances I might give
but that I will not trouble my Reader with such unprofitable
stories; and all these <hi>Popes</hi> said, they were <hi>Peters</hi> Successors, and
had the keys of binding and loosing, and all these Councils and
many more which were of the <hi>Roman</hi> faith which in <hi>R.E</hi>'s account
could not err but must needs be infallible, and yet are as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
one to another as light is to darkness, and black to white,
and looks with their faces several ways like <hi>Samsons</hi> Foxes; and
therefore let not <hi>R. E.</hi> nor none of his Catholicks think that the
Church of Christ now coming out of the Wilderness again, can
receive all their contradictory Decrees, and invented fopperies
and constitutions of Men for infallible: the day is broken, the light
hath taken hold of the ends of the Earth, the Sun is risen which
shall make all the foggy mists of darkness and clouds of ignorance
to fly away.</p>
            <p>But <hi>R. E.</hi> ceases not here, but heapes up one peece of darkness
upon another till blackness of darkness appear, and he tells of a
visible Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. which is builded upon <hi>Peter</hi> that visible
Rock, for that Rock there spoken of is not Christ, saith he, but
<hi>Peter,</hi> for immediately after he names <hi>Peter,</hi> whereas saith he, if
he had meaned himself or <hi>Peters</hi> confession, for that saith he is too
remote or mediate and anticedent, for if Christ had meaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
or <hi>Peters</hi> confession, he should have spoken according to the
Grammer Rule and Construction, <hi>Vpon that Rock, or upon this
Rock I have build, I do build, and not I will build,</hi> in the 63. page
and in the 64. page, he tells of a Church visible having two heads
of an <hi>Independent Head,</hi> and a <hi>Dependent Head;</hi> and in the 66. page
he saith, he hopes that it will appear clear to all, as it did to him,
that the visible Church is that Rule and Judge appointed by
God, and all upon pain of damnation are to submit unto it.</p>
            <p>Where <hi>R. E.</hi> hath read of a visible Church with two heads I
know not, and to take it for infallible I intend not; and where is
<hi>Peter</hi> called a visible Rock, and the chief Pastor among the Apostles;
doth not this contradict Scripture, doth not Christ say, <hi>the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
exercise Dominion one over another, but it shall not be so amongest
you, he that will be greatest among you let him be your servant, and he
that will be chief let him be your Minister;</hi> and as for thy visible and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50701:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
militant Church we read no such words in the Scriptures of
truth, we read of a Church of God and of the first born, whereof
<hi>Christ was the Rock and the foundation, and another foundation can
no man lay then that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 11. and
<hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 10. <hi>ver, as a wise master builder I have laid the
foundation.</hi> I hope <hi>R. E.</hi> will not be so impudent as to say he had
laid <hi>Peter</hi> or that he had preached up <hi>Peter</hi> to believe in for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins, nor for the foundation of faith, for that had been
contrary to the Apostles commission and their Doctrine; for saith
the Apostle, <hi>We have not preached our selves but Christ the Lord, and
our selves your servants for his sake.</hi> And I may say to thee <hi>R. E.</hi> as
<hi>Paul</hi> said to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> when they were striving about Men,
1 <hi>Cor. 3. 21. therefore let no man glory in men, for all things are yours;</hi>
or as he saith in the 1 <hi>chap. 13. ver. was Paul crucified for you, or were
you baptised in the name of Paul;</hi> were they not carnal that so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
was <hi>Peter</hi> crucified for us, or were we baptised in the name
of <hi>Peter,</hi> is not your visible Church carnal who thus judges that
Christ intended <hi>Peter</hi> to be the foundation of his Church, for
what was he or the rest of the Apostles, <hi>but Ministers by which many
believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and if thou had been present, it is very like would have
instructed Christ what to have said, and bidden him have spoken
after the Grammer Rule and Construction upon that Rock I will
build my Church; for <hi>Peters</hi> faith in Christ is to mediate it seems,
and his confession too remote and anticedent, to be the <hi>Rock</hi> meant
in the 16. of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> must be imediate, and
the Rock upon which Christ hath, doth, and will build his Church,
but as imediate as he was, and a sure a Rock as he was, when he
began to rebuke Christ he turned him about <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and said unto
<hi>Peter, Get the behind me Satan thou art an offence unto me, for thou
savours not the things of God;</hi> and so say I to <hi>R. E.</hi> and his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
they savour not the things of God, but it is thy <hi>private spirit</hi>
and your own Interpretations and not the mind of Christ, and
how far anticedent is <hi>Peter's Confession</hi> of Christ the Son of the
Living God, is it not in the 16. <hi>ver.</hi> and wherein was <hi>Peter</hi>
blessed but in this, that it was revealed to him that Christ was the
<hi>Son of the Living God, the Rock of Ages, and the foundation of his
Church;</hi> and as for thy visible Church with its two heads, <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
head,</hi> and <hi>dependent head,</hi> which sure must have two bodies
where they can be found, but that I shall leave to <hi>R. E.</hi> and I hope
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50701:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the grounds that thou hast here laid which did appear so
clear to thee, that none will be afraid not judge, that such a visible
Church with two heads is to be rule and guide to all to whom all
is to submit under pain of Damnation, which is to have <hi>Peter</hi> for
its Rock, which if he had been living he would have denyed you
all, as seters up of Men and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leighters of Jesus Christ the Rock of
Ages, the Foundation of the Church, the Head of the Body, the
Rule of Life, the Judge of quick and the dead, the Law-giver,
directer, instructer, and preserver of his Church for ever; but
<hi>R. E.</hi> goes on and saith, it only remains that we consider which
among all these congregations now on Earth, which pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be this Church of Christ, for having once found her and
knowing that she is so assisted with the Holy Ghost that she cannot
teach us an error, we shall no more dispute the verity of her Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,
then we would have questioned the Articles of Faith taught
by the holy Apostles or the words of Christ himself, wherefore if
this Church this infallible guide shall teach us that Infants ought
to be Baptised, and that it is as lawful to desire the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to pray for us as to desire the Prayers of them that are alive,
and that the body of Christ our Saviour is really and truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the Sacrament of the Alter, or any other article of Faith
we shall no more doubt it, then the first Christians did the verity
of what the Apostles taught them.</p>
            <p>Among all those Congregations on Earth that looks upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be this <hi>Church and spouse of Christ,</hi> there is one if thy eye
could behold, or if thou could discern it, but before thou can,
there is an eye in thee must be put out, and there is a wisdom in
thee that must be confounded and turned into foolishness, before
thou can discern it in its glory as it is, but however <hi>that is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
which is begotten into the faith through the publication of
the immortal word of Life, &amp; who are translated from death unto life, &amp;
who have received the power and spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
meets in his name and power, and doth witness his presence among them,
and have received a measure of that infallible Spirit of truth which
leadeth into all truth, and out of the pollutions of the World, and are
dead unto the World, and baptised into the sufferings of Christ, and are
crucified with him, who keep unviolated his Statutes and commands,
without adding to or diminishing from, who walk in the order of the
Gospel, and are not conformable to the world, nor to that which fallen
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50701:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men sets up, but to the power of God which worketh in the hearts of all
that believe, to the framing of them a meet habitation for God to dwel in,
and abideth in the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, and are sayers
and doers, speakes the truth and doth the truth, and holds the truth in
Righteousness, and the faith once delivered to the Saints in a pure heart,
and a pure Conscience, who prayes in the spirit, and with understanding,
who publisheth the truth, and declares it in the spirit reaching to the
Consciences, and to the witness of God in all that hears, who rejoyce
only in Christ Jesus the great power of God, and the wisdom of God,
and hath no confidence in the flesh, nor fleshly performances, whose faith
stands not in words but in the mighty power of God, which she hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
according unto the promise of God, this Congregation or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
which is one, and doth hold the one head by which all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ are knit together in the one faith, by which they overcome
the world; this undoubtedly is the Church of Christ and the spouse of
Christ.</hi> But whether <hi>R. E.</hi> will not dispute against the verity of
her Doctrine I question; notwithstanding all his submission in
words, and if this Church should teach that Infants are to be
baptised with Cream and Spittle, and signed with the Cross as
absolutely necessary to Salvation, or that it is the duty of the
Saints alive, to pray to the Saints departed this world, or to teach
that Christs body which was broken for us and hanged upon the
tree at <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> that this should now be in a <hi>morsel of bread
and a sup of wine,</hi> and conveyed thither by the Priest, and this to
be really the body of Christ, if this Church should teach any such
Doctrine there were good and weighty reason to question, seeing
that <hi>R. E.</hi> before hath said that they cannot be infallible who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
one another and teach two contrary Doctrines, and yet
say, they are both infallibly directed so to teach, I hope <hi>R. E.</hi> will
grant that the <hi>Church in Christs time and the Apostles was infallible,</hi>
and it taught no such Doctrine, but to the contrary, therefore
that Church which pretends infallibility, and yet teacheth such
Doctrines as before mentioned contrary unto <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
cannot be infallible, neither led by the <hi>infallible Spirit,</hi> and
all hath good reason to question the verity of these things, more
then what the Apostles taught, seeing they are contradictory to
<hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> teaching, and contrary to Scripture, and
contrary to the witness of God in all Consciences, and as I said
before, this Church of God whereof I have spoken now, though
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50701:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not denominated by any other name then the <hi>Church of God,</hi> is
and hath been assisted so by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as she hath not erred,
when she <hi>only hearkened to its instruction and direction;</hi> but when
the wisdom of the flesh, and the worldly part and <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</hi>
and <hi>Policies,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> have been minded more then
the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> then error hath been taught, and the greater
part in a Council have overswayed the rest, and established <hi>error
by decree,</hi> and hath enjoyned it under penalties to be received as
<hi>sacred and holy, and infallible,</hi> of which we find the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> exceeding guilty, and therefore do conclude notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the promise of God to his Church that kept in Covenant
with him, that this Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have erred and do err, both
in <hi>faith, doctrine,</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>infallible Church</hi> in the <hi>Apostles
days;</hi> and therefore their Doctrine is more to be questioned then
the Apostles, and they not fit to be this rule and guide, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recter;
unto which <hi>R. E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> saith, all is to submit under pain of
Damnation; Scar-Crows will hardly affright men of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but unreasonable Creatures it may. And last of all <hi>R. E.</hi> he
saith, he will conclude his whole proof with an argument from
Heaven, and of the highest nature, and makes it evident that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church must be this guide and judge, which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
because of the gift of Miracles; and cites the 15. of
<hi>John</hi> and 24. If I had not done among them the works that no
other man did they had not had sin, and now, I say, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church hath done works and Miracles such as no other
Church hath done, therefore if we refuse to believe her we shall
have sin and shew our selves haters of God; and he instances St.
<hi>Ber.</hi> St. <hi>Mal.</hi> St. <hi>Dom.</hi> St. <hi>Fra.</hi> which wrought Miracles; and of
<hi>Austin</hi> the Monk which taught Christian Faith first in <hi>England,</hi> and
his fellow Monkes which was then confirmed by wonderful Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
from Heaven, not in confirmation of those points and articles
of faith which you hold with us but of those which you call Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
and superstitious, as the Sacrifice of the Mass, and about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and veneration which is given to Saints Relicks and Images,
and about the Doctrine of Purgatory, and payment of Tythes, and
<hi>R. E.</hi> concludes if we will not believe what you have not seen,
you destroy faith which is an evidence of things not seen.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>R. E.</hi> make a great boast of the Miracles of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which no other Church hath wrought the like,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50701:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and therefore concludes that the is this rule and guide, unto which
all is to give ear unto, under pain of Damnation; and these Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
he saith is argument from Heaven, and proof of the <hi>highest
nature, believe him who can;</hi> if time would but permit, and the
Reader have patience to read most or many, if not all the Miracles
he so much crys up might be declared to his and their shame the
very report and relation thereof cannot but be reckoned as fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and fained stories, and proceeds from that lying spirit which
was in the <hi>false prophet which wrought Miracles before the Beast, and
deceived them that had received the mark of the Beast, and them that
worshipped his Image which must be taken alive and cast into the lake of
fire, Revelation 19. 20. It is an a dulterous Generation that
seeks a signe.</hi> And yet did not believe when they had Miracles
wrought by the <hi>finger of God amongst them,</hi> yet they said it was by
<hi>Belzebub;</hi> the Scribes and Pharisees said, if he be the <hi>King of
Israel</hi> let him come down from the <hi>Cross and we will believe;</hi> but
the power of Christ was not to be shewed at the blind will of the
Pharisees, neither would they have believed if he had come down,
though Miracles have been wrought by the power of God, and
is according to his Heavenly will, and is not limited either to
men, time or place, yet it is not so sufficient an argument from
Heaven as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> this true
Church, <hi>seeing that the Devil and Satan, and Antichrist shall come
with signes and lying wonders, and if it were possible deceive the elect;
and Janes and Jambres withstood Moses in working lying Miracles
before Pharoah to the hardning of his heart: and</hi> Chrysistome <hi>in his
Hom, upon Mat. 49. saith in the end of time power shall be given to the
Devil to work signes and Miracles;</hi> so that the Ministers of Christs
cannot be known by working of Miracles, but by working none
at all: and <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, though some said Prayers at the Tombs
of the Dead and obtained their desires as they said, saith, <hi>away
with these things, they be either juglings and mockeries of deceitful
men, or else delusions of lying spirits,</hi> Chrys. <hi>in his Hom. upon Matth.
49. in old times it was known by Miracle who were the true Christians,
and who the false;</hi> but now Miracles is rather among them that
are false Christians, and as for your great Miracles which thou
saith the Chronologies and Histories speak of <hi>J. L.</hi> as <hi>Bed.</hi> and <hi>Holm,
Sheads, Stows,</hi> and others, we look upon them not at all as Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
in this thing, seeing they have had the reports from other
hands and Pens of certain Monkish stories which they have found

upon record to deceive poor people withal for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and most of the Miracles that we hear of, is either
wrought about your Tombes and Sepulchres, and your holy Mass,
and your Relicks and Images; I have heard of indeed how that
from the skirt of an Image of yours, one in a <hi>Bloody Flux</hi> did but
touch, and immediately vertue came from it, and water and blood
issued forth, wherby the party was made whole by washing therin;
also I have heard of the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> first honored by
Christians in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> afterwards translated into <hi>Slavonia,</hi> &amp; when
Images began to be villified there and disesteemed, it removed it
self from place to place, as discontent did arise in it, it seems at
the place and people where it was situated sometimes, and at last
it removed <hi>a whole Island with it nearer Rome,</hi> now call'd <hi>Lorreta,</hi>
and commonly known by the name of our Lady of <hi>Laretta,</hi> to
which all the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> commonly and frequently go
to confess their sins, and to receive <hi>Absolutions</hi> before they came
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and so continues to this day. I cannot forget indeed the
notable Miracle wrought by <hi>Austin the Monk</hi> of which <hi>R. E.</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
so in, wrought at <hi>Cometon</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> touching the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of due payment of Tythes, a profitable Doctrine to <hi>Austin</hi>
and his <hi>Monks,</hi> the first <hi>Bishop of Canterhury</hi> confirmed by a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and such as it is you shall have it; About the year 600. as it
is said, <hi>Austin</hi> comes to preach at <hi>Cometon in Oxfordshire, the Priest
of the place complains to him, how that the Lord of the Manner would
not pay his Tythes;</hi> Austin <hi>questioning the Lord about the fault in his
Devotion; be stoutly answered, that the tenth sheaf doubtless was his,
that had the Intrest in the 9th. and therefore would pay none: presently</hi>
Austin <hi>denounces him excommunicate, and turning to the Alter to say
Mass publickly, forbad that any excommunicated person should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
there; suddenly a dead Corps that had been buried at Church door
arose, and went out of the Church, and stood while the Mass continued;
which ended,</hi> Austin <hi>comes to this living or dead whether you will, and
charges him in the name of God to declare who he was, he tells him,
that in the time of the Brittish state,</hi> hujus villi Patteronus; <hi>and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had often urged by the Doctrine of the Priest to pay his Tythes
yet he never could be brought to it, for the which after be was dead he
saith, was carried to Hell:</hi> Austin <hi>desired to know where the Priest that
excommunicated him was baried? this dead shewed him the place,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50701:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where he makes an Invocation of the dead Priest, and bids him arise,
because they wanted his help, the Priest rises;</hi> Austin <hi>asks him if he
knew that other that was risen? he tells him yes, but wishes he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known him; for saith he, he was in all things ever adverse to the
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hurch, and a detainer of his Tythes, a great sinner to his death, and
therefore I excommunicated him: But</hi> Austin <hi>declares that it was fit
mercy should be used towards him, and that he had suffered long in Hell
for his offence;</hi> you must suppose the Author meant Purgatory:
<hi>wherefore he gives him an Absolution, &amp; sends him to his grave; where
he fell again to dust and ashes; he gone, the Prist new risen tells that
his Corpes had lyen there about 170. years, and</hi> Austin <hi>would gladly
have had him to have continued on earth again, for instruction of souls,
but could not thereto intreat him; so he also returns to his former lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:
the Lord of the Town standing by all this while, and trembling,
was now demanded if he would pay his Tythes, but he presently fell
down at</hi> Austin's <hi>feet weeping and confessing his offence and submits to
pay Tythes, and receives pardon, and became all his life time a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Austin.</hi> Besides the common Legend of our Saints it is in
some Volumes put alone for a most observable Miracle, and it is
found to be bound up at the end of the M<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>Life of Tho. Becket,
Arch-Bishop of Canterbury,</hi> written by <hi>John Degrandesono,</hi> and it
<hi>remains in the pvblick Library of Oxford; there also it is related in
Johannes Anglicus his History Aurea, besides Selden in his History of
Tythes makes mention of it, and in the 274. page of his Book.</hi> And
as concerning the Miracles which is reported by certain <hi>Jesuits,</hi>
which was done in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> by them of that Society, after
they had converted to the Christian faith as they <hi>call it,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their Doctrine, they write of great Miracles that was
wrought by them, how that with <hi>holy water they had calmed the
Sea in great tempests;</hi> and with holy water they had driven <hi>Mice
out of the Country;</hi> and how that by holy water they had made
<hi>barren Women</hi> to bear Children: See <hi>Copes Dialogve</hi> the first,
<hi>page the</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>And many devised and fained Miracles is storied among you, and
kept up to deceive and blind the people withal; dead <hi>Images</hi> have
been forced to <hi>sweat,</hi> to <hi>weep,</hi> to <hi>laugh,</hi> and to <hi>shift</hi> themselves
from <hi>place</hi> to <hi>place;</hi> and as among the <hi>Pamins</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> was able by art to <hi>cry aloud let all Christians be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Country, Euseb. lib.</hi> 8. Even so among the false Christians,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50701:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Images have been able to speak whatsoever his Keeper or <hi>Sexton
listeth;</hi> and the Image of our <hi>Lady</hi> hath been able to <hi>attend her
own Candle,</hi> and other Images hath been able to <hi>heal all Diseases;</hi>
believe it who can. <hi>Nicholaus</hi> saith, in the Church of God the
Priests often times deceive the people with fained <hi>Miracles</hi> for
Lucres sake; and thus the World hath been borne in hand, that
Images were not only bare Images but had some secret devine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
hidden within them; but I shall conclude and say as <hi>Hirome</hi>
saith, <hi>the truth of Christ shall devour and consume the falshood of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
and all his fained Miracles and lying wonders, and inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and sorceries.</hi> with which he hath deceived the Nations:
<hi>Alexander Hales</hi> saith, <hi>p. 4. qua. 53. men, the</hi> 4. in the Sacrament it
self there appears <hi>flesh, sometime by the conveyance of men, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
by the working of the Devil.</hi> And hath not <hi>R. E.</hi> heard or read
of a certain <hi>Catholick</hi> of theirs, and no <hi>Lay-man</hi> neither, not many
ages ago that did <hi>penance at Pauls Cross,</hi> and made a publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his <hi>dissimulation,</hi> when he pricked his finger and made it
<hi>bleed</hi> when he gave that which youcall your <hi>Eucharist</hi> (or sacrament
of the Alter as you call it) unto the people to <hi>delude</hi> them, making
them believe that as the phrase is, Christ by <hi>Miracle</hi> had conveyed
his <hi>blood</hi> into the bread after the words of Consecration; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of this hath been said by others, and written largly of by
other hands and pens, so that I need not say much: But <hi>Miracles</hi>
be not evermore undoubted proofes of a true Doctrine, nor such
absolute signes of a true Church, nor such infallible arguments as
from <hi>Heaven</hi> as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith his is; and so I shall conclude with that
which <hi>Austin</hi> said unto <hi>Faustus</hi> the <hi>Manicha, Ye work no Miracles,
and yet if ye wrought any at your hands, we would take heed of them;
and</hi> Jer. 23. <hi>saith, the false Prophets have deceived my people by their
lies, and by their lightness, and by their dreams and Miracles.</hi> And so
hath this false fained pretended Catholick Church done, deceived
The Nations, and bewitched them with such lying fabulous stories,
and false and ridiculous miracles, and sorceries, and inchantments,
as is above mentioned, and many more of the like nature might
be mentioned, but that I would not be tedious to the Reader,
which if they were summed up all would hardly make up a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
argument and proof, as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith it doth; that their
Church is the only true Church, and fit to be the rule and judge
of all matters of faith; and now Reader view over their Miracles
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50701:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before mentioned, and see if thou can receive them, because the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> saith they are true, and must not be questioned,
for if thou do, thou art like to come under a hard censure by the
verdict of <hi>R. E.</hi> and his Catholick Church; first to be reckoned
as an <hi>unbeliever,</hi> secondly to be a <hi>hater of God,</hi> and thirdly in not
believing these Miracles, or whatsoever else shall be declared unto
thee by the said Church, or else thou comes under no les penalty
then <hi>eternal damnation;</hi> as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith in the 80. page of his Epistle:
but it is a small thing to be judged by man, and especially such a
man, who hath gaded abroad and changed his way so osft, so that
he hath forgotten the true path of Righteousness to walk in, or
else never knew it, and hath turned and wheeled about; and now
at last doth as the poor <hi>Indian</hi> doth with his Deer skin, hangs it
upon one shoulder and so upon the other shoulder to shelter him
from the wind and tempest that comes of that side: But the day
is dawned, and mens spirits are discovered beyond their words,
and all the turnings and wheelings of things upside down, is but
as the Potters Clay, for God measures every man, not by his
words but by his heart and spirit, and works, and will judge every
one in Righteousness according to their deeds.</p>
            <p>And <hi>R. E.</hi> goes on as confident that his arguments and reasons
laid down hath prevailed, and almost takes it for granted that it
must needs be evident to all, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the true
Church; and saith, he knows but one single point between the
Catholicks and them that stand devided from them, and that is,
saith he, that we follow a several rule, to guide and judge in the
great affaires of faith, for all sides are bound to believe all truths,
sufficiently propounded to them, to be revealed of God; and
therefore if the presence of Christ in the Sacrament, Purgatory,
worshipping of Images, Invocation of Saints, and prayer to the
Dead, and for the Dead, if these or any other point of faith be
sufficiently propounded, by denying them Gods varassaty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
and God thereby made a lyer. The difference stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
you and them that are devided from you, in more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
then thou art aware of, or ever will be able sufficiently to
propound them to be revealed of God, though it is true some are
but devided from you in Circumstantials and Ceremonies, and
some others in some points of Faith and Worship, yet some deny
you in the very ground; though 'tis true the different rule by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50701:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which each party are directed is a great and a main thing; thou
saith this Church Catholick is the rule; but I say, and am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
that Christ is the way to the Father, and the way to the
Kingdom, and the rule and means by which his Church is govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and he is the Lawgiver and the judge, and all Judgment is
committed to the Son, and it is he alone that <hi>propounds truth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently;</hi>
and they that are in him are <hi>new Creatures;</hi> and that
which is the <hi>new Creatures rule, guide and judge,</hi> is the <hi>rule, guide
and judge</hi> of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and Christ is the <hi>author of faith,</hi>
and it is nothing that availes any thing with God, but the <hi>new
Creature;</hi> and <hi>as many as walk according to this rule, peace is to them,
Gal.</hi> 3. 16. and Christ hath not left his people without guide, for
he said, <hi>lo I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> So as to commit
the guidance thereof to fallible men, who may assume authority
without his power, and to fasten those things upon God as to be
revealed from him, when the Lord hath spoken nothing; and we
are so far from looking that the main grounds that thou lays down
to prove your Church to be this rule and guide, and the many
Doctrines propounded by you are not <hi>sufficiently propounded</hi> to
be revealed of God, but rather they are the imaginations of your
own brain, and things packt up since the Apostles days by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Popes,</hi> and different <hi>mutations</hi> and <hi>alterations</hi> in your Church,
for filthy <hi>Lucres</hi> sake; and so to deny them is not to deny Gods
<hi>varassaty,</hi> neither to make God a lyer as thou falsly saith; but
thou and you are the lyers, as to propound those things to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from God and to be received by all under pain of <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
when God hath revealed no such thing, but the contrary, and
so thy own words at last shall turn to be thy burden, because thou
saith, the Lord saith, and hath <hi>revealed and sufficiently preposed,</hi> the
real presence of Christ in your Sacrament of the Alter as a devine
Revelation, worshipping of Images, Prayer to the Dead, and
for the Dead, and all the foolish imagination which you have
brought in, and intruded and thrust upon people by force; and
these are <hi>sufficiently propounded</hi> as thou saith, as <hi>devine Revelations,</hi>
and the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the Incarnation of Christ;
silence deceit, and for shame blush so to say, the <hi>Prophets</hi> who
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost and prophesied of
things to come, they declared of the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
all,</hi> and prophesied long before that <hi>a Virgin should bring forth a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50701:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Son, whose name should be called</hi> Emanuel, <hi>God with us, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
should be upon his shoulders:</hi> this the <hi>Pope</hi> hath usurped,
and you put it upon his <hi>Shoulders;</hi> but your invented Doctrines
aforesaid are meerly the imaginations of your own brain, which
neither the <hi>Prophets</hi> nor <hi>Apostles</hi> bore witness unto but against, and
therefore it is thy and your great presumption, to make <hi>God,
Christ</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> the foundation of all this <hi>rubbish, straw,</hi> and
<hi>stuble,</hi> which thou would put off as <hi>devine revelation and as suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
preposed</hi> as the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> was; nay
blush for shame; they brought in the <hi>Prophets</hi> for the peoples
sake, to prove that they had testified of the same before, and had
declared the coming of the <hi>just one;</hi> besides they commended
themselves to the witness of God <hi>in every mans conscience;</hi> and
upon waiting upon the Lord and in the measure of his spirit, they
found the things <hi>even so,</hi> and by searching the Scripture as the
<hi>Bareans</hi> did, and found the things even so as had been declared of,
but upon due consideration we find not these <hi>foresaid Doctrines</hi> so
propounded as to have the Testimony of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi>
neither doth your Doctrine and worship answer the <hi>Witness</hi> of
God in every Man's <hi>Conscience,</hi> and so to deny you is not to make
God a <hi>lyer,</hi> but <hi>God true, the Prophets and Apostles, and the witness
of God true,</hi> (and you lyers) who contradicts them and their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and the power of God, and would assume it to your selves,
though you be erred from the spirit and would put all under the
name of infallibility, and by such heavenly arguments as <hi>R. E.</hi> calls
them, to wit, the Miracles aforesaid, by which you have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Nations, and blinded the eyes of the people; but the
time is come, and Light and Life is broken forth that the skirts of
the <hi>Whore</hi> must be discovered, and her <hi>nakedness</hi> must appear, and
her <hi>fornications</hi> and <hi>adulteries</hi> shall be manifest unto all so that you
shall not proceed much further: And I hope by this time in
<hi>R. E</hi>'s words it will appear evident to all, whose eyes God in any
measure hath opened that this <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (so called) is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in what hath been said to <hi>R. E.</hi> not to be the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi>
neither their Doctrines and practice <hi>devinely propounded,</hi> neither
she taken from henceforth as the only <hi>infallible judge,</hi> rule and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recter
in all matters of <hi>faith,</hi> which all are to receive upon pain
of <hi>damnation,</hi> as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith; though she sit as a <hi>Queen,</hi> and hath
known no sorrow; but on the contrary she to be a <hi>blind guide</hi> that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50701:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath <hi>bewitched</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth, and the <hi>Nations</hi> (which are
<hi>waters,</hi> which is the universality <hi>R.E.</hi> boasts of) with her <hi>inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and <hi>sorceries,</hi> which from henceforth shall not be taken as
<hi>infallible</hi> but <hi>fallible;</hi> and as that Church that hath not conveyed
the true faith which was once delivered to the <hi>Saints,</hi> but rather
hath spread abroad <hi>error</hi> and false <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>traditions</hi> and
<hi>inventions</hi> of Men, instead of the Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> and would
put off all this under the name of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>power</hi> from God,
and <hi>sufficiently propounded,</hi> and infallibility, and under the penalty
of the highest curse upon not receiving it; but the Sun is risen
which hath discovered all your deceit; lay down your carnal wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<hi>Cain</hi>'s weapons, and your <hi>humane</hi> power by which you have
prevailed, more by force and cruelty upon the Nations, then by
found Doctrine, or that plea of being <hi>Peters</hi> successors: I say,
come forth with your spiritual weapons, which the Church of
God had in the Primitive times, and prevail as far as you can, but
oh you want these, and therefore you are necessitated to take up
force and violence, the <hi>Dragons</hi> power to compell all to come to
your Church.</p>
            <p>Further <hi>R. E.</hi> in his Postscript hath been confident of what he
hath declared, that it is of such force what he hath said for the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church so called, that he believes what he hath
said cannot be answered; and he saith, his confidence doth not
<hi>misbecome him,</hi> and that it is improbable to be answered, and
that he hath not yet done his <hi>All;</hi> neither in his first nor second
Edition, but hath somewhat more yet of great moment to speak
as to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> this only and infallible guide.</p>
            <p>Unto whom I say it had been good not to have boasted when
he put on his armor, but when he puts it off, and methinks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been so unstable and unsetled as he hath been formerly, he
should not have been so confident in opposition to Wisdom, as to
give such a challenge and make such a vapour of, as that it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable</hi>
to be answered, and it is more then <hi>any of you or all of you</hi>
can answer, as his own words are, (page the 89.) these words are
not becoming a man indeed, who saith, he hath learned meekness
and <hi>humility of heart,</hi> and hath such great bowels of Charity, as
he professeth he hath; page the 86. The substance of what he
hath said or written, which he reckons so profound and unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and to be more then any or all the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> can answer,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50701:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they have been answered over, and over again, before <hi>R. E.</hi> was
born, by many Learned, sufficient, and good Men; whose Reasons
and weighty Arguments about the Premisses have not been made
void unto this day, but hath prevailed with many, not only to
the <hi>convincing,</hi> but also to the <hi>turning</hi> of many from that usurped
Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and hath discovered the errors,
false Doctrine, and evil practices, notwithstanding their pretended
infallibility, which <hi>R. E.</hi> will not be able to answer if particulars
should be descended unto; and though <hi>R. E.</hi> may reckon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that he hath laid down, which he hath the most what taken at
the gainest, and reckon them as impregnable, yet I hope they will
not appear so to an understanding eye which is enlightened by the
spirit of the Lord, nor to them who are of a sound Judgment;
what others have done to answer his bold Challenge I know not,
because I am shut up in a corner for the Testimony of Jesus, and
for the word of God: but methinks them that are concerned
should not let such boasts go unreproved, neither such false
Doctrine nor false suggestions as <hi>R. E.</hi> hath made, to villifie and
debase and set at nought all things, and every thing, that seems
contrary unto the judgment of this pretended Catholick Church;
and seeing that he shuts out all <hi>Nonconformists</hi> as to be Members of
the Church of God, and to be without all <hi>Rule,</hi> all <hi>Order,</hi> all <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and to come under the great penalty of <hi>damnation,</hi> by
not submitting unto whatsoever this pretended Catholick
Church doth impose, how repugnant soever it be unto the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of Christ, and how contrary soever it be unto the <hi>Spirit of
God,</hi> yet all must be received without question, though it be that
which the Spirit of God sometimes called the Doctrine of Devils,
but now it must become <hi>holy,</hi> and of <hi>divine authority, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
propounded and so received;</hi> because as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith, this Church
cannot err; I say unto him and unto all men, and to the witness
of God in every man, either the Church in the Apostles days did
<hi>err and teach false Doctrine,</hi> or this pretended Catholick Church,
because they teach contrary one to the other, and do walk by a
contrary <hi>rule;</hi> and as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith, infallibility cannot contradict it
self; and he hath granted that the Apostles and Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had an <hi>infallible spirit,</hi> and did not err; then let <hi>R. E.</hi> and all,
take a view of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, and compare it with theirs
and they shall find it as far wide one from the other as the <hi>Heavens</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50701:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is from <hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>light</hi> from <hi>darkness,</hi> so that for the truths sake,
and for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>faith sake</hi> that was once delivered among
the <hi>Saints,</hi> and for the <hi>Nonconformists sake</hi> who cannot bow, their
knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> neither snbmit to the injunctions of changable men,
instead of the Doctrines of Christ. I could not do less then give
Answer unto the substance of <hi>R. E.</hi> his Epistle which he boasted
of, to be more then any could answer, and to reprove his false
Doctrine and error, which he would perswade all unto, and not
to question, because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath propounded it as
infallible; most of all those Doctrines are denyed, and I cannot
but give my Testimony against them as to be false, and that which
leads people into <hi>error;</hi> and let <hi>R. E.</hi> when he brings forth his <hi>all,</hi>
prove to us, that <hi>Infallibility as intailed to the Pope by succession,</hi> and,
Prayer for the Dead, worshipping of Angels, worshipping Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts,
worshipping Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatory,</hi> sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Infants; prove to us from the Scripture in thy next, that
these were <hi>Apostolical</hi> and <hi>Infallible Doctrines,</hi> delivered and taught
by the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> in the <hi>Apostles time,</hi> or in the first <hi>hundred
years</hi> after Christ, and thou will not only gain me, but many more
to receive and imbrace the Catholick Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
rule and guide, unto which all on earth ought to be subject
unto, which if thou do not, we will take it for granted; thou
dare not, least thou ingage thy self in such a Controversie as thou
never ingaged in yet, by which thy and your folly will more and
more appear unto all; I shall not trouble neither my self nor the
Reader any further in traducing <hi>R. E.</hi> in his multiplicity of
words, although the main and weighty Arguments and reasons as
<hi>R. E.</hi> looks upon them is answered, which I commend unto thee,
and to the witness of God in every Man's Conscience, to try and
search out, where the difference and weight lies, and the truth,
and as the measure of Gods Spirit in every Man's Conscience
doth close with or against, if it can what I have said about <hi>R. E.</hi>
his Epistle, for unto that I dare stand to the judgment of and in it,
as every one believes and walks, I bid my Reader, Farewell.</p>
