            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN this happy retrayt of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
banishment from the world,
(which by Gods goodnesse I have
made choice of) one principall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
of my thoughts is not to think
of the world; yet this cannot justifie
nor excuse me, if I should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or be willing to forget such a
Person, as you, and one to whom I
have so great obligations. Indeed
I should not comply with this my Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
if I did not oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you. To think of you, to
write to you, or converse with you,
are not worldly businesses: they may
become, and cannot but be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
even in matter of spirit, to
the most abstracted persons: for
<pb facs="tcp:46209:3"/>
what will such an object represent
to them, but a true esteem of heaven,
gracefully set off by an heroicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of earth; and this exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the best advantage by one, who
in the middest of the greatest afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all worldly contentments, in
the strength of his age, and vigor of
capacity, when he was most disposed
and inabled to tast whatever was
gustfull in them, yet had the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
courage to despise and renounce
them: And which is more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
one that still maintains a fearles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their skill to recall his liking
of them; since out of pure charity
to God, and his distressed servants,
he dares yet live in sight of them, a
stranger to them; one that (with
himself) consecrates all his own
riches to God, and onely interesses
himself in the wealth of others, to
the end that he may procure supplies
for those that want, and to inrich
those, who by supplying such wants,
<pb facs="tcp:46209:3"/>
can be perswaded to purchase eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall treasures?</p>
            <p>To you, <hi>SIR,</hi> therfore I addresse my
self, willing to take any, even this
poor occasion, by a very mean Present
to testifie to the world my cordial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
esteem of you &amp; my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
acknowledgment of your great
goodnesse and charity towards me,
expressed by a considerable pension,
without any intercession of friends,
voluntarily offered, and out of your
own prison and straitnesse freely
sent me immediately after my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
though a meer stranger to
you, yet sufficiently recommended by
relinquishing of Friends, Estate, and
Country, for that Religion's sake,
which before had made the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
over you: And since expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by many testimonies of your
friendly benignity and confidence.</p>
            <p>I take leave therefore to present
unto you this <hi>Book,</hi> as it is now a
second time published. The subject
<pb facs="tcp:46209:4"/>
of it is the story of my uncertainties
and wandrings; and in conclusion,
my fix'd establishment in the same
solid foundation of Truth with you,
which gained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e first the happinesse
of your affection. And I pretend in
this second publication to a further
entrance into the same affection,
not for any worth of the Treatise,
but onely for the testimony that I, of
mine own accord, give publikely of
my declining, to consider mine own
fame or esteem with men, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that respects, though only the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of divine Truth; Since
the ground why I renew the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is to signifie, that I detest to
maintain, with a perverse constancy,
even the smallest phrases or words,
which I could suspect might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to offence or misconstruction.</p>
            <p>I cannot call it a Book of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
though the essentiall points
of <hi>Catholike Religion</hi> be asserted
in it: or if of Controversies, it is
<pb facs="tcp:46209:4"/>
principally against those that unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
multiply them.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever it is, a poor Present it
is, God knowes; and yet even in that
respect lesse unacceptable to you, who
despise riches; and more becoming
me, whose profession is poverty. I
pretend to no reward, or if any, I
am content that your pardon should
be my reward: Yet I must recall my
words; I do indeed humbly expect
and beg a great reward, no lesse then
the richest kind of Almes, Prayers:
and the best of that best sort of
Almes, your prayers; mine for you
have been alwayes due, since I knew
you; and, God willing, shall be most
faithfully paid at Gods holy Altar;
for I am, in truth of heart,</p>

            <p>SInce it was the eminent sanctity of
your Order (in vaine endeavoured
with greater care by you to be hid from
the observation of the world, then by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
their hypocrisie) which contributed
much to put me in a condition of writing
a discourse of this nature: And since it
was by the command, and for the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of certain Superiours of your Order
likewise, that contrary to my Resolution
I adventured upon this work: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
since it was by the advice and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of certain of your Fathers Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
that I took the confidence to publish
it, being written; therefore in strict justice
it ought to return and addresse it self thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from whence in so many respects it
took its originall.</p>
            <p>But whereas the language made it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
<pb facs="tcp:46209:5"/>
either of the censure or apology of
those persons who had the greatest and
immediate influence upon it, and besides,
though it had been Translated, it would
not have procured that effect which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
desire; Therefore it may seem that
meer necessity hath cast upon you this
trouble and charity. Though the truth
is seeing the almost only argument of
this Book is to maintain <hi>Catholike Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
against the sacriledge of Schisme,
there could scarce be chosen fitter Patrons
for it' then such persons, who are the true
successors of those Innocent Martyrs,
with the effusion of whose blood, both <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Unity</hi> expired in <hi>England,</hi> and
that Sacrilegious Tyrant K. <hi>Henry 8.</hi>
dedicated his accursed Idol of Schisme;
an act, which alone may be able to rectifie
the judgments of the seducing &amp; seduced
World: for can any man think otherwise,
but that Catholike Unity is a daughter
of heaven, whose Victimes have been the

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. I Had no intention at all to
write, much lesse to give to
publike view this account of
the Reasons and Motives of
my relinquishing Error and Schism,
and rejoyning my self to Catholike V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Not that I preferred mine own
ease before the endeavouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
though in the smallest degree,
to the spirituall good of others: But
me thought a writing of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would seem to argue that I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my self a person of such conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as that men would expect from
my hands such an account: A conceit,
which truly I never entertained, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had I any reason so to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea afterward, when some men
(I am confident, without any visible
grounds either from my conversation
in times past, or late proceedings) did
assume to themselves the authority,
or rather, licence, to judge of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thoughts and intentions, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb facs="tcp:46209:11"/>
me with worldly ambition, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
or melancholy, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to such unworthy Principles that
change, which was only the effect of
Divine goodnesse and mercy implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with earnest and continuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
Yet other mens injustice to me
did not make me injust to my self, so
far as to think that that could qualifie
me so as to be fit to appear in publike.
All the effect it had upon me was, in
regard of my self, a secret joy to suffer
any thing for so blessed a cause, as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Unity; and in regard of the
authors of such aspersions, a secret
griefe and compassion, that they
would needs declare themselves ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers
to me for endeavouring, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any others hinderance or losse, to
save mine own Soule; or that (resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to be so injust) they would make
choice of such imputations, which
(though they had in themselvs been
true, yet) no man could believe them
to have been competent accusers and
informers of thoughts, known only to
almighty God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But, what neither the just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and disesteem which I had of
<pb facs="tcp:46209:11"/>
my self would permit, nor the unjust
calumniations of others could extort
from me, a command intimated from
certain vertuous worthy persons Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
of the <hi>Holy Order of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusians</hi>
(whom I thought my self in
some sort obliged to obey, though as
yet my Superiours only in desire and
reverence) gave me the assurance to
adventure upon. They, judging it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
that I should give some proof
both of the matute advice, and also of
the reasonablenesse of my change,
made me consider my self only as fit
to obey them, without altering in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degree the mean esteem I had of
my self: And the same persons advising
the publication of what I wrote, have
thereby made me by this in genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
declaration of what I knew of
my self (almost against my will) to
answer the aspersions; which those
that, I am sure, knew me not so well,
haue published.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now I do not pretend by this
Narration to deprive them of their
liberty of calumniating me still, since

the occasion and progresse of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
and resolution in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which I here make in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, and before the world,
protesting that I do my self believe
this history of my self which I now
publish, I assure them I shall not put
my self to the trouble of saying any
more for mine owne vindication in
this respect. Neither here do I answer
their calumnies any other way, then
by discovering my self naked to my
very thoughts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They may hereafter, if they
please, continue to traduce me more
probably and ingenuously, for no
doubt I shall in this writing give them
many advantages against my self: yea
I must tell them my intention was to
do them this pleasure; and for that
reason I called this <hi>Narration</hi> an <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologesis,</hi>
and that with reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
severall notions of that word: For
first it is a publike Confession, and that

Schism, but withall joyn'd with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of, no doubt, many imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:46209:12"/>
in searching after truth, during the
twi-light of my doubtings and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
and many weaknesses in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the truth, after I had found it:
So that they have <hi>confitentem reum,</hi> and

intended to be a publike Confession
or Thanks-giving, a <hi>Tabula votiva</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting

               </argument>
               <p>1. IT was in the moneth of <hi>June</hi> in the yeare
of our Lord 1644. that those most unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
bloody dissentions in <hi>Great-Brittaine,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
spread through all the Provinces of
that unhappy Nation, constrained me (not so
much to avoid my personall danger, as out of
the horrour to be a spectatour of such inhumane
Tragedies, as were every where daily acted) to
forsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e my native countrey, to recreate my selfe
with a voluntary exile, &amp; to follow the conduct
of the mercifull hand of God, which provided
for me not only an opportunity &amp; convenience
of subsisting in forrein countrys, but likewise
means of diverting in som measure my mind
from the sad remembrance of the miseries I left
behind me, and, by a retreit into places lesse
frequented by passengers, of withdrawing mine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46209:14"/>
cares from being wounded with fresh relations
of new bloodshed and massacres.</p>
               <p>2. I confesse that war was to me an object
not only of horrour, but even astonishment, as
having never read or heard of any other that
could enter into any comparison with it.</p>
               <p>3. Now that which astonished me in the
present Commotions was, 1. To consider,
that fatall concatenation of a world of disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and circumstances praeceding this war,
so strange that no humane prudence could have
foreseen or suspected them, if any of which had
not happened, there had been no possibility of
any prosperous successe to the Anti-Royallists.
2. To observe an event incredibly successefull
to designes the most unreasonable and seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ridiculous that ever were. For, for example,
who could imagine that an inconsiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of peevish ignorant Presbyterians should
ever come to be able to constreine a whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to forsweare the Religion, in which
they had been bred, and to subvert their own
Church upon a groundlesse suspition that the
King had a designe to change his Religion, who
yet was almost the only person that remained
constant in it, so as to hazard not only the ruine
of his estate, but the losse of his life also; For
the time was, when (if he would have given up
<hi>Episcopacy</hi>) he might have obteined in all
other respects very tollerable conditions;
Whereas severall of the wisest and learnedst of
his <hi>Cleargy,</hi> have been content to buy their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
with a voluntrry degrading of themselves
from their <hi>offices</hi> and <hi>titles;</hi> yea it may truly be
said, that though many of them have suffered
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46209:14"/>
in extremity, yet it was not properly with an
eye to their Religion, but rather their fidelity
and loyalty to their Prince; or upon quarrells
against Episcopall Tyranny, to perswade a
Nation to accept of Presbyterian Tyranny, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more unreasonable and intollerable:
And which is beyond beliefe, that they should
be perswaded to imbarke themselves in a warre,
wherein so many myriads of Soules have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
when the only differences (by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the chiefe incendiaries, the <hi>Calvinist</hi>-Ministers
and their partisans in <hi>France</hi>)
were only trifling inconsiderable ceremonies
and circumstances: Blessed God, what a
strange furious spirit is this, which has from
<hi>Calvin</hi> descended upon his followers, that moves
them to such horrible resolutions and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
even for matters in their owne opinion of
no considerable moment, and to the end to
enforce their novelties and fancies upon the
consciences of others against all justice and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
For what is more unreasonable then that
Sects, whose essentiall grounds are Scripture
alone, with a renouncing of all visible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to interpret it, should yet assume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
an authority to enforce their opinions
upon the consciences of others?</p>
               <p>4. Was it possible to consider these things
without astonishment? Is not the hand of
God as manifest to the eyes of mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
in this businesse, as the hand from
heaven was to <hi>Baltassar,</hi> when by the help of
<hi>Daniel</hi> he read the finall doom of his own and
his kingdomes ruine in those words, MANE
THE CEL PHARES? I must needs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46209:15"/>
confesse that, though at my leaving of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
the affaires between the King and
Anti-royallists stood almost in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> there
being no considerable advantage on either party,
notwithstanding I could not free my selfe from
grievous apprehensions that Gods Providence
had not been so busie and vigilant in contriving
such a concurrence of ominous and prodigious
events, to the end to suffer all things quickly
to conclude in peace and tranquility.</p>

               <p>1. FRom a view of our present miseries in

consideration and probable divination of
what might be supposed to be the causes of so

peculiar nationall sins have lately reigned in

God to make it such a spectacle of desolation,
and Proverbe of misery above any other nation.</p>
               <p>2. Even the Heathens themselves take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of two especiall sinnes so immediately and
directly contumelious to the Divine Majesty,
and therefore in themselves so heynous, that they
never escaped any long time an exemplary

even the posterity of the delinquents:
Yea though they had been committed only
by a private person, and that only inwardly and

                  <p>England prodigiously guilty of Sacriledge
since the Schisme.</p>
                  <p>Visible judgements have continually pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
this crime there.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. NOw how dreadfully and universally the
two Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have beene guilty of these two scandalous,
and even to Heathens abominable crimes,
<hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi> since the time that the
schisme from Catholique Unity began, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
apparent to all the world, and with
a secret remorse bewayled even by the English
Protestants themselves. No man therefore
can jnstly blame me as a discoverer and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher
of the faults of my beloved countrey, too
farre spread already, and too much boasted of
by that infamous faction of <hi>Calvinists,</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the chiefe authours of these sins there, and
now the avengers of them. It is <hi>Schisme</hi> onely
to which I impute these prodigious crimes: for
before the birth of that monster, I appeale to
all manner of ancient Records, if ever there was
any nation more abounding in holy Offerings,
or more exactly obscuring a sincere fidelity and
simplicity. I may therefore without blame
set downe the dire effects of the most pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sect that ever was, which is able to convert
Paradice it selfe into a savage wastnesse.</p>
               <p>2. In the first place then, what a ravage of
holy Offerings did that unsatiable gulfe of luft
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46209:17"/>
and avarice <hi>King Henry the VIII. of England</hi>
make at the beginning, and for the justifying
of his Schisme? How did he at one fatall
swoope, snatch away all the goods and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes,
drive out all the consecrated servants,
and with <hi>axes and hammers hew downe all the
houses of God in the land</hi> belonging to all <hi>Religious
Orders?</hi> A crime the more horrible in him,
in as much as he professed at the same time, and
made that profession good by his cruelty that
(excepting his withdrawing himselfe from his
Obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi>) he continued in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of all other Catholique Doctrines, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
likewise in the <hi>Calender,</hi> and celebrating
the memory of those Saints, S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> Saint
<hi>Bruno,</hi> S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> &amp;c. whose Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
he utterly demolished.</p>
               <p>3. In the dayes of his Sonne and Successour
King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. a Childe, the then-<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctour</hi>
and Governours adding compleat Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to the former Schisme, continued likwise the
Sacriledge, sweeping some few gleanings
that had escaped, and upon a ridiculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of superstition devoured even to the very
Hospitalls, Colledges, Schools and some Parish
Churches. Even Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her selfe, how
generous a Princesse soever, could yet streine her
selfe to swallow downe many goodly Mannors
belonging to her owne Bishops.</p>
               <p>4. Since her times, even till this fatall age, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge
has much languished there: But now
the present bloody <hi>Presbyterian Reformers</hi>
intending as it were to fill the measure of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to and above the brimme, and envying
the pleasure of this sinne to the successours of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46209:17"/>
this their new Schisme, doe labour to dig
up the very roots of all Ecclesiasticall revenews,
violently ravishing whatsoever belongs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to Almighty God in the Kingdome,
the designe of many of them being not to spare
even the tithes of Parishes, which they intend
to exchange into narrow and scandalous sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
               <p>5. Now to justifie that observation of the
Heathens touching Gods revenge continually
attending this sinne of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
that God has shewd himself at least as sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of this affront done him by <hi>Christians,</hi> as
heretofore by <hi>Idolaters,</hi> I adjure all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>England</hi> to witnesse with me, if a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
curse has not pursued and rested upon
the families and estates of those, who have
thought to enrich themselves by adjoyning the
possessions of Gods Church to the inheritance
of their Ancestors; if those holy things have
not continually cankred and consumed whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
temporall goods or lands have beene an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to them; In a word; whether that
may not be verified proportionably through
that whole Kingdome, which to this purpose
was observed by that learned Antiquary Sir
<hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> who discoursing of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bewayling, as oft hee did, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensiblenesse
of his country to this visible
curse of God, tooke a Mappe of his owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and opening a compasse to the distance
of about twenty English miles, fixed one
foot upon his owne house, with the other draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a circle about it, and protesting that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that circle there had anciently beene (as I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46209:18"/>
remember) neere thirty <hi>Monastries, Priories,
Nunneries,</hi> and other <hi>Religious houses</hi> distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to severall familes there: Withall that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the same compasse there were about as many
ancient Families that had had no portion in
those <hi>Sacrilegious Spoyles;</hi> and that of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
kind there were not left above three <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
houses</hi> and <hi>Mannors</hi> which continued in the
same families to which in the age immediately
before they had been given: and of the later
sort there were not above three families and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
that had failed and changed Masters.</p>
               <p>6. Now can any one possibly expect that
Almighty God will be moved to repent himselfe
of the plagues destined to that unhappy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or that hee will make use of such <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Reformers</hi> to procure the peace and
tranquility of it, when so visible examples of
his curses upon Sacriledge are not onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
but even a defiance is made against his
severity, by persons, who most blasphemously
stile it an honour done to Christ, onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
the sacred truths by him left unto his
Church, and the Holy Orders by him establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in it, but also to despoyle him of his coate
after the losse of his cloak, and to expose him
almost naked, in his Ministers, to the miseries
and scorne of the world?</p>
               <p>7. Can any thing else be expected for a
proofe that our English Reformers are arrived
to the height and perfection of this crime? Yet
even something beyond this may be added. Let
this age of Christians take notice, and let them
not forget to tell it to their Posterity (if they can
believe it) that concerning <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> Order is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46209:18"/>
taken by a publique law: And this, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the possession of Church-lands in those
sacrilegious hands, to which they have beene
given, not to afford them indempnity and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
against any claim of God or his servants:
(for how poore and inconsiderable an attentat
is that to the impudence of our Reforming <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists!</hi>)
But Order is taken by law against any
mans repentance hereafter for <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> against
feare of divine vengeance, against avoyding
such visible curses from heaven: it is a crime
for any man to cease to be <hi>Sacrilegious,</hi> or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to restore unto Almighty God those things
which he is perswaded belong unto him: it is
not permitted to such a man to restore to the
Priest to whom the care of soules is committed,
the tythes, which certainly are either Gods due,
or no mans: Before this can be done, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and indulgence must be had from all the
three Estates of the Kingdome, they must all
agree, as it were to their owne condemnation
before such a man can be allowed to ease his
tormented conscience, by freeing himselfe from
such accursed spoyles. My deare countrey,
I hope, will pardon me, if I professe that I
could not free my selfe from grievous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
that a fearfull account will be exacted
by Almighty God for a crime so continually and
heynously committed, at which even Heatherto
themselves would tremble.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>1. THen for the crying destructive sinne of
Perjury, the guilt thereof so often, so
heynously, so manifestly against conscience
repeated hath almost universally seised upon the

the former of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> is the ordinary and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

Order and in a most solemn fashion, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
either the lusts or interests of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have moved them to introduce any novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
among them. First, <hi>Henry the eight,</hi> without
giving his subjects leave or space to studie the
point of Controversie (which yet indeed was then
no controversie at all) with forced consent of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46209:19"/>
his Parliament constreined them generally to
renounce one <hi>Article</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> (namely, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Visible Universall Pastour of the
Catholique Church</hi>) wherein they and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
for many ages had been bred, a doctrine
introduced, and generally embraced there ever
since the Nation was converted from Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme
by their glorious <hi>Apostle</hi> S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
the <hi>Benedictin Monke</hi> delegated thither by the
more glorious <hi>Pope</hi> S. <hi>Gregory the Great.</hi> To ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
which <hi>Perjury,</hi> the meaner sort of people
were forced by Tyranny, and the <hi>Great-ones</hi>
allured by partaking in the spoiles of <hi>Sacriledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. After his death, those sacrilegious persons
who governed the Kingdome during the reigne
and minority of his Son, caused the Parliament
a second time to impose upon the whole Nation
a yet greater <hi>Perjury,</hi> namely entirely to sweare
away a great part of that <hi>Faith</hi> which made
them <hi>Christians.</hi> And though they willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
their former <hi>Perjuries</hi> and impieties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to their ancient Beliefe and Obedience
during the short reigne of that <hi>Catholique Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
Q. Mary:</hi> Yet, the interests of her sister &amp; suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
Q <hi>Elizabeth</hi> prevailed so far, as to make
them repent their repentance, and to sweare
over againe all their former <hi>Perjuries,</hi> her cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Counsellours</hi> by all unlawfull wayes of
violence and allurements surprising the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
corrupting the Cleargy, and violencing
the consciences of the subjects, and so contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their designs, as that they confidently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that <hi>Schisme</hi> and <hi>Haeresie</hi> were established
in <hi>England</hi> irremoveably, being setled by a <hi>law,</hi>
as irrevocable, as that of the <hi>Medes and Persians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:46209:20"/>4. But in vaine: For <hi>Schisme</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi>
wanting firme and reall foundations, and being
built only upon secular interests, when those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
come to faile (as all worldly things must
in time) naturally sinke lower and lower into
that gulfe which hath no bottome. For it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
that <hi>Heresie</hi> being the ruine of <hi>Faith,</hi>
as <hi>Schisme</hi> is of <hi>Charity,</hi> all changes that are
made in them are still to the worse. Faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
more and more undetermined, and
Charity more and more cryed downe and made
unlawfull. A fearfull example of this hath been
represented to the world in this late <hi>Schisme</hi> in
<hi>England</hi> from a former <hi>Schisme:</hi> For heretofore
the <hi>English Protestants</hi> pretended that by their
<hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> there was
made a rent only in the semelesse garment of
<hi>Christ,</hi> but yet so that the parts hung together
still, allowing the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> to be a
true <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but preferring their part
of it as better cleansed and washed than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But now <hi>Christs</hi> garment is torne by them
into I know not how many rags, all pluck'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
from one another, and this with such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
and injusitice, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> himselfe would
have abhorred.</p>
               <p>5. But to returne to <hi>Perjury,</hi> a most usefull
and necessary engine in <hi>Schisme;</hi> certainely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any <hi>Carthaginian</hi> or <hi>Barbarian</hi> hath given
such prodigious Examples, as the <hi>Presbyterian
Calvinists.</hi> For Persons, who make it a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their Sect to acknowledge a private
spirit to be the only judge of Scripture and
points of Religion, renouncing all externall Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
authority as to such a purpose, for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46209:20"/>
such men, I say, to force other men without any
new information or instruction to forswear
whatsoever the law of God (as they believed)
and most certainly the lawes of the Kingdome
then in force obliged them to, is an attentat most
horrible: But by a new oath, and that expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
commanding persons to preserve their
loyalty to their Prince, and to maintaine the
Lawes and Religion of the Kingdome, by
such an oath I say, to oblige the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
at the same time to seeke the destruction
of their Prince and of the same Lawes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to spend their fortunes and lives in
the defence of a Religion not yet in being, but
promised to be contrived no man knowes when,
nor by whom, and to sweare that that unknown
Religion yet in the forge was true and only
conformable to the word of God: What

renouncing of God, as this? And yet
all this hath been in the face of the sun, and this
must in <hi>England</hi> be stiled a <hi>Reformation,</hi> and
such an one as might deserve to be purchased
with that Sea of blood which hath lately flowed
there.</p>
               <p>5. Surely this one example alone may suffice
to advertise all those who have seperated
from the unity of Christs Church, what are
and probably will be the dire effects of <hi>Schisme.</hi>
Let them not cast their eyes so much upon those
frequent seditions and Rebellions, and those
rivers of Christian blood, which under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Reformation</hi> have been shed in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome

of his heavenly Majesty.</p>
               <p>7. Therefore such abominations as these,

                  <p>The sanguinary lawes, and cruell execution
of them upon Catholique Priests in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THere was one sinne more of which
the <hi>English Government</hi> since the
<hi>Schisme</hi> there was guilty, which God seldome
leaves unpunished, and for which, even during
the time of my being a <hi>Protestant,</hi> I apprehended
some time or other as a sharp visitation; which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46209:21"/>
was the enacting and putting in execution
those bloudy lawes against poor <hi>Catholique
Priests,</hi> against most of whom there was not
the least pretence of any charge of sedition or
Treason? But for this only crime of being of
that heavenly Vocation, to which the Spirit
of God had called, and the sacred authority
of the Church had exalted them; And for a
conscionable discharge of that calling, they
were arraigned, condemned, drag'd to the
place of execution, there ignominiously
hang'd (among thieves and murderers) and
their half-living bodies most inhumanely
quartered, and exposed to the sun and weather.</p>
               <p>2. This crime was the more inexcuseable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
committed by <hi>Englishmen,</hi> who (though
violent enough in their passion when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
yet) are apt in a short time to relent, and
by <hi>English Protestants,</hi> a Sect pretending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ordinary to moderation and clemency. But
the truth is, the <hi>Calvinisticall Spirit</hi> ha's been
working in that state and government ever
since the beginning of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign; for
the <hi>Calvinists</hi> were the Councellors that first
suggested, those cruelties, which their descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
have since eagerly pursued and acted by
the hands of others, till (their so long proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

bloud even to vomiting, as they have of late
done.</p>
               <p>3. Now that this is no false character of

experiences in other countreyes) our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46209:22"/>
great Presbyterian contrivers, and managers
of the late war have given severall testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
irrefragable, who (whensoever they were
pressed with want of treasure, knowing the
complexion and temper of their own faction
in <hi>London,</hi> how delightfull a spectacle of

supplies of money from them, then by fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

To the Communion of what Church I
should adhere upon supposition that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> should faile.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. NOt long after this there was, I know
not how, suggested to my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a thought, which I could not at pleasure si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and which interrupted much my extreame
eagernesse of reading; it was this, <hi>A supposition
being made that it should please Almighty God to
put a period to the Church and Ecclesiasticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in</hi> England, <hi>to what Churches Communion I
should then adjoyne my selfe!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It was not any reason I had to dispayre of
the Kings condition that occasioned such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
(for at this time he was in a state to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
upon even termes the victory with his
enemies) nor any jealousie of the truth of the
<hi>English Religion:</hi> But knowing that the <hi>English
Church,</hi> considered as distinct not only from
the <hi>Roman,</hi> but from all other Sects in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
likewise from it, was not, nor ever
pretended to be either <hi>indefectible</hi> or <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
Nay more, considering that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
government in <hi>England</hi> depended
absolutely upon the firmnesse or weaknesse of
the Kings authority there, by whose absolute
power only and according to whose interests it
was framed at first; And perceiving but too well
that for many yeares there had been a powerfull,
malicious, contriving faction of <hi>Calvinists,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46209:23"/>
enemies to Monarchy and Episcopall
Government (as they have given proofe to the
full) and which had intruded themselves and
were generally incorporated both into the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Cleargy, Universities, chiefe <hi>Bourgeosies,</hi>
and places of Judicature, whose designe received
from their forefathers it had been to omit no
occasion to ruine both the civill and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
State, whereto the whole Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland</hi> would be sure to give their brotherly
assistance: Lastly, being assured that the maine
thing, and to me the most considerable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which the English Church had above all
others pretending to a Reformation, namely
a succession and authority of Bishops and other
Ecclesiasticall Orders received from the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> was never confidently and generally
taught in <hi>England</hi> to be of <hi>divine right,</hi> and by
consequence tooke no firme rooting in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of English subjects; Upon which
ground I easily foresaw that though perhaps ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
would adventure far to support the Reall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
yet if ever the title of Episcopall Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
should be separated from the Rights of
the King, there would but very few appeare
that would hazard their fortunes or lives for
that which though they preferred infinitely
before the Presbyterian Tyranny, yet they had
never been taught that it was an essentiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a Church. Yea on the contrary they
had seen both King and Cleargy, and generally
the whole Kingdome looke upon the <hi>Calvinist</hi>
and <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, as brethren of the
same Religion in substantialls, sending Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and other Ecclesiastiques to sit with them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46209:24"/>
in their <hi>Synods,</hi> maintaining their quarrells,
commending their principall Authors, harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
releeving and preferring their exiles,
In a word, upon the title of <hi>Brotherhood</hi>
assisting them with treasure and forces in their Rebellions.</p>
               <p>3. Upon such grounds as these, considering
the unsure foundation of the <hi>English</hi> Church, I
thought it not unreasonable to spend some
thoughts upon that enquiry, viz. To <hi>what
Churches Communion I should adjoyne my selfe upon
supposition that the English Church should come to
sayle.</hi> I thought my self the rather obliged to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
such a provisionary enquiry, because I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred

               </argument>
               <p>1. NOw in pursuing this inquiry, it scarce
entred into my thoughts to admit into

debate the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> because the maine

               <p>2. Of Sects in separation from the <hi>Catholique
Church,</hi> those which I thought most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and therefore represented them to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
to examine which of them would
best approve it selfe to my choyce, were 1. the
<hi>Lutheran,</hi> 2. the <hi>Calvinist,</hi> 3. the <hi>Socinian.</hi> For
as for those fanaticall Sects of <hi>Auabaptists, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulists,</hi>
&amp;c. they being only confused troops
of ignorant dreaming spirits, which hitherto
have never been able to convert one Parish or
Village entirely to themselves, and the very
dregs of all other Sects, where those that were
discontented or craised in their understanding
ordinarily setled; I could not obtaine from my
selfe the patience to examine seriously their
grounds, or to put it to the question, whether
I should adjoyne my selfe unto them or no.
Adde hereto that I could not hitherto under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all their grounds distinctly, by reason that
I could never meet with any of their writings,
so obscure they are, and afraid of the light.</p>
               <p>3. Concerning the other three Sects, the
temper and morallity of the <hi>Socinians</hi> was much
more agreeable to mee then that of the other
two. But their inexcusable boldnesse of tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
under foot all authority of Fathers and
Councells, and their licentious introducing
blasphemous and long-since-buried Heresies
against the fundamentall Mysteries of Faith
was to me intollerable. Besides, neither <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46209:25"/>
nor <hi>Italy</hi> being able to afford me bookes
of <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrines, I was forced to content
my selfe with that curiosity, which I had had a few
yeares before in <hi>England</hi> (where such bookes
were but too frequent, notwithstanding the care
of the late <hi>Archbishop of Cant.</hi> to hinder the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
them) at which time I read over almost
all the considerable treatises of that Sect, both
of controversy, and exposition of Scripture.
The effect of which my curiosity was only an
esteeme of the excellency of their naturall parts
both for the subtilty, and clearnesse of disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and an acknowledgment that though their
<hi>principles</hi> were of all others most fallacious, and
their peculiar distinctive doctrines most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and intollerable to Christian eares, yet
they were far more constant to such their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and lesse incumbred with difficulties and
contradictions then the other two: In a word,
that the frame of their building was with all its
deformity more uniforme, then that of other H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques
of these times, &amp; as strong as a building
could be that had no better foundation then
the moving sand of naturall reason: Whereas
the other two Sects of <hi>Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi>
(to whom I had some jealousie that the <hi>English
Protestants</hi> might be joyned) relying princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
indeed upon private interpretation of
Scripture, but challenging likewise the suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which difformities and inequalities the <hi>Socinans</hi>

eminent abilities to confute so pernicious a
booke; which he having, as he thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
performed; they further told him that
it would be injustice, and a kind of confession
of guilt to publish his confutation without the
adversaries Text, and by that meanes they
made their Master a sower of Haeresy, for every
one almost bought up the booke for <hi>Socinus</hi> his
sake only, scarce any vouchsafing to cast
their eyes upon the heavy unskillful confutation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:46209:26"/>5. Thus I make but a small stay upon the
<hi>Socinians,</hi> on whom I looked rather with pitty
then resentment: Considering withall that they
were the almost only Sect which made professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against violence, and active disobedience,
condemning warre absolutely and upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
pretences. Notwithstanding observing
that one essentiall marke of that Sect was reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to hold no opinion, but in every <hi>Synod</hi> to
give leave to the questioning or altering of
whatsoever <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith had been before
decided, I found that seemingly calm and quiet
spirit of theirs lesse alluring; because from their
owne peculiar complexion and grounds, I thus
Argued; Who can tell whether (if they encrease
in numbers and power) they may not thinke fit
to begin with the alteration of that doctrine?
For I have known when even the <hi>Calvinists</hi> in
<hi>Holland</hi> and the <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> being in
low estate, have preached <hi>liberty of Prophesying,</hi>
&amp; pretended only to desire a freedome of injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Consciences in particular, promising
never to molest any others; As by their first
published writings, and by severall <hi>Remonstrances</hi>
and <hi>Petitions</hi> by Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> to K. <hi>Iames,</hi> in the
beginning of hisreigne, and to Parliaments in
those times; And yet the same men being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
become numerous &amp; powerfull enough to
gaine the effect of their Petitions by force, never
yet allowed any moderate qualification or tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to any other.</p>

                  <p>Reflection upon the Calvinists and Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
Churches.</p>
                  <p>Their first disadvantage in comparison
with the English Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. HAving passed with so much speed the
<hi>Socinian Churches,</hi> I fixed my thoughts
more seriously upon the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
to the end to resolve my selfe whether
those points of doctrine, discipline or practise,
wherein they differed from, and apparently
came short of the <hi>English Church,</hi> were indeed
of so high a nature as to dishearten me from
embracing their communion any other way, then
by allowing them my Charity, in not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, which I also afforded even to the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> it selfe.</p>
               <p>2. Now among the differences, (where in all
other <hi>Sects</hi> pretending to a Reformation were
distinguishable from the English, as wanting
certaine priviledges and commendable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which she enjoyed) some I found to be
commune to all those Sects, (especially the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists:</hi>) Others to be proper
and peculiar to each. Concerning these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I found it to little purpose to spend much
time in examining them, because the former
commune ones did more then sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
me from adjoyning my selfe to their
Communion. And those were especially these
five, viz. 1. Their grounding their beliefe both
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46209:27"/>
of the bookes of Scripture, and the true sence of
them, not upon the universall Tradition of
the Church, but their owne private Spirit,
which, as they pretended, assured them that the
<hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists</hi> were the Authors of
them, and that the sences, which they collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them, were the true undoubted sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of them. 2. Their apparent want of a
lawfull succession of Ecclesiasticall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Teachers, joyn'd with an unsuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
presumption in condemning of Tyranny,
that Government of Bishops, which had been
apparently setled in the universall Church
without contradiction since the Apostles
Times. 3. Their Doctrines and practises of
<hi>Sedition and Rebellion.</hi> 4. Their professed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of peace and Reunion with the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church.</hi> 5. The prodigious personall qualities
of <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> which shewed them to
be persons extreamly unfit to be relyed upon,
or acknowledged for <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Reformers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Concerning the first commune differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
namely, The <hi>Calvinist's</hi> and <hi>Lutheran's</hi>
grounding their beliefe of Christian Doctrines,
and their sence of them, and generally of the
bookes of Scripture, not upon the authority
and Tradition of the Church so much as
upon a private Spirit, testimony or suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretended to bee infused from the Spirit
of God, by which they took upon themselves
to be assured of the truth of Christianity, of
their expressions of severall Articles of Faith,
and of their perswasion that the Apostles and
Evangelists were the Authours of those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
writings: what little satisfaction I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46209:27"/>
found in this maine Foundation of their
Religion I shall reserve to demonstrate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
For the present I desire that to bee
mistaken when I call this one of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and disadvantages which the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi>
and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> &amp;c. have in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them with the <hi>English Church.</hi> For though
it bee true that by rationall consequence from
the grounds declared of the <hi>English Church,</hi>
the former position will evidently follow:
notwithstanding shee ha's beene more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and wary then publiquely to pretend
to such a <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> and by consequence
has left a latitude and liberty for them in her
<hi>Communion</hi> to renounce it, as many of the most
learned among them have done.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Apparent want, yea renouncing of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
succession of Ecclesiasticall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Teachers among Lutherans
and Calvinists.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I. A Second thing wherein the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
and <hi>Calvinists agreed</hi> to disagree with
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> was their want of
Bishops, and by consequence of a lawfully
ordained Clergy. This was an inconvenience
so much the more hard to be digested by
mee, and which deserved neither excuse nor
commiseration, because by reason of their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46209:28"/>
want of Bishops, at their first pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
they came to that shamelesnesse as
to seeke to palliate this defect by a desperate
condemning of the Order it selfe, as a
tyranny and usurpation crept into the Church
against the expresse Order of Christ and his
Apostles: And though they (especially the
<hi>French Calvinists</hi>) might afterward have in
some sort remedied this defect by receiving a
Cleargy by the Ordination of the English
Bishops (whereto they have beene earnestly
follicited, as namely, by Bishop <hi>Morton</hi>) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they utterly persisted in the
utter refusall of suffering this important dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
to be cured: which perverse Spirit
of theirs, <hi>Arnobius (cont.</hi> Gen. <hi>lib. 6.)</hi> elegantly
describes in these words, <hi>Quod semel fine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
fecistis, ne videamini aliquando nesciisse,
defenditis, that is, That thing, which yee once
unreasonably did, to avoid the imputation of
having beene ignorant, yee still maintaine.</hi> Yea,
to that ridiculous impudence have they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> not many yeares since, as to
admit one to publique Penance in the
Church onely for having beene a <hi>Protestant Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I cannot forbeare to give a taste of
<hi>Luthers</hi> Spirit with reference to this subject,
lively represented in a Bull by him published

is, <hi>Now bee attentive O yee Bishops, or rather
disguises of the Devill, Doctour</hi> Luther <hi>will
reade to you a Bull, which will not sound plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly
unto you.</hi> The Bull and Reformation of
Doctour Luther. <hi>Whosoever brings assistance,
spends Body, Life, and Honour to the end that
Bishopricks may be wasted, and the Government of
Bishops extinguished, such are the beloved children
of God, and true Christians, observing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God, and resisting the Ordinances
of the Devill. Or if they be not able to doe thus
much, let them at least condemne and avoid that
Government. But on the contrary, whosoever
maintaine the Government of Bishops, and obey them
voluntarily, such are tho very Ministers of the
Devill, and resist the Ordinance and Law of God.</hi>
Hitherto is <hi>Luthers Bull.</hi> And I desire that any
reasonable Christian would confesse, whether he
can chuse but believe that the very same whom
<hi>Luther</hi> himselfe confesseth to have beene his

that a man should not think that this was onely

which was a fearfull insurrection and Rebellion

               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:46209:29"/>3. <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp;c. though more subtile,
yet were not lesse malicious against Episcopacy,
as appeares in severall of their Treatises
and Epistles. Yea <hi>Calvin</hi> ascended to that
height of arrogance as to professe that, that
Order and Discipline which hee had forged in
<hi>Geneva,</hi> and whereof not one single patterne can
be given since Christs Time, was not onely
justifiable, but necessarily obliging all Christians
to conforme unto.</p>
               <p>4. Whether it may in some measure bee
attributed to my education in a Church which
challenged to it selfe a priviledge beyond all
other Sects from a succession of <hi>Bishops,</hi> or to
the evidence of reason and authority which
convinced mee of the necessity of such a
succession; However it came, I found it was
impossible for mee to suffer my selfe to be
perswaded that Episcopacy was a Government
condemnable; or that a legitimate succession of
<hi>Holy Orders</hi> was not necessary to the constitution
of a Church; Or lastly, that the supereminence
of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> above Priesthood, the appropriating
thereto of the power of <hi>Ordination, Confirmation,</hi>
and giving suffrages in Councells was an
usurpation crep'd into the Church immediatly
after the <hi>Apostles</hi> Times, and contrary to their
intention, Considering that the Primitive
Churches were extreamly and punctually
scrupulous in maintaining the very phrases of
traditionary Doctrines, and Formes of customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practises;
In so much as when the least
innovation in either was discovered, all men
conspired to condemne the innovatours; Witness
the controversies about <hi>Easter, Rebaptization
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46209:29"/>
of Heretiques,</hi> &amp;c. Was it imaginable, thought I
that those first Bishops, who even by their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
were more peculiarly <hi>Canditati Martyrii,</hi>
should so suddenly degenerate from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
Spirit of Humility, as universally to
conspire to set up that pretended Tyranny over
the rest of the Cleargy, and the whole Church?
Or supposing that in the midst of such dire
persecutions they had the will and leasure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
such ambitious projects, is it credible that
the whole <hi>Ordor of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esbyters</hi> would suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be excluded from their Priviledges and
Officers so very lately bequeathed them by
Christ, and conferr'd by the <hi>Apostles;</hi> and this
universally through the whole World, and not
one single <hi>Presbyter</hi> appeare that should protest
against such an usurpation? Certainly it was
much more probable that <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>
were either deceive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s or deceived, then that
all Primitive Bishops were Tyrants, and all
Primitive Preists fooles, or rather betrayers of
that power and duty left and enjoyn'd them by
the Apostles.</p>
               <p>5. But though I could have digested this,
what arts or violence could I make use of against
mine owne reason and conscience to perswade
my selfe to live in a Church, in which
there were neither <hi>Bishops</hi> nor <hi>Priests,</hi> but a
new Order and Title of <hi>Ministers</hi> made by a
conspiracy of ignorant laymen, a Church that
took upon her to degrade and annull the Orders
of the whole Christian World, because they had
not been communicated to her, a Church which
(notwithstanding the expresse words of S <hi>Paul,
Epb. 4.</hi> who tells us that one of the speciall gifts

such subordination, and that there were no
lawfull Bishops or Pastours in the Church for

them, and before <hi>Culvin</hi> escaped from <hi>Noyon</hi>

Where is it then that a Man shall find such Pastours?
S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us when hee sayes, God hath
placed in his Church first of all Apostles, secondarily
Prophets, in the third place Doctors. There then where
the Gifts of our Lord are placed, in the same place
must wee seeke for the truth, among whom the
succession of the Church since the Apostles, and the
purity of Doctrine is maintained in its integrity.
Witnesse S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (in Ep ad Magnum.) Whereas
some alledge that they acknowledge the same God the
Father, the same Sonne Jesus Christ, and the same
Holy Ghost; this can nothing availe them (<hi>viz. being

the same God that <hi>Aaron</hi> the High
Priest and <hi>Moses</hi> did, living under the same Law &amp;
in the same Religion: They invoked that one and true
God who is to be worshipped and praid to: Yet in as
much as exceeding the limits of their Ministery they
assumed to themselves the licence to sacrifice in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Priest, who by the ordination
of God had before obtained the lawfull Priesthood,
they being supernaturally strucken presently received
the just punishment of their unlawfull attempts. <hi>And
againe,</hi> Novatianus is not in the Church, neither
can be accounted a Bishop, who despising the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
and Apostolicall Tradition, succeeding to no
person has been ordained by himselfe. <hi>And againe,</hi>
How can hee be acknowledged to be a true Pastour,
who, (the true Pastour beeing alive, and by a
successive Ordination presiding in the Church) without
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46209:31"/>
succeeding to any one, beginns from himselfe. <hi>And

a substitute ordination (<hi>Vicariâ Ordinatione</hi>) He
that beareth you heareth me <hi>Witnes</hi> S. <hi>Athanasius</hi>

and many of them had arrived to the skil to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the subtillest reasons that that their infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

made since I came into <hi>France,</hi> I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

were summoned by such as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strein

they had the same advantage over Cotholiques, which
Catholiques have over them, they would allow the
same freedome?</hi> they would endeavour to give an
answer as unsatisfactory as their Confession of
Faith.</p>
               <p>3. It was not altogether the many seditious
passages in <hi>Luther</hi>'s and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s writings which
scandalised mee so farre as to conceive my
self by communicating with them engaged to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46209:32"/>
profess, at least not to professe against, such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
doctrines (for liberty is sometimes taken
by them to renounce some particular Texts
even of <hi>Calvin</hi>) but the not seeing any one
protesting against or disavowing such scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
assertions. I confesse I wondred how they
could hope to make any Christians believe that
their pretended <hi>Reformation</hi> proceeded from
the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> when instead of those spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
armes of charity, humility, patience &amp; most
indispensable obedience even to <hi>Nero</hi> himself by
which <hi>Christ</hi> enabled his <hi>Apostles</hi> to conquer the
world to the belief of the Gospel; <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
put into the hands of their Sectatours ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
pride, hatred to suffer for conscience sake,
active resistance against all authority, in a word,
the very same weapons that the Devill sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
to <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Now to make this appear to be no wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
imputation, besides the manifest experience
of all the blood shed in <hi>Germany, France, England,</hi>
&amp;c. and besides such bloudy treatises of <hi>Beza,
Knox, Good-man,</hi> and others of these later times.
I will produce expresse testimonies out of the
writings of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> First <hi>Luther (loc.
com, class. 4. c.</hi> 30. directing his speech to
one <hi>Spalatinus,</hi> hath these words, <hi>I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that which thou sayest,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Prince
will not suffer that any thing should be written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Electour of Mentz, nor any thing that
my disturbe the publique peace. I will rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
both thee, and the Prince: For if I have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Pope which is his Creatour, why should I not
oppose the creature?</hi> And, <hi>Is it not a pretty opinion
of yours that the publique peace ought not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46209:33"/>
nion of yours that the publike peace ought not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed,
but the eternall peace of God may; No such
matter,</hi> Spalatinus, <hi>no such matter.</hi> And again, <hi>(cap.
de Bapt.) We are exempted from all humane lawes by
the Christian liberty given us in Baptisme.</hi> Then
for <hi>Calvin, Calv. Inst. l. 4. c. 20. p. 10. &amp; com. in
Dan. c. 2. v. 39. &amp;c. 5. v. 5. Id. in. Dan. c. 6. v. 2. &amp; 25.</hi>
it is observable first how in severall places he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to discredit Monarchy in general: then how
seditiously he speaks elswhere, as in this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Earthly Princes devest themselves of their
power, when they oppose themselves against God,
yea they are unworthy to be reckoned in the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mber
of men. And therefore it is fitter that a man should
spit in their faces them obey them, when they grow
so sawey as to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>be willing to deprive God of his right.</hi>
Lastly <hi>D. Bancroft Archbishop of Canterbury</hi> (in
his Booke of dangerous Positions, pag. 9.) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
to <hi>Calvin</hi> this damnable position, openly
both in writing and deeds defended by his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
viz <hi>That it is lawfull for subjects, if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will not, to reforme Religion, and that by
force and armes, if it can be done no other way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. I should have been willing to let such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
speeches as these pass for personall faults,
and have attributed to them; <hi>Luthers</hi> frenzy and
<hi>Calvins malicious</hi> spirit, if any of their party
would have thought fit to disavow them; or if the
yet more horrid books of <hi>Beza</hi> &amp; other of <hi>Calvins</hi>
disciples had not justified their Masters to
have beene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> modest in comparison of
them; and lastly, if I had not knowne that
when any among them (I never heard
that any put it in a publique tryall, but one) to
whom such damnable doctrines have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46209:33"/>
odious, and were willing to publish their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of them, had not been interrupted, and
publikely silenc'd in such a dsigne. But to give
a proof irrefragable that this Sect especialy of
<hi>Calvinisme</hi> is bred and nourished with this
poyson of sedition, and that even in the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
thereof not being able to keepe in the
sting, when it was so weake as that it had no
power of wounding, as soone as it gets strength
it fayles not to dart it out to the destruction
of never so many thousands that oppose it, I
shall for proofe onely desire that men would
cast their eyes upon the condition of <hi>England</hi>
since the late Calvinisticall faction there got a
fatall opportunity to discharge freely that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which for a long time it was forced to
keepe closed up in it's entrals, where after the
best enquiry I could make, I could not finde or
heare of during the time of these late bloody
commotions so much as one single person of the
<hi>Presbyterian-Calvinist</hi> party but did actively
oppose his King; Nor one single Minister of
that party but was a Trumpet io incite to war:
And all this not to free themselves from any
danger they were in for their consciences (for
before the warre broke out, his Majesty had
offered them sufficient security) but to destroy
the present government of that Church, and to
set up their owne in place of it. And as for <hi>their
Brethren in France</hi> to this day it has beene in
vaine attempted to perswade them to signifie the
least dislike of these their practises, the most
infamous and scandalous to Christianity that
ever were.</p>
               <p>6. If all these considerations together
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46209:34"/>
doe not more then sufficiently prove that
without partaking of the scandall, I could
not adjoyne my self to the communion of these
Sects, let all the world judge: Especially I being
before, (&amp; yet remaining) absolutely perswaded
<hi>that it is utterly unlawfull upon praetence of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion, or avoyding persecution to oppose actively
that peaceably settled Government under which I live;
Much more to seeke the alteration or ruine of that
Government, upon designe of introducing that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which I thinke to be true.</hi> And truly I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but acknowledge it a great blessing of
God, that though I had the misfortune to be
bred in Schisme, yet it was in such a Church,
the forme whereof having been moulded by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(if not according to the interests) of the
Civill Governours, in which continuing it
was, besides the obligation of my conscience,
mine own secular interests also to be loyall to the
King, with whom that Religion did before stand,
and is now in great danger to fall: for by this
meanes I had no tentation at all to study waies
to elude those expresse commands of Christ by
S. Paul, <hi>(Rom. 13.) to be obedient not only for wrath
but even conscience sake to my worldly Governour;</hi>
and of Christ himselfe immediately <hi>(Mat. 5.)</hi>
to seeke for <hi>blessednesse by suffering for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of the Gospels sake,</hi> not by opposing
with active violence the Governours that sought
the ruine of it, much lesse under present here
of by persecuting and destroying others: Divine
Providence seeming on purpose to order
the publication of these truly <hi>Christian doctrines</hi>
under the reigne of <hi>Tiberius, Caligula,</hi> and
<hi>Nero,</hi> then which the sunne never saw more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46209:34"/>
abominable Tyrants and enemies to Religion,
to the end that in future ages no pretence should
serve to dispense from Obedience. And this
doctrine of Obedience, truly Christian, which
I learned in <hi>England,</hi> being now by Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
a <hi>Catholique,</hi> I do and by the grace of
God will to my death retaine; and the rather,
because I shall now embrace it meerly for the
authority of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in imitation of his
Apostles and ancient Christians afterward,
whose heroicall subjection to persecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
even then when it was in their power
to revenge themselves: among other writers,
<hi>Tertullian</hi> most divinely expresseth in his <hi>Apology</hi>
and elsewhere, and that most victorious <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baean
Legion</hi> gave an illustrious example. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in <hi>England,</hi> that the interest of state had: a
great influence even upon this doctrine of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
appears in this, that when Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
conceived it convenient for her worldly designs
to take on her the Protection of the low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes
against the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> She employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>D. Bilsou</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> one of her
learnedst Cleargymen to write his booke of
<hi>Christian subjection,</hi> in which to justifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
of <hi>Holland</hi> he gave strange liberty in many
cases, especially concerning Religion, for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to cast off their Obedience. But that book
which serv'd <hi>Q Eliz.</hi> worldly designs, by the just
judgement of God hath contributed much to
the ruine of her successour K <hi>Charles:</hi> For there is
not any booke that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have made
more dangerous use of against their present
Prince, then that which <hi>his Predecessour</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be written justifie her against the

wicked in this nature, as their best and most

the whole body of the <hi>French Iesuits</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi>

in this point) being in the yeare, 1625. met in a

disavowed, condemned and detested such sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
positions and writings, universally agreeing
to condemne that scandall, wherein I never yet
saw them imitated by any one <hi>Calvinist.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
for <hi>English Catholiques,</hi> their innocence
and clearnesse in this point of Obedience was
to me sufficiently apparent even before I left
that Kingdome, besides other proofes testifyed
in a <hi>Petition</hi> offered to the <hi>Parliament</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before the late Commotions, as in the name
of all of that Religion in <hi>England,</hi> In which the

true and lawfull King, supreame Lord, and

they acknowledge themselves to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
under paine of sin to obey his Majesty
in all civill and temperall affaires, as much
as any other of his Majesties subjects, and as
the lawes and Rules of Government in this

that notwithstanding any power or pretention

temporall proceeding or derived from him or

they will still acknowledge and perform to the
utmost of their abilities their faithfull loyalty
and true allegeance to their said King and

much as it may seem able, or shall pretend to

they profess that al absolute Princes &amp; supream
Governours of what Religion soever they be,
are Gods Lieutenants upon earth, and that
Obedience is due unto them according to the
lawes of each Commonwealth respectively in
civill and temporall affaires, and therefore
they doe here protest against all doctrine and

impious and against the word of God to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that any private Subject may kill and
murther the Annointed of God his Prince,
though of a different beliefe and Religion

                  <p>A fourth scandall among Calvinists, &amp;c.
viz. their aversion from unity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. A Fourth great discouragement which I
had to joyne in Communion with the
<hi>Lutheran</hi> or <hi>Calvinist</hi> Churches, was their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
renouncing of Christian Charity, and the
peace of Gods Church, their unwillingnesse to
abate the least point of doctrine even to a very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46209:37"/>
phrase, or to alter any thing in discipline though
to gaine thereby the greatest good, which is
<hi>unity</hi> and reconciliation, in a word, the <hi>Spirit
of Donatisme, a Spirit of Separation, out of the
love of Separation it selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Whether it was a naturall inclination in
me to hate all quarrells unlesse most extreamely
necessary and unavoidable: or my education
in the <hi>English Church,</hi> which of all other Sects
doth most professe moderation, I have alwaies
dearly esteemed those writers whether <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
or <hi>Protestant,</hi> which have endeavoured to
lessen the number of differences between Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to give the most moderate qualified
sences to differing opinions, and to attempt all
probable waies of reconciliation, as <hi>Hofmeiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
Wicelius, Franciscus à Sancta Clarâ,</hi> &amp;c.
among <hi>Catholiques;</hi> And <hi>Bishop Andrewes,
Montague, Grotius, Monsicur de la Millitiere,
Acontus,</hi> &amp;c. among <hi>Protestants.</hi> I was more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
in mine owne understanding convinc'd
that in very many points the differences between
<hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> was onely in words,
while in the meaning both parties agreed, as
concerning <hi>Freewill, Predestination, Iustification,
Merit of Good workes, sinnes Mortall and Veniall,</hi>
&amp;c. Nay further, that some negative points of
doctrine were maintained even by the Church
of <hi>England</hi> contrary to their owne grounds, that
is, contrary to the Universall consent of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
antiquity, as denying Sacrifice and Prayer
for the dead, and by consequence, Purgatory,
sacrifice of the Altar, Monachisme, Difference
betweene Evangelicall Councels and Precepts,
vowes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:46209:37"/>3. Hereupon it was that mine owne reason,
assisted by my love to Christian unity, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me that for worldly respects, or out of
feare of consequences ungratefull, even the
Church of <hi>England</hi> had divided it selfe from the
<hi>Catholique</hi> to a further distance, then justice,
truth, and charity would permit, I could
not answer it to mine owne reason and
conscience, if, instead of approaching to the
<hi>Catholique Church,</hi> I should run quite out of
sight from it, by communicating with those
<hi>Churches</hi> whose generall designe and study it is
to make the wound of division incurable, and
the breach every day wider and wider, among
whom it is a crime to talke of Reunion, in a
word who call it zeale to professe division
from the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> even in those very
points, wherein their consciences cannot
but tell them that they doe really agree
with it.</p>
               <p>4. Manifest testimonies of this more then
<hi>Donatisticall Spirit</hi> have been given by <hi>Calvin</hi> in
his most barbarous censure of that too too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
condescending booke of <hi>Cassander D E

                     </gap>ssicurs Grotius</hi> and <hi>de la Millitiere</hi> upon
occasion of those treatises by them published
tending to union. Yea so in love have they
shewed themselves with <hi>Schisme, quatenus Schisme,</hi>
so zealous to renounce that precious legacy of
<hi>Peace,</hi> which our Saviour at his last farewell to
the world left to his Church, that they multiply
division upon division even among themselves,
making <hi>Frusta de frusto,</hi> of the seamelesse

garment of Christ, denying Communion to one
another even for points in their own opinion of
no considerable importance. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> will
not communicate with the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> nor the

the <hi>Separatists</hi> with the <hi>English Protestants,</hi> And
whatsoever union the <hi>French-Calvinist Churches</hi>
boast of, they owe it entirely to the civill Power
there, for if that would allow them the liberty,
they would fall into as many devisions, as any of
their brethren.</p>
               <p>5. If sometimes an extraordinary fit of

demonstrate, that it was not love

qualities of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> the founders of
those Churches. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> admonisheth
us to judge of true or false <hi>Prophets by their
fruits:</hi> not that Orthodox teachers may not
sometimes live wicked lives; and Haeretiques,
laudably: But that those who take upon them
to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> that is, persons extraordinarily
raised up in Gods Church to publish new
doctrines, or to reforme generall abuses, such
men in their lives will signifie the spirit by
which they are moved, God never sending such
<hi>Prophets,</hi> but that he indowes them with a

wisdome and Holinesse: On the contrary

               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:46209:39"/>2. Now to judge of these <hi>two great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
by their fruits, I would not build so much,
nor be directed by reports of their adversaires,
that is the <hi>Calvinist writers</hi> concerning <hi>Luther,</hi>
nor the <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Hierom Bolsce</hi> concerning
<hi>Calvin:</hi> The Characters and pictures that
themselves have made of themselves will shew
them so unlike those, whose authority and
doctrine they pretended to assume, namely
<hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> that they will rather
appeare like persons that had agreed to divide
between them the whole Stock of Sin, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
taking for his share carnall sinns, as lust,
gluttony, and all manner of intemperance: and
<hi>Calvin</hi> appropriating to himselfe the sins
of the spirit, Pride, envy, malice, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. First for <hi>Luther,</hi> this testimony he gives
of himselfe (<hi>in Epist. ad Galat. c v.</hi> 14.) before he
was reformed, <hi>that being in the Monastery he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
stened his flesh with watching, fasting and prayer:
that he reverenced the Pope with great respect
for conscience sake: that he observed chastiry,
obedience, poverty: this, I did, sayth be, with a
simple heart, a good zeale, and for the glory
of God, fearefully apprehending the last day
of judgement, and from my heart thirsting
after salvation.</hi> This character he gives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
remembring the time that he was a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique:</hi>
But being turn'd a <hi>Reformer,</hi> what a
strange reformation doth he confesse that
that change made in him, he could not
for beare to tell the world such new doctrines as
these, (<hi>Luther. in Proverb cap, 31. v.</hi> 9.) There
is nothing in the world sweeter and more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46209:39"/>
then the love of a woman, if a man can atteine
to the enjoyment of it. (<hi>id. Tom. 7. in Ep. ad Wolfg.
fol 505.</hi>) And againe, <hi>If a man resolve to want
a woman, let him put off the name of a man, and
put on the nature of an Angell or Spirit. (id. in Ep.
ad Phil. fol. 334. and 345.</hi>) And againe, <hi>I burne
with a mighty flame of my untamed flesh. I which
ought to be fervent in Spirit, burne in the lust
of the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. Againe, <hi>These last eight
dayes now past I can neither write, nor pray,
nor study, being vexed partly with the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the flesh, partly with other troubles,</hi> &amp;c.
But saith he, <hi>it is sufficient for me that I know
the riches of the glory of God, and the Lambe
which takes away the sinnes of the world,</hi> Sinne
<hi>cannot seperate us from him, although we should
commit fornication or murder even a thousand
times a day.</hi> Sleydan, a very affectionate
Schollar of his, (<hi>Hist lib. 3. fol.</hi> 9.) reports that
<hi>he himselfe acknowledged his profession not to be
of lifcor manners, but of doctrine.</hi> And (<hi>lib. 2.
fol.</hi> 22.) that <hi>he wished that he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the Office of preaching, because
his manners and life did not answer his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
Now being reduced to this foule
condition, he, forgetting his old <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Monkish remedies</hi> of watching, fasting
and prayer, and having before renounced
his vow of Chastity, and cast away his <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>

scope to his lust, and privately, and (O horrible,)

<hi>that he himselfe could not believe what he
preached to others: and that Doctor</hi> Luther <hi>answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Praise and thankes be to God that this happens
also to others, for I had thought it had hapned only
to me.</hi> Now who cannot but admire the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Providence of God by which <hi>this pretended
Apostle</hi> was thus constreined to discover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the world in such a shape, as if he had
intended to fright all men from hearkning to
such a monster so abandoned to all filthinesse,
such an <hi>Apostate,</hi> and that against his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
not only from Faith, but even humanity?
I forbeare to let him publish his other vices, of
drunkennesse, gluttony, scurtility, &amp;c. (for he
hath left none of his good parts undiscovered in
the world) But one thing I cannot omit, a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
not to be parallel'd in any story, excepting
onely his fellow-reformer <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> namely,
that he should not be able to for beare to tell the

forced him to confesse) that the arguments
which moved him to leave <hi>Masse, (Luther. in lib.

him so steyned even with fleshly lusts also

my selfe permission to defile this paper with
transcribing his words; and not to repeat

befitting rather the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> then writings of

to omit likewise any blasphemous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
by which in immediate consequence
he destroyes the Mistery of the Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Justice and Sanctity of Almighty
God, making him formally the Author
of sinne; The only reading of his bookes
against his adversaries, and particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Cassander</hi> and <hi>Castalio,</hi> will acquaint any
man with what a spirit he was possessed and
agitated, a spirit that suggested to him words to
expresse the utmost extremity of Pride, Envie
and Malice that a humane soule can be capable
of Certainly if that be true (as it is blasphemy
to question it) which the spirit of God tells us,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46209:41"/>
                  <hi>That into an uncleane soule the spirit of discipline
will not enter:</hi> and againe, <hi>That God reveales
his mysteries to the humble and meeke:</hi> it was not
without a great care that God had of this part
of the world, that he suffered those two great
<hi>Teachers of Schisme</hi> to discover in themselves all
manner of uncleannesse both of the flesh and
of the spirit, as if on purpose, to the end that the
same persons while they were presenting to the
world the cup of their poysonous doctrine,
should likewise at the same time give warning
that that could be no other then poyson, which
proceeded from such hearts full of all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

Neither could I be mistaken to such a point

               </argument>
               <p>1. HAving proceeded thus far in my search
of a <hi>Church,</hi> and finding after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
disquisition that among all the Sects
in the <hi>Westerne</hi> parts of the world seperated
from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> I could not finde any
Congregation, unto the Communion of which
I could without hypocrisy adhere, if that
Church wherein I had been bred should come
to fayle (a supposition not only possible, but,
as the case began to be e're this time, even very
probable) I fell into a great perplexity of
minde, so great that I could not perceive any
cure for it, no not though God should blesse
the <hi>King of England</hi> so far as to give him
an entire victory over his enemies, and a
power to restore that Church to its former
lustre: For I now plainly perceived that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my title of being a Christian and a member
of Gods Church, all my interests and hopes of
blessednesse depended upon a Church, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did pretend either to <hi>indefectibility, infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
or <hi>authority</hi> obliging any other then only
those that live in her Communion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and
those not in conscience, but only upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of being deprived of certaine priviledgess
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46209:42"/>
and preferments belonging to <hi>English subjects;</hi>
upon a Church that never pretended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
or decide Articles of Faith, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then some few negative ones against
the Roman Church, or to fulminate <hi>Auathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
against whosoever submitted not to her
decisions, as the Ancient Church was wont
to doe; lastly upon a Church that, as, God
knowes, it appeares now manifestly, hath
no surer foundation than the prosperity of
the King, and continuance of his civill autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>2. To gaine some ease to my minde, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
my self to a re-examination of the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
I had against the other <hi>Reformed Churches:</hi>
None of which I could clearly take away:
and particularly concerning the want of a <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
succession of Pastors,</hi> I assured my selfe it
was not possible to be defended or excused,
nothing that I could invent my selfe, or learne
from others having any shew of the least proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
or deserving to be confuted.</p>
               <p>3. When this succeeded not, I travelled in
my minde over the <hi>Easterne Countryes:</hi> (for
still I was prepossessed that the maine ground
of the Roman Religion, namely the <hi>infallibility</hi> of
that Church, was as demonstratively confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
as any absurdity in <hi>Mathematiques:</hi> and
therefore though in the particular points of
differences I approached as near unto its belief
as <hi>Monsieur Grotius,</hi> or <hi>Monsieur de la Millitiere,</hi>
Yet that maine foundation being, as I thought,
ruinous, it was to no purpose to trouble my selfe
with any debate concerning that Church.)
But as ill successe I had in the East now, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46209:42"/>
nearer home: For of those Churches,
the <hi>Maronites</hi> I found, were in Communion
and beliefe agreeing with the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
The <hi>Abissiues</hi> were a schismaticall Church
divided both from the rest of the Easterne and
Westerne Churches now almost twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares since, namely upon the anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
of the <hi>Eutychian Heresie:</hi> the like may
be said of the <hi>Nestorians, Iacobites</hi> and other
Haereticall Churches in the <hi>Easterne Countryes:</hi>
As for the <hi>Graecian Churches</hi> they brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the same difficulties that the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> did, For almost in all points wherein
the <hi>English Church</hi> differed from the <hi>Roman</hi> they
agreed with it; in the Article of the <hi>Procession
of the Holy Ghost</hi> the <hi>English</hi> agreed with the
<hi>Roman</hi> against them, and their assuming equall
authority with the <hi>Pope</hi> was apparently an usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>

enough not to thinke my selfe safe enough
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46209:43"/>
in it. Yet it was a good while before I got any
sight of the <hi>Arke,</hi> and after I saw it, I did not
hastily suffer my selfe to be received into it, till I
saw there was no other way to escape drowning
left me.</p>
               <p>2. My first thoughts after so successelesse a
search of a Church were, not doubtingly, but
sollicitously expostulating in my mind, where
is the effect of that promise of Christ, that
the <hi>gates of Hell should not prevaile against his
Church?</hi> And, <hi>Behold I am with you till the end
of the world?</hi> I wondered that the Fathers
should so unanimously interpret the <hi>Church</hi> to
be that <hi>City seated on the top of a mountaine:</hi> For
I had in vaine sought both mountaines and
Valleyes, and could not get a sight of it. But
I concluded that certainly the fault was in
mine owne eyes, which some mist or disease
had blinded, and not in want of <hi>visibility</hi> in
the Church, since all the <hi>Promises of God in
Christ are in him, YEA, and in him AMEM.</hi>
And therefore that no preconceits of assurance
or demonstrations ought to hinder me from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
the pretentions of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
as well as the rest: That it was utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that the Promises of <hi>Christ</hi> should faile,
but that it was very possible that both my selfe
and Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> might be mistaken in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving
those arguments to be demonstrations,
which were not: That perhaps he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
fully the minde of his adversary M. <hi>Knot:</hi>
Or perhaps that the opinion and expression of
<hi>Infallibility</hi> combated by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> was
but an interpretation given by <hi>a private Doctour</hi>
of his sence of the Churches doctrine, &amp; so the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46209:43"/>
arguments against it not proceeding directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Church: However that it was very
reasonable, just and requisite seriously and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
to examine the true state of that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which if the Roman Church could to my
understanding justifie that she had not err'd in,
there would presently be an end of all my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells
and doubts about other particular contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.
For who will question or suspect the
truth of that Witnesse or Judge in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
speeches or assertions, that has once
in grosse approved himselfe to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
               <p>3. Had it not been for this point of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Infallibility, and some Philosophicall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
against the Reall Presence, &amp;c. I had
not lived thus long out of the communion of
the Roman Church; for I alwayes acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that there were in it very many advantages
and excellencies, to which no other Church had
the confidence to pretend. As 1. I could not
deny (having withall the Confession of the
most learned Protestants) that the Religion of
the present Roman Church is the very same
Religion which Saint <hi>Augustin the English A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
by the Mission of Saint <hi>Gregory the Great</hi>
planted in England, when he converted it from
Paganisme; so that me thought it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
an extravagant thing to separate now
from Rome for those very points, by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of which England became Christian;
Especially considering what persons Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
and Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> were, of what sublime
holinesse, and profound learning, and how
that Religion was confessedly conffirmed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46209:44"/>
Miracles. 2. I could not but admire and
infinitely approve the ingenuity of the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> in obliging all her children to interpret
Scriptures, and to conforme their beleife to the
generall consent of <hi>Fathers:</hi> Indeed the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> especially, made honourable
mention of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> but none but <hi>Roman
Catholiques</hi> proceed thus farre. 3. That if
we defined <hi>Haeresie</hi> and <hi>Schisme</hi> according to
the generall notion of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> viz. that <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi>
is a misbeleife innovated in points of
Faith contrary to the Doctrine universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Church; and <hi>Schisme</hi> an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
division of one part from the <hi>externall
Communion</hi> of the whole; Of all Churches in
the world the <hi>Roman</hi> could with least reason and
justice be accused of these two sinnes, for first,
She only receives and preserves the ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
and all the Councells and Synods of the
Church. Secondly all other Sects apparently
broke from her Communion, and all Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
were of her Religion before they innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and introduced new opinions. 4. That
the method by which the <hi>Roman Church</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
all emergent controversies, namely by the
authority of the present Church, however I was
then perswaded there was some usu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them: In so much as the proper difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> is; that if

and till that be done they breake not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:

suspicion of guilt in matter of Schisme, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
at least that worldly interests had influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

themselves with seeing themselves divided from

death beds at least, when all secular respects
are silent, desire reconciliation with the <hi>Roman
Churches.</hi> Whereas I believe there never was
heard any one example of a <hi>Roman Catholique,</hi>
which on his death-bed desired to forsake that
Communion to be incorporated into a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

advantage far more prevailing with me then
all the former (though at the first I had but an
imperfect view of it) namely, <hi>the eminent rules
of sanctity</hi> and <hi>spirituallity</hi> taught by most
prudent and pious directors, and practised after
a manner, that nothing in any of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46209:45"/>
The story and Order of my information in this
particular, I will reserve till the Conclusion of
this Narration. For the present I will content
my selfe with avowing that every day the
more neare and faire a prospect I had of the
beauty of Holinesse, my prejudices and objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against that Church, in which onely such a
jewell was to be found, diminished, till in the
end I could not free my selfe from partialli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
at least so farre as to wish that Truth might
not be found separated from so heavenly a
Companion. This Treatise being a Story rather
than a controversie, I thought my selfe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not to conceale my actions, though they
might be obnoxious to be esteemed imperfect
or faulty: and am content to heare and thanke
whosoever will vouchsafe to reprove mee for
them.</p>
               <p>4. I will not deny but that these seemed to
me very specious and alluring qualities, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
being of such a disposition, that is, one
that above all things in the world abhorred
quarrelling, one who though he durst not betray
necessary truths by professing the contrary, yet
in many cases would willingly have purchased
peace with silence: lastly, one that alwaies sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
his owne reason, and that was desirous
to find out authority, which might deserve to
have his reason submit it selfe to it.</p>
               <p>5. Yet notwithstanding all these invitations,
so prepossessed was I with the invinciblenesse of
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> arguments against the
<hi>infallibility</hi> of the Church, joyn'd with an
opinion that it was an essentiall requisite to
Communion with the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46209:45"/>
                  <hi>infallibility</hi> in the notion that I apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, that it was not without much violence
to my selfe that I could obteine from mine
owne reason permission to make a serious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the grounds of it. But at last, because
I would not accuse my self afterward of want of
ingenuity and fidelity in denying that to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church</hi> alone, which I had performed in
respect of all other Churches besides, even
to the <hi>Socinians, Nestorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians:</hi>
and besides, the affaires of <hi>England</hi> growing
every day in the greater decadency, I found
that I was likely to be forced to a reall necessity
of resolving that that <hi>Question,</hi> which at first
I reflected on onely upon an imagined
supposition, namely, <hi>Supposing the Church
of</hi> England <hi>should come to faile, to the
Communion of what Church I should then adjoyne
my selfe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>A Question</hi> this is, which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
never any one person of any one Sect
of Christians before was effectively forced to
determine: For never before was there any
Religion so wholly appropriated to any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or Government, as that such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
decaying, the whole frame of that Church
sunk, the professors thereof not being able to find
in the whole world any Church into which,
without renouncing their maine distinctive
principles, they could enter. Since the time that
it was Gods good pleasure to rejoyne mee
to <hi>the Rock from whence I was hewn,</hi> leading me
into the <hi>unity of his Church,</hi> I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that I might attribute this decay, and now
almost vanishing of the <hi>English Church</hi> to a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46209:46"/>
double intention of almighty God, the first,
To shew that when Religion, in substantiall
doctrines especially, is framed according to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of State, it does thereby as it were renounce,
and exempt it selfe from Gods Protection, and
by consequence not deserving his care, is not
likely to be long-liv'd: the second, to the end
to shew the curse that lies upon <hi>Schisme</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
it may seeme to have been Gods pleasure
that that Church which had more shew of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
than any other whatsoever, and that better
represented a form of the Ancient and most
glorious Church than any other Sect, should be
the first that should be undermined, to the end
that others seeing what has <hi>been done to a tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>1. VVEll, at last lifting up my heart in
dayly and almost hourely fervent
prayers unto almighty God for the direction of
his Holy spirit (a practise which, God knowes,
I never discontinued from the beginning of my
search, but now a more urging necessity sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the intention and fervour of my heart;) and
striving all I could to cleanse the scals, wherein I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46209:46"/>
was to weigh this so important a merchandise,
from all externall prejudices or allurements, or
any thing that might hinder my enquiry from
being perfectly ingenuous and unpartiall; and
almost vowing that, if God would be pleased
to <hi>set me on a rock higher than my selfe,</hi> giving
repose unto my minde, that onely knew <hi>quid
fugeret,</hi> but not, <hi>quò fugeret,</hi> I would consecrate
the remainder of my life to blesse and serve
him in the best and strictest manner I could
finde; and lastly, resolving to purchase truth
at the dearest rate possible, though with the
losse of fortunes, hopes, friends or Countrey;
I applyed my minde earnestly and diligiently
to the examination of the authority, and, so
much disputed, <hi>infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
to Catholiques a <hi>rock of foundation</hi> upon which
all Religion relyed, but to me hitherto <hi>a rock of
offence,</hi> and the maine considerable prejudice,
which drove me back whensoever I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to make any appoaches toward that
<hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. My next preparation and provision for
this businesse, was to informe my selfe, not so
much from particular <hi>Catholique Doctors,</hi> as
from the Church it selfe, in the decisions
of her Councels, what was her doctrine in this
point, and in what manner and termes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed:
my designe being to learne onely what
was so necessary to be believed in this Article,
as that without it, a man could not call himselfe
a <hi>Catholique,</hi> and with subscription to which
alone, a man might sufficiently justifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against all exception to deserve that title. For
this purpose I applyed my selfe to the Study of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46209:47"/>
the ancient received Councels, I perused dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
the <hi>Codex Canonum Ecclesiae Universae, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardus
Wormatiensis, Caranza's</hi> summe of the
Councels, but especially the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi>
and the <hi>Bull of Pope Pius quartus,</hi> desiring fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
information from severall learned <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</hi>
If I perused any particular Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
it was with intention to take notice of
such unquestioned and unsuspected Authors
as had most retrenched from this controversie all
particular opinions, and had expressed their
understanding of the Churches meaning with
the greatest condescendence and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>3. Having made <hi>extraits</hi> pertinent to my
purpose out of the forementioned <hi>Councells</hi> and
<hi>Authors,</hi> and having digested them, I deduced
corrollaries out of them, importing what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
the Church assumed to her selfe,
whence derived, and how limitted. And,
distrusting mine owne Collections, to confirme
my selfe further, and to assay whether those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
would be allowable by <hi>Catholiques</hi>
sufficiently informed of the true sense of the
Churches doctrine, I gathered out of my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
certaine <hi>Conclusions,</hi> which I digested into
a forme of <hi>Questions;</hi> These I sent to a worthy
and learned friend a <hi>Doctor of the faculty of Paris,</hi>
desiring his resolution, whether such senses as
I had given of the points mentioned, would
be receivable among <hi>Catholiques,</hi> or no. His
kindnesse and Charity moved him not onely
to take the trouble upon him of answering my
Questions, but likewise voluntary to publish in
print the Questions with his answers, to the end
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46209:47"/>
satisfaction might be given that he had said
nothing therein that any <hi>Catholique</hi> would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
Which resolutions of his I thought fit to
annex to this treatise.</p>
               <p>3. Besides all this, for my further information,
and because even during my education in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy</hi>
I had been advised, and was consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolved to embrace those doctrines, which
were most conformable to the profession of
the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> I conceived it necessary
to study diligently such Fathers writings especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as had been forced to maintaine the <hi>Churches
authority</hi> against <hi>Heretiques.</hi> Thereupon I betook
my self to the rending of the <hi>Ancient-Church Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi>
and besides others, I perused exactly
<hi>Tertullians Praescriptions against Haeretiques,</hi> &amp;c.
S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustines Epistles</hi>
and treatises against the <hi>Donatists, Manichaeans,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis,</hi> S. <hi>Hieroms Bookes
against</hi> the <hi>Luciferians, Iovinian</hi> and <hi>Vigilantius:</hi>
I had recourse likewise upon occasion to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
treatises of Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> and S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> S. <hi>Pacian</hi> &amp;c. And lastly I judged it
an effectuall way of atteining to the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the opinion of Antiquity concerning the
Church, to select the speciall <hi>Texts of Scripture,</hi>
wherein mention is made of the Church,
and to examine how the <hi>Fathers</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those <hi>Texts;</hi> and what inferences they
drew from them in their Sermons and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
in which I might be sure they spoke
without interest and passion, as having no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
in sight to combat withall, and therefore
were not likely to streine themselves in their
expressions. Such Texts of Scripture were these,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46209:48"/>
and the like, <hi>Die Ecclesiae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tell the Church,
and if he will not beare the Church, let him be to thee
as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi> And, <hi>Tu es Pertus,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build
my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevaile

                  <p>Successe of his enquiry into Councels and
ancient Fathers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THe answering of the Questions, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the perusing of those bookes
was the businesse of a good space of time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
twelve moneths, or more. The exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
paines and diligence employed by mee,
which otherwise would have brene tedious,
was much sweetned by the discovery every day
of new light. And I could not but observe the
strange effects of education and prejudice,
which made me believe my selfe to be sapara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in my beliefe from the <hi>Catholique Church</hi>
at a distance unmeasurable, when indeed I
was even at the doores: and I am certaine I
had been much sooner a <hi>Catholique,</hi> if I had
thought or rather indeed if I had considered
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46209:48"/>
(for if I had considered it well I might have
found sufficient ground to think so) that the
beliefe of the Churches doctrines nakedly as she
proposeth them, and in the latitude allowed by
her, had beene sufficient to have gained that
title. But I tooke those to be the necessary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> which were
onely the private opinions and expressions of
particular Doctors, And the <hi>simplicity of the
Articles of Christian Faith</hi> was clowded by
<hi>Scholasticall Metaphysicall tearms,</hi> which being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse,
nice, and unknown to Antiquity rendred
the doctrines themselves obscure and withall
new and suspected to me.</p>
               <p>2. And all this by a very pardonable fault of
mine: For from whom should I receive the
doctrines of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> when a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
is raised, but from the learnedst
<hi>Masters of Controversie?</hi> And how few among
them propose the points to be disputed between
them and the <hi>Protestants</hi> in the language of
the Church? Besides how few among them
are there, who in disputing will allow that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
which the Church apparently does?
There is scarce any Point of Controversie,
which is not severally interpreted, streitned,
or enlarged by severall <hi>Catholiques</hi> of severall
Orders and education: and most of them in
confuting the <hi>Protestants</hi> seeme very earnest
and make it almost their whole designe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their particular interpretations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
for Catholique doctrines. But with
very little or no successe: For a <hi>Protestant</hi>
will be very ready, and may with good reason
say, <q>
                     <hi>Though by being perswaded by you I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:46209:49"/>
a Roman Catholique, yet I might deny
all that you maintaine, and yet be a <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholique too, for I can produce Authors
which you dare not deny to be good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
that will not receive nor subscribe to
your expression and stating of this Point:
Therefore seek to convert them first, and then
come and dispute with me: Dispute like a
Catholique, for the question is not now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I shall be a Dominican, Jesuite, Scotist,
&amp;c. But whethe I ought to be a Catholique, or
no.</q> The truth is by these meanes, disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are endlesse, <hi>Catholiques</hi> themselves afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
answers and objections to <hi>Protestants</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Catholiques.</hi> Whereas if particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertists
as were indulgent as the Church is, &amp;
would be content to thinke that the termes
wherein <hi>Shee</hi> expressed her minde were the most
proper, their adversaries would quickly be
silenced, Controversies abated, and, by Gods
assistance, union in a short time happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored.</p>

liberty in censuring thus far the method of those
men by whom I have been so long a time so far

from my reunion to the Church: And on
the contrary, this happy successe in following
the direction of some few Catholique authours,
who separating particular opinions of Doctors
from necessary Catholique Doctrines, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
nothing upon me, but without assenting to

that that which healed me of my errours
and Schism, would not by Gods blessing want

               </p>
               <p>4. I cannot without ingratitude, in this place
and occasion omit a profession of that great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
I have with thankfulnesse to almighty
God, and respect to his happy instrument, to
acknowledge the efficacious influence that one
Treatise in speciall manner had to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and facilitating of my <hi>Conversion,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

almost all the considerable points of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,

hath approved and recommended the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
by his numerous blessings on it in the
Conversion of a world of wandering perverted
souls. From his ground it is especially that I
in this book both take this fashion and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of stating doctrines of faith, &amp; recommend
it to others, when they treat with Protestants:
And particularly from him did I receive Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that the very expresse terme of <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
was not of obligation to be made use of
in Disputation concerning the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
As likewise that the Doctrines of Faith
promulgated by the said Authority in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of generall Councells, did admit of many
more qualifications and restrictions then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Controvertists do think good to make
use of. So that if in this or any other point
any expressions found in this book shall seem
new or not so relishing to any, I must refer them
to the said Author and his Approvers, who no
doubt will ease me of the trouble of making
Apologies.</p>
               <p>5. But leaving this digression, I will at last
relate the successe I found in reading the <hi>Canons
of the Church,</hi> the forementioned books and
treatises of the Fathers, &amp;c. Which was, that I
thereby gained a distinct knowledge both of the
faith of the present Church, and what those
Ancients believed concerning the Churches
Authority: and this not by relying upon a few
select passages and Texts pick'd out by late
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46209:50"/>
Controvertists, but by observing the maine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
and intention of those Fathers, when the
very like Controversies in their times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streined
them to consider and unanimously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what they themselves thought, and what
they had received from their predecessours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Church, Haeresie, and Schisme.</p>
               <p>6. That therefore which I learned from them
pertinent to my present purpose I will set downe
in foure Conclusions, relating to foure principall
heads of controversie, namely, 1. <hi>Of the Rule of
Faith,</hi> that is, <hi>Scripture and Traditions unwritten.</hi>
2. <hi>Of the Judge of Controversies,</hi> that is, <hi>the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church. 3. Of the unity of the Church and the
danger of Heresy &amp; Schisme. 4. Of the perpetuall Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of the Church.</hi> To all which Propositions
respectively I will adjoyne the doctrine of the
present Roman Church, conteined especially in
the Councell of Trent; And likewise the beliefe
of Protestants; Concluding with an examination
whether the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> do best
conform themselves to the universal Ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Church &amp; her authority, &amp;c.</p>

any imputing to me sinister intentions, of
which they cannot be judges, shall say it
was either worldly discontent or ambition,
and not an evident conviction of truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to save my soule that moved me finally
to declare my selfe rather a follower of that
part which, to my understanding, followes an
universall and uninterrupted agreement of such
Teachers, as both sides agree not only to have
approached neerest to the fountaine of truth,
<hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> &amp; therefore to have had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46209:51"/>
meanes of informing themselves in <hi>Apostolicall
Tradition</hi> incomparably beyond us; But also
to have been extreamly cautelous and learned,
and so not easily obnoxious to be mistaken or
deceived, And likewise unquestionably pious
and vertuous, and therefore abhorring any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of seducing others for temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects:
Rather then three or foure new teachers,
in whom there is not only a visible want of all
these good qualities, but on the contrary such as
have not been able to forbeare to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be worse men, more polluted with Lust,
Gluttony, Sacriledge, Pride, Malice, Envie, &amp;c.
then without their own confession their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
could with a good conscience have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
or but suspected them; And the effect of
whose innovations ha's manifestly been nothing
but <hi>Atheisme, profanenesse, bloodshed, confusion

of Catholique Religion,</hi> in foure <hi>Conclusions,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
<hi>foure generall points of Controversie:</hi> The
sense of which Conclusions I found evidently
and uniformly delivered by the ancient Fathers;
and by the light of the said truths, through
Gods grace and goodnesse, I became entirely
undeceived, and by their direction, I was led as
it were by the hand into the Gates of that <hi>City,

I. CONCLUSION.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The entire Rule of Faith, comprised in the
Doctrines delivered by Christ and his
Apostles immediately to the Church, is
conteyned not only in Scripture but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in unwritten Traditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. FOr the former part of this Conclusion,
viz. <q>That the Rule of Christian Faith
(&amp; obedience) is no other then the Doctrines
(and Praecepts) delivered immediately by
Christ and his Apostles to the Church,</q> And
by consequence that the present Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not to any new Revelations, or Power
to make any new Articles of Christian Faith, or
to propose any Doctrines under that title other
then such as <hi>Shee</hi> has received by Catholique
Tradition, it will be unnecessary paines to
prove out of the Fathers, since I doe not know
any Christians, who deserve that title, that
doubt of it. Indeed the <hi>Calvinists</hi> (earnest
to find all occasions to heighten their <hi>Schisme</hi>)
charge the Catholique Church, as if she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
within this compasse other Doctrines,
Decrees and Decretalls, &amp;c. But most unjustly,
since there is no warrant or ground given them
to lay this aspersion upon the Church, and all
Catholiques generally renounce it.</p>
               <p>3. But as for that which followes in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
viz. <q>That this Rule of Faith is not
conteined entirely and expresly in Scripture
alone, but likewise in unwritten Traditions:</q> In
this lyes the maine difference betweeen the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church and all other Sects both anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46209:52"/>
and moderne; They all and alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
in this, <q>that the Scripture is to be the
only Rule, and themselves judges and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of the sence of it, at least for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or if not they, no body, however not
the present Church:</q> and on the contrary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
in all ages unanimously joyning in the
contradiction of that ground, and affirming
that all Doctrines of Faith were not indeed, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ever were intended to be entirely express'd in
Scripture; And that <q>Scriptures ought not to
be interpreted by any private spirit or reason,
any other way then according to the line of
Ecclesiasticall Tradition.</q>
               </p>
               <p>4. Concerning the Rule of Faith therefore,
let us aske our <hi>Fathers</hi> that were before us how
they were instructed in this point, and among
them the first testimony will be afforded us by

S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> (2 <hi>Thes. cap.</hi> 2.) From hence it

Synod of Trent, &amp;c. Clearly perceiving that
this truth and discipline (<hi>namely, the Doctrine
of</hi> Christ <hi>and his</hi> Apostles) is contained in
bookes, written, and unwritten Traditions,
which were received from Christs Mouth, or
delivered as it were from hand to hand from
the Apostles, to whom the Holy Ghost dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, hath arrived even to us: Following the
Oxthodox examples of the Fathers, receives
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46209:54"/>
and venerates with an equall affection of duty
and reverence all bookes as well of the Old as
New Testament, since one God is the authour
of both, as likewise the Traditions themselves
whether perteining to Faith or Manners, as
dictated either by Christs own Mouth, or by

far the Councell of Trent.</q>

it can be proved manifestly to him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in the written word of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Church of England</hi> (Art. 6. <hi>of English
Church)</hi> in particular makes this one of her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Articles, <q>That the Holy Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
all things necessary for salvation: so
that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may
be proved thereby, is not to be required of
any man, that it should be believed as an
Article of Faith, or to be thought requisite
necessary to salvation. <hi>But withall professeth
that</hi> The three Creeds, <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
Creed, and that which is commonly
called the Apostles Creed ought throughly to
be received and believed.</q> Moreover that she
receiveth the foure first Generall Councells:
yet not saying that she thinkes her selfe obliged
to the one or other for the authority of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or the Councells, for if so, she would be
obliged likewise to accept of and submit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Traditions and Councells, as likewise
many points and practises confirmed in those
Councells, besides the Mysteries of the Blessed
Trinity, many of which notwithstanding shee
relinquishes, if not condemnes: Yea on the
contrary for those three Creeds she gives this
reason for her admitting of them <q>because they
may be proved by most certaine warrants of
holy Scripture.</q> And how little or no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
she allowes to the Church, or Generall
Councells shall be shewn in the next Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46209:55"/>
For the present therefore, taking those
words of accepting the three Creeds and foure
Councells rather for a complement of Civility
to Antiquity, then as importing any reall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to admit any judge or Rule of Faith, but
only Scripture and that interpreted by her selfe,
for her selfe at least: Come we to consider how

almost that are and ever were doe rely,
and therefore in all likelyhood, since so many
millions of people of all Sects and in all ages
have been concern'd to study and make it good,
should in reason be best upheld: Yet to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of all other controversies, this
is the most weakly grounded, and guiltily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>2. The experience I have of the particular
disposition of English Protestanats (properly
so called) and the happinesse I have enjoyed in
the acquaintance and friendship with very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46209:56"/>
many the most considerable persons for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Prudence, and Piety in that Church, gives
mee warrant to say this of them, that there
is no point of Controversy that they are
more unwilling to touch upon then this of
<hi>Scriptures being the onely Rule, and no visible
Judge to interpret it,</hi> I meane, as to the
positive maintaining thereof (for as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the disputing against the infallibility of
the Church, there is none more ready to make
Objections then they.) One reason hereof may
be, because the English Church, out of gratitude
to the Ancient Church and Fathers, which have
hitherto maintained their Ecclesiasticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
against the Calvinists, till they came
to dispute with fire and sword, professeth therfore
greater reverence to antiquity and Tradition
then any other Sect whatsoever; And therefore
her children are unwilling to renounce or oppose
that great army of Saints &amp; Martyrs of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times, who unanimously acknowledge
that besides Scriptures they had received from
their Ancestors Traditionary Doctrines and
Ritts, and these so universally spread through
all Churches Easterne and Westerne, no man
being able to name any particular fallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of them, that they were as firmely assured
that they proceeded from the Apostles, as that
the books of Scripture proceeded from the same
Authours. Yea, for many of these Traditions
greater proofe might be made of their authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
and Divine Originall, then of most books
of Scripture, in as much as they were from the
beginning universally apparent in the Practise
of the Church, visibly shining in their <hi>Publique
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46209:56"/>
liturgies,</hi> for example, <q>Prayer for the Dead, and
by consequence, Purgatory, that is, a State of
deceased Christians capable of being bettered
and eased by the Charity and Devotions of
the living, Sacrifice of the Masse, and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it for the Quick and Dead, Adoration of
Christ really present there, Baptisme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
Non-rebaptization of Heretiques,
Observation of Ecclesiasticall Feastes, Lent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasts,
&amp;c. Invocation of Saints, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Reliques, Images, &amp;c. Practise
of Crossing themselves, Rites in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
Sacraments, &amp;c.</q> Whereas the
bookes of the New Testament, especially the
Epistles and Apocalypse, being written upon
emergent occasions, and for the present neede
of particular Persons and Churches, were a
great while before they could be generally
dispersed, and great caution and circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
used before they would be admitted into
the Cannon: and being all, except some few
that have perished, received there, it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to prevent infinite corruptions in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
since every one had leave to transcribe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>3. A second reason why English Protestants (I
speake knowingly at least of my selfe and not a
few others) dispence the more easily with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for examining the sufficiency of this Rule
of Faith is, because there being but two ways i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable
of assigning such a Rule, that is, either
expresse Scripture alone, or that joyn'd with Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Tradition, which is to be received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the authority, or (as the Schooles call it) the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Church;</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that they can unanswerably confute this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46209:57"/>
fallibility, they take it for granted that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is the only Rule, and therefore surcease
from undergoing the paines of diligent enquiry
how firmely their foundation is layd, and what
course to take for the answering of those inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable
inconveniences which follow upon that
ground, for feare, lest if both these foundations
should come to shrinke, Christianity it selfe
would become questionable, and a way made
for direct Atheisme. Hereupon it is that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
their writers have proceeded the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
way, willingly undertaking to contradict
the Churches infallibility; and it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
extreame violence that they can be brought
to maintaine their owne grounds; Which when
the earnestnesse of <hi>Catholiques</hi> extorts from
them, though they must conclude, for only
Scripture, and No-judge, yet either shame or
remorse makes them deferre somewhat to the
ancient Churches authority, as it were excusing
themselves that they dare not suffer themselves
to be directed by her; For if by her as a visible
Church, then by all Churches succeeding her
to these our times.</p>
               <p>4. In these latter times since that great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Champion against the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
Mr.</hi> Chillingworth published his booke in
defence of Doctour <hi>Potter,</hi> this guilt of English
Protestants ha's beene farre more conspicuous.
His objections against the Church, that is, his
destructive grounds are avowed and boasted of
as unanswerable in a manner by all: but his
positive grounds, that is, the making onely
Scripture, and that to be interpreted by every
single mans reason, to be the Rule of Faith,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46209:57"/>
this is at least waved, if not renounced by
many: But most unjustly: since there is no
conceivable meanes how to finde out a third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
way of grounding beliefe and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
controversies besides divine revelation
proposed and interpreted authoritatively by the
Church, or meere Scripture without any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
interpretation, as shall be demonstrated
hereafter. Hence the generall Character given
of himselfe and his booke is, <q>That he has
had better luck in pulling down buildings,
than raising new ones, <hi>and</hi> that he has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
his sword much more dexterously than
his buckler.</q> And yet as if there were no
need either of house or buckler, or as if Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
did thinke themselves secure from wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and danger, if Catholiques were expulsed
and wounded, No man appeares with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
to provide himselfe of any safer way of
defence, then that which Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath
afforded. Yea Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> himselfe (his
friends know the reason of it) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>utterly refused to
answer those unconquerable confutations of his
positive grounds, and those fearefull consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
charged upon them: being satisfied, or at
least making a countenance before those that
knew him not inwardly, that he was satisfied
of the firmenesse of his Rule of Faith, as long
as an exact particular answer to all his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
against the <hi>Churches infallibility</hi> was not
published.</p>
               <p>Those who have had a particular acquaintance
with that extraordinary sublime wit and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
will, or at least, can, witnesse with me
that thus much as I have said in a seeming cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

of him is true. Considering the long and
inward friendship, and the many obligations I
had to him, I had absteined from this, but that
the cause in hand obliged me thereto; and but
that his book alone had the principall influence
upon me to shut up my entrance into Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
unity: I shall therefore have frequent
occasion hereafter in this Narration to weigh
both his proofes and objections, at least such of
them as were most powerfull with me: yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving

                  <p>Inconveniences following Protestants Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Only-Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Fathers refuse to dispute with Haeretiques
from only Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. VVHen I was forced to weigh with
circumspection and fidelity this
maine <q>fundamentall Position of Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture is the only
Rule of Faith, or, That all things necessary
to be believed are conteined expresly in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</q>
what a world of unavoidable inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
did presently throng into my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iog,
and upon how meere sand did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to be laid! For the inconveniences.
1. It is impossible upon this ground that ever
there should be found a way to end any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46209:58"/>
as shall be demonstrated in the next
Conclusion. 2. There can scarce be named one
Haeretique but tooke the same for a ground of
his Haeresy, and generally the Fathers protest
against this ground, reducing them to Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
Tradition, and the authority of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church.</p>
               <p>2. For a proofe whereof we may consider the
particular Treatises and bookes of the ancient
Fathers which they wrought directly for this
purpose, namely to shew what method and
grounds their Ancestors and reason it selfe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
to be used and proceeded upon in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with any Haeretique whatsoever: and we
shall finde that the Catholiques of these dayes
doe shew themselves indeed sons of those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Fathers, exactly treading their steps
in appealing to Scripture and generall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from which there lyes no prescription or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale:
And on the contrary, that the Haeretiques
and Schismatiques of our times have been as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in pursuing the traces of their Ancestors,
pretending only Scripture, but relying upon the
Pride of their owne hearts, and thinking that
their interpretations and wrestings of Scripture
ought to prevaile against all present and past
authority how universall soever for place, and
how uninterrupted soever for succession: The
treatises anciently written for this purpose are
S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> against Haeresies, <hi>Tertullian de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptionibus,</hi>
S. <hi>Cyprian de unitate Ecclesiae,</hi> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin
de unitate Ecclesiae, contra Epistolam Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,
de utilitate credendi,</hi> &amp;c. S. <hi>Vincentius Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinensis
his Commonitorium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. In particular may be witnesse of this <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46209:59"/>
(Tert. de Praescrip. cap. 19.)</hi> 
                  <q>There is no
good got by disputing out of Texts the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
but either to make a man sick or mad.
<hi>And againe,</hi> There ought therefore to be no
appealing to Scripture, nor disputing out of
them, since by that meanes either neither
side will be victorious, or it is a hazard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>And againe,</hi> But hitherto we have in
generall proceeded against all Heresies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by assured, reasonable and necessary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
against all Heresies, that they are
to be excluded from all disputation out of
Scripture. Witnesse likewise S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
Haeresies and doctrines of perversenesse
ensnaring soules, and sinking them into
Hell have risen from no other fountaine,
but this, that Scriptures which are good, are
understood not well, and that which is not
well understood in them, is rashly and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
maintained.</q> 
                  <hi>Againe, the</hi> same Father
<hi>brings in the</hi> Arian <hi>Bishop</hi> Maximinus <hi>thus chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
a Catholique, (id con. Maximin. Ar. Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum lib. 1.)</hi>
                  <q>If thou wilt produce any thing
out of divine Scriptures which are common
to all, it is necessary we should hearken to
thee: But these speeches which are not in
Scripture are in no case receivable by us.</q> The
same Father in the conclusion of the same books
brings in another Heretique using these words,
<hi>I desire and wish to be a Disciple of the Holy
Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thou shalt affirme any thing out of
the Scriptures, if thon shalt produce a quotation of any
thing written there in any place, We desire to be
found disciples of the Holy Scriptures.</hi> Againe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
other passages to the same purpose may be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46209:59"/>
seen in severall other parts of his workes as in
<hi>Epist</hi> 222. and in <hi>lib. de Gen. ad lit. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 9.
and <hi>de fide &amp; Symb. cap.</hi> 9. and <hi>in Joan. Tract.</hi> 18.
Lastly, the same Father disputing against <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius</hi>
the Grammarian, saith, <hi>(id. lib. 1. con. Cresc.
Gram. cap. 33.)</hi> 
                  <q>Yet notwithstanding although
there is produced no example of this
out of Scriptures Canonicall, we doe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
observe the truth of the same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
when we doe that which is approved by
the Church, whose authority the Scriptures
recommend.</q> See suitable passages <hi>in l. 5. de. Bap.
cont. Donat. cap.</hi> 23. and <hi>de Unit. Eccl. cap.</hi> 19. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
againe S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> (S. <hi>Hieron. dialog. cont.

                  <q>Neither let them please themselves,
if sometimes they seem to make good their
assertions out of some Texts of Scripture, for
the Devill likewise sometimes quoted Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for Scriptures consist not in the bare
words, but in sence.</q> It is true indeed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sometimes commend the fulnesse of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as S. <hi>Basil</hi> saying, <hi>whatsoever is without
the Scripture is sinne,</hi> but withall he gives us a
Rule to know his meaning, shewing that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the last quotation out of S. <hi>Augustin</hi>
against <hi>Cresco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>us</hi> the Grammarian, that may be
said to be virtually conteined in Scripture,
which is delivered by the Church, whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is recommended to us in Scripture, so
sayes S. <hi>Basil</hi> likewise, <hi>(id. lib. de Spiritu sancto.)
It is an Apostolique thing to persist constantly in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
not written, for saith the Apostle, I praise
you in that you are mindfull of whatsoever thing
came from me, and observe the Traditions which I
have given you.</hi> Besides in some cases there may
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46209:60"/>
be controversies about points, which are not
grounded upon Orall Tradition but only
Scripture.</p>
               <p>4. A third inconvenience following the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
position is this, That since undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there were in the Primitive Church Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in great number, besides what is expressed
in Scripture, I could not imagine what was
become of them, or how it should be possible
they should come to be lost having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
generally through the whole Church,
and most of them shining in the practise of it.
To salve this inconvenience, Protestants ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impudently give the lye to all the Fathers,
and say without the least proofe that there were
none at all: Or in England there being under-Sects
which by Scripture alone could not be
confuted, as Puritans, Anabaptists, Sabbatari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
&amp;c. they are forced to acknowledge some
few Traditions of such a nature, although there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they destroy their maine foundation of
Only-Scripture; For by the Traditionary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Non-rebaptization they conclude the
Anabaptists to be Heretiques, that is, erring in
a necessary point of doctrine: Yet themselves
renounce doctrines and practises delivered by
a far more full Tradition; So great effect hath
interest in that Church. But what will become
of S. <hi>Basils</hi> saying before quoted, <q>That the
day would faile him if he should undertake to
enumerate all the Traditions left by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
in the Church, not mentioned in
Scripture?</q> For all, that even the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
Protestants will allow for such, may
be reckoned five times over in a minute of an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46209:60"/>
hower. Considering therefore that such Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being visibly manifest for the most part in
the practise of the Church, are far more easily
preserved then any writing can be, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow that the rest of that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
are extant in the Roman Church, as may be
proved of most of them before reckoned by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of Ancient Fathers. <hi>(Vid. sup. c. 3.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. A fourth inconvenience to my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
unavoidable by Protestants, and a great
proofe of the truth of the Doctrine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church is this: Though Protestants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
deny that the points of Controversie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
between them and the Roman Church
were universally received by the Ancient
Church, as <q>Invocation of Saints, adoration
of Christ, as present in the blessed Sacrament,
Prayer for the dead, &amp;c.</q> Yet they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but that in many of the Fathers proofes of
these doctrines may be found to shew that such
was at least their particular opinions: Now if
generally the Ancient Church had agreed with
Protestants both in denying such doctrines and
practise, received now in the Roman Church,
and likewise in making only-expresse-Scripture
the Rule to judge by; it could not be avoided
but that some Synods or Fathers would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of such pretended errours in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of other Fathers, and likewise would
have produced some of those Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
now made use of by Protestants for that
purpose: a thing they are so far from, that on the
contrary we find that many of the Fathers infer
the same doctrines from the same Texts that
Catholiques now do. And Protestants, though
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46209:61"/>
they alledge some passages of Fathers, by which
they may seem consequently to destroy such
doctrines, and to contradict their owne formall
assertions in other places, yet are not able to
produce so much as one Text of Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
by any Father to confute any one such
pretended errour. Which is a thing very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and will argue either that no man in the
Ancient Church took notice of such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
dangerous speeches of so many Fathers,
or that they understood not the plaine Texts
of Scripture, if Protestants grounds be true:
or upon Catholiques grounds, since it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
but they must have taken notice of
such opinions, and since they certainly did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
plaine Texts of Scripture, that therefore
not disputing out of Scripture, as Protestants
doe, they were so far from believing such opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
to be errours deserving a Schisme, that
they all of them agreed in receiving them as
Catholique Truths. Other inconveniences
which without hope or possibility of remedy do
arise from making Scripture alone (secluding
not only Traditions but likewise any visible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
interpreter) to be the only Rule and
Judge of Controversies, shall be reserved to be
examined in the next Conclusion concerning
the Authority of the Church in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>1. AS I said before, since Protestants and all

even themselves being judges, so many glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Saints, Confessors, Martyrs, Bishops, &amp;c.
were renowned not onely in their owne,
but all succeeding times, dissipated armies
of Haeretiques, propagated the Kingdome of
Christ over the world, subdued Idolatry, and
made it utterly to vanish though supported
with the force of the whole Roman world,
and in fine arrived to a supereminent degree
of glory in Paradice; And since in stead of
this so successefull a way, they have chosen to
walke every man in a severall path through those
narrow, crooked and at least very dangerous,
(because new) wayes of a proud selfe-assuming
presumption in interpreting only-Scripture each
man according to his own fancy &amp; interest, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the example of no antiquity, but only
ancient Heretiques; in all reason they should
have taken order to have justified themselves
herein after a more then ordinary manner, they
ought to have contributed all the invention
and skill of all the best wits in each Sect to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46209:62"/>
this common foundation of only Scripture,
and no visible judge, beyond all other points of
difference.</p>
               <p>2. And so no doubt they have to the utmost ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of the subject: But no skill can serve to
build a firme secure edifice upon sand: and
private reason, or fancies of inspiration are
more weake and sandy then even sand it
selfe. For proofe hereof let us consider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
proofes and reasons which they alleadge
to assert this their fundamentall position, viz.
<hi>that the entire Rule of Faith is the written word of
God, of which there is not extant any visible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
interpreter.</hi> Proofes hereof produced by
them are 1. Negative, invalidating such Texts
of Scripture as are alledged by Catholiques, and
expounded by Fathers to prove Traditions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written:
and 2. Positive, drawne from other
Texts expressing the sufficiency and perfection
of Scripture.</p>
               <p>3. Some Texts by Catholiques produced to
prove Traditions, and those concerning points
of Doctrine as well as practise or ceremonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what is written in the Evangelicall books,
are among others these following out of S. <hi>Paul,
(2 Thes. cap. 1. ver. 15.)</hi>

so unanimously acknowledged by the

                  </gap> in the plaine importance of
them (for there was no need to call their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
interpretations, there being not the
least difficulty or obscurity in them to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
Protestants, especially the <hi>Calvinists</hi> (for
the Church of England hath been more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous)
have been forced to make use of the
poorest guiltiest shift imaginable, which is, to
translate the word<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>enseignements,
instructions, or by any other word, but what
reason and rules of Grammar would require,
namely, Traditions. That which moved them
hereto was apparently a resolution to seduce
the people: for nourishing them up in the
hatred of the Church, in contempt of her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in rejecting all her Traditions, so far that
whatsoever is proposed under that title of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is not only not accepted, but scornfully
rejected by them as supposed most certainly false
and superstitious; if it should appeare that
the Scripture it selfe should referre us to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
doctrines under the notion of <hi>Traditions,</hi> the
very sound of that word in Scripture would
perhaps make them suspect that their Ministers
had abused them.</p>
               <p>5. But moreover for a helpe, if this poore
subtility should come to be discovered by their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46209:63"/>
Proselites, it is further answered by them, that
S. <hi>Paul</hi> might very well referre <hi>Timothy</hi> or the
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> to the summe of Christian doctrine
by him before preached, and not yet reduced to
writing, because the entire Canon of Scripture
was not yet compleated and sealed up; but
when that was finished, afterward Christians
were not to trust to their memories, but to have
recourse to expresse Scripture, as is implyed by
severall Texts of Scripture denoting its abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
sufficiency for all uses and necessities.</p>
               <p>6. For answer to this way of arguing it will
be sufficient to say, that whatsoever is here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by Protestants is meerly <hi>gratis dictum,</hi>
there being not the least intimation given by
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other Evangelicall Author, that
the Apostles had any intention to write among
them a body of the Christian law, searce any
booke of the New Testament having been
written, but only upon some particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and for the use of some particular person
and Church: and on the contrary it appearing
expresly both by Scripture and Tradition that
the Apostles, in all the Churches founded
by them, left a <hi>depositum</hi> both of the doctrines
and discipline of Christianity uniforme and
compleate, not relating at all to any thing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or afterward to be written.</p>

not only opposing the former evident quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for Traditions, but in dividing from and
condemning all Antiquity that taught the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and not onely so, but relyed upon Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
alone in severall points confessed by them
not to be visible in Scripture, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
anathematized and utterly vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
severall Heretiques, who thought it a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
warrant to be dispensed from severall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
taught, and practises continued in the
Church, because the Scripture was silent in them.</p>
               <p>2. Of all others the most considerable Text
of Scripture alledged by Protestants, and most
prized by them as efficacious to prove its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
&amp; sufficiency to be an intire Rule of Faith
is this speech of S. <hi>Paul to Timothy, (1 Tim. c. 3. v.
16. 17) Omnis Scriptura divinitius inspirata, utilis
est, &amp;c. All Scripture divinely inspired is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for teaching, for arguing, for reproving and
for instructing in righteousnesse, that the man of
God may be perfect, instructed to every good worke.</hi>
Here, say they, it is apparent that <hi>S. Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
Scripture to be profitable for all
kindes of spirituall uses, teaching, arguing, &amp;c.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46209:64"/>
and moreover in such a perfection that by it
not onely ignorant persons but even the man of
God, that is, he who is a Teacher of Gods
people, who by his office is obliged to a higher
perfection of knowledge, may be made perfect,
and that, to every good worke.</p>
               <p>3. To this it is answered 1. That by reading
the verse immediately going before, we shall be
informed both of what Scriptures S. <hi>Paul</hi> there
speakes, and in what sence and with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
they are profitable for the forementioned
uses and ends: the words are, <hi>Tu verò permane,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Doe thou (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Timothy) persevere in those
things which thon hast learned, knowing of whom
thou hast learned them, and because from thy
childhood thou hast knowne the Holy Scriptures,
which may instruct thee to Salvation, by faith
which is in Christ Jesus: For all Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inspired is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. By the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of these words it appeares that those
Scriptures to which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
and glorious character were the same
in which <hi>Timothy,</hi> now a Bishop, had been
instructed from his childhood, that is, the
Scriptures of the Old Testament: For how few
of the Evangelicall writings were published
even now that he was a Bishop, and certainly
scarce any at all when he was a child. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Pauls</hi>
designe therefore in this passage is evidently
this, viz. to exhort <hi>Timothy</hi> to remaine constant
<hi>(in iis quae ei tradita fuerant)</hi> in those Christian
verities and precepts by the Apostle delivered
in trust to him not in writing, but orall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
For which purpose he uses these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
namely 1. the consideration of the sublime
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46209:64"/>
Apostolicall Office of himselfe his instructour,
immediately and miraculously called and
enabled to that imployment by <hi>Christ from</hi>
heaven, therefore he sayes, knowing of whom
thou hast learned these Evangelicall truths.
2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> The conformity of these new revelations to
those ancient ones of the Old Testament, in
which <hi>Timothy</hi> had been instructed from his
childhood, in which he might perceive, though
obscurely traced, certaine markes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyes
of the Gospell, and so be easilier en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to beleive what S. <hi>Paul</hi> had plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to him. 3. Upon this occasion he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the great profit which a Christian may
find by having recourse to the old Testament,
as having great efficacy to make a man wise
unto salvation; but this not of themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but joyned with the Faith, which is in
Christ Jesus, and perseverance in believing the
Christian verities delivered by orall Tradition.
So that the Apostles might very well conclude,
All Scriptures (of the Old Testament giving
testimony to the Gospell) being inspired by God
are very profitable (not entirely of themselves
sufficient) for teaching, arguing, reproving,
instructing in righteousnesse; And that by
them the man of God, (even a Christian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop)
may be made perfect or enabled to every
good worke (that is, as he expresseth the same
sence in the former verse, <hi>wise unto Salvation;</hi>
but upon condition that they be <hi>joyned with the
Faith</hi> (or Gospell) <hi>of Christ Iesus,</hi> and <hi>perseverance
therein.)</hi> This to my understanding seems to be
the proper naturall importance of this Text
of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> so far from evincing what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46209:65"/>
would collect from it, that it confirmes
the quite contrary.</p>
               <p>4. But let it be supposed (which is impossible
to be evinced) that the Apostle speakes here by
way of Prophecy of Evangelicall Scriptures
not yet written, but with respect to the
time when they should be perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated;
he sayes onely they are profitable, not
sufficient, to produce the mentioned effects and
end; He excludes not the Church interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them; in a word, He referres expresly to
orall Tradition; And by consequence he is
far from saying any thing that may warrant the
Protestants upon pretence from these words, to
relinquish the way which all ancient Christians
and Fathers of the Church walked in, and to
walke in that which, as hath been shewed by
irrefragable testimonies, has beene traced
by all and onely Heretiques. So far is he from
saying, or giving warrant to any to say, <q>Reject
all things that you finde not expresly contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Scriptures, though the whole world upon
whose only testimony you receive Scriptures
affirme that they received other things from
the same authority, Keep your selves close to
that sence of Scriptures which your own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
or interests shall suggest unto you, and
admit neither fathers nor Church to interpret
them to you, believe your own understandings
onely, which you may call the inspirations of
the Holy Ghost, if you please, And content
not your selves with deceiving your selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
with such fancies, take authority upon
your selves to destroy all publique authority,
and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46209:65"/>
and glosses upon the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of others.</q> This S. <hi>Paul</hi> ought to
have said, if he had purposed to justifie
the grounds of Protestantisme: But this I
could not conceive to be his meaning, and
therefore I tooke it to be my best course to be
misled by Fathers, Councells and the whole
Catholique Church.</p>
               <p>5. A second proofe for the sufficiency of
Scripture alone to be an entire Rule of Faith,
and of great moment among many Protestants
is that speech in the end of the Revelation, <hi>(Rev.
c. 22. v. 18. 19.) Contestor enim omni audienti,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>I doe protest to every one that hears the words
of the Prophecy of this book: If any one shall
adde unto these, God shall adde unto him the
plagues written in this booke. And if any one
shall diminish from the words of this Prophecy,
God shall take away his part out of the booke
of life, and out of the Holy City, and out of
those things which are written in this book.</q> The
weight of this Text is much more pressing in
their opinion by reason of the situation of it in
the close of the whole body of Evangelicall
writings; and likewise by the advantage of a
Parallel place in the end of <hi>Moyses</hi> his law.</p>
               <p>6. Hereto it is answered that this Text is so
far from obliging us to understand it in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of Evangelicall doctrines, that expresly
and <hi>in terminis terminantibus</hi> it restreines it
selfe onely to the Prophecies conteined in this
particular booke, for bidding any one to presume
to make any change in it, either by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and interpolation of other Prophecies
pretended to be written by the same Divine
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46209:66"/>
Author (a thing practised by Heretiques in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evangelicall writings when this booke
was published) or by razing out any Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
herein conteined, (as some Heretiques
likewise had done in other Apostolicall bookes.)
So that this author is so farre from forbidding
any other revelations of divine doctrines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those already published, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any thing here said, <hi>Agabus</hi> and Saint
<hi>Philips</hi> daughters might, if they had pleased,
have set forth their Prophecies, so they had
done it without injury or disparagement to
the Apocalypse. Even as <hi>Moyses</hi> by such like
words signified that in his writings were contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the summe of that law delivered by God on
Mount Sinai, at least as much of it as was fit
to communicate for the present to the people,
and therefore forbad any man to change his
writings any way: Yet notwithstanding, it is
apparent that not onely the Jewes, but likewise
the Ancient Fathers believed that besides this
written law, <hi>Moyses</hi> himselfe delivered to the
Preists and Sanedrim many unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
relating to the law it selfe, some of which
are mentioned in Evangelicall Scripture, as the
<q>institution of the order of Exorcists, the
mingling of water with the blood of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
wherewith <hi>Moyses</hi> sprinckled the
people, Skarlet wooll and hyssope to be used
in all aspertions, the sprinkling the booke of
the Covenant with blood, The names of
Jannes and Mambres the antagonists of
<hi>Moyses,</hi> and the combat betweene an Angell
and the Devill about <hi>Moyses,</hi> his body, &amp;c.</q>
Besides, many Holy men published bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46209:66"/>
the Jewes acknowledged of divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
wherein were many Mysteries of Faith not
onely more expresly, but <hi>de novo</hi> conteined,
and not at all declared by <hi>Moyses,</hi> many wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of devotion, Precepts of Piety and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
&amp;c. Onely <hi>Moyses</hi> his bookes have beene
received to this day under the notion of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
law of the Jewish Common-wealth,
a title that other writings never challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>7. As concerning the advantage taken from
the position of the forementioned Text in the
close of the Evangelicall writings, it will be of no
force at all to any man that shall consider how
it came to passe that the severall bookes were
placed in the order as wee at this day finde
them viz. That certaine men unknown to us
now, but followed by a tacit agreement of the
Church, when after the decease of the Apostles
they had sought out all the writings that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and had beene occasionally published by
them, compiled them in one volumne in this
order; They begun with the Gospels or histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of our Saviours life and death, as reason was,
placing them it may be in the order as they
were written, however assigning the first place
to S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> because he having written his
Gospel in Hebrew for the use of the Jewes and
Jewish Christians to whom Christ commanded
his Gospel should first be preached, and
upon their refusall, to the Gentiles, even for
that reason alone his Gospel might be thought
to have deserved the first place, the rest follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the order as they were written. Then
followes the Story of the Apostles, especially
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46209:67"/>
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> written by his companion S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and
continued till their separation by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to Rome. After bookes of Story follow
doctrinall writings, namely Epistles, conteining
particular doctrinall controversies and precepts
of manners, written upon occasion, when false
Teachers had sowne tares of particular Heresies
in the Churches, founded by the Apostles,
Among these Epistles, those of S. <hi>Paul</hi> both
for the number, importance and length of
them obtained the first place, but disposed not
according to the order and dates of time that
they were written, but according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and advantages of the Churches and
Citties to which they were sent; the <hi>Romans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obteined, as reason was, the first place,
then the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> &amp;c. and after all such,
followed his particular Epistles to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> &amp;c. In the last place, the
whole volume was concluded with this single
booke of Prophecies, as being last written, most
difficult, and lesse necessary. These things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apparent, let all reasonable men judge what
just advantage can be taken by Protestants thus
to build their maine foundation of difference
from the Catholique Church upon so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
so casuall a thing, as the order wherein
the bookos of the New Testament have been
ranged, no man knowes by whom.</p>

for a ground, <hi>viz</hi> 
                  <q>That no man
ought to be obliged upon
paine of Excommunication to
believe any thing, but what God
hath revealed to be necessary to eternall salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the substance of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made by God in Christ, conteining
points of necessary beleife, and precepts of
necessary Evangelicall Obedience; For,
<hi>(saies he)</hi> why should any errour (or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
exclude him from the Churches
Communion, which will not deprive him of
eternall salvation? Why should men be more
rigid then God?</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. These grounds thus laid, and supposed
unquestionable: In the next place to prove
that this Covenant is entirely conteined not
only in the whole Scripture but also in the lower
Gospels, yea sufficiently in any one of the former,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46209:68"/>
he first alledges these reasons, <q>Because the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
having, as they professe, a purpose
to write the Gospell of Christ, or New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
no reason can be imagined why they, who
have set downe many passages unnecessary,
should neglect any necessary: For what su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
negligence and indiscretion must that
needs bee; such, verily, as no man in these
dayes undertaking the same designe, would
commit? Againe, with what truth could they
stile their bookes the Gospell of Christ, being
but a part of it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. After such discourses he brings, in his
opinion, two evident and unanswerable Texts
out of the Gospells to prove, that whatsoever is
necessary for a Christian to beleive or practise
is conteined in every one of them severally:
The first Text is the conclusion of S. <hi>Johns</hi>
Gospell, (<hi>cap. 21</hi>) <q>Many other signes also did
<hi>Iesus</hi> in the sight of his Disciples, which are
not written in this booke: But these are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that ye may believe that Jesus is Christ
the Son of God, and that believing you may
have life in his name.</q> For the enforcing of
which quotation, he addes. <q>By these words
(these are written) may be understood either,
These things are written, or These signes
are written: Take it which way you will,
this conclusion will certainly follow, That
either all that which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
or lesse then all, and therefore all much
more, was sufficient to make them believe
that which being believed with lively faith
would certainly bring them to eternall
life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:46209:68"/>4. The second proofe is from those words in
the Preface of S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell, (<hi>cap. 1.</hi>) <hi>Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
us many have taken in hand to set forth in
order a Declaration of those things which are most
surely believed among us, even as they delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us which from the beginning were eye witnesses
and Ministers of the word. It seemed good to me
also having had perfect understanding of things
from the first, to write to thee in order, most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
Theophilus, <hi>that thou mightest know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of those things wherein thou hast been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</hi>
To this quotation he addes a parallell
passage of the same S. <hi>Luke</hi> in his entrance to his
History of the Acts of the Apostles, (<hi>Chap. 1.</hi>)
viz <hi>The former treatise have I made, O</hi> Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus

                  <p>That Christian Religion was setled in the

               </argument>
               <p>1. THe whole weight of this Controversie
concerning the Rule of Faith (viz.
<q>Whether all truths and precepts, &amp;c. of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
necessary to Salvation be to be sought
for in Scripture alone, or any one or more of
the Gospels, as expresly conteined in them
(as Protestants affirme) or likewise in the
Tradition of the Catholique Church, as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
maintaine?)</q> relying upon the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of these three things especially,
viz. 1. The way whereby Christianity was
setled in the Church, which will appeare to
have beene by Orall Tradition and externall
uniforme practise, as being more secure from
errour and mistakes than writing. 2. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the writing of the Gospels and other
bookes of the New Testament, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
which the Church reapes by them. 3. The
meaning of this Phrase, things necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and the freeing of it from ambiguities
and misapplications. I conceived it therefore
necessary to meditate seriously, and as exactly,
as I was capable, to informe my selfe distinctly
of these particulars, to the end that I might be
able to judge, whether these difficulties and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46209:69"/>
objections alledged by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> would
approve themselves as unanswerable, as at my
leaving of <hi>England</hi> I supposed them, Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will set down in order the effect of my
enquiry.</p>
               <p>2. To begin therefore with the first particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to be premised, namely, the way whereby
Christian Religion was setled and continued in
the Church: By diligent reading of the writings
of severall Fathers especially, and ancient Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
Historians it manifestly appeared, at
least to mine own full satisfaction, that it was
not the purpose of Christ to deliver his new
law, as <hi>Moyses</hi> had done his in Tables or
written characters, but in Orall Tradition: or
to write it indeede, but, as <hi>Eusebius Caesariensis</hi>
before quoted expresseth it, <hi>not with ink on paper,
but by his Spirit in the hearts of his people,</hi> according
to the ancient Prophecies concerning him in
the Old Testament: And hereupon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
observe, that our Saviour left nothing at all
in writing, neither did he lay any injunction
upon his Apostles to write bookes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the same <hi>Eus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bius (Hist. Ecel. l. 5. cap. 8. &amp;</hi>
24.) expresly affirmes, <hi>That the Apostles had the
least regard to writing.</hi> The like is noted by
Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his frist Homily upon the
<hi>Acts,</hi> where he gives the reason why the
booke of the <hi>Acts</hi> does onely or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
conteine the occurrences concerning S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and not those neither to the end of his
life. But an assurance of this irrefragable is given
by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe, who in severall places
of his Epistles referres to the doctrine setled by
orall instruction, as when he sayes, <hi>Gal. c. 1. If any</hi>

makes this rule, <q>The Scripture is wont
for brevities sake to be silent of many things,
which are to be learned from the order of
Tradition.</q> For this reason it was, as antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
observes, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> kept his residence so
long a time in many Cities after he had setled
Churches there, to the end to inculcate into
their memories the substantiall doctrines
preached over and over unto them, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
an uniforme order and discipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, which by that meanes continued
in an exact conformity for severall centuries of
yeares in the Catholique Church all the world
over, as <hi>Tertullian, S. Basil, S. Augustin,</hi> &amp;c.
observe.</p>
               <p>3. Now this way of setling Religion by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and outward practise was much more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and lasting, and far lesse subject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
then writings (without unappealable
interpreters especially) could possibly be. If it
be objected, that memory is not so safe a depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitary
as written records, which are made use of
to supply the defects of memory. It may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46209:70"/>
that that is true of preserving doctrines
meerely speculative, but not so of such as may
be made as it were visible by practise, as
almost all Evangelicall doctrines are. For as
for bookes, we see by experience that those
which of all other in the world ought to have
been preserved with the most exact care, and
wherein the most scrupulous curiosity was
commendable, I meane the Sacred Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
writings, have not been able to escape the
inevitable fate of all bookes, especially such as
every one almost will thinke himselfe concern'd
to transcribe, that is, to have infinite variety of
readings, much more then any other bookes
that I know of whatsoever, and principally in
in the originall tongues, which were not read
in Churches: Insomuch as in my hearing
Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> (one of the most learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Prelats in England) professed that,
whereas he had had of many yeares before a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
to publish the New Testament in Greeke
with various lections and Annotations, and for
that purpose had used great diligence and spent
much money to furnish himselfe with Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
and <hi>Memoires</hi> from severall learned men
abroad, yet in conclusion he was forced to desist
utterly from that undertaking, lest if he should
ingenuously have noted all the severall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of readings, which himselfe had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
the incredible multitude of them almost
in every verse should rather have made men A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistically
to doubt of the truth of the whole
booke, then satisfie them in the true reading
of any particular passage. An evident signe this
is that the ancient Governours of the Church
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46209:71"/>
did not suppose that Christian Religion did
onely or principally rely upon what was in
writing: For if they had, they would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
either have forbidden such a multitude of
transcribers, or have preserved the Originall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
or at least have imitated the exact diligence
and curiosity of the <hi>Jewish Masorites</hi> in their
preserving the Old Testament entire for the
future, namely by numbring all the letters and
points, and signifying where and how oft every
one of them were found in Scripture: None of
which preventions and cautions notwithstanding
have been used in the <hi>Christian Church:</hi> Yea so
farre is it, from that, that at least one whole
<hi>Epistle of S. Paul to the Laodiceans,</hi> and that most
ancient <hi>Gospel in Hebrew, secundum Nazaraeos</hi> are
at this day utterly lost: not to speak of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
bookes mentioned in the Old Testament,
not now to be heard of.</p>
               <p>4. Well, but how casuall soever bookes may
prove to be yet it does not hitherto appeare
how <hi>Orall Tradition</hi> and Practise can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
it selfe a way more secure and free from
hazard than they. I will therefore endeavour
to resolve this seeming difficulty by asking
these Questions. Can any one reasonably say
that, for example, the doctrines of Christs
death for mankinde commemorated in the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sacrament of the Eucharist, &amp; <hi>of his reall unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative
presence there</hi> have beene, or could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
have beene more securely propagated
and more clearely and intelligibly delivered
to Posterity in bookes written, which
may be lost and will be corrupted by some
transcribers (and every transcribers copy is as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46209:71"/>
authentique as any others) or, as they have been,
in the Tradition and universall Practise of the
Church, and in a continuall visible celabra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of those divine Mysteries, where every
action they did performe, published the truth
which they believed; where their thanksgiving
for Christs Passion dayly renewed the memory,
manner and end of it; where their prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and adorations demonstrated their assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his reall Presence, where every mans
saying <hi>Amen</hi> at the Priests pronouncing <hi>Corpus
Domini nostri Jesu Christi,</hi> expressed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of that Presence with exclusion of all
Tropes and Metaphors in the businesse?
Againe, is not the true inward sence of these
Christian Doctrines conveyed more intelligibly,
and represented more exactly, lively and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
by such practises and solemne spectacles,
than by bare words, though they had beene
never so eleare, and of never so studied a
perspicuity? With relation to which expresse,
impossible to be mistaken way of propagating
the Mysteries of Christian beliefe, and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
in his minde thereupon S. <hi>Paul</hi> in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
thus reproved the <hi>Galatians</hi> for their
inconstancy, in these words of wonder and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
<hi>Gal. c. 3 v. 1. O insensatiGalatae. O foolish
Galatians, who hath bewitched you that ye should not
obey the truth, before whose eyes Iesus Christ hath
been (lively) represented, being Crucified among
you?</hi> As thinking that nothing of lesse power
than a charme could deceive persons, or blinde
their eyes, after they had been visible spectators,
as it were of the passion of Christ.</p>
               <p>5. This admirable way of conveying saving
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46209:72"/>
truths as it is say more expresse than words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
the naturall sence of the Mysteries being
as it were construed and interpreted to the
people thereby, or (according to the Prophets
expression foretelling this way of Tradition of
the Gospel) being not written with inke and on
paper, but by the Spirit in mens hearts, by
which meanes the sence sunke into their soules,
farre more effectually than if words only had
swom in their braines: So seemes it to me also
farre more lasting, then bookes, being scarce
possibly obnoxious to be either extinguished
or adulterated. The rage of Persecutors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an extraordinary vigilance of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
had failed but little of abolishing the
whole Bible, I am sure it made them very scarce
and precious, and not every ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
penniworth for severall ages together,
and effectively destroyed many most usefull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
monuments of the Ancient Church; The
same rage, or negligence or some other misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
have actually beene the losse of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to Laodicea, and other Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
writings, And some meerely speculative,
not very necessary Traditions have perished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not apted to be conveyed by practise, as
What that was which hindered the revelation of
the man of sinne, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes he told the
Church of the Thessalonians; that world of
miracles which S. <hi>John</hi> sayes our blessed Saviour
wrought; and likewise the true sence of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
passages in the New Testament which the
Primitive Churches, no doubt, understood; Yea
moreover many ancient Liturgies and Missals
are now wanting, by reason that the particular
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46209:72"/>
Churches, in which they were in use, have fayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But to take out of the way, or adulterate the
Mysteries of Faith through the whole Church,
which have been thus continued and daily
every where preached not so much in Sermons
(though so too) as in visible practise, and not
so much written in bookes (though so too) as in
the hearts of all Professors of Christianity, This
is beyond the reach of either secular or infernall
Powers, for to effect this, Persecutours must first
have dostroyed all Congregations of Christian
mankinde, and by some impossible charme, all
men must have agreed together to forget to day
what they said and did yesterday: here neither
transcribers negligence, nor particular innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
fancies of Heretiques, neither <hi>adulter sensus,</hi>
nor <hi>corruptor stilus</hi> could <hi>obstrepere veritate, (Tert.
de Prescript.</hi>) none of such either negligences
or cunnings could interrupt or out-clamour the
truth.</p>
               <p>6. Now what hath been here exemplified
in two particular points, namely the Mystery
of Christs Passion, and of the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may and ought rationally to be extended
likewise to the whole body of Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
pertaining to the substance of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
how abstruse, sublime, yea how seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a speculative soever. What points more
sublime, more speculative then those of the
<q>Blessed Trinity, <hi>the</hi> equality <hi>and</hi> consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallity
of the Son with the eternall Father,
the union and yet distinction of the two
Natures in one person, &amp;c.?</q> And yet all
these might and were continued in the Church,
not so much by writings delivered, or Sermons
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46209:73"/>
reiterated, as by the outward Practises of the
Faithfull in their publique uniforme Devotions:
Hereupon when troubles and contestations
arose in the Church about those Mysteries, and
thereupon <hi>Synods</hi> assembled, the severall <hi>Bishops</hi>
being demanded how they had been instructed
in them each one respectively in their Diocesses,
they had no need of stroining their wits to find
out the sence of obscure passages of Scripture
concerning such Mysteries, or to invent wayes
of reconciling Texts seemingly clashing together:
they might say, for example concerning the
article of the Blessed Trinity, we following the
instructions and practises of our Predecessors
do <hi>baptize in the name of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost,</hi> and in our Devotions we pray unto, give
thanks, glorifie each of these three persons in the
same language, with equall expressions of
duty, without preferring one before the other,
thereby acknowledging their glory to be equall,
their Majesty coeternall. So likewise for the
<hi>Consubstantiality</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> the
<hi>union</hi> and <hi>distinction</hi> of the <hi>two Natures,</hi> they
might say, We adore onely one God, and yet
we adore the Son with adoration equall to the
Father, by which we acknowledge them both to
be one onely God; We doe likewise celebrate
and give thanks to the same Son of God for
vouchsafing, being God, to take our Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him &amp; in that to dye, by his death redeeming
us from sin and death eternall, Therefore we
confesse two distinct Natures united in one
Person. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>7. Now if such sublime Revelations might,
and indeed were really conveyed not in formall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46209:73"/>
expressions of words and phrases, but, which was
farre more efficacious, in the true naturall sence
and importance of them uncapable of ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
by such a way of Tradition so impossible
to be interrupted as long as Christians begot
Christians, and so free from danger of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that they could not be feared, unlesse all
Churches would conspire to alter their whole
frame of Devotions; A thing they have been
so far from intending, that at this day if wee
compare all the Liturgies extant from S. <hi>Jame's</hi>
(which ha's received testimony from above

&amp;c. wee shall finde an admirable uniformity in
all the substantiall parts, yea in many manners
of expressions, to the very circumstances of

Veneration of Reliques, Images, &amp;c. Prayer
and Sacrifice for the Dead, a beliefe of a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in them to be eased and benefitted by such
Prayers, &amp;c. How was it possible that such
Doctrines once delivered should be forgotten,
being so visibly every Day by all persons
acted in the Church? And if no such
Doctrines were at first consigned and deposited
in the Church, how was it possible they
should so chance to mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Persons not only strangers, but for a long

such a point, that if they had not had irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
testimonies of the universall Tradition of
such doctrines and Practises, the conformity
of their adversary Churches would have beene
an argument sufficient to have made them to
relinquish such Practises and condemne them?
Could the Heathen-Graecians ever forget their

supposed to have beene received by

               <p>1. BUt it will objected, who knowes but
there may, yea who can deny but there
have crept in alterations even in these Liturgies
and formes of Publique Devotions? For
answer, It is confess'd there have, for the first
Liturgies, as S. <hi>James</hi> and others ascribed to
Apostolique Persons were briefe, simple, lesse
ceremonious: and as the Church grew more
large and splendid, so Gods service became
more extended, solemne and majesticall. But
that any substantiall part of Devotion, any
expressions implying or instilling new bred er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
have been introduced into the publique
formes of God's service, that is utterly denyed:
And they that lay this imputation upon Gods
Church are obliiged to produce examples and
visible proofes thereof, which it is impossible
for them to doe with the hundreth part of that
assurance that Catholiques by shewing those
which are now extant of the Ancient Liturgies,
by alledging irrefragable testimonies of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
punctuall curiosity of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in exactly and unalterably preserving
Tradition according to the Apostles direction,
<hi>Formam habe,</hi> &amp;c. Keepe the forme of sound
words, will demonstrate the contrary. I cannot
forbeare on this occasion, among many other
examples which may be produced to specifie
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46209:75"/>
that extreame nicenesse of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> shewing
not only his care to deliver Traditionall truths
themselves, but the termes also in which those
truthes were conveyed to his times, <hi>Ne me inep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
putes.</hi> Do not thinke me foolish (saith be
to <hi>Honoratus, lib. de util. cred. cap.</hi> 3.) for using
Greek termes, my chiefe reason is, because I
have so learned these things by Tradition,
neither dare I deliver them to thee any other
way then as I have received them. So the
same Father (<hi>dequant anima cap. 34) Divinè

is delivered by Tradition be observed. And,
Let Tradition prevayle. And, Let novelty
forbeare to oppose antiquity, &amp;c.</q> This care
certainly was more curiously observed in the
publique Devotions of the Church.</p>
               <p>2. For proofe whereof, besides the
confronting the Ancient Liturgies of the
Easterne and Southerne Churches, let Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
if they please, examine the Ages,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46209:75"/>
against which they believe they have the justest
arguments of suspition of any other, <hi>viz.</hi>
since the time of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great. There
are to this day extant his own Missalls in
Print, and Breviaries in Manuscript in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Libraries, let them examine what changes
such ignorant superstitious Times (as they
thinke,) and so many wicked Popes (as
they say, and not alwayes untruly) have
made in these publique Devotions of the
Church: They will blush certainly to have had
the least suspition in this nature of the Primitive
Times, when they shall see evidently that in
the Canon of the Masse there ha's scarce been
one word altered for above these last thousand
years, And in the Breviary not any that will
afford them contentment answerable to their
paines of comparing them.</p>
               <p>3 Now whereas some Protestants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
(and particularly Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
in severall places) where are we to seek for
these Traditions of which the Roman Church
talkes so much? where is the Cabinet and
Magazine wherein they are stored? And
when will shee empty it that we may see all
the treasure that Christ lest unto his Church?
Hereto it is answered, that M. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
said well, that, <hi>To say a secret Tradition is as absurd
as to say a silent Thunder,</hi> since Traditions are
obvious to all Mens Eyes, and sound aloud in
all Mens Eares, shining in the publique vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
practice and profession of the Church: The
Church is so far from pretending (as Protestants
would faine seem to fancy) that she has certaine
secret conservatories of these Traditions out
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46209:76"/>
of which upon occasion she can draw some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

                  </gap> in the publiquely received professions
and practises of the Church are not perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
as points of Faith, that is, as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary
Divine Revelations In so much as
some learned Catholiques are of opinion (how
justly or no I examin not) that certaine Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
now ventilated in the Church, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Conception of our Blessed Lady, and
some of the more subtill and scholasticall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
between the <hi>Jesuites</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi>
concerning Grace and Freewill, Predeterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Contingency, &amp;c. have not light enough
either from Scripture, Tradition, or the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Profession and Practise of the Church,
so as to be capable of a precise decision, at least
so farre as to make such a decision to become
properly an article of Faith; unlesse perhaps
such a one, as was that of the Councell of
<hi>Vienna</hi> touching Grace infused into Infants in
Baptisme, which is set downe in this forme.
<hi>Nos attendentes,</hi> that is, <q>Wee heedfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the generall efficacy of the death of
Christ, the which by Baptisme is applyed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
and indifferently to all that are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by the approbation of this Holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
have judged that the second opinion is
to be chosen as the more probable and more
consonant and agreeeing to the sayings of the
Holy Fathers and of the moderne Doctors,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46209:76"/>
which opinion asserteth, That informing
Grace and vertues are as well conferred upon
Infants in Baptisme, as on persons of ripe age.</q>
See <hi>Clementin. de sum Trin. &amp; fide Cath.</hi> And
thus the Councell of <hi>Basil (Sess. 36.)</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the point of the imaculate conception of
our Blessed Lady, not as an article of faith in
the present strict and proper sense, but, <hi>tanquam
doctrinam piam &amp; consonam fidei,</hi> that is, as a pious
doctrine and consonant to faith. See more in
the learned treatise of <hi>Franc.</hi> as <hi>Clara</hi> called
<hi>Systema fidei,</hi> Cap. 35.</p>
               <p>4. Indeed it cannot be denyed but that in
some cases it is within the power of the Church
to invent <hi>de novo</hi> some word or phrase proper
to signifie and express a Traditionary doctrine,
namely in contradiction to any Haeresie arising
and opposing Apostolique Revelations,
shining in the publique profession and practise
of the Church. So to condemn the <hi>Arians</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Divinity of our Saviour, the Fathers of
the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> made choice of the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>though new, yet answerable to
the sense and notion of that mystery, which was
received by Tradition in the Church, a terme
directly and specifically opposite to the <hi>Arian</hi>
Position. In like manner the Church of late
devised a new, or rather borrowed of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

Transubstantiation as most proper to expresse
the notion which in all ages has been received
in the Church concerning the Reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the body of Christ in Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a terme which like the flaming two-edged

all sides whatsoever new Heresies do, or probably
ever shall devise to oppose that Mystery.</p>
               <p>5. Notwithstanding some certaine Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
there were which in the Primitive times
were kept secret among the principall Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
Governours, as certaine sublime
Doctrines, the ceremonious formes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
some Sacraments, of making the holy
Chrismes, Oyle, &amp;c. which seemes to have
been done partly to gaine a reverence to the
Clergy, as more neerly approaching to the
Divine Light, But principally not to expose
such Mysteries to the scornfull and profane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the Heathens, or to the weak
understandings of the ignorant, and not yet
sufficiently instructed Christians, according
to the practise of S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe, (1 <hi>Cor c.</hi> 2.)
who saith, <hi>Sapientiam loquimur inter perfectos,
Wee spèake</hi> (sublime) <hi>wisedome among those that
are perfect:</hi> Hence those earnest adjurations
in the writings of some very ancient Bishops,
whereby they conjured others of their own
rank, when they communicated to them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
sublime mysteries to preserve in a deep
secrecy what they so received; a memorable
instance we have of this caution in the Books of
S. <hi>Denis Areopagite (Hier. Eccl. c 1.)</hi> Hence those
disguisings of other Mysteries in Books which
were to passe publiquely abroad: Hence those
sudden interruptions when they were ready to
discover unawares somewhat above the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of their hearers, Pagans, or Catechumens,
Frequent examples I could alledge out of S.
<hi>Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine.</hi>
end others: But <hi>Cui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> bono</hi> in this placed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46209:77"/>
Since Paganisme has been utterly abolished, and
meanes of instruction more common and
promiscuous, especially since the invention of
Printing (whether happy, or not it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
this cautelous reservednesse has beene
out of use, perhaps with no little prejudice
to the Church: in so much as nothing is
reserved now in the brests of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Governours,
even the anciently most secret
Ceremonies are divuled to all Mens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
So that now Tradition is far more
loud and visible, then ever it was before,
and no ground for Protestants to pretend to
any suspition that under a shew of Tradition the
Church has a mind to exercise either Tyranny
or cunning to gaine authority to her determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>6. Now from this generall Traditionary
way of conveying Christian Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
it came to passe that many Fathers being assured
of the truth and authenticknesse of such
Traditions, and willing to assert them out of
Scripture also, have interpreted many Texts,
as conteining such Doctrines, which either
did not at all afford such a sence, or at least not
necessarily, though perhaps the outward sound
of the words might put a man in mind of such
Doctrines: Examples of this are not a few,
particularly in the points of Purgatory, Prayer
to Saints, &amp;c. So that whereas Protestants cry
<hi>Victory</hi> when they can prove. or at least make
probable that such Fathers have been mistaken
in such interpretations, as if the doctrines thence
deduced were confuted, in my opinion it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ground, since on the contrary the lesse
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46209:78"/>
force that such Texts of Scripture have to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
such doctrines, the greater and stronger
proofe have such Traditions, seeing the Fathers,
prepossessed with a beliefe of them from the
publique practise of the Church, accounted
them so apparent, that they thought they saw
them even where they were not at all. And
therefore, when the Church commands us not
to oppose the interpretations which the greatest
part of Fathers unanimously make of Scripture,
I conceive she does not a waies oblige Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
thereby to give the same sense to Texts
which the greatest part of Fathers doe, but
rather, not so to interpret any Text as to
contradict the Traditionary doctrines believed
generally by the Fathers upon this safe ground
of Tradition, though perhaps not Logically e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
deduced from such speciall passages of
Scripture: so that though perhaps their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
there may be questioned, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in the commentaries ought to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>1. IT may now be demanded, if this way of
conveying Christian doctrines be so
much clearer and safer than writing books, or
any other way of transmitting recordes, to what
purpose were the Evangelicall bookes written?
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46209:78"/>
and why were the necessary points of faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into such a prescribed form in the Apostles
Creed?</p>
               <p>2. To say something for answer, and first
concerning the Creed. The end why that
was compiled seemes to have been to bring into
a short and cleare abridgement the principall
points of Christian Religion to be repeated at
any ones initiation into Christianity by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
being as it were an enlargement of that
forme of Baptising prescribed by our Saviour,
viz. <hi>Baptizo te in nomine Patris &amp; Filii &amp; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
sancti</hi> (Now in what sense<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and in respect
of what Persons in what State or Order the
Creed may be said to contein all points of faith
necessary to Salvation shall be shewd hereafter.)
As to our present purpose we may observe.
1. That the Creed seemes to be of a middle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
betweene written bookes and Orall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
as a prescribed forme of words, so it
approaches to the former: but as committed
by all to memory and actually repeated at
Baptisme and other publique Devotions, so it
partakes much of the latter. 2. What extreame
advantage Tradition has for its preservation
beyond any writing, seeing the Creed after it
was enlarged by partaking thereof has preserved
it selfe from any variety or corruption all the
Church over to this day It is true indeed that
insome Churches, viz in <hi>Af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ica</hi> in the first
beginning of Christianity there was a small
difference, their Creed wanting these words,
<hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> the sense whereof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
may probably be supposed to
have been included in the Article concerning
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46209:79"/>
the holy Catholique Church, as may be observed
in the Creeds extant in the African Fathers,
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Optatus</hi> and S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin:</hi>
Which difference it is not imaginable
should have come by neglect or forgetfulnesse:
it is rather probable that that Apostolique
Person who taught Christianity first in those
quarters, brought the Creed with that small
defect; for the very first Creed of all seems to
have been much shorter then that now current,
as conteining only a profession of Faith in the
three Persons in the Blessed Trinity in whose
names only Baptisme was administred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were so inlarged.</p>
               <p>3 In the next place, concerning the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and end for which the books of the New
Testament were written, we ought to consider
the books of History apart from the others of
Doctrine and Prophecy, as being distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable
both in their occasion and end,
For the Gospells therefore, the whole subject
of them is a narration of severall passages of
our Saviours Life, Death, Resurrection and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension;
likewise some of the most considerable
miracles which he wrought; a sum of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
points of his Doctrine, both morall, and
mysterious in parables concerning his Church,
&amp;c. Now though the memory of all these (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
perhaps only the severall miracles,
prophecies, &amp;c.) as much as was suficient for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46209:79"/>
particular persons, might and actually was in
substance preserved by practicall Tradition (as
1. the Mysterious and to us most usefull passages
of his Life, &amp;c. in the publique solemnities
appointed from all antiquity, in the solemne
Fasts &amp; administration of Sacraments. 2. Morall
duties in the publique Confessions, and most
ancient Penitentiall Canons, Love-Feasts, &amp;c.
Yea some of them receiving force almost only
from Tradition, as not being at all in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
at least not so expressely as Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
requires to points of necessity, as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse
of Polygamy, incestuous marriages</hi> in
some particular degrees, &amp;c.) Notwithstanding
it could not but be infinitely acceptable and
satisfactory to all good Christians to be informed
as particularly as might be in any thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<hi>so Blessed a Master and Saviour,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were these divine books received with all
imaginable reverence and joy, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with all possible care, so farre as thousands
willingly exposed themselves to Martyrdome
rather then deliver them up to the fire; they
were read in Churches, discoursed on in
Sermons, illustrated by Commentaries, in a
word esteemed divine and infallible by all
Christians. But yet no generall Tradition has
come to us that all that is necessary for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all degrees, whether single or in Society
to bring them to heaven is conteined expresly
in these Gospells: Which is a certaine proof
that the ancient Church did not thinke so, or
however that they did not think it necessary
to thinke so, for <hi>no one thing generally thought
necessary to salvation, but has been conveyed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46209:80"/>
under that notion by Tradition orall, as well as wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
Besides, it is clear there is nothing expresse
for assembling Synods, ordeining severall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Ministers, no formes or directions for
publike service, no unquestionable prohibition
of <hi>Polygamy, incest, &amp;c.</hi> So that although no
doubt to some persons in some suddaine despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
circumstances there is in the Gospels to be
found enough, yea more then enough of
meere necessity, yea in any one of them, yea
in two or three verses of any one of them: Yet
therefore to deduce a generall conclusion <hi>that all
things simply necessary are conteined in the Gospels,</hi>
is surely very unreasonable: and much more,
thence to inferre a generall Conclusion, so
as to make it the fundamentall ground of
all Sects of Religion, and a sufficient excuse for
that, which (if that Conclusion be not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not true, but not so evident as that there can be
no shew of contradiction, is a most horrible
sinne, namely Schisme or Haeresie) this to me
seemed to be somewhat that deserved a name
beyond unreasonablenesse it selfe; and that
joyned with infinite danger in a point of the
highest consequence imaginable.</p>
               <p>4. Now the same inconveniences will follow
though the bookes of the <hi>Acts, Epistles</hi> and
<hi>Apocalyse</hi> were added to the Gospels to make
them altogether to be an entire perspicuous
Rule of Faith without any need of an authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
interpreter. For first, for the <hi>Apocalyse,</hi> it
is a meere obscure Prophecy, and can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
little or nothing to the instruction or
discipline of the Church. Then the booke of
the <hi>Acts</hi> though it relate some particulars of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46209:80"/>
our Saviour after his Ascension, as his Sending
the Holy Ghost, &amp;c. together with a very few
passages concerning any of the Apostles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
some few yeares of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> travells:
yet it will prove but a very imperfect modell
for setling of the Church in such a posture
and with such qualifications both for doctrine
and practise as unquestionable antiquity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
unto us the Primitive Apostolique
Church. And la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly for the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
&amp;c. it is confessed by all, and the Text it selfe
justifies it, that those Epistles were never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be written as institutions or Catechismes
conteining an abridgement of the whole body of
Christian Faith for the whole Church: For,</p>
               <p>1. They were written only to some particular
congregations, yea many of them to single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and no order is given to communicate
them to the whole Church, I am sure no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
appeares that they should be so divulg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</p>
               <p>2. They were written meerely occasionally,
namely by reason that some particular False
teachers sowed certaine false doctrines in some
particular Churches founded by the Apostles,
in the confutation of which Haeresies all the
doctrinall parts of those Epistles are generally
employed; So that if those Heretiques had not
chanced to have broached those particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
those Epistles had never beene written.</p>
               <p>3. These Epistles especially of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the
most and the largest, are written in a stile so
obscure, such intricacy of arguing, with such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gessions
interwoven, the Logicall Analysis is so
extremely difficult, that that gift of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was in those dayes a necessary attendant of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46209:81"/>
the Apostles preaching, and I am confident that
if an hundred men, and those generally of the
same Sect and opinions, were oppointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the order and method of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there would not three of them agree for
three verses together. Now upon these grounds,
how improper such writings are to serve for
the onely Rule of Faith (which even in Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s opinion must be so cleare
and evident in points necessary, that there can
be no rationall possibility of diversity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and by cosequence no need of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative
interpreter) let him that can believe
it; and let him that dare, put it to the tryall,
when his soules eternall estate depends upon it.</p>

                  <p>The third preparatory ground, viz. the

<hi>necessary to salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THese words (<hi>necessary to salvation</hi>)
being applyed to severall
objects and subjects admit of
great variety in the application
and use: therefore before they
be affirmed or denyed of any
thing,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Card.</hi> Perron. Ep. ad <hi>Casaub.</hi>
                  </note> or to any person, he that intends to
expresse his mind distinctly and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
must necessarily and expresly before
hand declare in what sence, to what degree, in
respect of whom, and for what end such things
are, or are not necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:46209:81"/>2. Therefore first for sorts of necessity, There
is <hi>necessitas medii,</hi> when a thing is of it selfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessry
to salvation: and <hi>necessitas praec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pti,</hi>
when it is only therefore necessary because it
is commanded. Againe <hi>necessitas fidei specialis,</hi>
that is, of things to be believed expresly and
distinctly, as the Articles of the Creed: and
<hi>necessitas fidei generalis,</hi> of things which some
persons are onely to believe. Againe, <hi>necessitas
actus,</hi> that is of things to be performed by all, as
Confession of Christs name, pardoning of
offences, restitution, &amp;c. and <hi>necessitas ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probationis</hi>
or <hi>non contradictionis,</hi> when men are
at least obliged not to condemne certaine
things, as vow of Virginity, Voluntary poverty,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. Then with respect unto objects or things
necessary to salvation, some are so absolutely,
that is, so as no circumstance of person, time
or place, no ignorance, no defect how irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable
soever can excuse the absence of such
things: other things on the contrary are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
only conditionally, which in some cases,
to some persons may be excusable. Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sort, there are but extreamely few things
necessary. For, for example, if a Heathen at
the point of death upon an effectuall exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Christian should embrace in generall
the Religion of Christ, not being able to attend
particular instruction, nor perhaps actuall
Baptisme, it is very probable that the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of Christ to be the Saviour of the world,
and relying upon him for the pardon of his
sinnes, and profession of his resolution to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
whatsoever should appeare to him to have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46209:82"/>
been Cbrists will though death should cut him
off from a particular information in other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Faith, the Sacraments, particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Christian morality, &amp;c. would be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to such a man to salvation. Of the later
sort, viz things necessary conditionally, it is
impossible to tell how many or how few they
are, till all conditions and circumstances be expressed.</p>
               <p>4. In regard of persons, that is, necessary to
one which is not to another, as more to a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than a Disciple; to a Governour, then to a
person subordinate. Againe, that is necessary
to a Congregation, which is not to a single
person, to the setling of a Church in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which is not to every Congregation: to
the well-being of a Church, which is not to its
simple being: some persons are obliged to know
many things explicitely, which others are onely
not to dis believe, it being sufficient if they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them not, not necessary that they know them.</p>
               <p>5. Having considered such an ambiguity and
variety of things necessary (to which many
other distinctions might yet be added) I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
judged that whatsoever was the reason
that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> thought it not necessary
to make a distinct application of these severall
kindes of necessity according to the exigence
of the objects and persons; whether it was
neglect or want of memory, or whether intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely to repell his adversaries present ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
he thought fit to say no more then he
was for that purpose necessarily obliged: What
ever was the cause, I am sure that for want of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46209:82"/>
such a distinct application, whatsoever he has
said to confirme his maine position is little
to the satisfaction of any third person,
as, I thinke, shall presently be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

reasons and proofs before alleged, for
the maintaining of the maine foundation of all
Schisme, viz. <hi>That the Scripture, yea any one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
conteines in it expresly all things necessary
to salvation, either for belief or practise.</hi> In the
examination whereof (as likewise of other
Protestants grounds which follow, and are
set downe and prosecured more clearely, more
subtily, and I am sure more to the satisfaction of
English Protestants, by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
then by any other) I must professe that my
intention is not to consider Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s
discourses as precisely opposed to his
adversaries, for I have neither the vanity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
that so learned and practis'd a Catholique-controvertist
should be willing to accept of any
one, and much lesse of such an ignorant Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyte
as my selfe to defend his excellent booke;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46209:83"/>
neither have I the impudence without leave
from him to undertake such a taske: But since
upon mine owne knowledge Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
believed that his booke, as concerning
the Positive grounds, conteined as much as
any Protestant could reasonably say; so for
the destructive part, that it was an unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
conviction not onely of what his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in particular had said, but of what any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
could alledge concerning either the
Rule of Faith, or Judge of Conteoversies: Seeing
likewise I found it not onely very reasonable in
it selfe, but absolutely necessary for me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the condition in which I then was,
for finding repose unto my mind to inform my
selfe, not what some particular learned Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
taught to be their sense of the Churches
beliefe in these points (for that would have
been a labour insupportable to me, who was
much pressed with a desire to be no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
without any Church to joyne withall)
but to enquire what the Roman Church her
selfe believed, and in what language, and with
what latitude She her self expressed her thoughts
and beliefe: Upon these grounds I conceived
it requisite to exact and apply M. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s
positions and arguments to the simple
doctrines and decisions of the Catholique-Church;
Resolving that if I found that what She
said, and in the latitude that She expresseth her
self, was just and reasonable, and withall able to
stand firme notwithstanding any of Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>'s
oppositions, to rest contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
For, for the present it would be happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
enough for me to get onely within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46209:83"/>
of a Church, though no farther then the
door-keepers place, I might afterwards, if need
were, at leisure make choice there of what
ranke or company I would range my selfe unto.</p>
               <p>2. Coming therefore to the consideration of
M. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s conclusion, together with
the reasons and proofes of it which he beleived
of force sufficient to destroy the doctrine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to be believed by all Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
I must needes say that this his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
(<hi>The Scripture conteines all necessary points of
beliefe and practise,</hi> and <hi>the Creed all necessary
points of beliefe</hi>) is so expressed, that in severall
respects it may and ought to be assented to
by any Catholique: For (as I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
if the word <hi>necessary</hi> in respect of the
object, relate to necssity absolute, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the subject, to any person though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in a desperate estate for want of means
or space to inform himselfe further, then not
only the Scripture, or the Creed, or one Gospell,
but perhaps this one verse in a Gospell. <hi>This is
eternall life to know thee the only true God, &amp; Iesus
Christ whom thou hast sent,</hi> may be instruction
sufficient to salvation: and so arising propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to other circumstances, in respect
of other single persons more truths and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
are necessary, and more yet to persons
enjoying sufficient means to information, to
Clergy-men, to Congregations, to well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Churches. Besides, if the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
be considered in another sense (without
altering the expression) a sense obvious enough &amp;
not improper, in which among other ancient
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46209:84"/>
Fathers S. <hi>Aug.</hi> explaines it as he was before
quoted cap. 38. viz. that the Scripture here (as
likewise the Creed) is to be taken as joyned with
the Churches authority, to which, saith hee, we
are expresly referr'd in Scripture, then
it not onely conteines whatsoever is necessary
to salvation in some qualifyed degree of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and to some certaine persons consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in some certaine circumstances, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the most exalted importance of the
word necessary, and to all persons considered
either as single, or in actuall Communion &amp;c.
Lastly if the same Conclusion be so understood
that the words of Scripture may be (I doe
not say, supplyed, but even) interpreted by
the Tradition of the ancient Church and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the present, so many Catholiques
will subscribe to it.</p>
               <p>3. This conclusion therefore being so vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
applicable, and by consequence capable
of being orthodox or erroneous according to
severall applications: in the next place I was
to reflect upon my present condition, to try
whether it befitted mee or no. Now for the
present I was in quest of a Church, that Church
wherein I had been bred e're this time being
almost ready to expire: I lived in an age
wherin there was no want of meanes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and instruction, even to excesse, for the
overmuch light made many men too too wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and curious: I had been bred after such a
manner that I was capable in some reasonable
degree not only of information, but likewise
of an ability to judge what instructour could
approve himselfe to be the fittest to be followed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46209:84"/>
and beleived, and for that purpose I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
all I could to free my mimd from all
prejudices and partiality: in these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
two parties invited me to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
(and a Communion some where or
other I knew was necessary:) The one sayd,
You may without inevitable danger perhaps
take your choice of ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her, but certainly your
best and safest way is to come to us, for we
will propose to your beleife nothing but the
acknowledged written word of God, and that
wee have for this hundred yeares beleived to
conteine all things necessary not only for your
salvation, but any mans else: You shall have
the satisfaction to bee freed from all visible
authority interpreting that Word, The Spirit
will teach you to interpret it as truly as wee
doe, for otherwise we shall not suffer you in
our Communion. The other party on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
protested aloud, that if I joyned not with
them I was utterly lost; that they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to me nothing but Divine Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
not onely in bookes written, but Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
unwritten; both conveyed by the same
hand and with the same authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
if either, both to be received; that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
inviters were a new faction for worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
divided from the whole world, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
from a Church, which had continued
ever since Christs time in an un-interrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of instructers and Doctrine, of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
appointed for Guides not onely by testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of all ages, but likewise of the same Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
upon which their adversaries pretended to
ground their Schisme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that these Guides had
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46209:85"/>
continually preserved the Church in a perfect
unity of beliefe; whereas the other party within
one age that they have appeared, have been torne
into near an hundred Sects, All of them with
equally-no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without the least effect of union, not one

cleared.</p>
               <p>4. In these circumstances coming to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of this fundamentall ground of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantisme
<hi>That the Scriptures conteine all points
of beliefe and practise necessary to salvation,</hi> I
found it necessary, without any change made in
the words, to apply the termes <hi>necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
not to one or more persons ignorant,
destitute of meanes of knowledge, and in some
particular unavoydable exigence, but to my self
considered in the conditions before mentioned,
yea further, to all Christians in generall, and
to the exigence of Churches well ordered and
setled, as on all sides they pretended to be:
And having done thus, I found that no Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
ever delivered this Conclusion in so large
a sense; yea on the contrary that generally all
Antiquity protested against it: I found that no
reason could require that <hi>writings</hi> evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for sepciall uses, and confuting three or
foure Haeresies should be made use of, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
should be accounted sufficiently and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
convictive against Opinions not named
in them, and not them thought upon by the
Authours, <hi>as if they had been entire Systemes of
Christianity:</hi> In a word, I found that after I
had applyed this conclusion to the present use

and Hypothesis, the arguments and reasons
produced by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> &amp;c. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

evince or conclude that which would give
me, in the case I was, any satisfaction at
all: especially considering that if the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
had gained the better in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
concerning a Rule, yet I should be far
from being at rest in their Churches, unlesse
they could further demonstrate, that the
Scripture conteined all these things so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
and clearely to all eyes, naming those
particular necessary doctrines in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
to others unnecessary, or but
profitable, or perhaps requisite onely and
applying them to the persons respectively to
whom they are necessary, and all this after such
a manner that no honest reasonable man could
remaine in doubt, or be in danger of quarrelling
with others (a thing which mine owne eyes
confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, since I apparently saw earnest conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and separations about points not onely by
my selfe, but by the whole Christian world for
above thirteene hundred years together esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
necessary, And since by my small reading,
I had found that there was not one Article of
the Creed which had not been questioned
and contradicted) Or unlesse they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
that there was no particular point
at all necessary; Or lastly that there was some
visible authority to decide unappealeably what
was to be acknowledged for the true sense of
Scripture, and in it, what was onely true, what
usefull, what requisite, and what necessary:
But these were conditions such as that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
had not confidence enough to promise

the former, and they were too proud and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of themselves to allow the latter.</p>

                  <p>An answer to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and reasonings premised before
his proofes out of Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. BUt to come at last to Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s
reasons and quotations out of
Scripture to prove that all things necessary to
salvation are not onely sufficiently conteined
in the bookes of Scripture in generall, but even
in any one of the Gospells, mentioned before
<hi>cap.</hi> 26. And first for the examination of that
which he layes as a ground of his enforcing the
said quotations, viz. <q>That no man ought to
be obliged upon paine of Excommunication
to believe any thing, but what God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to be necessary to eternall salvation,
which is the substance of the New Covenant
made by God in Christ, conteining points of
necessary beliefe, and precepts of necessary
Evangelicall obedience. His reasons being,
Why should any errour or ignorance exclude
him from the Churches Communion, which
will not deprive him of eternall salvatio?
Why should men be more rigid then God?</q>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. In stead of answering to this, I acknowledge
the foundation to be very substantiall, and the
Reasons very concluding. Onely I must take
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46209:86"/>
leave to explaine one phrase in this discourse,
viz. Things which are of the substance
of the New Covenant. For if his meaning
be, that onely those things are necessary to be
believed explicitely which are essentiall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
parts of the New Covenant, and that
directly and of their owne nature, I must then
deny it: and so does himselfe elsewhere, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in this place that which followes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to this foundation does seeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
such a sence of the words. And to prove
the reasonablenesse of my denyall (he being
now unfortunately dead) I desire any Protestant
to resolve these questions, <q>To believe that our
Lord was descended according to the flesh
from <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> is it of the substance
of the New Covenant directly and of its own
Nature?</q> We shall both of us answer, No. Nor
by consequence is it necessary to salvation to
know or believe it. I aske then further: <q>But
suppose a man finde, that proposition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
in Scriptures sufficiently proposed to
him and acknowledged to be the word of
God, is it not then necessary to salvation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it?</q> I will answer againe as both of us
should doe, Yes, without any question: the
reason being evident, because though to believe
Christ to be the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> be not in it
selfe of the essence of the Covenant, yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that whatsoever God sayes is true, is:
and by consequence an accessory may by some
circumstances be made essentiall, and, <q>a man
may come to be damned for not believing
that, which without any the least prejudice to
him he might never have known or heard of. </q>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:46209:87"/>
So likewise, for any one who believes, that the
Church is the depositary of divine Revelation,
and that she is endued with authority from
Christ to command things though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
not necessary, yet such as she thinkes help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to piety; for such a man I say to refuse to
believe the unlawfulnesse of Rebaptization (for
example) acknowledged by the whole Church
both in her universall practise and profession,
that it was a Tradition unwritten which came
from the Apostles, and confirm'd by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a lawfull Councell: or againe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to absteine and fast in Lent, Fridayes,
<hi>Quatuor-Temporibus,</hi> &amp;c. the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
him: both these refusalls (though the
former be of a doctrine of it selfe not of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the New Covenant, and the later, of an
action little more then circumstantiall) are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
sinnes, and the Church may justly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
and by consequence God will assure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
condemne such as persist obstinately in
such refusalls; And this for a reason more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
then the former, because namely obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Chnrch is not onely commanded
expresly in Scripture (as in the former case) but
commanded under this very penalty of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
(which the former was not) for
saith our Lord, <hi>If any one heare not the Church,
let him be to thee as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But to proceede, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> to
prove that this New Covenant is entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
not onely in the whole Scripture, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the foure Gospells, yea sufficiently even
in any one of the foure, he first alledges these
reasons, <q>Because, saith he, the Evangelist's
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46209:87"/>
having a purpose to write the Gospell of
Christ or new Covenant, no reason can be
imagined that they, who have set downe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
passages unnecessary, should neglect any
necessary: for what a negligence must this
needs be? such an one surely as no man in
these dayes undertaking the same designe
would commit. Besides, with what truth could
they stile their bookes the Gospell of Christ,
if they were onely a part of it? </q>
               </p>
               <p>4. Hereto I answer, that if by the Gospell
of Christ he had meant the story of the life, acts,
discourses, sufferings, death, Resurrection
and Ascension of our Saviour (as I mentioned
in my preparatory grounds) I should willingly
grant that the foure Evangelists joyntly have
written the Gospell of Christ entirely, not
omitting any passage thereof necessary, or
very requisite to be known: I say the foure
Evangelists joyntly, for of each severally I
cannot say so: For, for example, S. <hi>Marke</hi>
(either because S. <hi>Mathew</hi> had done it sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before, or for what other reason I will not
trouble my selfe to divine, but) S. <hi>Marke</hi> 
                  <q>omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Incarnation of our Lord of a pure
Virgin, his birth,</q> and all things that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till he was thirty yeares old, begins his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
with S. <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> mission to preach: now
I suppose these Mysteries omitted by S. <hi>Marke</hi>
are at least in a high degree requisite to be
known and believed generally; yea I will adde,
necessary; since they are expressed in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed, as short as it is: yet not necessary ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and indispensably to every person in
what state soever, but only to those that live in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46209:88"/>
the Church, much more to persons of ability
and parts, yet more to Teachers, and most of
all to Congregations and Churches: and if
so, then that which Master <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
would conclude from hence, cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
in this controversie, among such
persons, and Sects, and at this time, as I shewed
before. So likewise the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> S. <hi>John,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
almost all the miracles, Sermons and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables
mentioned by other Evangelists, omitt's
the <hi>Blessed Sacrament,</hi> and the Story of our
<hi>Saviours Ascension.</hi> Now I desire any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to say whether (what ever would become
of some particular person ignorant of these
things by an excuse of an impossibility of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction)
a man living, as now, in sufficient
light, and much more one obliged to be a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of others could be saved with ignorance of
these things omitted by S. <hi>John?</hi> I further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to say whether a society of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to be joyned and ordered so as to be
made a Christian Church, if they had onely
S. <hi>Johns Gospell</hi> for their Rule and patterne, yea
though they had all the foure <hi>Evangelists,</hi> yea all
the <hi>Evangelicall writings,</hi> whether they could
settle themselves according to the frame of the
<hi>Apostolicall Churches,</hi> with the same orders, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
customes, &amp;c. as apparently were in
the Ancient times universally, while some wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
lived, who might have seene the Apostles
themselves? If not, as it is most evident that not:
I aske, whether those Churches were so setled by
the free liberty and fancy of the Apostles, so as
it had been no great matter though they had
ordered them any other way? or whether
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46209:88"/>
by the expresse command of Christ, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
or by the intervention of his <hi>Holy
Spirit?</hi> By the latter way, no doubt: and by
consequence some thing necessary for the frame
of the Church, because commanded by Christ,
is not conteined in the Evangelists, neither
severally nor together, no nor in union with all
the other Evangelicall writings.</p>
               <p>5. Againe, our Saviour in his life-naturall
among them told his Disciples that <q>he had
many things to tell them, but he would not
tell them then, because as yet they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to beare them: But when the Paraclete, the
Spirit of truth came, they should then be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instructed.</q> Now will any man say that
all these <hi>many things</hi> were unnecessary? no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
on the contrary they were of such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
great moment, that the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
could not then beare them. Or were these
so weighty things written in the Gospells, where
our Saviour sayes he would not discover them?
If not there: can it appeare that S. <hi>Luke</hi> had
a designe to set them all downe in the booke of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> where his principall designe was to
write some passages especially of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells
onely, and that during the time that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was a witnesse? Lastly, (for as for the
<hi>Revelation</hi> that being nothing but obscure
Allegory or Prophecy, needs not therefore to
be enquired of about this matter) is it likely that
a few <hi>Haeretiques</hi> broaching certaine errours,
which caused the writing of almost all the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,</hi>
should light so fortunately for us as
to give the Apostles occasion in consuting them
to publish all those <hi>many things</hi> which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46209:89"/>
would not tell them in his life time?

               <p>1. AS for those passages produced by Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> out of the Gospells, and,
as he thought, fully to his purpose, and first to
that taken out of the conclusion of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
where it is said, <q>these things were written
that ye might believe in the Sonne of God,
and that believing ye might have life.</q> Besides
the former demonstrations that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ
onely of our Saviours life and death, and even
therein omitted many things of extreame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which are mentioned by the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
and all things revealed after <hi>Christs</hi>
Ascension by the Comforter, which were far
from being unnecessary: And besides the so
necessary distinction of things necessary in
respect of the object and subject so oft ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
before; I answer particularly to the
phrase of this quotation that it does not prove
that these things alone are sufficient for such an
effect, but onely that these are some of the
principall ones necessary: For it is ordinary
in Scripture to ascribe the effect of a concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of causes to some more especiall ones
alone, either thereby to shew the extraordinary
vertue and necessity of them above the rest, or to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46209:89"/>
imply that such vertues cannot be, at least in
perfection, alone, but are alwaies accompanyed
with the rest. So our Saviour (Mat. <hi>cap</hi> 5.) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
Beatitude to each single Christian vertue,
which indeed is the effect of them all meeting
together. And so that speech of S. <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi>
10.) is to be understood, <q>If thou shalt confesse
with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in thy heart that God raised him from
the dead, thou shalt be saved. And againe,
Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
shall be saved.</q> Indeed nothing is more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in Scripture then such Phrases, I will
therefore absteine from an unnecessary multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of such passages, concluding this with
two like expressions of the same Evangelist, the
first in the same Gospell, <hi>This is eternall life
that they may know thee the onely true God, and
Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> The other out
of his first Epistle, which may with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
prove it self alone, even without the Gospell,
to be sufficient instruction to salvation. <hi>These
things we write unto you that your joy may be full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To the double quotation of S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the
Prefaces to his Gospell, and the History of the
Acts of the Apostles, both in effect saying the
same thing, namely that in his Gospell he
he had written<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>of all things that Jesus
did or taught, it is already answered. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that this speech is hyperbolicall appeares
not onely from S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, which relating
both the facts and speeches of our Saviour,
speakes notwithstanding, but very briefly and
of a very few things mentioned by S. <hi>Luke</hi>
or any other Evangelist: but likewise from

another passage of the same, S. <hi>Luke</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
following the quotation out of the <hi>Acts,</hi>

Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> adjoyned to these <hi>Quotations</hi>
to the end to presse the force of them more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciously
as thinking them unanswerable, which
notwithstanding I found nothing at all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
I will according to my promise set them
downe in order, and adjoyne to each an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>2. To the 1. Question therefore, viz.
<q>Whether S. <hi>Luke</hi> did not undertake the very
same thing which he sayes many had taken in
hand?</q> I answer, Yes.</p>
               <p>To the 2. <q>Whether this were not to set
forth in order a declaration of those things
which are most surely believed among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</q>
I answer likewise, Yes. But then
I must adde, not all those things but the
principall; and the principall onely among
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46209:90"/>
those which concerned our Saviour in Person
while he lived on earth till his Ascension, as all
the Evangelists expresly say: for a further
proof whereof I adde this, It will not surely
be denyed but that among the Mysteries of
Christianity that of <hi>Pentecost</hi> holdes a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
place, at which time was the Sealing, as
it were, of the Apostles Commission by the
Holy Ghost visibly descending and enabling
them to performe that for which our Saviour was
borne, preached, prayed, wrought miracles, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
rose againe and was glorified, that is,
the promulgation and propagation of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
law (as the Jewish Pentecost was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to commemorate the Promulgation of
the Mosaicall law:) Surely then this Mystery
is a principall one, and necessary to be believed
and commemorated, at least by most Christians
capable of instruction, however by a well ordered
Christian Church. Yet meerly because this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the descent of the Holy Ghost hapned
ten dayes beyond the time that all the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
fixed to their Gospells not any of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
it: far was it from them to agree in the
omitting of it upon this opinion that it was not
necessary.</p>
               <p>To the 3. Question, viz. <q>Whether the
whole Gospell of Christ, and every necessary
doctrine of it were not surely believed among
Christians? </q> I answer, Yes. Yea more, that not
onely the Gospell, that is, the Historicall narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christs life, Sermons, &amp;c. but whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Holy Ghost afterward taught &amp; ordered
in the Church, was the object of Christian faith,
as perteining to the Gospell, that is, the New
Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:46209:91"/>To the 4. <q>Whether they which were eye-witnesses
and Ministers of the word from the
beginning delivered not the whole Gospell
of Christ?</q> I Answer, Yes, in this sence, that
all this Gospell, as far as concernes our Saviours
personall actions and passions during his abode
among men hath been delivered sufficiently in
the<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>by the foure Evangelists all
together; but in particular, S. <hi>Marke</hi> omi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s the
Incarnation, birth, &amp;c. of Christ S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the
Lords Prayer, the Blessed Sacrament, &amp;c. very
substantiall things in Christian Religion
surely.</p>
               <p>To the 5. <q>Whether S. <hi>Luke</hi> doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to write in order those things whereof he
had perfect understanding from the first? </q> I
answer still, Yes.</p>
               <p>To the 6. <q>Whether he had not perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the whole Gospell of Christ? </q>
I answer, <hi>Yes:</hi> yea more, that if by the Gospell
of Christ we meane, as he does, the story of
Christ, he could have added many more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
not unconsiderable, if he had pleased,
and if he had not thought that that which he did
write was sufficient for his purpose, and
many more particulars, yet he could have written
of the Gospell of Christ, if by that be meant
Christian Religion in generall.</p>
               <p>To the 7. <q>Whether he doth not undertake
to write to <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ophilus</hi> of all those things
wherein he had been instructed?</q> I answer,
Yes, keeping within the limits of his designe.</p>
               <p>To the 8. <q>And whether he had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in all the necessary points of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
of Christ?</q> I answer, Yes, viz. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:46209:91"/>To the 9. Whether in the other Text (of
<hi>Act. c.</hi> 1.) those words, all things which Jesus
began to do and teach, must not at least imply
all the principall and necessary things? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Yes,</hi> keeping to his subject.</p>
               <p>To the 10. <q>Whether this be not the very
interpretation of your Rhemish Doctours in
their annotations upon this place?</q> I answer,
<hi>I know not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the 11. <q>Whether all these Articles of
the Christian Faith, without the belief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no man can be saved be not the principall
and most necessary things which Jesus taught?</q>
I must answer by parcells. 1. I cannot assent
to that, that no man can be saved without the
beliefe of all these Articles, <hi>viz.</hi> conteined in
the Creed, of which he treates in this Chapter:
for I doubt not but some particular man in
some cases and extremities may be saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having received information of our <hi>Saviours
being borne of a Virgin,</hi> of his <hi>being three dayes
in the Grave,</hi> his <hi>Descent into Hell,</hi> &amp;c. 2. I am
assured that now Christians (having means of
more sufficient illumination) are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
more then the simple bare <hi>twelve Arti les
of the Creed;</hi> for the four first Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
do much enlarge the signification of them,
and besides p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>opose other points, at least indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
objects of our belief. 3. To the following
words I answer that though those points were
the principall and most necessary things, which
Jesus taught, yet this makes nothing against
Catholique doctrine. 1. Because many men are
necessarily bound to know more then what is in
it selfe simply necessary: and, 2. Our Saviour
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46209:92"/>
himselfe sayes expresly that besides those points
which himselfe taught them, there were others
more sublime and surely necessary to some,
which till the Comforter came, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
them further, they were not able to
beare.</p>
               <p>To the 12. and last Question, viz. <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
many things which S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath written in
the Gospell be not lesse principall, and lesse
necessary then all and every one of them?</q>
I answer, Yes, and good reason for it; since
his intent being to write a History and not a
Catechisme, it was fit for him to relate (<hi>grosse
modo</hi>) all things that Jesus said or did, whether
necessary, or not: for as every circumstance
and action of Christ (though worth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
was not a mystery necessary to be related;
so neither were all his words articles of Faith
necessary both to be known and believed.</p>
               <p>3. Whereas for a Corollary and Appendix
to these Demands, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> adds this
<hi>Prosopopaea,</hi> to his adversary, <q>When you have
well considered these proposalls, I believe you
will be very apt to thinke (if S. <hi>Luke</hi> be of any
credit with you) that all things necessary to
salvation are certainly conteined in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
alone:</q> If his learned adversary would
give me leave, I would answer; That truly I
have according to the capacity of my weake
understanding well considered these proposalls,
and S. <hi>Luke</hi> is of very great credit with mee,
and yet I doe not finde in my selfe any aptitude
at all to believe that all things necessary to
salvation, (that is, with respect to all men and
all Churches as the present controversy requires)
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46209:92"/>
are certainly conteined in his writings alone;
and this for severall reasons before alledged:
to which I will adde this one more for a close
of this whole conclusion, viz. Because I judging
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s opinion to be very reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
that upon this <hi>hypothesis</hi> (that all things
necessary are conteined in Scripture) it must
follow that they are conteined there most cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
expresly and so as no reasonable honest man
can doubt of the sense of them; I am notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
most assured that no man can finde in
S. <hi>Lukes</hi> writings expresse words sufficient to
confute all Haeretiques that ever taught any
thing destructive to salvation. It may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
so excellent a wit as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s
by the advantage of Logick and diligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Fathers, &amp;c. may out of S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel
draw conclusion after conclusion, and so at last
infer propositions contrary to <hi>Socinian doctrine,</hi>
for example: yet he should deny his owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
if he should call that doctrine a Haeresie,
or so much as an errour of the least danger,
which contradicts perhaps the fifth or sixth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
drawne from an Article of Faith it
selfe. Let any man therefore for tryall take S.
<hi>Luke,</hi> or all the four; Gospells, yea the whole
Bible, and I am perswaded he will finde it a
more then <hi>Herculean</hi> labour out of all to frame
such a Creed as the <hi>Nicene</hi> or <hi>Athanasian,</hi> and
much more, all the points concluded in the
four first Generall Councells, which truly I
believe necessary to be believed, and I do not
begin to believe so now, I was taught so when
I lived in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>II. Conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second Conclusion out of the
Fathers, &amp;c. was this, viz.</hi>
That it belongs alone to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church, which is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depositary of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
authoritatively and with
obligation to propose those reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
to all Christians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to
interpret the Holy Scriptures, and
to determine all emergent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies;
and this to the end of
the world, in as much as the
Church by vertue of Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46209:93"/>
and assistance is not onely
indefectible, but continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in all truth.</p>
               <p>1. IN this conclusion there are severall parts,
as 1. <q>That the Catholique Church is
the depositary of all Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
written and unwritten. 2. By conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
that it belongs to her to propound
them to all persons. 3. That she has authority
and that such as requires submission from all,
not only to propound, but also to expound
these Revelations, and finally to determine all
emergent controversies. And 4. That this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is sufficiently grounded upon the great
promises of our Saviour made unto his
Church.</q> Now of these severall Propositions,
the two former not being questioned by me
when I was in <hi>England,</hi> I conceived it not sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to my designe (which was a narration e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
of mine owne doubts and resolution
with as much brevity as possibly I could) to
fill paper with quotations of Fathers or other
proofes to resolve that of which I was resolved
before. My only scruple was concerning the
third and fourth Propositions, Or, to speake
properly, it was not a scruple, for I was on the
contrary fully resolved, and, to my thinking,
satisfied that there was not upon earth any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
authority that could so interpret. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or determine Controversies, is that all men
should be obliged necessarily to embrace her
interpretations and determinations: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my purpose is to insist principally upon his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46209:94"/>
Architectonirall controversie, not neglecting in
the meane time to examine likewise the other
propositions, but briefly and <hi>quasi aliud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It may be believed, and, since this treatise
is intended by mee for an <hi>Exomologesis</hi> or
publique Confession, I will not forbeare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it, that when the progress of my enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Church led me at last to take into debate
even those grounds, of which before I had not
the least scruple at all, namely, Whether, as the
Roman Church professed, <hi>there were extant in
the world visible any such authority,</hi> I could not
free my selfe from so much partiality against
my owne understanding, as to wish that it could
be made appeare unto me, that there were to be
found any tribunall whose decisions I might
believe my selfe obliged to follow without any
scruple or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ergiversation: For then I should not
onely in a moment be free from all scruples and
doubts in particular points proposed by that
authority, in which they would all be swallowed
up; but likewise from a world of inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
inevitably attending upon my position, viz.
<q>That in doubts of Religion we had onely a
Rule of it selfe indeed infallible, but challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by all Sects, and no Judge to apply that
Rule when necessity required, every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left to his own reason, at his own perill to
take heed that he wrested not that Rule accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his owne interests or prejudices.</q>

of the Churches authority

pretending to an immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. BUt before I proceed further to shew
how and upon what grounds I found
satisfaction in this point of the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
after which I could not long remaine unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed
in all other points beside: I have
somewhat, though not much, to say concerning
the first part of this Conclusion, namely of the
Churches being depositary of divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I do not remember that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> hath said any thing of it, more then
what may be inferred from those words in the
6. Article, <q>In the name of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
we do understand those Canonicall
bookes of the Old and New Testament, of
whose authority was never any doubt in the
Church.</q> By which expression She seemes
to make the Churches authority the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ground that may ordinarily be relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the discerning which books are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
and which not. And this Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
acknowledges in severall passages of his
booke.</p>
               <p>2. But as for the <hi>Calvinist</hi> Churches in <hi>France</hi>
(whether the <hi>Lutherans</hi> agree with them or no,
I had not meanes to informe my selfe) I could
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46209:95"/>
not without both indignation and shame read
how they have declared their mindes touching
this Point in their publique Confession of
Faith: Where, after the premising what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
bookes of Scripture they received as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall,
they adde these words, <hi>Nous recognois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
&amp;c. that is, <q>We acknowledge these books
to be Canonicall, and a most certaine Rule
of Faith, not so much for the commune
agreement and consent of the Church, as for
the Testimony and inward perswasion of the
Holy Spirit, which makes us able to discerne
them from the other Ecclesiasticall books, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, although they be profitable, cannot
be grounded an Article of Faith.</q> By which
expression they do clearly tell the world, that
their meaning is (not to ascribe to the assistance
of the Holy Spirit this their beliefe, for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
all Christians doe acknowledge a necessity
of such an influence upon the soule, whereby
the understanding is perswaded to captivate it
selfe to the beliefe, and the will inclined to the
love and acceptation of all divine revelations
proposed by the Church: But) that they have a
new immediate, distinct revelation and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Holy Ghost inwardly informing them
what bookes are Canonicall and what not:
And this not only more certaine then the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the present Church, but likewise contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thereto, inasmuch as thereby they renounce
severall books: which the Church proposes as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Canonicall.</p>
               <p>3. Was it possible that reasonable men could
write such things, and ever hope to finde
any other men foolish enough to believe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46209:95"/>
them? There seems to have been many persons
conspiring to the writing, or at least the signing
of this Confession: Had all these this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Gods Spirit revealing to them, and
so enabling them to judge and discerne
which particular writings are Canonicall, and
which not? And does this testimony (which
certainly, if not falsely pretended to, is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible)
extend to all the particular passages and
Texts in these books, without which the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the books in grosse would be uselesse?
VVell, since they may say what they please
without feare of being silenced, and so
may all their Off-spring; For what other way is
left to silence him that sayes he has the Spirit,
but only <hi>Exorcismes?</hi> Yet for those that wrote
this Confession to say this both for themselves
and in the name of all their faction to the worlds
end, and this without consulting any of them
to know whether they had received such an
immediate revelation or testimony, and
without pretending to such an eminent gift
of Prophecy, as never was example of the like
since the world began, this exceedes all
wonder. Good Lord! to what strange times
are we reserved, to see a Sect so numerous, so
powerfull (as they have shewed themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many sad occasions) and not one of them
but is a Prophet? What a stupendious thing
is this that there should not be found one Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist
destitute of this so certeine, so divine a
testimony, beyond the assurance of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
since Christ, and yet not one <hi>Englishman</hi> or
<hi>Frenchman</hi> unlesse of that faction, nor any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
that I know of besides that knowes any
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46209:96"/>
such thing of himselfe, or dares pretend to it?
For surely if any one had it, some would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it, since a man cannot have a Testimony,
but he knowes he has it. This is a miracle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all that Christ and all his (Apostles ever
wrought in the Church. But is it not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
nay is it not beyond all probability most
certaine, most palpable that all these men
knowingly and wilfully deceive themselves,
and would fain but cannot deceive others? Is
not this apparently <hi>a lying against the Holy Ghost?</hi>
Why may it not as well be expected that in
their next Confession (or rather, their Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption)
they should pretend (as at least most
particular writers among them doe) for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their heires a discerning infallible
Spirit to judge of the sense of Scripture, as
well as the books? Indeed, what may not be
expected from such as having had a hatred to
charity, and therefore no true love to the truth,
God has justly given over to strong delusions to
believe such palpable lyes?</p>
               <p>4. But leaving these men miserably pleasing
themselves in pretended inspirations, and by
that meanes attributing to the Holy Ghost not
only all their errours, but likewise their renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Christian Charity &amp; Unity, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
as long as they take upon them to believe
that it is from the Spirit that they have divided
themselves from Gods Church both in opinion
and practise: I will returne to my enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the authority of the Church.</p>

                  <p>Importance of the Controversie concerning

               </argument>
               <p>1. PRoceeding therefore for mine owne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to read the Fathers upon this
argument, and resolving to read them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
as possibly I could, that is, silencing
mine owne understanding, when it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
that no discourse or Rhetorique ought
to have force against those demonstrations,
which I thought I had against the Churches
infallibility, or when it would invent forced
senses to that world of passages which I found
in the Fathers inconsistent with my pre-assumed
assurance; Proceeding I say, in the best manner
I could to the reading of the Fathers upon this
point, I found that as this controversie was of
so infinite importance that upon the decision
thereof eternall peace or warre in Religion
among Christians depended, the most wise and
mercifull Providence had suitably furnished us
with meanes of satisfaction in so important
a point, infinitely more copious, evident and
powerfull, then in any other besides: For in
other speciall points of Controversie we must
be content to informe our selves of the minde
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46209:97"/>
of Antiquity therein onely by particular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
passages of the Fathers, commonly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>en passant,</hi> they having no occasion ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to combate with Heretiques about them:
But in this businesse of the Churches authority
I found Epistles, Treatises, Bookes, yea vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes
full of almost no other subject; I found
(that I may here before the proper season de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the successe of so many moneths labour)
that the maintaining of the authority of the
Church against Heretiques alledging onely Scripture
as a Rule, and disclaiming all Judges
of that Rule but themselves as to themselves,
had beene the businesse of many Ages, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
employment of many the learnedst ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
Fathers of the Church: I found that such
an authority of the Church had been a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all others most Universall, not any one
booke of Scripture being so often testified of
in Antiquity as this: I found that if this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Church were not to be preserved
inviolable, all Synods and Councels that ever
were in the Church fell to the ground, yea more,
became not only of no validity, but were to
be esteemed the most unjust Tyrannicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
that ever were, as presuming without
sufficient warrant to accuse and anathematize
whosoever opposed or accepted not their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
even in such points as were not in
Scripture at all, or at most onely there in
consequence to their interpretation: Lastly, I
found to my infinite satisfaction, and for which
I thinke my selfe obliged to spend the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test
part of my life in glorifying Almighty
God for it, a full, effectuall and experimentall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46209:97"/>
satisfaction by acknowledging this authority,
and suffering my selfe to be taken out of my
owne hands, to be conducted by her that
Christ had appointed for that office; in a word,
I found, that that saying of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> was most
true, viz. <q>That the Sun of the Church present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dryes up all the streames of errour and
Schisme. </q>
               </p>
               <p>2. For these reasons I cannot chuse but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
all Protestants, especially English (who
think satisfaction and repose of mind upon earth,
and glory to be revealed in heaven to be things
desirable) that, omitting, or at least deferring all
particular disputes with Catholiques, they
would in the first place without prejudice and
partiallity examine what the present Catholique
Church sayes, and in what words Shee sayes it
when Shee comes to declare her necessary
doctrine concerning this her authority: and that
having found what it is that Shee requires to
be believed, they would (without altering her
expression, and without applying thereto
any particular Schoole-man's or Doctours
interpretations, as by an obliging necessity to be
subscribed to or received) compare what the
Church defines, with what the Fathers &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
do generally and purposely agree in: And
if this method produce not in them the same
effect, which, by the blessing of God, it did
in mee, yet at least they will have this content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
after an ingenuous, and, to my knowledge,
not-much by them-practised way of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to conclude, that they finde that their
owne single judgement and interpretation of
Scripture deserves rather to be relyed upon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46209:98"/>
and to be preferr'd above all manner of visible
authority of all persons and ages, how sacred so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
esteemed by others; they will either
become Catholiques, or remaine in their
own (then not very unreasonable opinion)
Protestants still, but persons meriting from
themselves the highest esteem for <hi>infallibility</hi>
that the Church ever enjoyed since the Apostles
times.</p>

what at large most of the bookes wherein
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46209:98"/>
they are found, endeavour generally to prove,
whether Logically and rationally or no, let
the world judge, I am sure they proved it
so effectually, that they have thereby ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
destroyed the Heresies that opposed
them.</p>
               <p>Let the first witnesse therefore be S. <hi>Irenaeus,
(lib. 3. c. 4.)</hi> 
                  <q>Where the Church is there
is the Spirit (<hi>of God</hi>) and where the Spirit of
God is there is the Church and all grace. <hi>The
same Father againe, lib. 4. c. 43.</hi> We must obey
those Priests that are in the Church: those
that have succession from the Apostles, who
together with Episcopall power have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the good pleasure of the Father
received the certain gift of Truth. And all the
rest who depart from the originall succession,
wheresoever they be assembled, to have suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
either as Haeretiques or Schismatiques or
Hypocrites: and all these do fall from the
truth. <hi>Againe, lib 4. c.</hi> 62. The spirituall man
shall judge them that be out of the Church,
Which Church shall be under no mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For to the Church all things are
known, in which is perfect faith of the Father,
and of the dispensation of Christ, and firme
knowledge of the Holy Ghost teacheth al truth.
<hi>Again, l. 5. c.</hi> 4. What if the Apostles had not left
Scriptures, ought we not to have followed the
Order of Tradition which they delivered
to those to whom they committed the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
To which order many yeild assent,
who believe in Christ, having salvation
written in their hearts by the Spirit of God
without letters or ink, and diligently keeping
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46209:99"/>
ancient Tradition. It is easy to receive the
truth from God's Church, seeing the Apostles
have most fully deposited in her as in a rich
Store-house all thinges belonging to truth:
For what! if there should arise any contention
of some small questions, ought we not to have
recourse to the most ancient Churches, and
from them to receive what is certaine and
cleare concerning the present question?</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. <q>
                     <hi>Witness</hi> Tert. (<hi>de Preser.</hi>) Therefore we must
not appeale to Scriptures, neither is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
to be settled upon them, in the which
there will be either no victory at all, or very
uncertaine, &amp;c. <hi>Againe,</hi> Order did require
that that should be proposed in the first place,
which ought now to be onely debated,
viz. Which of the parties is possessed of
that faith to which the Scriptures agree,
from whom, and by whom, and when, and to
whom that discipline was delivered, by which
men are named Christians: For wheresoever
it shall appeare that the truth of the Christian
discipline or Faith is, there will also be found
the truth of Scriptures, and expositions, and all
Christian Traditions. <hi>Witnesse</hi> Origen, Since
there be many who thinke they believe
the things which are of Christ, and some
are of different opinion from those who went
before them, let the doctrine of the Church
be kept, which is delivered from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
by order of succession, and remaines in
the Church to this very day. That onely is
to be believed for truth which in nothing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrees
from the Tradition of the Church.
<hi>And again,</hi> in our understanding of Scriptures
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46209:99"/>
we must not depart from the first Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Tradition, nor believe otherwise then as
the Church of God hath by succession delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>4. <q>Witnesse S. <hi>Cyprian, (de unit. Eccl.)</hi> There is
one head &amp; one Source &amp; one Mother, by the
Issue of her fruitfulnesse copious: by her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
we are born, we are nourished with her
milk, with her Spirit we are quickned:
The Spouse of Christ cannot be defiled with
adultery, Shee is pure and chast: Shee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
one house and with chast bashfulness keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the sanctity of one bed. This preserveth
us in God: This advanceth to the Kingdome
the Children that shee hath brought forth:
Whosoever divideth from the Church
and cleaveth to the adultresse, hee is sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the promises of the Church: He
cannot have God to his Father, that hath not
the Church to his Mother. Witnesse, <hi>Lactantius,
(l. 4. c. ult.</hi>) It is onely the Catholique Church
that hath the true worship and service of God:
this is the wel-spring of truth, the dwelling-place
of Faith, the temple of God: into which
whosever entreth not, and from which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
departeth is without all hope of life
and eternall salvation. Witnesse S. <hi>Basile</hi> and
S. <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi> who (<hi>as Ruffinus (Hist. Eccl. l. 2.
c. 29.)</hi> relateth took the interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
not of their own sense but from the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Fathers. Witness S. <hi>Cyril of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
(lat. 18.)</hi> The Church is called Catholique
because it is spread over the universall world
from one end to the other: and because it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
Catholiquely and entirely all doctrine
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46209:100"/>
which are to be known. Witnesse S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
Faith is the foundation of the Church:
for it was not spoken of the flesh of <hi>Peter,</hi>
but of his faith, That the gates of Hell
should not prevaile: His Confession over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Hell: and this Confession ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
many Haeresies: for seeing the
Church like a good Ship is beat upon by many
waves, the Foundation of the Church must
prevail against all Haeresies. <hi>L. de incarn. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Againe, Ep.</hi> 54. The heighth of all authority,
&amp; all the light of reason for the reparation and
reformation of mankinde consists only in
the saving name of Christ, and in his
only Church. <hi>Again, (Ep. 56)</hi> The supream Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of our Faith hath fortified his
Church with the cittadell of authority,
and by meanes of a few persons piously lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
hath armed it with copious provisions of
unconquerable reason. That therefore to him
is the most right discipline, that especially the
weak should retire into this cittadell of Faith,
to the end that for their defence being placed
most securely, others should combat with most
strong reasons. <hi>Again, (de util Cred. c. 16)</hi> if the
Providence of God doth not precide over hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs, no care is to be had concerning
Religion. But if the severall variety of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which ought be believed to have flowed
from some fountain of most perfect beauty,
and by certain inward instinct doth exhort
both publiquely and privately those who are
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46209:100"/>
naturally better disposed, attesting that God
is to be sought and worshipped: we ought
not to despaire but that there is some au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
placed by the same God, upon which
we raising and settling our selves as upon a
most firm basis, may be exalted up unto God.
<hi>Againe,</hi> This is the providence of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
this is commanded us from heaven,
this is delivered unto us by our Blessed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
this is preserved even to these our
times: to be willing to disturb and pervert
this, is nothing else but to seek a sacrilegious
way to true Religion. <hi>Again, (de unit Eccl c. 19.)</hi>
Neither thou nor I do read this evidently and
expresly (<hi>viz in the Scriptures</hi>) But if there were
to be found in the world any one endow'd with
wisdome and recommended by the testimony
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and if such an one
were consulted with by us touching this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
we should in no wise doubt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
whatsoever such an one should say unto
us; and this for fear of being judged to have
opposed not so much such a person, as our Lord
Jesus Christ himself, by whose testimony such
an one is recommended: Now Christ gives te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
to his Church. <hi>Again, (de Bap. l. 5. c. 23.)</hi>
To speak the truth, the Apostles have prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
nothing concerning this, but this custome
ought to be believed to have taken it's origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
from their Tradition, As there are many
things which the universall Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
the which in good right ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to have been delivered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
although they be not found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
<hi>Againe, (lib. 4.)</hi> That which the universall
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46209:101"/>
Church holds, and it is not ordeined by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
but hath been alwayes reteined and
observed is most justly believed to have been
delivered no other way than by Apostolique
Tradition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We must observe in these
things that which the Church of God
observes: the Question therefore between
you and us is, Whether of the two, Yours or
Ours is the Church of God? <hi>Againe,</hi> To
omit therefore this sincere wisdom which you
will not allow to be in the Catholique
Church: There are many other things which
most justly keep me in her bosome, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Peoples and Nations keep me there;
The authority begun by Miracles, nourished
by hope, augmented by charity, confirmed
by Antiquity keep me there; The succession
of Prelates ever since the Seat of <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom
our Lord after his Resurrection committed the
feeding of his sheep, to this present Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
keep me there; And finally the very
name of Catholique keeps me there, the which
name this Church alone not without cause
hath reteined among so many and great
Haeresies, insomuch as when any stranger
demands where the assembly is, wherein a
man may communicate with the Catholique
Church, there is not any one Heretique
ha's the boldnesse to shew him his Temple or
house, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These so many, and so strong,
and most deare tyes of the Christian name
with good right retein a believer in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church, although that by reason of the
slowness of our understanding, or want of
merit in our lives, the truth doth not as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46209:101"/>
yet shew it self unto us with perfect evidence.
<hi>Againe, the same Father in the same book,</hi> (ca. 5.)
I doe not believe (<hi>saith he</hi>) that <hi>Manichaeus</hi>
is the Apostle of Christ, I pray you be not
angry, neither begin to give ill language:
For you know that I have resolved not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
rashly any thing produced by you. I ask
therefore, Who is this <hi>Manichaeus?</hi> You will
answer, the Apostle of Christ. I do not believe
it. Now thou wilt find nothing what thou
shouldst say or do; for thou didst promise
me a science of truth, and now thou forcest
me to believe a thing that I know not. It
may be thou wilt read the Gospel unto
mee, and from thence wilt endeavour to
assert the person of <hi>Manichaeus.</hi> But what
if thou shouldest light upon one that
doth not yet believe the Gospel, what wouldst
thou doe to him when he tells thee, I do not
believe? And truly, I my self would not
believe the Gospel, were it not that the
authority of the Catholique Church moves
me Now why should I not believe the same
persons saying to me, Believe not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichaeus,</hi>
to whom I gave credence, saying,
Believe the Gospel? Chuse what thou wilt:
If thou shalt say, Believe the Catholiques:
they move me to give no credence to you,
therefore if I believe them, I must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
not believe thee. If thou shalt say, Doe
not believe Catholiques, Thou shalt
doe unjustly compelling me by the Gospel
to believe <hi>Manicheus,</hi> because the
same Gospel I believed upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

                     </gap>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:46209:102"/>
say, Thou didst well to believe the Gospell
upon the commendation of Catholiques, but
ill in believing them discommending Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus:
Doest thou think me so very a fool,
as that without any reason rendred I should
believe what thou pleasest, and dis-believe
what thou likest not? So that surely I doe
much more justly and warily, if because I
am already a believer I doe not forsake
the Catholiques to come over to thy partie,
unlesse thou commandest me not to believe,
but undertakest to shew me something
that may be known most manifestly and
apparently. Therefore if thou wilt afford me
reason, quit the Gospel: if thou holdest
thy self to the Gospel, I must hold my selfe
to those upon whose command I believed
the Gospel: and upon the same persons
commandement, I must by no meanes
believe thee. But if by chance thou
shouldst be able to find in the Gospell some
passage most evident concerning the Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Manicha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Catholiques, who command mee not to
believe thee: which authority being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validated
I would no longer believe the
Gospell it selfe, because it was for their sakes
that I believed it. So that whatsoever thou shalt
alledge, will have no force with me.</q> To the
same purpole the same Father, (<hi>lib. de util. cred. c.</hi>
14.) <q>Why should I not most diligently enquire
what Christ commanded of them before all

                     </gap> that Christ commanded any good
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46209:102"/>
thing? Canst thou better declare to me
what hee said, whom I would not have
thought to have beene, or to be, if the belief
thereof had beene recommended by thee to
me? This therefore I believed by fame
strengthened with celebrity, consent, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
But every one may see that you, so
few, so turbulent, so new, can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
deserving authority. VVhat mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is this? Believe them [Catholiques]
that we ought to believe Christ; but learne
of us what Christ said. VVhy, I beseech
thee? surely if they [Catholiques] were
not at all, and could not teach me any
thing, I would more easily perswade my
selfe that I were not to believe Christ, then
that I should learn any thing concerning
him from any other then them by whom
I believed in him. <hi>Lastly the same Father, (con.
Cres. I. 1. c. 33.)</hi> Although <hi>(saith he)</hi> there cannot
be produced out of the Scriptures any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of such a thing, yet the truth of the

when we doe that which pleaseth the whole
Church, the which the authority of the same
Scriptures doth commend, that because
the holy Scriptures cannot deceive us,
whosoever feareth to be deceived with the
obscurity of this question, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the judgement of the Church, which
the Holy Scriptures without any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
doe demonstrate: to the end that
because the Scriptures cannot deceive us,
whoseover is afraid to be deceived by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
of any question, may have recourse to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46209:103"/>
the Churches judgement concerning it,
the which (Church) the Holy Scriptures
demonstrate without any ambiguity.</q>

                     <hi>Witnesse</hi> S. <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis,</hi> (c. 2.)
Inasmuch as all do not take the Scripture in
the same sense by reason of it's profundity,
but some on one fashion, some on another,
so that almost as many sences may seem to be
drawn from it as there are men: for <hi>Novatianus</hi>
expounds it one way, <hi>Photinus</hi> another, <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>

another, And lastly <hi>Nestorius</hi> another:
For this reason to avoyd the labyrinth of so
many contrary errours, it is very necessary that
the line of Propheticall and Apostolicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
should be drawn according to the
rule of Ecclesiasticall and Catholique sense,
or intelligence. <hi>Witnesse lastly</hi> S. <hi>Leo,</hi> It is not to

is of divine institution, and that whatsoever

                  <q>It is to us a safe

have been agitated in any Catholique-National-Synod,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46209:104"/>
nor determined in any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenicall:
but to maintaine that with the
assurance of a secure voice, which in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of our Lord God and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ hath been strengthned with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the universall Church. <hi>And againe,</hi>
In the former ages of the Church before the
Schisme of <hi>Donatus. (Id. de Bapt. con. Don. I. 1.)</hi>
The obscurity of that Question (viz con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Rebaptization of Haeretiques) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
great persons and endued with great
charity to dispute and debate among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
however without any breach of peace:
In so much that in severall Countreys for a
long time the decisions of severall Councells
did vary and clash among themselves, untill
in a Plenary Councell of the whole world that
which was soundly believed, was without all
manner of doubt confirmed.</q> Again, <hi>(Id. con.
Parm Ep. lib. 2)</hi> 
                  <q>the question being whether
Baptisme can be given by those men also
who never have been Christians; we ought
not to affirme determinately any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
without the authority of a Councell so great
as may be answerable to the greatnesse of the
matter. But concerning those who are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the unity of the Church, there is
no question at all but that they doe both
reteine it, and communicate it, and that they
do both perniciously reteine and perniciously
communicate it without the bond of Peace:
for this hath been already agitated, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
perfected and confirmed in the unity of
the whole world.</q> 
                  <hi>And againe, (Id. de Bapt. con.

                  <q>Neither durst we affirme
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46209:105"/>
any such thing if we were not well grounded
upon the most uniforme authority of the
universall Church, unto which undoubtedly
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would have yeelded, if in his time
the truth of this question had been discussed;
and declared, and by a Generall Councel
established.</q> Lastly, (to omit many expresse
testimonies of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis, Facundus,

the Great, (Ep. 24.)</hi> who professeth that
<q>he receives and venerates the fower first
Generall Councells no otherwise then the
fower Gospells: as likewise that he doth in
like manner embrace the fifth Councell.</q>
This was the language of the Catholique Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when they wrote many of them purposely
upon this very Question: And besides these
testimonies, other will be produced occasionally

                  <p>The great and apparent reasonablenesse

               </argument>
               <p>1. I will now subjoyn to the doctrine of the
<hi>antient Church</hi> that of the <hi>present Roman
Church,</hi> that being set in view the one of the
other, we may better judge how well they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
or what unlikenesse there is between
them. The substance of what the Church has
defin'd concerning this point is conteined in
this decision of the Councel of Trent <hi>(Sess. 4.)</hi>
viz. <hi>Praetercà ad coercenda petulantia ingenia,
decrevit (Synodus) Ut nemo, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <q>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
to the end to restrein petulant witts,
this Synod decrees, That no man relying
upon his own skill, and wresting Holy
Scripture to his own sences, shall presume to
interpret the Holy Scriptures in matters of
Faith and manners pertaining to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christian doctrine against that sence
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46209:106"/>
which hath been and is held by (<hi>our</hi>) holy
Mother the Church, to whom it appertains
to judge of the true sence and interpretation
of Holy Scriptures, and against the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
consent of Fathers, although such
interpretations were never at any time to be
published abroad.</q> The substance of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
is repeated in the <hi>Bull</hi> published by <hi>Pius
IV.</hi> concerning the <hi>Oath of the Profession of
Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This decision, considered simply as the
words import in their plaine direct sence, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me so strangely reasonable and equall,
requiring only due reverence to the <hi>present
Church,</hi> and implying with a strange ingenuity
and assurance a conformity with the doctrine
unanimously maintained in the <hi>antient Church,</hi>
that I could not believe but that some where
or other I should find a far greater burden laid
by <hi>her</hi> upon her childrens shoulders: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that information, which I received from
the learnedst Doctours of Controversie among
Catholiques (who for the most part doe dresse
this point in <hi>School-language,</hi> and exalt that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
to the utmost importance, deducing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the most rigid consequences from it) I
thought the bonds &amp; fetters wherein the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> rest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eined all <hi>in her Communion</hi> were far
more stringent and painfull, cutting even to
the very bones; So that this newly discovered
great equity of the Church made me suspicious,
and thereupon inquisitive: therefore I search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my selfe, and begg'd of others to search for
me into former Councells for somewhat more
rigorous and unreasonable: and after all, I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46209:106"/>
could not find in any <hi>declaration</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> in
any <hi>Councell universally received</hi> any higher or
more hardly-to be digested expression of the
<hi>Churches authority,</hi> then what is set downe in this
<hi>decree of the Councell of Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Then I perceived that it was that (as it
fell out through mine own unwarinesse, to me
unfortunate) word of <hi>infallibility,</hi> and that
word understood by me in the most rigorous
sence that the terme could import, that above
all other things made me despaire of ever being
able with a good conscience to enter into the
Communion of the <hi>Catholique Church:</hi> And
yet no such word could I find in any Councell,
no necessity appeared to me, that either I, or
any other Protestant should ever have heard
that word named, and much lesse pressed upon
us with so much earnestnesse and rigour as of
late it hath generally been in disputations and
bookes of Controversie. Against this word of
<hi>infallibility</hi> that (so much by all English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
exalted) <hi>booke</hi> of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
combats, and this with too too great
success, by reason that the <hi>Author</hi> makes his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of that word, affixing thereto a sense far
more strein'd and exilted, then, I am sure, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
doctrine,</hi> yea or even his learned <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist</hi>
doe require. Truly if Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
would have thought it for his purpose to have
proceeded with the ingenuity he professeth, and
have examined how much latitude might have
been allowed him in this point, concerning
this expression of the <hi>Churches infallibility</hi> in her
<hi>Conciliary decisions,</hi> he would have found that
he had much lesse cause to triumph in the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46209:107"/>
batteries that he pretends to make against
it. For first of all, the forecited Doctor <hi>Veron</hi>
saith expresly, <hi>That no mention is found of the word
Infallibility in the decrees of the Councell of Trent,</hi>
nor any other received <hi>Councell,</hi> and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
according to the designe of his <hi>Method,</hi>
that word cannot be, as of necessity, imposed
upon any one: A <hi>Method</hi> commended &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
by <hi>three Generall assemblies of the Cleargy
of France:</hi> without contradiction insisted on,
and prosecuted more then 40. years together by
him, both in Sermons, Disputations and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and the Author of it enabled to pursue
it, both by <hi>letters Patents of the King of France,</hi>
by the quality of a <hi>Catholique Doctour,</hi> and by
<hi>Episcopall Mission.</hi> Againe, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> treating
of the comparison between the <hi>Infallibility of a
Generall Councell,</hi> and that of <hi>Scripture,</hi> gives the
preeminence to Scripture in five severall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
among which the third is, <q>That in
Scripture there can be no errour, neither in
points of Faith nor manners, nor likewise
whether any thing be affirmed pertaining to
the whole Church, or onely to some few or
one particular person, whereas Councells may
erre in particular judgements. <hi>And the fowrth,</hi>
That in Scripture not only all sentences, but al
and every single word belong to Faith, whereas
in Councells neither the disputations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
nor the reasons added, nor illustrations
nor explications adjoyned doe belong to
Faith, but only the simple naked <hi>Decrees,</hi> and
not all those neither, but only such as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
as of Faith, &amp;c.</q> Hereto may be added
that even those <hi>naked decrees</hi> also are not alwayes
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46209:107"/>
necessarily to be understood according to the
latitude of the significations of the words and
expressions in themselves, but onely so far as
they are intended to contradict the speciall
<hi>Heresie</hi> condemned by them. Hence that <hi>famous
Carmelite,</hi> who modestly disguises himselfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the common title <hi>Salmanticensis</hi> (the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of this age both for subtility, perspicuity, and
profound solidity of judgement, in that part of his
Theological discourse, where he treats largely of
Angels) being to answer an Objection out of the
Councel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> hath these words, <hi>Ad digno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
an aliquid sit desinitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ab Ecclesia,</hi> &amp;c. that
is,<q> To be able to give a judgement, whether
any thing be defined by the Church, we must
(as <hi>Cajetan</hi> well observes) attend unto the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
which the Church proposeth to condemn,
and not to those things, which shee speaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently,
for such things doe not remaine
defined, neither is it erroneous in Faith to
opine against them. Now the intention of the
Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> in that decree was only to
exclude the errour of <hi>Origen,</hi> who affirmed,
That this visible world was not (<hi>per se</hi>)
directly intended by God; but onely occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
and by accident, to be a prison in
which the Devills should be punished: and
hereupon the Councell defined, That it was
Gods pleasure and will directly and out of his
primary intention, by his divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to create both the Angelicall and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature: Whereas in that Decree it
onely sayes incidently that he created at
once from the beginning both these Natures.
And therefore this last assertion is not by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46209:108"/>
vertue of the said definition become an
Article of Faith.</q>

De Angel. p.</hi> 364.</p>
               <p>4. Hence it will appeare what ill use Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> makes of the terme <hi>infallibility,</hi>
either unwillingly forgetting, or willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the great latitude that is allowed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and by unsuspected Catholique Authors
to the sense and notion of it: which latitude I
am assured his learned Adversary would have
been very willing to have allowed him. But it
was not for his purpose to accept, nor so much
as take notice of such allowance, it would have
spoiled and abated the edge of many of his
flourishing and seemingly subtile discourses. So
that it is apparent that Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against the <hi>Churches just authority,</hi> as
he pretends, (which to most English men, and
I am sure to me once appeared unanswerable)
If that the word <hi>infallibility</hi> were but laid by
for a while, yea if the unquestionably allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
qualifications if its sense were but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
would (I am confident by mine owne
experience) lose the greatest part of their
strength, and however appeare not to endanger
the Catholique Church at all.</p>
               <p>5. I doe not speak this (being now, as
I am, by Gods grace a Catholique) to the
end either to shew my selfe foolishly forward to
take part with any one Catholique writer or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
against another: (for the truth is, my
resolution was, that, if my mind disquieted with
scruples of Religion should chance to finde rest
in the Catholique Church, to submit my selfe
in all simplicity to her doctrine, to avoid as
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46209:108"/>
much as might be the interessing my selfe in
Disputes and Controversies, and the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all unusuall, suspected, devious, and rash
opinions, and to spend the remainder of my
life more to the benefit of my soule, then by
engaging my selfe in particular factions and
partialities, either about Doctrines or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.)
Nor secondly, to censure at randome all
those that make use of that terme in disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For I know that before any of our late
Schismes, that word was used perhaps without
any inconvenience by the Schoole men; and
if it were confined to that place where it was
bred, there would be still no inconvenience.
But since by manifest experience the Protestants
(I speak of <hi>England</hi>) thinke themselves so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
when they have leave to stand or fall by
that word, and in very deed have so much to
say for themselves, when they are pressed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily,
abruptly and too too rudely with
it, the sence thereof not being mollified and
sweetned by just and allowable qualifications:
Since likewise it is a word capable of so high a
sence that we cannot devise one more full and
proper to attribute to God himselfe, insomuch
as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> when he could prove
that the Church was not in so high a degree
infallible as the Apostles (shall I say?) no
not as God himselfe, thought he had gained the
victory: Whereas, besides <hi>Bellarmine</hi> before
quoted, S. <hi>Aug. (lib. 2. de Bapt. com. Don. cap. 3.)</hi>
expresly allowes to holy Scripture a place and
preeminence before the decisions of Councells;
Lastly since the Church (which Catholiques
in this controversie doe pretend to maintaine
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46209:109"/>
only) obliges no man to that word, which
is not found expresly in any of her received
Counsells, as <hi>Mounsieur Veron</hi> professeth: yea
since <hi>shee</hi> almost desivers the victory into their
hands when they urge only her decisions, and
when they urge them in the latitude that she
allows; Can I be blamed, if my duty to the
Church, my affection to mine own countrey
and indeed to all that call themselves Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and the remembrance how, if I had not
perceived that it might be permitted me in this
Controversy concerning the Church, to wave
that word of <hi>infallibility,</hi> I should perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have had occasion to speak this of it in a
writing of this nature, Can I (I say) be blamed,
if such reasons move me to wish that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
may either never be invited to combat
the authority of the Church under that notion?
Or however that when the terme of <hi>Infallibility</hi>
is used, it may not be pressed in a sense more
rigorous and comprehensive, then the Church
her selfe hath expressed.</p>
               <p>6. Now here by the way I think it fit, to the
end to prevent any mistake or misconstruction
of what hath been sayd touching the words
<hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> to expresse my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be this (<hi>viz.</hi>) That I am so far from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeing
the words themselves so generally made
use of, both by <hi>Schoole men</hi> and <hi>Controvertists,</hi>
that I professe I cannot devile any other single
termes by which to expresse the <hi>Churches</hi> just
and necessary <hi>Authority.</hi> For if it be true (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
it is, I am sure) That God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
his Church with an Authority to which
all Christisns are obliged to submit their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46209:109"/>
and captivate their wills; then it
must necessarily follow from the <hi>infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
and <hi>goodnesse of God,</hi> that his <hi>divine
providence</hi> will preserve his church in all truth,
so as to secure all believers that they cannot be
misled by following her, nor walk safely when
they follow any other direction: And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that she can neither deceive them, nor
be deceived her self; all which is clearly import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>distinct Grammaticall sense</hi> of those
single termes, <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
Notwithstanding since the same termes may
possibly be misconceived, because they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of comprehending a more extended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then is here expressed, as evidently they
do, when they are attributed to God and to his
immediately <hi>inspired</hi> word. And since <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
have, especially of late, entertained and
drunk in a notion and conception from these
termes far more rigorous and comprehensive,
then either the church her self, or most of the
most learned and approved <hi>Controvertists</hi> do
conceive any one to be obliged unto; which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is as yet very difficult to efface out of
their imaginations: Upon these grounds it is,
that both from mine own experience in my
self, and knowledge, that I think I have of the
peculiar temper of <hi>English Protestants;</hi> I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it convenient, and even requisite, to exhort
<hi>Catholiques</hi> treating with them, especially in
such times as these, that the <hi>fields are even
white unto the Harvest,</hi> and that very many
more may probably be won by a charitable
complyance (yet still without wrong to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Catholique doctrine. God forbid else)
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46209:110"/>
then perhaps by the most convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of reason, That they would condescend
so far, either to the misunderstandings, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
or infirmity of <hi>Protestants,</hi> as, since the
<hi>Church</hi> her self obliges no man to those very
expresse termes, for a while either to abstain
from them in <hi>disputes,</hi> or using them, to do it
with a <hi>qualifying preface,</hi> urging and fastning
no stricter a sense on them then the <hi>Churches
own Decision of her authority</hi> doth require.
Certainly the receiving of a soul from <hi>Heresie</hi>
and <hi>Schisme</hi> is a work so infinitely precious and
meritorious before <hi>Almighty God,</hi> that it
will deserve that we should employ in it, not
only all our strength of wit and learning, but
all our charity likwise; so imitating the great
example of that <hi>great Conductor of souls</hi>
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who told the <hi>Corinthians, Astutus
dolo vos cepi,</hi> that is, <hi>being crafty I caught
you with guile,</hi> namely, by <hi>instilling Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctrines</hi> into their minds leisurely and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
neither out of time enforcing unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
truths upon them, nor hastily and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
urging even necessary, but perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
ones, till he had prudently prepared a
way for them. Now if we, entreating with
well minded, but seduced souls, would, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> only propose to them at the first
necessary doctrines, and those represented with
all the lawfull <hi>inviting</hi> advantages, and most
easie constructions, we should no doubt, make
many <hi>points,</hi> from which for the present
through misapprehension they have a strong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
very receiveable, and very easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestable
to them. And by these meanes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46209:110"/>
been happy instruments of restoring them
to the Church, we may at leasure, if we have
a mind, seek to induce them to adhere unto,
and declare themselves for our particular <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
and distinctive <hi>interpretations</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
points.</p>
               <p>7. But to return from this digression, I most
affectionately entreat the Protestants, that they
would heedfully cast their eyes upon this <hi>decree
of the Councell of Trent,</hi> that they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
and turn it as they please; and when they
have done this, let them consider if a Synod of
<hi>Charenton,</hi> or <hi>Dort,</hi> or <hi>Gap</hi> do not, even while
they renounce all <hi>visible obliging authority,</hi>
usurp notwithstanding more then the <hi>Catholike
Church</hi> here challenges: Would any of them
give leave to any among them to interpret
Scriptures against their sense established by
them? Nay, do not they command men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<hi>Scriptures</hi> against <hi>doctrines</hi> unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
consented to by Fathers? Lastly,
would they suffer a French Protestant to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
Scriptures, but even as their brethren Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
in in <hi>England</hi> (heretofore during their
prosperity graced by them with that title) do
ordinarily interpret them (for example) about
<hi>Episcopacy, reall Presence,</hi> &amp;c? If therefore
such fragments of churches do allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so much, let Protestants try if they can
be unreasonable enough to impute tyranny to
the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> for forbidding any in
her communion to invent new senses of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
contrary not onely to the doctrine uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
embraced through the whole Catholike
world, but to this doctrine as professed to be
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46209:111"/>
the same which all Churches before, and all
Fathers unanimously consent in?</p>

               </argument>
               <p>1. I Will now proceed in my <hi>narration,</hi> how
and by what meanes (after I had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my selfe of the <hi>Roman Churches established
doctrine</hi> concerning <hi>her authority,</hi> and after I
had been assured by very learned Catholiques,
that I was not obliged to build upon any other
expression of this doctrine, but that of the
Church it selfe) I in ashort time arrived to a
full satisfaction of all the difficulties and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
that before I was incombred withall.</p>
               <p>2. The objections and difficulties by educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and many yeares study setled in my mind
against the Churches <hi>infallibility or authority,</hi>
and which were not suddainly cleared, after I
knew that the Church was more moderate and
condescending then I had before believed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
not only the substance of this doctrine,
but likewise many particulars and circumstances
of it, as likewise the immediate consequences
of it, forexample, How it could be justifyed
with certainty sufficient to support a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
faith, that the Church was legally possessed
of this authority; Where this authority was
scated, whether in the whole Church, or some
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46209:111"/>
speciall members of it; Upon what grounds it
was challenged; How far it was extended;
And after all these, what might appeare to me
to be the most rationall way for a Catholique
to expresse his <hi>resolution of faith,</hi> so confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by all Protestants charged with <hi>circles</hi> and
absurdities?</p>
               <p>3. To gaine satisfaction in these points,
as, for the <hi>foundation,</hi> I resolved only to
consider what the Church her selfe sayd, so for
an information more particular since the church
had not descended to so punctuall an expression
of her mind, conceived it my best way to have
recourse either to the writings or verball reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of such Catholiques of unsuspected O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
as had expressed themselves the most
moderately, intelligibly, with allowing the
greatest latitude, and lastly, most approaching
to the grounds which I thought before to be
most reasonable. The particular persons whose
speeches or writings contributed most to my
satisfaction, I shall occasionally name or
reflect upon in the pursuance of this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>4. Now I do not vainly pretend to, or so
much as trouble my self with wishing that any
man, Catholique, or other, should believe that
the method according to which I proceeded, or
the grounds which in mine own reasoning I
laid, were more rationall then others; for my
intent is only to make an <hi>Exomologesis,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that particular order and progresse
whereby I attained repose of mind in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Church, and great contentment
in abasing and captivating my reason: It will
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46209:112"/>
be sufficient for me if the grounds by me laid,
and inferences from them deserve not to be
condemned by Catholiques, to prevent which,
I may with confidence say that I took very
good advice, and used very great circumsp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that others should tell me that they could have

                  <p>Grounds laid to prove a certainty of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Severall degrees of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. SOme of the grounds laid by me in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to a distinct conception and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
concerning the Churches authority foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> and the certainty thereof,
have been already occasionally, though somwhat
before their due season, mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
conclusion, cap. 8. and 9. The substance
of which, together with others pertinent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
I will here, as in their proper and naturall
place, orderly set down.</p>
               <p>2. In the first place therefore, since all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of things past before our age can no
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46209:112"/>
other way be had (excepting only extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
or <hi>divine inspiration,</hi> not to be expected,
or relyed upon, if pretended, unlesse it be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by miracles) but by <hi>Tradition</hi> from the
times when such things hapned, yet arriving at
us by the testimony of the present times and
persons living with us: By consequence I had
no difficulty, but that in the present <hi>hypothesis</hi>
of <hi>Christian revelations</hi> the only immediate
witnesse of them was the present church, and
this either by orall profession, that thus she
had received by information and practise of the
precedent age; Or by writings of <hi>antiene
times</hi> continued and daily transcribed, but all
preserved and conveyed to us by the present
church.</p>
               <p>3. In the second place I considered that these
<hi>divine Revelations,</hi> and <hi>doctrines</hi> of <hi>Christian
Religion</hi> being of such a particular nature as
that, besides the believing them to have been,
we are obliged to assent unto and embrace
them, as the only necessary means of avoiding
eternall misery, and attaining to eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.
Hereupon it is, that the present church,
our only witnesse of them, represents them to
us, not only as the present age does the actions
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> or books of <hi>Cicero,</hi> that is, with so
much assurance that we cannot be reasonable
men and doubt of them, yet by doubting or
<hi>disbelieving</hi> them there is no losse to be feared,
but only of our reputation. But she proposeth
them to us as necessarily to be submitted to,
and <hi>her self</hi> as an authorised witnesse, having
received commission from the <hi>divine Author</hi>
to oblige all men to believe her, as a <hi>proponent.</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:46209:113"/>
Which double capacity of the church, viz.
1. <hi>Simply a proponent. 2. As an authorised pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,</hi>
I conceived it very requisite for me to
distinguish, and, at least, in my understanding,
to separate the one from the other: For though
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> who from their infancy have been
brought up in acknowledging the grounded au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the church, have no need to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
this double capacity for themselves, yet in
disputation with those Sects, which accept of
<hi>Tradition,</hi> simply at least for books of Scripture,
but deny such an obliging authority, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in explaining the manner of <hi>Resolution
of Faith,</hi> I conceived and found, as to my
self, great profit in this <hi>distinction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. In the third place, for simple <hi>Tradition</hi>
I enquired whether, and upon what grounds it
could be made to appear to be certain and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<hi>convincing.</hi> And upon mature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
I was satisfied that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
mistaken, who thought that there was
no absolute certainty in any knowledge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
only such as we receive either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by our senses, or by evident discourse and
demonstration of reason. For on the contrary
I found that knowledge from report of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might in some cases be as truly certain, as
that from sense or demonstration. So for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
before, I saw the City of Rome, I was
most assured that there was such a place, and
the reason was, because it was impossible that
such a world of writings and persons, all which
could not be led by interest to frame a lye,
should conspire to witnesse such a thing, and
not one person be found that contradicted
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46209:113"/>
them. The like may be said of <hi>Tradition,</hi> or
report of things past, when a whole age agrees
universally to acknowledge a <hi>Tradition</hi> under
that notion, neither friends nor enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting,
it is impossible that such a report
should be false: Yea I may add further, when
there are in the same age two <hi>Traditions</hi> of two
considerable parties directly contradicting the
one the other, it may fall out, yea sometimes it
may be most assured, that both of them must in
some respect be true. As for example, the
whole Nation of the Jewes dispersed all the
world over, do agree that they have received
as a most sure <hi>Tradition,</hi> that our Saviour was
an Impostor, and wrought all his pretended
miracles by Magick and help of the Divell; on
the contrary, all <hi>Christians</hi> through the whole
world agree that they have received a <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
that our Saviour was the true Messiah pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and that he wrought all those true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
by the power of God, and for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his <hi>divine doctrine:</hi> In this case these
two <hi>Traditions</hi> being in respect of the partyes
respectively universall, must necessarily be true,
though in some sort contradicting, yet not in
that wherein they contradict. For it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the Jewes received, and have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
propagated such a <hi>Tradition,</hi> though false
in the root, as that the <hi>Christians</hi> have received
the contrary: Notwithstanding reason may
judge <hi>infallibly</hi> between them concerning the
root of these <hi>Traditions,</hi> namely by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
that such miracles (acknowledged by
both sides to have been wrought) were many
of them of such a nature, as that they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46209:114"/>
all created power, and that the doctrine
was so <hi>divine,</hi> so destructive to the divell, as
that he was obliged in interest to endeavour
the <hi>annibilation</hi> of it: and lastly, that nothing
was either done or taught by our Saviour, but
what was agreeable to the antient <hi>Prophecies,</hi>
received by the Jews concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
&amp;c. upon which grounds it will evidenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that the Jews, who first received such a
<hi>Tradition,</hi> were abused by the malice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousnesse
of their ancestours, &amp;c. And this
is the only proper way of <hi>determining</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding</hi>
the controversie between these two Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>5. In generall therefore I found that a full
unquestionable certitude might be had of some
<hi>Traditious;</hi> as to give one example more, that
there was such a man as <hi>William Duke of
Normandy,</hi> who conquered England, is most
certain, not any Englishman or other that ever
heard of it, but believes it, and would impute
frenzy to any man that should call it in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now the reason why this is so certain to
every one, is this; because all men living at this
time, who either are inquisitive into times past,
or c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pable of <hi>information</hi> do agree; that this
particular was told them by their Predecessors,
as a thing come to them by <hi>Tradition,</hi> and so
the men of the former age of that before them,
thus ascending, till we come to the age wherein
he lived, and was personally known and seen by
his Subjects. Now it is impossible that all
men of any age should both agree together, and
actually effect that complot, to <hi>deceive their
children</hi> with a lye, under the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:46209:114"/>
Add to this; that the present age affords
us books and Records descending from hand to
hand, and written in severall ages between that
time and us, which testifie the same thing. As
likewise there are in the generall practise of
<hi>England, Lawes, Customes, Priviledges, &amp;c.</hi>
all which are acknowledged to have had their
<hi>Originall</hi> from the same <hi>Author.</hi> This is an
example of one of the highest degrees of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary
certitude</hi> that may be of a thing pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so many ages since, being confirmed by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Tradition, Universality, Records,</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and <hi>practises</hi> or <hi>customes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. An <hi>inferiour degree of certainty in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
(yet <hi>certainty however</hi>) is, for example,
<hi>that there was such a man as Alexander the
Great.</hi> This is a thing most certain, and yet
it wants many of those arguments of assurance
in the former example. There is indeed a kind
of <hi>Orall Tradition of this likewise,</hi> yet not
<hi>arriving</hi> unto this age and <hi>climate</hi> of the
world by such a generall succession as the
former, by reason that <hi>Alexander</hi> having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in a quarter of the world remote from us,
we are not descended from the men of his age,
who knew him; yet, it may be, some of them
or their children coming to <hi>Rome</hi> delivered
this, and so some <hi>Romanes</hi> conveighed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these Western parts of the world. There
are no customes or practises among us relating
to <hi>Alexander;</hi> so that the main arguments of
<hi>certainty</hi> are, 1. <hi>Positive,</hi> that is, <hi>writings</hi>
dispersed abroad, made by <hi>antient Grecians
and Romans,</hi> all testifying the same thing.
<hi>2. Negative,</hi> not one man appearing in this
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46209:115"/>
age, nor to be heard of in the former, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it, or so much as called it in question.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>A yet inferior degree of certainty in
Tradition</hi> may be exemplified in some writings,
as in S. <hi>Clements first Epistle to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
lately published and printed in <hi>England.</hi> For
that there was such an <hi>Epistle</hi> written is testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and was assuredly believed
by all learned men in this age before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of it: But it is, now near eight hundred
years that it ha's been missing in the world, for
<hi>Photius,</hi> I think, is the last writer that takes
notice to have read it. Of late this <hi>Epistle</hi> was
found in an ancient <hi>Manuscript</hi> in the <hi>King of
England's Library,</hi> sent him for a present out
of the <hi>Eastern countries.</hi> Now the <hi>certitude</hi>
that this is the same <hi>Epistle</hi> anciently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and read in the <hi>Church,</hi> appears in this:
1. That the characters of the <hi>Manuscript</hi> are
very ancient, (yet I do not believe it to have
been written by that glorious Virgin Martyr
S. <hi>Tecla,</hi> as the credulous <hi>Grecians</hi> would
pretend;) so that if it had been counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it was done in times, when the falsity
might have been discovered by unquestioned
copies. 2. That the stile is agreeing with the
ancient <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>gravity of Apostolique
writings.</hi> 3. That the subject is the very same
that those <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> who speak of it, do
mention. 4. That all the extraits and passages,
which the Fathers of the <hi>Church</hi> do quote out
of S. <hi>Clements</hi> true <hi>Epistle,</hi> are found in this.
Upon which grounds it may be truly said, and I
believe no man will contradict it, <hi>that this is
certainly S. Clements Epistle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:46209:115"/>8. It is likely that besides these degrees of
certainty, more upon consideration might be
found out: but these I esteemed enough for my
present purpose. Now by <hi>certainty</hi> I intend
not <hi>certitudinem rei,</hi> for <hi>so</hi> nothing that is or
hath been is in it self more certain then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for even a thing that ha's its existence
from <hi>free</hi> or <hi>casuall</hi> causes, when it is, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as any other thing produced by causes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so determinate, efficacious or necessary: But
<hi>certitudinem quoad nos,</hi> that is, our assurance
that it hath been: And a thing I call <hi>more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
in this notion (not which ha's less doubt
or suspition of not being, for if there be any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
suspition, there is <hi>no certainty,</hi> no not in
the lowest degree: but) that which ha's more
wayes to prove it self to be certain then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>Divine revelations proved to be certain
beyond humane story.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. I Will now proceed by way of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to demonstrate <hi>the high degree of
certitude;</hi> which we may have of <hi>divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
testified by the present Church, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a simple proponent, setting aside the
authority which she challenges to oblige all
men to submit to. In which discourse we are
to consider four things especially in <hi>Christian
Religion,</hi> coming to us by <hi>Tradition,</hi> but in
<hi>subordinate</hi> degrees of <hi>certitude, viz. 1. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
meerly speculative,</hi> and which hardly
could be testified in the practise of the church.
2. <hi>Books of Scripture. 3. Ceremonies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
practises</hi> not mentioned expresly in
Scripture. 4. <hi>Doctrines and customes shining
in the practise of the Church,</hi> and likewise more
or losse clearly express'd in Scripture.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>First for speculative doctrines,</hi> which
could hardly be express'd in the practise of the
Church, the <hi>Tradition</hi> of them seems to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
difficult, and the certainty not so demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable.
As for example, there are in the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Heresies made by S. Epiphanius, S Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
and <hi>Philastrius,</hi> certain <hi>opinions</hi> called
<hi>Heresies</hi> in a large <hi>notion,</hi> which seem not to
have been in themselves of any dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
but yet have been condemned by
Popes, &amp;c. and ever since by a tacit consent of
the Universall Church avoided; as the <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:46209:116"/>
of the <hi>Millenaries, Melchisedechians,</hi> &amp;c.
Now whether these Heresies were condemned
as <hi>contrary to a Tradition,</hi> or only by a <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of discretion,</hi> by shewing, that the grounds
pretended for such <hi>opinions</hi> out of <hi>Scripture</hi>
are not concluding, but rather the contrary,
(as the second Councell of Orange seems to
condemn some doctrines of the <hi>Semipelagians</hi>)
is not very certain. However they rest condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and more probably the former way, as
contrary to <hi>Tradition;</hi> which may rather be
believed of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> because they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for their doctrine a <hi>Tradition</hi> derived
from <hi>Papias</hi> a scholler of the Apostles, and it
was very far spread in the church, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by great Saints and Doctors, as S <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naus,</hi>
S. <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> &amp;c. It might very
possible be, that the <hi>Traditionary doctrines</hi>
contrary to these Heresies (however specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and which could not be conveighed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
outward practise of the church) might have
continued in mens memories to the times,
when these <hi>opinions</hi> were confuted; For no
doubt can be made, but that the Apostolique
churches, together with the books of Scripture,
received the true sense and <hi>interpretation</hi> of
the most difficult passages, which might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
by a successive <hi>instruction,</hi> but of which,
by reason they were no necessary doctrines of
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> many are lost, as I exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
in the former conclusion. So that the
certainty of such <hi>Traditionary speculative do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
is very hardly demonstrable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
many learned Catholiques conceive, that
severall lately controverted <hi>opinions</hi> in the

and Freewill,</hi>

as an <hi>article de fide,</hi> that is, as a <hi>divine

Since it is generally confess'd, that they want
such a <hi>Tradition.</hi> See above in this <hi>Section:</hi>
1 <hi>Cha.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>3. As <hi>concerning books of Scripture,</hi> the
<hi>Tradition</hi> of them may appear certaine in a
high degree, at least for the substance of the
books: For though at first they were written
for the use and necessity of <hi>particular Churches
and persons,</hi> and no <hi>Obligation</hi> appears ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
to have been imposed to disperse them
through the whole Church: Notwithstanding
the infinite reverence, which all <hi>Christians</hi>
bore to the Apostles, made every church desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to possesse themselves of whatsoever <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
proceeded from them: Yet this not out
of any extreme necessity, for from their first
foundation all churches were instructed in all
points and doctrines of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the same <hi>orders of government, publique
worship, &amp;c.</hi> and this after an uniform man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as appeared to me evident, not only from
the <hi>antient Liturgies,</hi> but severall testimonies
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46209:117"/>
out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
&amp;c. But there was required a long time e're
such writings could be universally spread, yea
several ages were passed, before they were all of
them received, even at <hi>Rome</hi> it self, as appears out
of S. <hi>Hierome.</hi> For before they were admitted
into the Canon, we may be sure that great cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and exact information was used. So that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this they having been now many ages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the whole church for divine
writings, we may have a greater assurance of
them, then of the books of <hi>Aristotle, Cicero,</hi> &amp;c.
which, by reason men were not much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whether they were legitimate or supposititious,
have not been examined with so much advice
and caution; and yet that man that should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to a doubt of them, would be suspected of
all men to be tainted in his understanding. But
this <hi>high degree of certitude</hi> we have only of the
<hi>divine books</hi> considered <hi>in gross,</hi> not of the true
reading of <hi>particular Texts,</hi> as appears by the
infinite variety of readings in <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> yet
even in this respect also we may assure our selves
that there is no corruption very considerable, or
of very dangerous consequence, by considering
not only Gods providence and promises to his
church, but likewise by comparing the originall
Texts with such a world of <hi>Translations, Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake,
Arabick, AEthiopian, Latin,</hi> &amp;c. many of
which were made in the very infancy of the
church, long before the <hi>Archetype</hi> or Original
copies were lost, some of which <hi>Tertullian</hi>
sayes, remained in his dayes.</p>
               <p>4. In the third place, reason told me that
such <hi>ceremonies,</hi> as were universally practised
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46209:118"/>
through the whole church from the first times,
though not mentioned in Scripture, might ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
themselves to be derived from the Apostles
with a greater certainty, then even the books of
Scripture themselves; according to that saying
of S. <hi>Augustine, (Ep. 118.) Those things
which we observe, and are not written, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
and are practised all the world over,
are to be understood to have been commanded
and appointed either by the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or by Generall Councells, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whereof is most healthfull in the Church.</hi>
Which <hi>Tertullian</hi> before him thus expressed,
(<hi>de Praesor.) This custome certainly proceeded
from Apostolique Tradition; for how could
that come into (generall) practise, which
was not delivered by Tradition?</hi> Now of such
kind of rites many examples are extant in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Liturgies, and many more mentioned, as
universally received by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
&amp;c. who wrote before there had been in the
church, any plenary Councell, and therefore,
by S. <hi>Augustines</hi> rule, argue such rites to have
come from the Apostles. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not <hi>imagineable</hi> how it could be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that such rites should be received by all
churches through the world, and that so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the Apostles times, and in such a
season, when there had never been any generall
meeting of Bishops, yea when by reason of the
horriblenesse of the persecutions it was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
difficult for the Bishops of one Province to
meet together to settle particular necessary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
(in none of which Synods notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is the least mention made of ordaining such
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46209:118"/>
ceremonies) if together with <hi>Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
they had not been introduced by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
Let now any reasonable man judge if the
books of Scripture, which he acknowledges on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the ground of generall <hi>Tradition,</hi>
however certainly and unquestionably <hi>divine,</hi>
yet do not want some of these arguments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
and enjoy some of the rest in an
inferiour degree.</p>
               <p>5. But fourthly, <hi>Doctrines or customes shining
in the generall practise of the Church, and
withall more or Lesse clearly expressed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
(that is, indeed the whole substance and
and frame of Christian Religion, as was shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, and therein many points now in
controversie between Catholiques and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
&amp;c. and above all other, this point of
the Churches authority) may prove themselves
certain in a degree beyond all these, and with
as much assurance, as Tradition is capable of,
I am confidently perswaded, beyond the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree that I mentioned for <hi>secular Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in the example of <hi>King William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
of England.</hi> For first, all the persons
living in the time of <hi>Luthers Apostacy</hi> in all
Provinces, not of one Kingdome, but of the
whole Catholique Church, agreed in testifying
that their ancestours had delivered such things
to them, as of <hi>Tradition Apostolicall,</hi> and by
consequence, since the contrary cannot be made
apparent, we are to judge the same of all prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ages ascending upwards, till the first times,
not one Catholique expressely dissenting, and
much lesse any one age: So that unlesse in some
one age of the church all Catholiques should
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46209:119"/>
should have conspired to tell a lye to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and not only so, but should have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have seduced them, not one appearing
that would have the honesty to discover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
I could not conceive it possible, that a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of such a nature could be false. Add to
the confirmation of the same doctrines the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of Histories and Records, yea even
of enemies for many doctrines and practises:
Moreover the laws continually in force through
the Catholike Church, lastly the <hi>publike forms
of Devotions, Feasts, times of mortifications,
&amp;c.</hi> All these arguments of certainty conspire
in a far more eminent manner to prove these
kind of doctrines and rites, then in the example
of <hi>William the Conquerour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. But beyond all these something may, be
added, to which that secular example doth in no
visible distance approach: For, <hi>did William</hi> the
<hi>Conqueror</hi> ever appoint any persons about him
to write all the considerable particulars of his
story, supplying them with all things for the
enabling them to that purpose? Did he work
miracles himself for the confirming his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and give power to his servants and their
successors for severall ages to do the like? Did
he appoint a succession of Teachers to the
worlds end sufficiently instructed, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to keep warily the <hi>depositum</hi> of that
Religion, both from mixture and perishing, and
so to deliver it to their successors, and this upon
great penalties of disobeying? Did he, besides
solemn dayes for severall uses, institute out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
rites and practises to be by all men in all
times and places solemnly either seen or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46209:119"/>
and these with prescribed formes, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
and actions, on purpose that the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
passages of his acts or sufferings should
continually be celebrated in the world, leaving
an impossibility of their being forgotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a deluge? Nay lastly, to secu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e all men
from the least apprehension, did he ingage an
omnipotent power to perform a promise that
those orders, ceremonies, and laws should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to the worlds end in despight of the gates
of hell it self? Not any of these things have
been done by <hi>Will. the Conquerour,</hi> (or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but our Lord) to propagate his memory;
and yet, notwithstanding all these defects, we
are most assured of the Tradition, that such a
person there was, that he conquered England,
brought in new lawes, customes, &amp;c. What
shall we then say of the testimony of the present
church for the substance of Christian Religion,
even while we consider the church only as a
bare witnesse or proponent of such things to us?
Is any confirmation stronger then all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to beget an assurance in us? Yea is it
possible that more secure order could have
been taken, then that which the Son of God
ha's used to make that which was past now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
sixteen ages to remain alwayes, as it were
visible before our eyes?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The reason of considering this double ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Certainty of belief, compared with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of knowledge.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THe reason why I enquired into the
proofs of the <hi>certainty of universall
Tradition</hi> proposed by the Church, <hi>considered
antecedently to her authority,</hi> was, because I
found it necessary, as to my self, for a distinct
understanding the <hi>Resolution of Catholique
Faith,</hi> that grounds of certainty of <hi>Tradition</hi>
should first be laid, before the authority of the
church interpose to oblige us to believe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
doctrine for the prime authors sake final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which is <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Since then <hi>Tradition</hi> in generall is in it
self credible, and some <hi>Traditions certaine,</hi>
and above all others that ever were; or, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
can possibly be, the Tradition of the
church, especially in necessary doctrines of
Faith universally believed, and all rites univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
practised, and among them this particular
<hi>Tradition of an obliging authority in the
Church,</hi> is the most certain; we may conclude
that the beliefe and assent thereto approaches
the neerest to <hi>knowledge of sense,</hi> that beliefe
possibly can do. But it is impossible, <hi>ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speaking,</hi> that it should arrive to all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of assurance that sense <hi>cum debitis cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiis</hi>
may have; by which means it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46209:120"/>
                  <hi>meritorious,</hi> that is, capable of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which, I conceive, <hi>experimentall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
knowledge</hi> is not: And hereupon it was
that our Saviour told S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who would
not give credit to any reports concerning his
<hi>Resurrection,</hi> till his eyes saw him, and hands
felt him, <hi>Thomas, because thou hast seen me
thou hast believed, blessed are those who have
not seen, and yet have believed. (John 20. 29.)</hi>
But it may be objected, if <hi>manifest vision</hi> take
away <hi>meritoriousnesse</hi> by reason of such an
apparent certitude, as inforces the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to assent; why should <hi>Faith,</hi> which is, or
may be built upon grounds demonstrably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
though indeed not in the utmost degree of
experimentall knowledge, have blessednesse an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to it? I answer, the reason seems to be,
1: Because before a man arrive to an assurance
in <hi>Faith,</hi> there is required a great exercise of
his understanding to search all the arguments
conducing to a firm grounding of his belief,
which cannot be done, unlesse there be in those
persons inquiring some degree of love to the
things inquired after, which travell proceeding
from love, is a thing proper to be rewarded.
2. Add to this, that such persons after such a
love, and inquiry proceeding from that love,
will be forced to submit and <hi>captivate their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
to the belief of many <hi>mysteries</hi>
infinitely beyond the naturall capacity of their
comprehensions, a thing extremely acceptable
to God.</p>
               <p>3. And this is the state requisite in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
endued with abilities and learning in the
Church, especially the <hi>teachers</hi> and <hi>governors;</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:46209:121"/>
And however it is most necessary in generall
for the setling of a Church, that there should be
means of assurance of <hi>Tradition</hi> praerequired to
supernaturall Faith, because <hi>discoursing</hi> men,
especially if they be propossessed with prejudice,
or a <hi>contrary belief,</hi> would hardly or never be
brought without it to captivate their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
in such a manner. But as for silly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>Christians,</hi> to whom <hi>God is pleased to give
a certainty of adherence beyond a certainty of
evidence</hi> (as M. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> sayes) and who
seem rather to <hi>believe with their wills,</hi> then
<hi>their understandings,</hi> an immediate and simple
captivating of their minds to <hi>Christian Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
without searching arguments of <hi>assurance,</hi>
may be conceived acceptable to God, <hi>supposing</hi>
notwithstanding that they live in a <hi>Church,</hi>
where it may be made appear, that what
they believe is not a lye, nor a <hi>doubtfull
truth,</hi> but on the contrary <hi>certain and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
To which purpose S. <hi>Augustine (cont. Ep.

people, it is not the sharpness of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
but the simplicity of believing that
makes them secure.</hi> And again, <hi>If Christ be
dead only for those who are inabled by a certain
comprehension to discern these things, we do
labour in the Church almost to no purpose.</hi> And
therefore the <hi>Calvinist Ministers &amp;c.</hi> (who
profess an undervaluing of <hi>Tradition</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of <hi>pretended inward revelations and
assurances from God's Spirit,</hi> and who teach

may do well to consider <hi>what</hi> will becom

when they shall begin to doubt that such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
are either apparently false, or at least
impossible to be proved, or however no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at all to perswade a third person.</p>
               <p>4. Lastly it is observeable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that such <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
as we now speak of, are alwayes capable

so, the neerer they come to their foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aine or
times, whence they take their originall. And
therefore, for example; though at the beginning
the whole Nation of the Jews were eye-witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the stupendious manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of delivering the
law in the wildernesse, yet their successors (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after that generation was dead) fell
into Idolatry and infidelity; the reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was, not because they wanted means, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
themselves of the divine authority of their
law, and the curses attending the breach of it;
but because of this there was requisite some
meditation and exercise of their understanding
and besides, those curses were future, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
present temptations of fleshly and secular
lusts presently enjoyed by them, had so much
power over them as to keep them in negligence
or busying their understandings, and in a

                  </gap>ion that those curses which were fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
might perhaps never happen, or not upon

                  </gap>epen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
some time or other might be prevented.
In like manner, and upon the same grounds
the Christians of the first times were more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
more unmoved in their faith, more zealous
for the glory of God then in following a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
because the grounds of assurance and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46209:122"/>
other motives did more immediately, and so
more strongly, make an impression upon their
minds. Notwithstanding the faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse

               </argument>
               <p>1. HAving shewed the certainty of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ha's to prove the certainty of her Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those doctrines which concern the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Christian Religion: In the next
place I proceeded to make some neerer approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to the consideration of the Authority,
which she challenges to her self, and whereby
she obliges all in her Communion to believe
receive, and embrace whatsoever she thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth,
that is, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cknowledge the Verity and
divine originall of all those Christian revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
deposited in her hands, and severall wayes
both by orall instruction, practise, or writing
delivered by her to all Christians, to be by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46209:122"/>
them believed, practised and obeyed. The
Church, as a simple proponent, only tells us,
that such doctrines, books, and rites were anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
delivered as divine, and attested by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
miracles, believed most assuredly to be
such by all Christians: And in respect of this
way of proposing, even her enemies may joyn
with her to confirm this Tradition; proofes
thereof we find in Jewish and Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:
The Jewes all confesse that the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(by Christ and his Apostles preached in the
world) was (at least pretended) to be of divine
authority; That strange wonders, (pretended
likewise to be wrought by a divine omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence)
gave testimony hereto. But yet neither
Jews nor Heathens assent to what Christians
infer from hence, namely, that these were
indeed divine miracles, and by consequence
the Doctrine confirmed by them, divine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</p>
               <p>2. This being so, the Church (before she can
interpose and make use of her authority to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
any to submit to the particular doctrines
and practises by her proposed, and by her like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
where need is, explained and interpreted)
must give a firm unquestionable assurance
of these two things. 1. That the Religion in
grosse (which Tradition on all hands agrees to
have been delivered) is divine, and hath been
more then sufficiently proved to be so. 2. That
one of the speciall doctrines of this Religion,
is her authority so far extended. I say this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
must be firm, and unquestionable in
both these points; for if it be only probable,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46209:123"/>
though in never so high a degree, I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to comprehend how that which is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a ground, could be absolutely firm and
unquestionable.</p>
               <p>3. To demonstrate therefore the former
point; viz. concerning our assurance of the
divine originall of Christian Religion, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this for a ground, <hi>That from sufficient
principles, reason can conclude certainly and
necessarily:</hi> which not being to be denyed by
rrason, I adde that the principles to be laid by
reason as a ground of this our assurance are,
1. The consideration of what a nature those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were, (which that they have been
wrought we have from Tradit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on not only
assurance, but the highest degree of assurance
that Tradition can almost afford.) 2 Of what
a nature <hi>Christian Religion</hi> (delivered by an
equally assured Tradition) is, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
whereof such miracles were wrought.
These two principles, as they give mutual ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
each to other, and both of them together do
necessarily conclude all that we desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
so they ought not easily be disjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For first, some of the same effects, which in
Christianity we call true miracles, no doubt,
have been wrought in places where a false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath been professed. And on the other
side every Religion wherein there is no impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not necessary to be esteemed of divine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall.
But when can it be demonstrated that
true miracles have been wrought for the assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Religion; and that that Religion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
supernaturall doctrines of holynesse, piety,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46209:123"/>
justice, &amp;c. then nothing can in reason be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against it.</p>
               <p>4. In the present case therefore; 1. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miracles wrought by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
&amp;c. (to the end that I may only point at
these things, since it is not my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to speake of this argument, but only as
a preparation to my information concerning
the churches authority and Resolution of
Faith) we may consider as in this number of
miracles, 1. Propeecies in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
brought to us by most assured Tradition,
wherein we find expressely foretold, that the
<hi>Messiah should come before the Scepter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from Judah,</hi> that is, before the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Commonwealth of the Jews was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that he should teach a new Covenant to be
<hi>written not in Tables of Stone,</hi> but <hi>in the
hearts of Gods people;</hi> that he should confirm
this Covenant by the same Miracles which our
Saviour actually wrought; that the Gentiles,
(after the death and glorification of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah)
should be received into this Covenant, and
the Jews for their infidelity rejected, &amp;c. 2. Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
miracles apparently wrought by
Christ and his Apostles; to which, because they
were but a few persons, end therefore, lest the
narrownesse of the scene should prejudice their
authority, we may ad a continuance of the like
miracles performed by the successors of the
Apostles in all the parts of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and by a world of persons, learned and
unlearned; men and women, &amp;c. None of
which could have been performed by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46209:124"/>
naturall agent known of us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either by God himself immediately, or
by good supernaturall spirits at least.</p>
               <p>5. In the second place for the doctrines and
precepts of Christianity, the former are indeed
many of them above the reach of naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but not directly against it, conducing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much to the glory of the divine incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
Majesty; and the latter directing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in the most perfect manner imagineable
to glorifie God, to renounce, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
wicked Spirits, teaching men to performe
all duties of justice and charity to all manner
of persons respectively, to preserve peace and
tranquility in the world, and lastly to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
every single person in sobriety, chastity,
&amp;c. after a manner more then humane; so that
if man be capable of being elevated to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beyond nature, this is the onely Religion
worthy to bring him to it.</p>
               <p>6. From these principles, reason may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
most assuredly. 1. That such miracles
were certainly wrought, many of them, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by an omnipotent power; and the rest
at least by good Angells, as Gods Ministers;
since it is impossible that wicked Spirits should
be willing to strain themselves so far on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to teach mankind to love and glorifie
God so hated by them, to encourage them in
the learning and practise of vertue and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and, in a word, to induce them to hate,
renounce, and destroy the Kingdome of <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi>
the <hi>Prince of Divells. 2. That such a
Religion,</hi> which most assuredly ha's been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46209:124"/>
by such miracles, is most true. 3. That by
consequence, since this Religion expressely
sayes so, it is most necessarily to be embraced,
being proposed by such a witnesse and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
as God in that Religion ha's declared
to have received commission from him, and
authority for that purpose. And this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
is (as after the spending of many thoughts
and much time, before I could free my selfe
from many prejudices and misinformations
caused by education, &amp;c. by the goodnesse and
mercy of God I came at last evidently to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be) the <hi>present Catholike Church.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance, <hi>That the Church alone was that
divinely authorised proponent, from whom I
was to receive divine Revelations, and these
in the sense that she received and proposeth
them;</hi> as likewise the method and manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which, as distinctly as I could, I
first gave an account to mine own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and now to others, were as follows.</p>
               <p>2. It having been before declared, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
testified by all kinds of antient Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
writers, 1. <hi>That the doctrines and
formes of practise of Christian Religion were
by the Apostles with great care and assiduous
inculeations firmly setled in all Churches by
them founded and established:</hi> To which form
other Churches, by their successors converted,
generally conformed themselves, as <hi>Tertullian
(de Prescrip.</hi>) saith, <hi>The Apostles founded
Churches in every City, from which</hi> (Churches)
<hi>other Churches afterward did borrow the
Faith delivered, and the seeds of doctrine.</hi>
2. <hi>That Religion</hi> was thus setled chiefly, and
indeed only by Tradition, the books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
having been written only occasionally,
and though they comprehend in generall the
principall points of Christianity, yet it is very
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46209:125"/>
briefly, obscurely, with seeming contradictions,
and dispersedly; whereupon it is that they do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
refer us to the profession and practise of the
church. Hence in evidence of reason it will
follow, that he that would inform himself of
Christian Religion, must have recourse thither
where it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a's been d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>posited, and that not simply
in words, but withall the sense of those words,
and the very life of them in practise; and this
depositary is by all acknowledged more or less,
to be the Catholike church: For even those, who
make it a part of their Religion to oppose the
authority of the Catholike church, yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that they have received the Scripture (that
is, all the Religion which they have) from her
and her authority.</p>
               <p>3. Hence it will follow, that that man that
should either look for Christian religion where
it is not, or expect to find it entire where there
was no intention to include it in its whole lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
or hope to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssure himself of the clear
sense of it, where it is set down often obscurely,
almost every where obnoxious to variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations,
would certainly not follow the
conduct of his reason.</p>
               <p>4. Notwithstanding, if the imputation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
were the only effect of such an
indiscreet way of information, there is no proud
man (and pride, or impatience to submit to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<hi>is the root of all heresie and Schism</hi>) but
would easily perswade himself to despise such an
imputation; yea he would take a pleasure in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
himself and his own reason single, not
only to one, but many ages of men, that should
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46209:126"/>
it more reasonable to relye upon authority for
that, which cannot be believed, but upon the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
motive of authority. There is therefore ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
effect far more considerable, then point of
reputation, which is the utmost danger of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
perdition in renouncing <hi>one main do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall
foundation of Christian Faith, which
is the authority of the one, holy, Catholique
Church of Christ:</hi> which authority consists
not only in delivering books of Scripture, or
Traditionary doctrines, but in obliging all men
to unity, both in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith and love, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be had, except all men be obliged to
the sense and interpretation which she propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
as received from her by the same autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from which she received the books or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
themselves.</p>
               <p>5. A doctrine this is the most expresse in
Scriptures, the most constantly asserted by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the only businesse of all Councells, the
most freely without any contradiction embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by all Christians before these times, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
only those, whom even the Sectaries of
these times will call Heretiques or Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes)
and in these times by all that enjoy the
name of <hi>Catholikes.</hi> In a word, a doctrine this
is beyond all other traditionary doctrines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
from the Apostles to these times, with
the fullest universall consent of all Catholikes
in all places, and of all times, of any one point
in Christian Religion, or any one book of Scripture.</p>
               <p>6. Among proofs out of Scripture, we will
begin with the Old Testament (concerning
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46209:126"/>
which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> (in <hi>Psal. 3. ch.</hi> 2.) professeth
that the Prophets foretold more often, &amp; more
plainly of the Catholike Church then of Christ
himself, and the reason, he sayes, was because
many Heretiques would arise that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
spare the person of Christ, but none could
be a heretike without withdrawing himselfe
from the authority and unity of the Church.
Now the particular Texts which especially
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> makes use of to assert the churches
Authority are these, <hi>In the last days the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Lord shall be on the top of all
mountains, and all hills shall flow unto her.</hi>
And <hi>she shall judge every tongue that resists
her in judgement.</hi> And, <hi>Kings shall walk in
the light of the Church, and people in the
splendour of her East.</hi> Again, <hi>That every
Kingdome and Nation which doth not serve
her shall perish. (Isa. c. 2. 54. and 60.)</hi> That
of the Kingly Prophet <hi>David, Glorious things
are spoken of thee, thou City of God.</hi> That of
the Canticles, <hi>Thou art faire, and there is no
spot in thee.</hi> And that of the Prophet <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
Thou shalt no more be called forsaken, Psa.</hi>
86. <hi>Cant. 4. Ezech. 37.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. <hi>Proofs out of the New Testament are,</hi>
Behold I am with you alwayes unto the end of
the world, Mat. <hi>8. upon which S.</hi> Augustine
in Psa. 70. &amp; 10. <hi>thus infers,</hi> The Church shall
be here unto the end of the world. For if it
shall not be here unto the end of the world, to
whom was it that our Lord said, Behold I am
with you alwayes unto the end of the world?
And what was the reason that it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46209:127"/>
that there should be such speeches in the
Scripture? Because there would in times to
come arise enemies of the Christian Faith,
which would say, Christians will continue for
a certain space, after that they will vanish,
and Idoll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was before.) <hi>Again</hi> Mat. 6. Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi>
and upon this rock will I build my Church, and
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it;
<hi>And again,</hi> Joh. 14. The Spirit of truth shall
remain with you for ever. <hi>And again,</hi> Let both
grow together unto the harvest. <hi>And againe,</hi>
Mat. 18. If any man will not hear the Church,
let him be to thee as a Heathen and a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.
(<hi>Upon which S.</hi> Augustine (lib. 5. de
Bapt.) <hi>thus descants,</hi> the which house likewise
hath received the keyes, and a power of loosing
and binding. Whosoever shall contemne this
house, reproving and correcting him, let him,
saith he, be unto thee as a Heathen and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.)

                  <p>The validity of such Texts, &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. UPon these and other such Texts of
Scripture, joyn'd with Tradition and
uninterrupted practise, the <hi>antient Church</hi>
grounded upon her authority, the <hi>antient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells</hi>
their power of <hi>anathematizing</hi> all gain-sayers,
and the <hi>antient Fathers</hi> all their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and discourses against all sorts of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques;
<hi>arguing thus, That</hi> if the promises of
Christ were true, <hi>that his Church</hi> should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
for ever, and so continue, as that <hi>she</hi> should
<hi>alwaies be preserved in all truth,</hi> so that the
gates of hell should never prevail against her;
<hi>then</hi> whatsoever <hi>Heretiques</hi> opposed, or Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques
separated themselves from the present
Church, either gave Christ the lye, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
themselves to be a Congregation exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from these promises; <hi>concluding</hi> that no
pretence could be sufficient to warrant any man
at any time to separate from the Church, to
which such promises have been made. Hence
that great <hi>Alexander Bishop of Alexandria,</hi>
(Theod. Hist. Eccl. l. 1. c. 4.) <hi>We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
one onely Church Catholique and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique,
which, as she can never be rooted out,
although the whole world should attempt to
fight against her, so she surmounts and dissipates
all the impious assaults of Heretiques.</hi> Hence
likewise S. <hi>Athanasius, The Church is invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
although hell it selfe should oppose her.</hi>
Hence lastly <hi>Theophilus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> God at all times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46209:128"/>
the same grace unto his Church, namely
that the body should be preserved entire, and
that the poysons of hereticall doctrines should
have no power over her.</hi> V. S. <hi>Hierom.</hi> Ep. 67.</p>
               <p>2. Now if these <hi>promises of Christ</hi> be not
both <hi>infallible,</hi> and likewise <hi>absolute:</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the Church, to which such promises belong
be not only <hi>visible,</hi> but by the weakest under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
discernable from all other <hi>factions</hi>
and Congregations: and lastly, unlesse upon
the same grounds that <hi>all the Fathers</hi> took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from such promises to condemn all
<hi>Schismes and Heresies</hi> against the <hi>Catholique
Church of their times,</hi> all <hi>succeeding Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
might with as much reason and justice
from the same promises conclude as efficatiously
against all following Heresies and Schismes;
whatsoever hath been said by all these Fathers,
especially the writings of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> against
the <hi>Donatists,</hi> will prove to be the most foolish,
impertinent, jugling discourses that ever were;
yea that were too mild a censure; I should say,
the most blasphemous and pernicious to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:
For by ascribing <hi>to the present Church</hi>
respectively such <hi>sanctity, authority,</hi> and <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibility,</hi>
if such titles could not be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> all possible
means of taking away scandalls and errours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians would be utterly lost; it would
be unlawfull for any men to preach truth and
piety, or reform vice: in a word, that fearfull
comminatory <hi>curse</hi> in the Revelation would be
converted into an <hi>Evangelicall precept, Qui
nocet, noceat adhuc, &amp; qui in sordibus est,
sordescat adhuc. Let him that doth mischiefe,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46209:128"/>
proceed to do more mischiefe still, and let hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
that is filthy, be filthy stil,</hi> (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.) I might
ad, <hi>Et qui incredulus est incredulus maneat. Let
him that is a disbeliever, take care that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a disbeliever still,</hi> for whosoever reforms
these things are <hi>Heretiques</hi> and <hi>Schismatiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But such promises are too expresse in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
the <hi>Tradition</hi> of them too constant and
universall, the <hi>Fathers</hi> too good Christians to
leave any suspition in mens minds, that they
should either lightly, imprudently, or wickedly
make use of arguments to destroy <hi>heresies,</hi>
which in future times would be as proper, yea
far more efficacious to destroy <hi>truth.</hi> Therefore
<hi>if all antiquity</hi> conspired to argue <hi>thus; Christ</hi>
has expressely promised and foretold that his
<hi>Church</hi> shall be <hi>as a City set upon the top of a
hill:</hi> and that <hi>he</hi> by his Spirit will <hi>be with this
his Church to the end of the world,</hi> in which
Church notwithstanding there shall be a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> till the day of Judgement,
but however the <hi>Church</hi> it self is <hi>without spot
or wrinckle:</hi> Therefore it is a blasphemy in
<hi>you Manicheans, Donatists, Pelagians,</hi> &amp;c.
to say the Church of Christ was perished or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
or a harlot, till <hi>you</hi> revived, reformed
and purified it: I say, if the Fathers had reason
from such promises to argue thus in the second,
third, and fourth <hi>Centuries, their Successours</hi>
had as good reason to make the same deductions
from the same principles in the fifth and sixth
ages, and so downward till these very times.
For, as <hi>Christ is the same yesterday, and to day,
and for ever,</hi> so likewise are his <hi>promises,</hi> and
by consequence so likewise is his <hi>Church,</hi> since
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46209:129"/>
                  <hi>he</hi> ha's engaged his omnipotence to make good
such his promises to his Church untill the
worlds end.</p>
               <p>4. If not, <hi>Let those</hi> that forbid such a method
of arguing, name how long a time, and how
far those <hi>promises</hi> are to be extended: Let them
name the Climactericall year when the effect
of them is to cease, or what constellation ha's
over-ruled the operation of Gods holy Spirit.
To conclude, let them give some reason why
the <hi>Donatists,</hi> (who though in all points of
Christian Doctrine agreed with the Catholique
Church, yet because, for I know not what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>misdemeanour</hi> of <hi>one Bishop,</hi> they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from his <hi>Communion,</hi> and afterward from
all those that communicated with <hi>him,</hi> that is,
the <hi>whole Church,</hi>) are therefore so highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the <hi>Fathers</hi> for this their Schisme,
that they professed the same heaven could not
hold them both, yea that <hi>Martyrdome</hi> it selfe
could not blot out that crime: What priviledge
can all those <hi>Sects of this age</hi> alledge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that the same arguments and judgements
of the <hi>Fathers</hi> should not be applied to <hi>them,
who,</hi> to their Schisme from charity, have added
a division from, and contradiction to not only
the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> but all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
praeexistent in so many points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and faith of so high importance?</p>
               <p>5. I confesse I could not imagine what could
be opposed to this; and therefore I could not
but conclude that the <hi>antient Fathers Logick</hi>
was concluding; yea that such unanswerable
<hi>arguments</hi> of theirs, were powerfull <hi>means</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
by <hi>Christ</hi> for the accomplishing of his
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46209:129"/>
good promises to his Church, inasmuch as by
them the <hi>gates of Hell,</hi> that is (as severall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
expound) <hi>Heresies</hi> have been so far from
prevailing against the Church, that <hi>they</hi> are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vanished, and the <hi>Church</hi> built upon that
<hi>Rock</hi> which gave <hi>Peter</hi> that his new name,
continues firm and unmoveable, and no doubt
will do so to the end of the world, whatsoever
engines of cunning, malice, or rebellion, the
<hi>Calvinists</hi> and other bloudy Sects do raise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>it,</hi> to batter it with greater violence then
ever before.</p>
               <p>6. I am the more confirmed in joyning thus
with the Fathers, because I perceive that they,
yea that one single <hi>Father of the first magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
( S. <hi>Augustine)</hi> ha's already answered all
the most considerable arguments which the
<hi>Protestants</hi> of these times are ready to borrow
of <hi>their Fathers the Donatists, &amp;c.</hi> to destroy
the authority of the Church: <hi>He</hi> ha's already
cleared the objection from the example of the
<hi>Jewish Church</hi> reduced to such an almost invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <argument>
                  <p>The Objection from the overflowing of
Arianisme in the Church, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> objection, That
Christs promises are conditionall, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THis last objection <hi>concerning Arianisme,
because even</hi> the-now-English-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<hi>think they have great advantage from it,
I am not in so much hast to draw towards an
end of this conclusion, but I can be content to
set down S.</hi> Augustin's <hi>answer to it, with a short
Appendix. It seems the</hi> Donatists <hi>took the
advantage from some hyperbolicall language of
S.</hi> Hilary <hi>concerning the great deluge of</hi> Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme
<hi>upon the Church, to enervate the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of</hi> Christ, <hi>concerning the extension and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of</hi> it. <hi>To this S.</hi> Augustine, Ep. <hi>48. thus
answers,</hi> That time, concerning which Hilary
wrote, was such, that thou hast thought that
thou mightst privily assault such a number of
divine testimonies, as if the Church were peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
out of the world, <hi>&amp;c. Hilary</hi> therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blames only the tares, which were in the
ten Asian Provinces, and not the wheat: or
he thought fit therefore the more profitably, by
how much the more vehemently, to blame the
wheat, which by some default was in danger.
For even the Canonicall Scriptures have this
custom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in reprehensions, that the word seems
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46209:130"/>
to be addressed to all, when it reaches home only
to some few.</p>
               <p>2. For confirmation of this answer of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
it may be observed, 1. <hi>That</hi> the violent
brunt of that <hi>Persecution</hi> of the <hi>Catholiques</hi> by
the <hi>Arrians</hi> lasted scarce <hi>four years,</hi> namely
from the <hi>Councell of Ariminum</hi> to the death of
the <hi>Emperour Constantius.</hi> 2. That during that
time the <hi>Western Churches</hi> felt little change by
that <hi>Persecution.</hi> 3. That those who subscribed
the cunningly contrived <hi>Creed</hi> at <hi>Ariminum</hi>
did not intend to prejudice thereby the faith
of the <hi>Councell of Nice,</hi> since the <hi>new Creed</hi>
was capable of a Catholique sense. 4. That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the <hi>East</hi> very many glorious Catholique
Bishops survived the fury of the Arrians 5. That
the succession of Catholique Bishops was so far
from being interrupted thereby, that S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
who lived neer those times, professeth that in
his daies there was not one Bishop in the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church</hi> that was not a legitimate successor
of those <hi>glorious Prelates</hi> of the <hi>Councell of
Nice.</hi> From all which considerations we may
rationally collect, that <hi>our</hi> Lord in this example
gave a warning to the <hi>Rulers of his Church</hi> to
be vigilant to prevent the like dangerous <hi>Heresies</hi>
for the future; but withall to be confident in his
<hi>promises,</hi> since <hi>he</hi> had been so carefull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them, that when <hi>Heresie</hi> had all imagine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
advantages, yet <hi>he</hi> provided so for his
Church, by putting an end to those tentations,
that the succession of lawfull Bishops was not at
all interrupted by them.</p>
               <p>3. Beside these, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
an engine (his friends know from what
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46209:131"/>
                  <hi>forge</hi>) to invalidate, as he believed, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of advantage, which <hi>Catholiques</hi> reap
from the <hi>promises of Christ,</hi> concerning a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
succession of his Church, by saying,
<hi>that those promises are onely conditionall,</hi> viz.
If Christians would make use of, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
those meanes that Christ had left for
the propagation of his Church; otherwise
not.</p>
               <p>4. But hereto the <hi>answer</hi> is very ready,
For 1. All that is alledged is spoken meerly
<hi>gratis,</hi> there being no warrant from any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
in those <hi>Texts,</hi> wherein such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are contained, for such an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore when <hi>plain Texts</hi> are,
and have been interpreted in a <hi>sense absolute</hi>
by all Catholiques of all times, a new unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
interpretation will certainly find no
entertainment with any, unlesse it be <hi>such as
make antiquity a prejudice to truth. 2. M. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>
applies this interpretation to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
times onely, not to passed or present;
so that thereby it shakes onely <hi>our hope</hi> for
succeeding times, not <hi>our faith</hi> for the passed
or present; and therefore it is not availeable
in the dispute in hand, concerning the <hi>Roman
Catholique Church,</hi> which all <hi>English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
acknowledge to be a <hi>true Church of
Christ,</hi> defective in no necessary truths, all the
fault being <hi>her superabundance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And for this reason it was that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was blamed, and I <hi>my selfe</hi> have often
taxed <hi>him</hi> for serving himself of so scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and as we thought, so uselesse an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.
But upon more serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46209:131"/>
I judged not <hi>him</hi> unreasonable for
it, but my <hi>selfe,</hi> and others not quick-sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
enough to perceive the necessity <hi>he</hi> had
(though he never discovered himselfe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to any man, as far as I know) to make
use of so desperate a <hi>glosse:</hi> For doubtless he
saw clearly, that if there were such <hi>absolute
Promises</hi> of <hi>indefectibility</hi> and <hi>divine assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
to the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> none could
with any justice challenge them, but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> since <hi>she</hi> only appropriates them
to her present Communion, <hi>all</hi> others lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down their <hi>claim.</hi> The speciall allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which <hi>she</hi> may produce, to prove her self
in a speciall manner interessed in these promises
I shall take notice of in the last conclusion.
Lastly S. <hi>Augustine</hi> will afford us a satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
answer, who, to the like objection of the
<hi>Donatists</hi> (viz. <hi>Men would not persevere, and
therefore Christian Religion hath failed out
of all Nations, except only the party of</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus:)
Answers him, <hi>As if the Holy Ghost
was ignorant what would be the future
wills of men, which yet foreseeing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
foretold that the Church of Christ
should endure for ever. De unit. Eccl. c. 12.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The generall ground of the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<hi>viz.</hi> Christs promises.</p>
                  <p>The severall subjects and acts thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. TO return therefore to the <hi>authority of
the present Catholique Church,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of which <hi>she</hi> obligeth all men in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
not only to receive the Scriptures
from <hi>her, as a depositary</hi> of them, but the true
interpretation likewise of them preserved by
her, together with all other Traditions, as
much as concerns the substance of Christian
Religion: This authority seems to be grounded
especially upon the promise of <hi>indefectibility:</hi>
an <hi>indefectibility,</hi> I mean, of <hi>the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as one body</hi> composed of parts <hi>ruling</hi>
and <hi>obeying,</hi> teachers and persons instructed, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> describes the Church, as it is to continue
to <hi>the perfecting of the Saints: (Eph. 4.)</hi> Not
as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> who would make our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
meaning to be no more, but <hi>that</hi> till his
second coming his Gospell should not be so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
rooted out of the world, but that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
or other there should be some that should
professe it.</p>
               <p>2. By vertue of this promise, the <hi>Church</hi> is
assured 1. not to be deprived, neither of any <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
truths,</hi> nor of <hi>lawfull Pastors</hi> to teach
those necessary truths: when I say <hi>necessary,</hi> I
mean <hi>not absolutely necessary</hi> to every single
person, considered in any circumstance, exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or extremity (as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46209:132"/>
                  <hi>Doctor Potter</hi> &amp;c. through their whole books
understand it, whether mistaking <hi>their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
or no, I thought it unnecessary to trouble
my self to examine; but I am sure, without any
prejudice to the established doctrine of the
Church, which remains untouched, though all
the inferences which they would make from
such a notion of the word <hi>necessary</hi> were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them,) but I mean <hi>truths necessary</hi> to the
constitution of a glorious <hi>visible Church,</hi> which
must be furnished with a world of <hi>Doctrines</hi>
and <hi>Orders,</hi> which to all single persons are far
from being necessary to be believed or known,
much lesse to persons wanting abilities, or
means, or time to be instructed. 2. <hi>She</hi> is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from Schisme or Heresie; for remaining
to the worlds end, <hi>one holy Catholique Church</hi>
(as we professe in the <hi>Creed</hi>) how can she be
divided from her self, either in Faith or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
For unlesse all <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Councells Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenicall,</hi>
and indeed <hi>all Christians</hi> should
conspire to renounce that truth to day, which
they believed yesterday, how can novelty or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
enter universally into the Church, under
the notion of Tradition?</p>
               <p>3. Concerning the <hi>subject</hi> of this <hi>authority,</hi>
the <hi>principall subjects</hi> are indeed the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
and <hi>Pastours of the Church,</hi> with whom
<hi>Christ</hi> hath promised that <hi>he</hi> will be to the end
of the world: But the <hi>adequate subject</hi> are
all <hi>Catholique Christians,</hi> as well <hi>instructers</hi> as
<hi>instructed:</hi> since Tradition is continued by
them both, shining in the doctrines taught and
received, in devotions exercised, and in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
practises and ceremonies celebrated by all
Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:46209:133"/>4 Now of this authority of the Church
there are, generally speaking, <hi>two acts, 1. An
Obligation</hi> lying upon all Christians to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<hi>that doctrine</hi> to be true and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to be believed, and <hi>those practises</hi> necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to be conformed to, which are taught and
received by the <hi>whole Church:</hi> and all this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
penalty of being accounted <hi>Heretiques,</hi>
that is, no members of the Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by consequence divided from <hi>Christ the
head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which inspires life into it
here, and will glorifie it hereafter. 2. A <hi>coër<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zion,</hi>
or infliction of spirituall penalties and
censures, as <hi>suspensions, deprivations, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
&amp;c.</hi> on those that persist stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly
in opposing those truths and practises.
And this belongs to the <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi>
of the Church, more or lesse, according to
their severall qualities: For every <hi>Parish Priest</hi>
ha's some degree of this coercive power over his
stock: every <hi>Bishop</hi> over both Priests and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
congregations within his Diocesse ha's
more: every <hi>Metropolitan</hi> a yet larger power:
A <hi>Provinciall Synod</hi> above a single Bishop or
Metropolitan &amp;c. And in conclusion, the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Ecclesiasticall tribunall</hi>
is a <hi>Synod Occumenicall</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called,<note place="margin">See Bacon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalys. sid. &amp; Cellot. de Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Eccl lib. 4. c. 10. &amp; 12. Syst. fidei ca. 23. &amp; infr. ca. 33.</note> confirmed, and
<hi>some adde,</hi> universally received
by all Catholique Churches,
that is by their Prelates, from
which there is no appealing, for
if there were, all authority
would be vain, enjoying the
name, but without any effect, or
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46209:133"/>
use at all, as shall be shewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>5. Concerning the <hi>former act of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
authority, (viz.</hi> an Obligation lying upon
all Christians under pain of Heresie to receive
the doctrines and practises of the universall
Church) that it is in the Church antecedently
to a <hi>generall Councell,</hi> appears by this, namely,
<hi>that</hi> there were in the Church very many <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
taken notice of, acknowledged for such by all
Catholikes, and dissipated before any <hi>generall
Councell</hi> had been called, as the <hi>Ecclesiasticall
history</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> will assure us. And this is
grounded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Upon evident reason,</hi> for what is <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) but a relinquishing of a former
received opinion or practise, and the <hi>choice</hi> of a
particular new one? an act this is which implies
an extreme contempt of the whole mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ, and a preferring ones own single
judgment or wilfullnesse before whatsoever els
is prudent or sacred in the world. 2 <hi>Upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Scripture,</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands the
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> all Christians to
abstain from the conversation of, and not so
much as to bid <hi>God speed</hi> to all <hi>disordinate
walkers,</hi> swerving from the rule established,
and all introducers of novelties in the Church:
Yea S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, that an <hi>Heretique,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Bishops censure, <hi>is</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
<hi>condemned by himself,</hi> that is (as severall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
expound it) voluntarily and by himselfe
<hi>separated</hi> from the body of the faithfull; so
that the solemn excommunication of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
against him may seem to be onely a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of that mans censure against himselfe:
For I conceive it can hardly be affirmed of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46209:134"/>
all <hi>Heretiques</hi> in generall that they are
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>self-condemned,</hi> that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
and maintaining errors against their own
conscience and knowledge.</p>
               <p>6. Now this <hi>authority residing in the whole
body of the Catholique Church</hi> (I must adde,
<hi>of the present Catholique Church</hi>) has been in
all times preserved so inviolable, that besides
the fore-cited testimonies of the <hi>Fathers, this
observation</hi> will sufficiently justifie it, viz. <hi>That
there was never in any age of the Church</hi> (as
far as I have been able to inform my selfe)
<hi>any one single person esteemed a Catholique,
that ever either spoke against, or in the least
degree censured, or seemed to render suspitious
any doctrine or practise universally believed or
received by the Catholique Church during the
time that he lived.</hi> Many Fathers have been
very bold and eager against abuses and errours
<hi>particular,</hi> some of them perhaps too largely
dispersed; but never any of them, whether pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
person or Governour, learned or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>taxed the Church</hi> either of <hi>errour</hi> in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or of <hi>superstition, prophanenesse,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other enormity in practise: Many of them
have earnestly called for a <hi>free Councell</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
particular disorders and errours in the
lives and writings of both Clergy and Laity
(sometimes not sparing <hi>Popes</hi> themselves) but
never to have the Church it self to alter any of
her doctrines, or to change any of her practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
upon pretence that they were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>7. I know the severall <hi>Sectaries</hi> of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
age are in this occasion alwaies ready to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46209:134"/>
object the only one blameable action of that
glorious <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I mean
<hi>his</hi> contestation with the Pope, and opposition
to the generall Apostolique Tradition and
practise of the Church in <hi>non-rebaptization of
Heretiques. They</hi> neglect, forget, and by their
practises condemn that most <hi>Christian Spirit
of Unity and Charity,</hi> which shined in <hi>him</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
those that differed from him in this point,
and (as if <hi>his</hi> errour had been his only vertue)
acknowledge him only an example to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his fault, not considering what probable
excuses there are to qualifie that single fault of
his, to which qualifications, <hi>they</hi> in none of their
so many rebellions can pretend to: as 1. <hi>That</hi> the
generall practise of the Church against him did
not appear to <hi>him</hi> so evident, but that <hi>he</hi> could
alledge examples, not only of the African
Churches, but severall in the East likewise, as
<hi>Cappadocia, Phrygia,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>he</hi> was informed
by <hi>Firmilianus</hi> in his Epistle to him. 2. <hi>That</hi>
he himself begun not this novelty, but conld
justifie the Tradition of it for severall successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
at least as high as the times of <hi>Agrippinus</hi>
one of his Predecessours. 3. <hi>That</hi> no <hi>generall

Yea S. <hi>Augustine</hi> (before quoted) confidently
professeth, that if S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had survived to the
time of the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> he would no
doubt have relinquished his opinion, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Councell.</p>
               <p>8. By this objection borrowed from antient
Heretiques, it appears, that as in <hi>the Catholique
Church</hi> there is a Tradition and Succession of
<hi>truth, so in heresies</hi> likewise of errour, the latter
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46209:135"/>
Heretiques borrowing from their Predecessors
(though not Predecessors in their particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions)
the same arguments and pretences that
formerly have been without successe made use of
against the Catholique Church: so zealous do
such men shew themselves to use all endeavours
to renounce that precious <hi>legacy</hi> of <hi>unity</hi> and
peace, which our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ready to relinquish
the world, so tenderly bequeathed to his
Church.</p>
               <p>9. Then for the <hi>second act of Ecclesiasticall

and supremely in generall Councells,

authority</hi> the primitive times, and all ages ever
since have acknowledged to be grounded upon
the institution and promises of Christ, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

to tread under foot all kind of Ecclesiasticall

               <argument>
                  <p>Authority of the Christian Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with that of the Jewish.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. BEfore I leave this argument of the
grounds of the Churches authority
(and the foundation thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of <hi>indefectibility &amp;c.</hi>) because objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against it are frequently taken out of the
<hi>Old-Testament,</hi> namely from a comparison
with the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> which though it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
great promises, did notwithstanding fall
into a generall corruption, <hi>both in faith and
manners:</hi> It will not be amisse to set down for
what reasons I rested satisfied, that none of
those arguments ought to have any effect
upon me, to shake my acknowledgement of the
authority of the Christian Church so unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
grounded, and so universally submitted
to.</p>
               <p>2. The first reason was, because the <hi>Jewish
Church</hi> had not such promises of <hi>indefectibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and security from <hi>Heresies,</hi> as the <hi>Christian</hi>
Church apparently has. It is true, the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
Jacob</hi> prophesied, that <hi>the Scepter should
not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from
between his knees till Shiloh came.</hi> But this
promise; I assured my self, respected only the
outward policy of the <hi>Jewish Nation,</hi> which
was to remain in a distinct government, not
swallowed up by other governments, but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
governed by its own laws, as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
plainly distinguishable from others till
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46209:136"/>
the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> 2. They were not
furnished with those means of preventing and
condemning of Heresies that the <hi>Christian
Church</hi> enjoyeth. For the understanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I conceived that the <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Law</hi> of <hi>Moyses</hi> was to be considered in
two respects, <hi>first</hi> in the plain litterall sense,
and so it differed not much from the lawes of
other Kingdomes, <hi>the end</hi> thereof being <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happinesse,</hi> which is only in expresse words
proposed in that law. <hi>Secondly</hi> in a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
allegoricall and typicall sense, and so it had
Immediate influence upon the conscience and
inward acts of the soul, which later sense was
taken notice of only by extraordinary persons,
<hi>as Prophets &amp;c.</hi> Now for the <hi>execution</hi> of this
law in the literall outward sense and notion of
it, God left sufficient authority in the Priests
and other Magistrates, threatning every one
with death that opposed their sentences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.
And for the explication of any emergent
difficulties, God left the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> together
with a succession of Scribes, <hi>from whose lips
the people were</hi> ordinarily <hi>to seek knowledge:</hi>
Insomuch as <hi>our Saviour</hi> speaking of such
<hi>Scribes</hi> sayes, <hi>They sit in Moyses his Chair;
whatsoever they command you to observe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and do it, Mat.</hi> 23. But if we observe the
dependance and limitation of that speech, the
meaning will appear to be, <hi>that</hi> for the outward
practises of <hi>Moyses</hi> his law, the Jews were to
submit themselves to the established authority,
yea even when <hi>they</hi> interpreted that law to the
peoples disadvantage, as they did in the case of
<hi>tythes</hi> mentioned by our Saviour in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46209:137"/>
of the former speech, including herbs'
as <hi>Mint, Commyn, &amp;c.</hi> among the Species tyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
which <hi>Moyses</hi> his law did not expresse, not
necessarily imply.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Such authority</hi> the <hi>Priests, Scribe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and
<hi>Pharisees</hi> had to explain the Precepts of his
law for outward practise: But as for <hi>spirituall
points of belief, Prophecies</hi> or internall sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it does not appear that they much medled
with them, not one decision of the <hi>Sanedrim</hi>
can be produced concerning such matters. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
who should be the interpreter of such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?
There were among them two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
factions, the <hi>first</hi> of the Nobility, that is,
Priests, and those were generally <hi>Sadduces,</hi> as
<hi>Josephus</hi> informs us: the <hi>other</hi> that popular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Now I suppose the
<hi>Sadduces,</hi> who denied the immortality of the
soul, the existence of Angells &amp;c. were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent
Judges in spirituall matters, and yet
the authority was principally in their hands: As
for the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> they were the more <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>
of the two, but wanted authority. And to
shew that neither party pretended that points of
such a nature were within their cognizance, it
is observeable, that neither of them extended
their power to the condemnation or excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of the other for such differences; For
for such trifles as heaven or hell, &amp;c. they gave
free liberty of conscience to every one to believe
what and how much any man thought fit.
Therefore surely our Saviour never intended
to extend the forecited Text to such decisions
of the Scribes: For then the people had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to have submitted to that decree of theirs,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46209:137"/>
viz. that <hi>he should be excommunicated that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Christ to have been the Messiah.</hi> Which
<hi>Decree</hi> of theirs, though it seems to be about a
principall <hi>point of Faith,</hi> yet the ground of
making <hi>it</hi> was not to determine points of that
nature; but because they believed, or at least
said that they believed, that <hi>our Saviours</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
had been <hi>to destroy the law of Moyses and
the Temple,</hi> and all the Rites which <hi>Moyses</hi>
gave to the Jews, therefore as externall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
they provided by such a decree against
sedition and rebellion.</p>

of the Churches authority, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me both as firm in themselves, as
the expresse <hi>word of God,</hi> the <hi>promises of

could make any thing firm; and likewise
as <hi>evidently certain</hi> to my understanding as the
universall acknowledgement of all Christians in
the Catholique Church, attested by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
profession and practise of all ages
of Christianity, the quotations, yea whole
volumes of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the concurrence of all
Councells, Provinciall, Nationall, and O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall,
could render any thing that was
delivered before our times assured to any man:
In the <hi>next place,</hi> I took into consideration
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46209:138"/>
the <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>latitude of this authority,</hi> how
far it did necessarily oblige all Christians to
submit to it; and what manner of submission
is required respectively to the doctrines, Rites,
Reformations, &amp;c. decided by the Church.</p>
               <p>2. Now this enquiry I made, not with any
designe to make choice of any particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
among learned Catholiques to adhere to
in opposition to any others (for being a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
I was resolved to be an <hi>obedient son of
the Church,</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> of the Church) but to the
end, that by instructing my self, how much
more easie some <hi>Catholique Doctors</hi> of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
integrity had made the bonds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>Church</hi> restrained all in <hi>her Communion</hi>
(contrary to that conceit which I, whilst I was
a <hi>Protestant</hi> had entertained, when I opposed
the <hi>Churches authority</hi> under the School-noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>infallibility,</hi> and that notion extended
to the utmost importance of the word) I might
clearly perceive my selfe, and if occasion were,
discover to others (especially of my own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
that the exceptions and advantages which
we have against the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> proceed
only from our misunderstanding of her necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
doctrines, or at most, that all the efficacy
they have, is only against particular opinions
and inferences made by particular Catholique
Writers.</p>
               <p>3. I did not search for the most qualified sense
of the <hi>Churches authority</hi> in the writings of <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,
Almain, Major,</hi> no nor of the most learned
spirituall <hi>Gerson, &amp;c.</hi> partly because some of
those Writers are obnoxious to be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
and all of them wrote before the <hi>new
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46209:138"/>
Schismes</hi> gave <hi>Catholiques</hi> the oportunity to
study this controversie more exactly. I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
therefore to writings published since the
<hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and abstaining from relying
upon the suspitious moderatenesse of <hi>Cassander,
Padre Paulo Veneti, Picherellus &amp;c.</hi> I fixed
upon the judgement of our learned <hi>Stapleton,</hi>
a man seldome cited, either by <hi>Cardinall Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,

the voice and determination of the Church
be infallible? <hi>gives an exact explication of the
true state of the controversie in seven observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(called by him</hi> Notabilia) <hi>which are in
brief, as followeth.</hi> 1. That the Church does
not expect to be taught by God immediately by
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w revelations or enthusiasmes, but makes use
of severall means and diligent enquiry, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
governed not by Apostles, who received
immediate revelation, but by ordinary Pastors
and Teachers. 2. That these Pastours in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of these severall means of decision,
proceed not as the Apostles did, with a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
infallible direction of the Holy Spirit, but
with a prudentiall collection, not alwaies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
3. That to the Apostles, who were the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46209:139"/>
first Masters of Evangelicall Faith and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Church, such an infallible certitude
of means was necessary: not so now to the
Church, which pretends not to make new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, but only to deliver what faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
she received, and in some cases to adde
explications. 4. That in conclusions notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
though drawn from means and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
sometimes of reason and humane docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Church is infallible, Propheticall,
and by the holy Spirit's assistance, in some sense
divine. 5. That the ground of this difference
is, because the Church teacheth not Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically,
and by rules of art, but by an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conferred by Almighty God. Hence in
Councells we see their Decrees and Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but not alwaies their proofs and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
6. That this manner of deciding in
Councells was necessary, first in respect of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
persons, because they being rude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
could never be secure of their belief, if it
were to depend on medium's and principles
which they could not comprehend: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in respect of the learned, among whom there
would be no end of disputing, if it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them to examine, whether the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
upon which Councells build their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
were firm and concluding enough. In
a word, otherwise Religion would not be faith,
but Science and Philosophy. 7. (<hi>To set down
his words at length</hi>) We must observe, that to
the Churches infallibility in teaching, it is
sufficient that she be infallible in the substance
of faith, in publique doctrine, and things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation. This is manifest, because
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46209:139"/>
this is the end of the infallibility given, <hi>viz.</hi> For the consummation of the Saints,
and the edification of the body of Christ,
that is, to the publique salvation of the
faithfull. Now God and nature as they
are not defective in necessaries, so neither
are they superabundant in superfluities, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the speciall Providence of God to be
deduced to each particular: The which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
as it doth permit many particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in the Government of the Universe, and
this for the beauty of it, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
(de Civ. lib. 11. cap. 18.) observes: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
doth it permit many private errours<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Church, and even in the most learned men
an ignorance of many things not necessary,
and this not onely to shew a beauty in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sltion,
but for the salvation of the Teachers,
to whom it is expedient to be ignorant of
many things; that in this regard power may
perfected in weaknesse, that is, may be
repressed from pride. <hi>Thus</hi> Stapleton <hi>with

               <argument>
                  <p>Upon what grounds <hi>Stapleton</hi> may be

with more then ordinary latitude.</p>
               </argument>

                  </gap>te with my self about this great and
most important controversie; together with
the grounds upon which I believed that he had
been more moderate and condescending in
this point, then generally other Catholique
Controvertists are.</p>
               <p>2. But first by the way it may be observed,
that when <hi>he</hi> speaks of the voice and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>question</hi> proposed, <hi>he</hi>
means the <hi>decree of the Church</hi> speaking in a
<hi>generall Councell</hi> representatively, in which,
sayes <hi>he,</hi> the <hi>Church is infallible,</hi> namely with
that <hi>restriction</hi> expressed by him in his last ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
viz. <hi>in delivering the substance of
Faith, in publique doctrines, and things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation.</hi> Other Catholiques there are
which in this matter speak more restrictively
then <hi>Stapleton</hi> hath expressed himself: as, to
name one <hi>Panormitan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Panorm. C. signif. ext. de Elect.</note> (whose
words and opinion, though for
the most part disclaimed by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Writers, yet not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
consured by any that I know,
as hereticall,) they are these. <hi>Although a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell represent the whole univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Church, yet in truth the universall
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46209:140"/>
Church is not truly there, but only representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
because the universall Church is made
up of a Collection of</hi> (all) <hi>believers, and that
is that Church which cannot erre. Panormitans</hi>
meaning (to make his words tollerable) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
is, <hi>That</hi> the <hi>decrees</hi> of a <hi>generall Councell</hi>
are not absolutely and necessarily to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the <hi>infallible Doctrines of Faith,</hi> till
they be received by all particular Catholique
Churches, because till then they cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

vertue of a <hi>Generall Councell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Now this opinion maintained by such
considerable learned Catholikes, and not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
contrary to any decision of the Church,
though I did not intend to subscribe to, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46209:142"/>
true; for my resolution alwaies was
not to engage my self in any private Sects or
topicall opinions, and least of all in such as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be exotick and suspitious, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I was very well contented to perceive,
that it was at least an allowable opinion; For
I found it of great convenience to my self, to
free me from many difficulties: For thereby,
1. Here is no entrenching on the points of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
between Catholiques and Protestants,
since they are all, not only decided by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Councells, but likewise actually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to and imbraced by all particular Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Churches; neither (as matters of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
do now stand) is it necessary to require
any more from Protestants, then what ha's been
so both decided and received. 2. Hereby all the
objections, which Protestants make from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(reall or imaginary) contradictions which
may be found in decrees of Councells about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
points not now in controversie, are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
rendred ineffectuall; for if that be to be
only necessarily accounted an article of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Faith, which is actually acknowledged
and received by Catholiques, and since contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
cannot be actually assented to, it will
follow, that whatsoever decisions of Councells
may seem to oppose such articles, are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
to be accounted Catholique Doctrines,
and by consequence not obligatory. 3. That so
much objected speech of S. <hi>Augustine (de Bapt.
Dom. l 2. c. 3.)</hi> (viz. <hi>The letters of Bishops
may</hi> be corrected by Nationall Councells, and
Nationall Councells by Plenary ones, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Plenary Councells may be corrected by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46209:143"/>
that succeed) though it be understood of
points of Doctrine (as it seems to require such
a sense, because S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks it upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of <hi>rebaptization</hi>) yet makes nothing
against Catholiques, who upon the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
grounds and authorities, need account that
only to be Catholique Doctaine, which is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
imbraced by Catholiques. Yea upon the
same grounds the like may be said of that yet
more bold speech of Cardinall <hi>Cusanus,</hi> viz.
<hi>It may be observed by all experience, that an
Universall Councell may fail. (Cusan. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
l. 2. c. 14.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. But to proceed to the severall grounds;
upon which I conceived <hi>Stapleton</hi> determined
this question, with a greater latitude and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
then most other Writers, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<hi>he</hi> hath escaped the censure of any,
being commended even by those who use much
more rigor in it then <hi>he</hi> has done. The first is,
That no Doctrine can be called an <hi>Article of
Faith,</hi> but what was in the beginning revealed
and delivered to the Church by Christ and his
Apostles. 2. <hi>That</hi> these doctrines have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and continued to these times by <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
that is, not only in books approved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<hi>Traditionally,</hi> but rather in an orall
practicall <hi>Tradition</hi> from one age to another.
For the Church pretends not to any new imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<hi>revelation,</hi> though <hi>she</hi> enjoys an effectuall
assistance of Gods holy Spirit. 3. <hi>That</hi> there
is a double obligation from decisions of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councells,</hi> the first an obligation of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
belief,</hi> in respect of <hi>doctrines</hi> delivered
by <hi>Generall Councells,</hi> as of universall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46209:143"/>
the <hi>second</hi> only of Canonicall obedience
to orders and constitutions for practise, by
which men are not bound to believe that <hi>these</hi>
are inforced, as from divine authority, but only
to submit to them, as acts of a lawfull Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
power, however not to censure them as
unjust, much lesse to oppose and contradict
them. 4. <hi>That</hi> many (I may say, most) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of Councells <hi>in order to practise</hi> do
yet vertually include some degree of belief; as
that of <hi>Communion under one kind, of the use
of Images in Churches and upon Altars, &amp;c.
of residence of Bishops, of authorised Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> And that in such cases
we are not obliged to believe that Christ or his
Apostles gave order that such practises should
follow, <hi>but only that</hi> considering Christs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
care over his Church so clearly promised,
neither these nor any other orders universally
established and practised are destructive to any
substantiall doctrine or practise of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and that the authority left by Christ in his
church was so large and ample, as that when she
<hi>shall</hi> judge it fit, considering the various dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of succeeding times<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>she</hi> may alter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
the substance of Christian Religion, even in the
Sacraments themselves, as we see acknowledged
in some cases by all Christian churches, as
about the altering of the <hi>time and posture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Eucharist, the triple immersion in
Baptisme, abstaining from things strangled,
and from bloud, &amp;c.</hi> 5. That doctrines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by Nationall Councells lay no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
at all upon any other churches, but only
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46209:144"/>
those whose Bishops meet together: and all the
obligation even of those Christians who live
within such Provinces, is only not to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;
they are not bound to receive such <hi>deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as Articles of Faith;</hi> the reason being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
<hi>because one Nation cannot be a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
judge of Catholique Tradition, and there
neither is, nor can be any Article of Faith
but what is delivered that way. 6. That the</hi>
authority of the <hi>Pastours of the present Church</hi>
is not of so absolute and sublime a nature as
that of the Apostles was, <hi>though</hi> it be sufficient
to require obedience from every man: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
consequently <hi>that</hi> they are not in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
so powerfully assisted in their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as the <hi>Apostles</hi> were, so that some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is to be made between <hi>Canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Apostolike writings,</hi> as hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before out of S. <hi>Augustine, Beltarmine,</hi> and
other Authors. 7. That <hi>some difference</hi> may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be made between the <hi>present</hi> and <hi>primitive
Churches:</hi> For they having received Christian
doctrines more immediately and purely, and
besides the true sense of particular passages of
Scripture, which are difficult (which is now in
a great measure utterly lost) <hi>they</hi> were able to
speak more fully of many particular, not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
points in Christian Religion, then the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
church now can, though perhaps the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of tongues and sciences, the benefit of
so many writings, both ancient and modern,
long study and meditation, &amp;c. may in some
sort recompense those disadvantages of the
present church 3 yet however <hi>these</hi> are but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
and humane perfections, whereas the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46209:144"/>
                  <hi>former</hi> were Apostolique Tradition. 8. That
even of <hi>points of doctrine</hi> decided by Councells
a <hi>difference</hi> may be made between <hi>such as are
of universall Tradition,</hi> and <hi>others:</hi> for those
former being capable to be made evidently cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(as I proved before) such <hi>decisions</hi> are
to be the <hi>objects</hi> of our Christian Faith, and no
more to be rejected then any other divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:
But other <hi>points</hi> of doctrine there are
sometimes decided in Councells, rather by the
judgement and learning of the Bishops, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Texts of Scripture, wherein such points
seem to be included. And weighing together
the doctrines of antient. Fathers and modern
Doctors, an example whereof I gave before
in the Councell of <hi>Vienna,</hi> touching inherent
grace infused into Infants in Baptism, and in
the Councell of <hi>Bazil,</hi> concerning the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
conception of our <hi>B. Lady:</hi> NOw <hi>such
decisions</hi> many Catholiques conceive, are not
in so eminent a manner the necessary objects of
Christian Faith; because not delivered as of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
Tradition: But however an extreme
temerity it would be in any particular man to
make any doubt of the truth of them, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
disobedience to reject them, I mean
the <hi>conclusions</hi> themselves, though if the Texts
of Scripture be set down, from whence such
conclusions are deduced, or the said authorities
produced, it may perhaps not be so great a fault
to enquire and dispute, whether from such a
Text, or such authorities, such a conclusion
will necessarily follow. 9. If in such decisions,
as these later are, there should happen to be any
errour, (which yet we may piously believe the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46209:145"/>
assistance of Gods holy Spirit promised to the
Church will prevent) but if this should happen,
since it must necessarily be in a point not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to the substance of Christian Religion,
(for all substanciall points are univ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rsall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as we shewed before) it were far better
such an error should passe, till (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith) some later Councell amended it, then
that unity should be dissolved for an <hi>unnecessary
truth,</hi> since as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, <hi>There is no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
so important to the Church, as Schism,</hi>
upon any pretence whatsoever is <hi>pernicious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Upon such grounds as these, I supposed,
it was that <hi>our</hi> learned <hi>Stapleton</hi> stated this
question of the churches authority (or as he
calls it, <hi>infallibility</hi>) with so much latitude and
condescendence; And <hi>him</hi> I have quoted not
with any intention to prefe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
of any other, but to shew that
thereby I perceived my self not to have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
considered the necessary doctrine of the
Roman Church in this so fundamentall a point
of faith; and likewise how (when I heard the
Church speaking in her own language, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
interpreted by Catholique Doctors.)
I found what she said so just, so reasonable, so
impossible to be contradicted by any thing but
passion, or interest, or pride, or hatred of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that there was no resisting the attraits of it.
Then at last I found what I had all my life time
in vain sought after, namely a firm foundation,
whereon I might safely and without any scruple
rely; and more glad then of all worldly treasures
to see my soul taken out of mine own hands,
and placed under the conduct of <hi>her</hi> whom
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46209:145"/>
Christ had appointed to be my guide and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctresse,
to whom <hi>he</hi> had made so many rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,

in contradiction to other Seets, with
whom they will not communicate; yea even

those <hi>who</hi> make a <hi>liberty of prophecying</hi> a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencing
mark of their Sect, yet will not allow
their own partizans this liberty of prophecying,
unlesse they prophecy by their rule, and against
their enemies. In the next place I took into
consideration the unspeakably happy effects of
this authority, which immediately represented
themselves to my mind.</p>
               <p>2. I will notwithstanding a while defer an
account of those effects, till I have briefly set
down and examined the grounds which <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
lay for interpreting Scripture, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
controversies in Religion, in opposition to
this authority of the Church and her Generall
Councells; as likewise their principall objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against the said authority: For then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
both these doctrines together, and the
consequences together, it will be more easie
and commodious to decide whether of them is
the more advantagious, and whether or no I
have made a prudent choice in forsaking a
Church, where all unity was impossible, but
only such an outward unity, as worldly hopes
and fears can produce, and in betaking my selfe
to a church where Schisme is impossible.</p>
               <p>3. All Protestants, and other Sects, agree in
this against the Catholique Church (for <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeest

42.) saith, <hi>Their unity is an agreement in
Schisme, that the Scripture is the only sufficient
Rule of Faith, and that there is no visible
Judge of the sense of it.</hi> But yet to the end
that Gods church may not become a very Babel,
since a Judge visible or invisible must needs be
had, some disagreement there is among
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46209:146"/>
among them, what invisible judge to pitch
upon.</p>
               <p>4. All that I can collect from the sense of
the English Church in this point is, that which
results from these articles of hers compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
viz. <hi>Holy Scripture containeth all
things necessary for salvation, so that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is not read therein, is not to be required of
any man that it should be believed as an Article
of Faith, or be thought requisite necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
Again, <hi>The three Creeds &amp;c. ought
throughly to be received &amp;c. For they may be
proved by most certain warrants of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
Again, <hi>The visible Church of Christ
is a Congregation of faithfull men, in which
the pure word of God is preached, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
be duly administred &amp;c. As the
Church of Hierusalem &amp;c. so also the Church
of Rome hath erred, not only in their living
and manner of ceremonies, but also in matters
of Faith.</hi> Again, <hi>The Church hath power to
decree rites or ceremonies, and authority in
controversies of Faith; and yet it is not lawful
for the church to ordain any thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Gods Word, neither may it so expound
one place of Scripture that it be repugnant to
another: wherefore although the church be a
witnesse and a keeper of Holy Writ, yet as it
ought not to decree any thing against the fame,
so besides the same ought it not to enforce any
thing to be believed for necessity of salvation.</hi>
Again, <hi>Generall Councells may not be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together, without the commandement and
will of Princes. And when they be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together (forasm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in things pertaining unto God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
things ordained by them as necessary
unto salvation, have neither strength nor
authority, unless it may be declared, that
they be taken out of Holy Scriptures.</hi>
From which Articles it is apparent, that
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> though in words
she seemes to ascribe some kind of power
to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Generall Councells,</hi>
yet in very deed, since she makes her
selfe at least, if not each particular man,
a judge, whether the Catholique Church
proceeds according to Scriptures or no,
the thereby utterly deprives the Church of
all manner of authority: <hi>yea de facto</hi>
the Supremest authority, which is in the
Church, is actually censured as a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
both in having made decisions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond,
and against the Word of God. But
after these destructive determinations, the
<hi>English Church</hi> names no other visible or
invisible authority, not laying her selfe any
claime thereto, although in effect <hi>she</hi> takes
upon her to do more then she claimes:
So that <hi>à primo ad ultimum,</hi> all the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I could make of the <hi>English
Church</hi> was, that since worldly interests
constrained her to separate from the Catholike
Church, by the just judgement of God, she
had only a power given her to <hi>destroy the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God,</hi> but not so much as to lay one stone
towards the raising up another in the place of
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:46209:147"/>5. As for the <hi>Calvinist</hi> party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they follow the example of <hi>Calvin,</hi>
and most of his followers that I had read,
as likewise the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> &amp;c. all which
make the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> testifying to every
mans conscience, the <hi>infallible interpreter
of Scripture.</hi> Now concerning this their
pretence to such a <hi>Judge,</hi> all I had to say
upon it, during that very small time that
I had the patience to take it into debate,
was; 1. <hi>That</hi> I could not believe that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
themselves, when they laid claim each
man, or each Sect to such an <hi>infallible Iudge.
2. That</hi> if they did indeed believe it, as I
could not hinder them, so till I had some
good experience I durst not pretend to the like
<hi>infallibility. 3. Since</hi> all those <hi>Sects</hi> pretend
to so <hi>more-then-miraculous an infallibility,</hi>
and yet not any of them work any other <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
it proves of no effect to end controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
which is the proper office of a Judge,
especially such a Judge as the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which
is the <hi>Spirit of unity. 4. That</hi> if such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was indeed <hi>false</hi> (as it must be in all
Sects differing betweene themselves, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>one</hi>) it is in all the rest a most horrible
presumptuous <hi>lying against the Holy Ghost,</hi>
and most justly punished by <hi>him</hi> with implacable
and eternall divisions both among themselves,
and from <hi>Catholique</hi> unity, divisions; I say,
impossible to be remedied, till all but one Sect
agree in the same confession, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
since a <hi>Judge</hi> is requisite, and the <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
one</hi> will not serve the turne, <hi>that</hi> therefore
they are to have recourse to the <hi>onely visible
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46209:148"/>
one,</hi> viz. The present Catholique Church,
<hi>which</hi> in Spirits so envonomed against the
Church, as those Sects are, how without a
miracle it cannot be expected, fearfull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
shewes. 5. <hi>That</hi> since this pretending
to the Spirit is effectuall onely so far, as by
a seeming divine warrant to make them hate
one the other, but not to oblige one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to submit to their so <hi>eanonized interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
it is of no use at all in this businesse
of finding out a <hi>Judge to end controversies</hi>
among dissenting Christians. Lastly, <hi>That</hi>
that <hi>rule of Tertullian (de Praser.)</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable,
viz. <hi>That whatsoever is new is
Religion, praejudges it selfe to be false,</hi> it
will undoubtedly follow, that this ground of
so many Sects, is of all others most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
untrue, since no example can be found
for it in all <hi>Antiquity:</hi> Here the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the antient Patriarchs of Merefies
failes them, for excepting some fanaticall
Heretiques, as the <hi>Montanists,</hi> &amp;c. none
ever pretended to the Spirit against the
church.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> found Judge
of Controversies, <hi>viz.</hi> Private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>His grounds for the asserting such a Judge.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. SInce the publishing of Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's</hi>
book, there ha's appeared in
England a <hi>new Judge</hi> of controversies, and
much defer'd unto there, which is <hi>every man's
private reason interpreting of Scripture.</hi> From
<hi>what countrey</hi> this new <hi>Judge</hi> came, is very
well known, and I willingly forbear to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
The truth is, if Christ had made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to his church, if it had not by God's own
Spirit been called the <hi>Pillar and ground of
truth;</hi> if universall Tradition were a fable;
if all Councello, conspiracies of Tyrants, and
lastly, if unity in the church were unnecessary
or unprofitable, <hi>reason</hi> might have much to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for it self, that it should be raised into
this tribunall.</p>
               <p>2. But before I examine particularly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of <hi>reason to this</hi> Office, I will set down
the <hi>State of this controversie,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
(c. 4. parag. 93.)</hi> ha's very perspicuously
and yet very briefly expressed it in these words;
<hi>Believe the Scripture to be the word of God,
use your true endeavour to find the true sense of
it, and live according to it, and then you may
rest securely that you are in the true way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46209:149"/>
happinesse.</hi> These are the directions
which <hi>he</hi> professeth that <hi>he would give to any</hi>
man desirous to save his soule, and requiring
whose instructions to rely upon for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and this in opposition to a <hi>Catholique,</hi>
that would advise such a man to have recourse
to the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. Now for a more orderly examining of
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> direction for finding out
the true sense of Scripture, and judging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies;
I will yet more distinctly set down
his grounds in severall propositions collected
out of his book, in such a method, as may shew
the respect and dependence of the one on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
together with the chief reasons which <hi>he</hi>
alledges for the proof of them; and afterward
I will subjoyn thereto the <hi>reasons</hi> which moved
me to judge such grounds of his, insufficient,
and his reasons unconcluding; and in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I will declare how I satisfied mine own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that all the severall <hi>objections</hi> which <hi>he</hi>
makes against the <hi>Churches authority,</hi> under the
notion of <hi>infallibility,</hi> have not that force that
both <hi>he</hi> and <hi>I my self</hi> once imagined.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The abridgement of Mr.</hi> Chillingworth's
<hi>whole discourse, I conceived might be reduced
to these Propositions following, viz, 1.</hi> That
Christian Religion having been planted so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ages since, the only ordinary way that we
can arrive to the knowledge of it is Tradition:
and the only assured way, universall Tradition
of all ages and Churches, which is of it selfe
credible, and admits not of any proof. 2. That
for himself he could find nothing delivered by
such an universall Tradition, as of divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46209:149"/>
but only books of Scripture; for if he
had, he would have imbraced it with equal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
since the being written makes not any
thing more credible. 3. That the Scripture is a
most sufficient, and the only rule of Faith (most
sufficient) because it self sayes so (the only rule)
because nothing else can be proved to be of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Tradition. 4. That by consequence, the
Scripture contains in it all things necessary to
be believed and practised by all sorts of persons,
and this so plainly and expressely, that no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
man can doubt of the sense thereof,
much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esse be mistaken; for otherwise God
would not have provided sufficiently for the
salvation of mankind. 5. That concerning
those passages of Scripture, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
doctrines of Christianity, but not so
plainly, men are not obliged necessarily to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
or believe them, since it cannot consist
with the goodnesse of God, that men should be
bound to have an expresse knowledge or belief
of that which God himself ha's purposely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
obscurely. 6. That since no proof can be
made, either out of Scripture, or universall
Tradition, that there is any authoritative vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Judge of the sense of the Scripture; and
since each mans understanding or reason is the
only faculty capable of judging; that therefore
it only is to judge of the sense of the Scripture
as far as concerns each mans particular. 7. That
fince every mans reason may possibly be deceived,
(especially proceeding upon objects not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
offered to sense) therefore an infallible
faith is not required; such a probability will
serve tqe turn, as is sufficient to produce in a
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46209:150"/>
man obedience to the precepts of holinesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Gospell. 8. That since all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
cannot but agree in necessary doctrines
(which are expresse) they ought not to deny
communion to one another for other doctrines,
not expressely contained in Scripture. And
that this is the only affectuall means of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and preserving unity among Christians.</p>
               <p>5. These are in brief the <hi>grounds</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, and of the means afforded us to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the true sense of as much of it as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and likewise to beget charity and unity
among Christians as they lye dispersed up and
down in Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi> book, and which
I have set down faithfully and ingenuously, in
the most rationall method that I could devise.
I will now with as convenient dispatch as I
can, adjoyn likewise in the same order <hi>respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively</hi>
the reasons why I could not content my
self with them, but was forced to relinquish
them, to abase mine owne reason, and
to have recourse to a foundation, as I
thought, more firme and rationall, and I am
confident farre more safe, viz. the <hi>Catholique
Church.</hi>

                  <p>An answer to the three first grounds of
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. TO the first ground therefore, viz. <hi>That
there is no other way to be assured of a
Religion established many ages since, but uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Tradition,</hi> I grant it; But whereas it
is added, <hi>A Tradition of all ages:</hi> If the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be, <hi>that</hi> it is required to such an assurance,
that a man should have precisely from every
age a sufficient testimony of this <hi>universal
Tradition,</hi> this is u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>terly impossible any other
way, then as including the testimony of former
ages in that of the present; for though there
may be preserved a few writings in every age,
all which may contur in this testimony, and so
make it indeed very probable; yet the testimony
of three or four Writers is not equivalent to the
testimony of the age. <hi>Add</hi> to this, that such a
way of proof (though it may give good satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to learned persons, and is practised
more by <hi>Catholiques</hi> then any other, who yet
rest upon the present Church for the certainty
of Tradition) yet it is very laborious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and whereof very few persons are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and therfore not to be made a ground for
all men to build all Religion upon. The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
therefore of all former ages is alwaies most
safely included, as to particular men, in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the present age, if <hi>that</hi> be universall
for place, and grounded upon Tradition, as I
shewed before, and made the <hi>proofe</hi> of the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46209:151"/>
of it to be, <hi>because</hi> it was impossible it
should be false, unless some one whole age should
conspire to deliver a thing as of Tradition, which
was not so and not only conspire, but should
actually deceive their children, no man discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the imposture, a thing beyond all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of possibility. I will therefore add no more
here, but only the confession of a learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in his own words, viz.<note place="margin">Field of the Church. l. 4. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is impossible but such a doctrine should come by

could find nothing as of divine authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by universall Tradition of all ages, but
only books of Scripture.</hi> I answer, that any
one that will search with a willingnesse to find,
shall doubtlesse have better fortune then
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth.</hi> For I desire any one to
consider with himself, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Whether</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did not in all churches established by them,
settle the whole doctrine and form of Christian
Discipline uniformly? and <hi>whether</hi> this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and discipline was not carefully preserved
in the Primitive churches all the world over? if
these things be granted, as plaine Texts of
Scripture for the former,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 20. 27</note> and
an agreement of most of the
Fathers, within the time of the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46209:151"/>
                  <hi>four first Generall Councells</hi> will testifie for
both. Then I desire to know, <hi>whether</hi> from the
<hi>fourth Councell</hi> till <hi>S. Gregory the Great's</hi>
days, any substantial part of either ha's perished?
If any one say it ha's, he will find it a labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Hercules</hi> his forces to prove it; for to this
hour I could never see one pressing testimony
out of any Ecclesiasticall Writer. Then from
<hi>S. Gregories</hi> dayes to these, it is visible that not
any the least substantiall part of either is lost,
and this by the confession of
severall learned Protestants,<note place="margin">Vid. Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys Prot. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. tr. 2. Sect. 1.</note> by
the agreement of all Catholique
Writers, by <hi>S. Gregories</hi> own
writings, and (which is a proof
irrefragable) by comparing the
<hi>Gregorian Liturgy and Missall</hi> with those of
the present age. In the next place, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<hi>that</hi> most of the books of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were written by the Apostles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
for the use of particular churches, some to
particular persons, sent by single messengers.
Besides, <hi>that</hi> severall ages were passed, before
all the <hi>books</hi> were communicated, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and accepted as Canonicall by the whole
Catholike Church. <hi>Now</hi> after a comparing of
<hi>these two Traditions</hi> together, let any man
judge whether of them is the more universall,
either for time or place.</p>
               <p>3. To the third, viz. <hi>Of Scriptures being an
entire Rule of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> It is already answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>cap. 31, 32. &amp;c.</hi> Whereto I shall for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
only add this, viz. That Mr. <hi>Chillingworth
(cap. 1. parag. 5. 6. 7.)</hi> takes great advantage
from a speech, as he sayes, of his adversaries,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46209:152"/>
namely, <hi>That the Scripture is a perfect rule,
forasmuch as a writing can be a rule.</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
his learned adversary never intended to
allow him all this in the sense and extent that
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> presseth it, as if all points of
Faith were as fully set down in Scripture, as
they could be in any writing. But I have no
commission to interpose between them two, and
therefore all I have to say is, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me no kind of necessity, nor any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that it was his Antagonists intention,
that such a large allowance should be made to
<hi>Protestants;</hi> for I would fain know, since <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
is one necessary condition to make a rule
<hi>perfect,</hi> could Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> believe that
the meaning of his learned adversary should be,
that for example, the doctrine of Faith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>blessed Trinity</hi> is as evidently and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly
stated in Scripture, as in the first <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
of <hi>Nice?</hi> or all points in controversie now
adayes, as in the <hi>Councell of Trent?</hi> or that all
Texts of Scripture are so unquestionably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that no interpretations or Commentaries
could make them plainer? his meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
surely was, that <hi>Scripture</hi> in regard of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and with relation to <hi>fundamentall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi>
chiefly intended to be published in it,
is as evident as can be expected from any one
single writing standing alone. Not but that one
writing explained by a second, and those expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
further cleared by a third may be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Or though it might have been possible, that
for example, the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity</hi> might
have been declared so manifestly, that <hi>Photini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme</hi>
or <hi>Arianisme</hi> might have been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46209:152"/>
notwithstanding no plainnesse of writing
can prevent malitious spirits from extracting
novelties of some kinds of senses or heresies,
either those or others as pernicious, since as our
blessed Lord sayes, <hi>Necosse est ut veniant
scandala,</hi> that is, <hi>It is necessary that scandalls
must come, Mat. 19. 9</hi> And S. <hi>Paul, Oportet &amp;
haereses esse,</hi> that is, <hi>It is needfull that there
should be heresies, 1 Cor. 11. 19.</hi> both for the
tryall of those that love God, and discovery of
those that hate him. For unlesse God should
quite change the nature of mankind, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that any one writing should be so plain,
but that either the curiosity, or pride, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
or malice, or at least the debility of mens
wits may, and doubtlesse will find or extract
obscurities and difficulties out of it, especially
such a writing as the Scripture is, which being
composed by men of severall dispositions and
spirits, moreover belongs to all mankind, of all
conditions and dispositions, so that if they be
let alone, every one will be forward, yea even
take a glory to dig and search into the treasures
of it, and challenge an equall right to maintain
his own, and disparage the discoveries of any
other; every <hi>Sect</hi> and <hi>Sectary</hi> will think
they see and read therein all their owne
distinctive opinions clearly shining, and a
confutation of all opposite tenents. Yea perhaps,
the blind sensuall. <hi>Passions,</hi> worldly interests,
and proud fancies of vain man, will have recourse
thither, and not want the impudence to seek
for, nor blush to pretend that they have found
a covert and protection for the works of Satan
in the divine Word of God. In vain therefore
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46209:153"/>
doth Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> triumphantly boast of
his inferences, to his seeming advantagious to
himself, since they are all extracted meerly
from his own misunderstanding of that most
reasonable and prudent saying of his worthy
<hi>Antagonist.</hi> 4. Yea this one consideration, that
the necessary mysteries of Faith are not, nor
could be so evidently set down in any one place
of Scripture, but that other places may be
found, which may afford ground even to an
understanding man to raise objections, will
make any man conclude, that <hi>either</hi> there are
no mysteries necessary to be believed, <hi>or that</hi>
something besides Scripture must be made use
of to clear all difficulties.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>An answer to M. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> fourth
and fifth grounds.</p>
                  <p>Severall Novelties introduced by him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. To the <hi>fourth,</hi> where it is said, <hi>That all
things necessary to salvation are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in Scripture so plainly, that no reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man, desirous to find the true sense, can
doubt or be mistaken in the sense of them; so
that for such matters there is no need of any
interpreter.</hi> An assertion this is, which is one
of the main foundations, upon which all manner
of Sects that withdraw themselves from the
Churches authority, do and must relye; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
I thought it necessary to spend more
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46209:153"/>
thoughts in examining the firmnesse of it: and
after all, I professe I found it of all others most
weak, most contrary to reason, and every daies
experience.</p>
               <p>2. For demonstrating the justice of this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it, and that I may expresse my self more
clearly, I will lay down certain <hi>positions,</hi> to
which I conceive all rationall men will assent.
As first, touching the word <hi>necessary,</hi> (besides
what hath already been spoken of the ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of that <hi>word,</hi> which is <hi>relative,</hi> and
variable according to it's application to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
objects and subjects, which I will not
now repeat) I suppose that all men will call
that necessary, for which being either denyed
or affirmed, they being of a contrary opinion
would break Communion from, and deny it to
other Churches: for <hi>Schisme</hi> about unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
things, is by all Christians acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
a sin almost unpardonable. 2. <hi>That</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
to affirm <hi>a doctrine to be expressed
plainly in Scripture,</hi> it is not sufficient to say
<hi>it appeares so to me,</hi> for so almost every one
will be forward to say of all his <hi>Opinions,</hi>
which he pretends to be grounded on <hi>Scripture:</hi>
But <hi>that</hi> is to be called <hi>plain and expresse,</hi>
which ha's not been controverted by men of
reason, pretending to <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>impaertiality,</hi>
especially if they be in any considerable
number; so that it will not be satisfactory to
say, <hi>this appears plainly to me,</hi> and I am sure
I am not led by interest or faction, as others
are; for this may be every ones plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
another. 3. <hi>That</hi> where two senses are
given of any passage of Scripture, <hi>the one</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46209:154"/>
probable and naturall, <hi>the other</hi> not
wholly absurd, and whereof the words may
possibly be capable: <hi>in this case</hi> one Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
cannot upon their own grounds condemn
or impute heresie to another.</p>
               <p>3. These positions thus premised, in the next
place I conceived it very just, that before any
Sect of Christians did build upon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>of the</hi> Scriptures, containing expressely
and evidently all things necessary, that <hi>they</hi>
should all conspire to make <hi>a Catalogue of
points necessary,</hi> and this with relation to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
states of persons, or at least to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Churches: (I add this limitation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to multiply severall distinct Catalogues
for all persons would be of extreme labour: and
on the other side, to make one Catalogue for
all men, would (as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth (Cap. 3.
parag. 13.</hi> sayes) be <hi>like the making a coat
for the Moon,</hi> which is continually in the wain
or encrease.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. Now to shew the reasonablenesse of this,
and that Mr.</hi> Chillingworths <hi>adversary required
most justly such a</hi> Catalogue from Protestants,
<hi>let but any man consider with himself what
satisfaction any man can have from a</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Minister, <hi>when he shall tell him,</hi> You
have the Bible of our Translation, in which we
affirm all necessary truths to be contained, but
mixed with a world of unnecessary, you are not
absolutely bound to study, or to be able to read this
Bible, yet you shall be damned if you be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of those necessary truths dispersed here and
there in it; to say definitively how many, and
which are those especiall necessary truths, we
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46209:154"/>
are not able, neither have we authority; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at your own perill be sure you mistake nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the number nor sense of those truths:
we can indeed afford you Articles and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes,
to which as long as you live with us
you must be forced to subscribe, but we have no
authority (for there is none visible upon earth)
to propose our collections or determinations, as
obliging in conscience, &amp;c. <hi>In what a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
case would that</hi> Protestant <hi>be, that should
give himself leave to examine upon how meer
a quicksand all his pretentions to eternity are
built.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And whereas Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> would seem
to conceive himself secure in the midst of these
uncertainties, because, as he thinks, Catholiques
also are encumbred with the like: I found that
conceit of his altogether groundlesse; for <hi>the
promises of Christ remaining firm, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the Catholique Church,</hi> it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
1. That in the Catholique Church shall
be taught to the worlds end all necessary and
profitable truths to all sorts of persons; so that
every man respectively receiving and believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what the church appoints to be proposed to
him, cannot fail of being instructed with things
necessary, &amp;c. 2. The same Church being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with authority to determine the true sense
of divine truths, a Catholique submitting to
the Church, cannot be in danger through mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
or errours; so that he who hearkens to the
Church, ha's his catalogue of fundamentalls
made to his hand, the Church, like the wise
Steward in the Gospell out of that store of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
given her by Christ, proportioning to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46209:155"/>
every man his <hi>dimensum panis quotidiani,</hi> his
own befitting allowance.</p>
               <p>6. And here by the way will appear; 1. The
vanity of that ordinary calumny, which Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
impute to the Catholique Church, as if
she taught that it were sufficient to ignorant
men only implicitly to believe what the Church
believes, without an explicite belief of any
thing: for there is none so ignorant,
but is obliged to know and assent to what the
Church teacheth him by his Pastour suitable
to his estate and education. And secondly,
an usuall mistake among Protestants, who
think that all the <hi>credenda</hi> in Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are comprised in the definitions of
<hi>Councells:</hi> for before ever any <hi>Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
sate, the Church was furnished with her
full measure of divine truths, necessary to
be believed, which were by her publiquely
professed and proposed; which have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
declared, and distinctly expounded in
her Councells. But to return to Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. He by his sharp understanding, and long
meditation, coming to perceive those incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
and considering that no <hi>Protestant</hi>
or other Church could upon their generally
acknowledged grounds authoritatively define
either the number or sense of Articles of Faith,
so as to oblige any man, even within her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
in conscience to assent and submission
(For, for example, if an <hi>Englishman</hi> would not
subscribe to the sense of any Article of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> all the penalty would be,
he should not partake of the priviledges and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46209:155"/>
of that Church, but he might go over
into <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> whose sense in such
an Article he liked better, and still be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<hi>even by the English Church</hi> to be ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
enough.) <hi>He</hi> therefore was forced to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<hi>two Novelties</hi> among English Protestants
which find great approbation: the first is to alter
the old manner and notion of <hi>subscription</hi> to the
English Articles; for <hi>whereas</hi> before, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
there by their subscription testified their
belief of all the 39. Articles in the sense import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the words; yea <hi>whereas</hi> there was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
which denounced Excommunication <hi>ipso
facto</hi> to all that should say that any of them were
not true, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> thus
expresseth his mind in subscribing,<note place="margin">Answ. to Dire. to N. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>par. 39.</note>
                  <hi>I am perswaded that the constant
doctrine of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
is so pure and Orthodox,
that whosoever believes it, and lives according
to it, undoubtedly he shall be saved: and that
there is no error in it, which may necessitate or
warrant any man to distrub the peace, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Communion of it. This in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is all intended by subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. His second novelty is, <hi>that</hi> whereas the
<hi>Protestants</hi> alwaies professed that the publiqua
Confessions of their Churches Faith, was
indeed their own faith, <hi>that is,</hi> such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
plain and indubitable, as are in holy
Scripture concerning such points, or at least
irrefragable consequences from Scripture, and
therfore were to them as Scripture, because their
sence of Scripture: and <hi>whereas</hi> they respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46209:156"/>
divided themselves from the Communion
of the Catholike and other particular churches,
because they would not joyn with them in the
belief of Scripture explained in that sense,
which their severall <hi>Articles</hi> import (and not
because they refused to submit to Scripture,
which all professe to do.) And lastly, <hi>whereas</hi>
though they acknowledged <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ripture</hi> to be the
only Rule of Faith, yet because it not having
being written in form of <hi>Institutions</hi> or a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme,</hi>
the necessary doctrines of Religion
are dispersed uncertainly in the severall books,
difficulty to be found out of them, and withall
not so plainly delivered, but that there is
need of explication and conciliation with other
passages of Scripture that seem to contradict;
for this reason each church compiled <hi>abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and <hi>confessions</hi> disposed orderly and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically,
by which they signifie to the world
how <hi>they</hi> understand Scripture: Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
on the contrary delivers their mind
joyntly for them after a new way (which is his
<hi>second Novelty</hi>) which I will set down in his
own words, (<hi>cap. 6. parag. 56.) By the Religion
of Protestants I do not</hi> (saith he) <hi>understand
the doctrine of</hi> Luther, <hi>or</hi> Calvin, <hi>or</hi> Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
<hi>nor the confession of</hi> Augusta, <hi>or</hi> Geneva,

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> harmony, as a perfect rule
of their faith and actions, that is the Bible,
the Bible, I say the Bible only is the Religion
of Protestants: Whatsoever else they believe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46209:156"/>
besides it, and the plain irrefragable indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
consequences of it, well may they hold it as
matter of Opinion, but as a matter of Faith
and Religion, neither can they with coherence
to their own grounds believe it themselves, nor
require the belief of it of others, without most
high and most Schismaticall presumption.</hi> Thus
far Mr. <hi>Chillingwrrth.</hi> Now how far other
Protestants out of <hi>England</hi> will approve of this
<hi>new shift,</hi> which <hi>he</hi> ha's found out for them,
and which, I am sure, he ha's published without
any commission from them, I know not: But
if <hi>they</hi> also justifie him in this, all I can say is,
that they will make their party much the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by it, and will likewise have reason to pretend
to almost primitive antiquity, for if all be of
their body, who, whatsoever their particular te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
be, build their faith upon only Scripture
interpreted by each mans reason, then not
only all Heretiques of these times, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
almost all Heretiques since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
times, will be united in the same <hi>corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. But once more to return to Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's
'Position,</hi> viz. <hi>That all necessary truths
are contained in Scripture so expressely, that no
man can rationally doubt of the sense of them,
and by consequence there is no need of an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised
visible interpreter.</hi> All that I shall say
in answer hereto, shall be the making a few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
to our English Protestants especially: As
1. To consider this and the former speeches of
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> not as an extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of his excellent wit, but that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
necessity forced him to: for though
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46209:157"/>
before him few Protestant Writers have so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered the <hi>arcana schismatis,</hi> as being
unwilling to tell their followers that they had
no authority to oblige them to their opinions:
Yet Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> deals more ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
discovering, that this is indeed a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
most necessary to be laid by all those,
who deny all visible Ecclesiasticall authority
in expounding Scripture, and judging defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
of controversies in Religion: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they may say, <hi>God ha's given us the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be our only rule, this Rule is ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and difficult, even in necessary things;
there is no judge to interpret it, mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
are weak, and their wills strong,
they are easily led away with prejudices, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and worldly interests; so that it is a
great chance if they light upon the true sense of
those difficult, yet most necessary mysteries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
besides, that they are very contrary to
flesh, and blood, and carnall reason. This were
to deal with mankind worse then the AEgypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Taskmasters did with the Israelites, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
brick, and give them no straw.</hi> Since
therefore no Protestant would willingly lay
such an imputation upon the <hi>Father of mercies,</hi>
it will follow, that he must of meer force ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
with Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> that all
truths necessary to salvation are contained in
Scripture so expresly, that no rationall man can
doubt of the sense of them.</p>
               <p>10. My second request to English Protestants
is, that they would take into consideration how
(after that a Catholique would be so liberall,
as to allow them this ground) they would be
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46209:157"/>
able, and by what rules, to distinguish points
unnecessary from necessary: for though it were
true that all necessary points are plain, yet all
plain points are not necessary. 3. That for
a more particular tryall, they would resolve
with themselves, whether the Mysteries of
<hi>the eternall Godhead,</hi> and Incarnation of
our Saviour, be not necessary to be believed;
if so, (as the English Articles import) then
they may do well to take a survey of all the
Texts of Scripture, which <hi>Volkelius</hi> and <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
heap together to combat these mysteries,
and afterward conclude, whether only Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
being the Rule, and only private reason
the Judge, these mysteries be so plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
contained in Scripture, that no reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man can doubt of the sense of them, and
that there needs no interpreter to reconcile
them. 4. I would likewise desire <hi>them</hi> to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the places of Scripture which Catholiques
make use of, to build the <hi>authority of the
Church, and the Reall Presence</hi> (I name these,
because they are the principall grounds of their
separation.) Now when <hi>they</hi> have consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Texts for the former point, let them
take notice that they cannot produce <hi>one express
Text</hi> of Scripture against the authority of the
Church; and for the <hi>other point, whether</hi> the
Texts which Catholiques produce for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Presence,</hi> do not in the literall grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
sense say all that Catholiques believe;
and <hi>whether</hi> all that Protestants labour to
prove be not, that though <hi>Hoc est corpus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
as the words lye, be against them, yet
the <hi>sense hidden</hi> and figurative, which <hi>they</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:46209:158"/>
desire to force upon these words, is against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques.
And having considered these two
instances, let them upon Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi>
present grounds judge how they can satisfie
their own reason and conscience, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Scripture for themselves, and against at
least expresse words of Scripture for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
to make a separation from the whole
world.</p>
               <p>11. In the last place I desire them to speak
freely, whether if this be true, that to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
&amp; unambiguously set down in Scripture,
be a condition necessary to all necessary points
of Faith, there be indeed any points of faith
necessary, since there is scarce any one article of
the Creed which ha's not been, and is not at this
day questioned by many men, yea by whole
churches, in which are, and have been found
persons of great learning, subtilty, and as far as
the eys of men could judge, piety and vertue, as
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and
S. <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> of other Heretiques.
Now if they say they will not believe such te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of their adversaries probity, then the
controversies between Sects will become not
disputations, but calumniations and implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>12. To Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> fifth ground,

               <argument>
                  <p>An answer to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi>
sixth ground.</p>
                  <p>Of the use of Reason in Faith.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. TO the sixth ground, viz. <hi>That since no
proof can be made out of Scripture, nor
out of universall Tradition, that there is any
visible Judge of the sense of Scripture: and
since a mans reason is the only faculty and
principle capable of judging, therefore Reason
is the only judge of the sense of Scripture; but
this only for each mans own self, &amp;c.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
1. <hi>That</hi> his supposition of <hi>no visible
Judge</hi> is so far from being true, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ha's all the proofs imagineable, and in
the highest degree of assurance imagineable, if
Tradition universall for time and place, plain
Texts of Scripture interpreted by all Fathers
that have written upon them, the continuall
practise of the Church in Councells &amp;c. can
give a certain proof, as I have shewed before.
2. For private reason being a judge, I will
shew the impossibility for it to attain the ends
for which Christ appointed a government in
his Church, (viz. unity of minds and wills
among Christians) together with the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
absurdities attending such a Judge; and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46209:159"/>
this, after I have considered briefly the rest of
his grounds. 3. In this place I will take into
consideration the generall foundation of this his
foundation, viz. <hi>That no other judge, as to a
mans own self, besides his own reason, can be
imagined, chap. 2. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. This foundation Mr.</hi> Chillingworth <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems
so firm, that upon all occasion he objects
it to his adversary, and places his chiefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in it; both as a sword to wound his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and a buckler to defend himself: for
thus, and in this</hi> order he <hi>argues. 1.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
I do in matter of Religion, I do it by
mine own particular reason, and resolve it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
into mine own reason. And this is not
only my method, but the same is done likewise
by all sorts of men, even those that deny pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
reason to be judge, deny this by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and because their reason tells them that
it is more reasonable to rely upon authority,
then upon their private judgement or reason.
&amp;c. 2. The difference between a Papist and a
Protestant is, not that the one judges, and the
other does not judge, but that the one judges
his guide to be infallible, the other his way to
be manifest. 3. To speak properly, <hi>saith he,</hi>
The Scripture is not a judge of controversies,
but a rule only, and the only rule for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to judge them by; every man is to judge for
himself by the judgment of discretion, and to
chuse either his Religion first, and then his
Church, as we say: Or as you, his Church first,
and then his Religion: but by the consent of
both sides every man is to judge and chuse. <hi>This
appeared to me to be the substance of Mr.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth's
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46209:159"/>
                  <hi>discourses severally dispersed in his
book upon this argument,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I confesse this way of arguing of Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> had a long time great effect
with me; and after considering it more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
I found that of necessity there must be
some <hi>Sophisme</hi> in it, because it makes all parties
most contradictory to one another, yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
their beliefs into the same point, which
notwithstanding they utterly deny, it was long
before, to mine own satisfaction, I could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the secret; and now after all, I find not
the least difficulty how to expresse my self di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
and intelligibly in my answer to it:
notwithstanding I will endeavour to do it as
perspicuously as I can.</p>
               <p>4. For preparation therefore hereto, I will
first shew what faith or belief is, and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kinds and manners of it, together with the
order how it is begotten in the soul, &amp;c.
Now I only speak of a <hi>rationall</hi> and well
grounded faith, not such an one, as with which
many ignorant or interessed persons assent, that
is, rather with their wills and passions,
then their reason or understanding. 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe</hi>
therefore in generall is an assent of the
understanding to any thing related to us; and
this for the authority of the relator: So S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin.
(de util. cred. c. 2.) That we believe any
thing, we owe it to authority; that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
any thing, to reason.</hi> 2. Belief is <hi>immediate,</hi>
or <hi>mediate: immediate,</hi> when the prime relatour
reveals it immediately to the believer: <hi>mediate,</hi>
when by the intervention of others. 3. <hi>Beliefe
certain</hi> or <hi>probable is either,</hi> when we have a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46209:160"/>
certainty or probability of the prime relators
authority or fidelity; or else, though we be
assured of the prime authors fidelity, when we
have a certainty or probability of the authority,
fidelity and information of the subordinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator.
4. Belief <hi>supernaturall</hi> is, when the
prime relator is supernaturall, and also when
the object is supernaturall: I might add, and
which is begotten in the soul by a <hi>supernaturall
vertue</hi> (but that is not debated here.) 5. The
order an manner whereby an assured firm su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
faith is begotten in the soul, is, <hi>first,</hi>
in <hi>immediate divine revelations,</hi> the prime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
reveals any thing to the believers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
by the intervention of his outward
or inward senses, in mediate divine revelations;
when this is done by means of some persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with authority and ability; so that before
firm faith in the thing revealed, there must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
precede a certain knowledge that such a
thing ha's been revealed. 6. <hi>Discourse of
reason</hi> may, and ordinarily does precede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
but belief it self is not discourse, but a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
assent of the understanding. 7. In beliefe
we are to distinguish between the <hi>causes,</hi> and
the <hi>motives</hi> of it: and when men speak of the
<hi>last resolution of faith,</hi> they intend to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the last <hi>motive</hi> or authority into which it is
resolved, not the primary <hi>efficient cause</hi> of it.
Therefore though faith be an act of reason,
yet it is not said to be resolved into reason,
though produced by it, but into authority. 8. It
is a meer <hi>tantology</hi> to say, the act of faith is
terminated in reason, because reason judges
that it is reasonable to believe God: For that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46209:160"/>
seems all one, as if a man should say; an act of
reason is an act of reason, or a reasonable act;
and indeed otherwise it would be impossible
to terminate faith ultimately in God, but a
man should believe God, not for Gods autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
sake, but his own. 9. The use of reason
antecedent to faith, and act of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in assenting to a thing revealed for the
authority of God the revealer, do not prejudice
neither the supernaturalnesse, nor certainty of
Faith; because the same things have place in
any revelation, though made immediately by
God; for it is with my senses that I receive
the thing revealed, and convey it to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
it is with my understanding that I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to it, and the reason why I assent to it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is most reasonable to believe God, yet
none of these things diminish either the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturality,
or absolute certainty of this belief.</p>
               <p>5. But to come to a more particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> Positions. 1. <hi>He</hi>
argues that private reason ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Judge of controversies, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Scripture, <hi>because whatsoever we do in
Religion, we do it by our particular reason; yea,
even those that deny private reason to be a
Judge do this, because their reason tells them
this is more reasonable, &amp;c.</hi> It is confessed
that Faith is an act of reason, that is, of the
reasonable faculty of the soule; and that it is
the same faculty of reason which submits and
captivates it self to divine or Ecclesiasticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
for as to be Gods slave is the greatest
liberty, so to renounce carnall reason when
God commands it is most reasonable. It is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46209:161"/>
moreover confessed, that in such a case, when
reason with submission to God captivates it
self, and renounces all discourses of reason that
would oppose such an a bnegation of it self, that
it does this from a rationall principle, viz. that
it is most reasonable to believe and submit to
God, who is veracity it self. But what will
follow from hence? Will any one therefore
either be so unreasonable, as to conclude, that
divine faith is ultimately resolved into reason, as
into the motive of assenting? (it is indeed the
efficient cause producing the act of assent, but
the last and principall motive is divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)
or that divine revelations are to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and exacted according to the rule and
principles of naturall reason, thereby either to
stand or fall? Or lastly, that when reason
judges it reasonable to receive the sense of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations from the Church endewed
with authority for that purpose, Reason in
that case shall be called the interpreter or
judge?</p>
               <p>6. In the second place, where <hi>he</hi> sayes, <hi>The
difference between a Papist and a Protestant is
this, not that the one judges, and the other
judges not:</hi> (Thus far I grant;) <hi>But that the
one judges his guide to be infallible, the other
his way to be manifest.</hi> To this I answer, that
here are two judges, 1. a <hi>Catholique,</hi> and his
judgement is, that his guide is <hi>infallible,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speaking in his guides language, that
<hi>she ha's authority to direct him.</hi> This is true,
but not all that is true; for he judges of his
way too, namely that that way and rule, by
which, and in which, his guide sets and directs
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46209:161"/>
him is manifest. And he judges of this more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
then a <hi>Protestant</hi> can, because the same
that God appointed to be his guide, is both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with this rule, and an explainer of it
likewise to him, having not only words, but
sense delivered to her. 2. <hi>A Protestant Judge;</hi>
and his judgement is, that <hi>his way is manifest:</hi>
it is true he judges so, but how injudiciously,
hath been already shewn. But does he not judge
of <hi>his guide?</hi> or ha's he no <hi>guide</hi> to judge of?
Yes, that is himself, or his own reason, and
that he judges to be all sufficient, both for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and prudence. <hi>He</hi> that in interpreting
an <hi>Heathen Orator</hi> or <hi>Poet,</hi> would not trust his
own judgment, or adventure his reputation to
the world, without alledging authorities, by
which he might justifie his judgment: and much
more, <hi>he</hi> that in a tenure of land would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
submit his judgment to the authority of those
judges whom the Law ha's deputed, will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
trample upon all authority, upon
the traditionary interpretation of many ages, <hi>he</hi>
will despise Fathers and Councells, and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
eternall happinesse or misery upon his own
single judgment: and when all this is done,
will call it a judgment of reason and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>7. In the third place, <hi>To speak properly,</hi>
(saith he) <hi>the Scripture is not a Judge of
Controversies, but only a rule, &amp;c.</hi> This I
grant to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and withall, that he
is the first Protestant that I know of, that ha's
spoken properly in this point. But he adds, <hi>and
the only rule to judge them by.</hi> But the contrary
I think I have already proved. Yet before
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46209:162"/>
I leave this passage, I desire to be informed
what controversies are here spoken of; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whether concerning points necessary or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary?
surely not of necessary, for how
can there be controversies about such points, as
according to his belief are set down in Scripture
so plainly, that no reasonable man can doubt
of the sense of them? and if of unnecessary,
why will they confesse that they quarrell unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily?
It follows, <hi>Every man is to judge
for himself with the judgement of discretion:</hi>
This is true if the sense be, <hi>that</hi> it is by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of reason that he embraces and assents to
divine revelations: not that such revelations
are to be admitted or refused, according as they
are consonant or repugnant to the principles of
discourse of naturall reason. It follows: <hi>And
to chuse either his Religion first, and then his
Church, as we say.</hi> But what Church do <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
chuse, since (though in effect there
are infinite Churches among them separating
from, and damning one another; Yet) if the
grounds of Protestantisme be true and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
viz. 1. <hi>That</hi> the belief of necessary funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
doctrines is sufficient to make a true
Church. 2. <hi>Since</hi> all such points are so plainly
contained in Scripture, that no reasonable man
can doubt of the sense of them, much lesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
them. And 3. <hi>Since</hi> no <hi>Protestants</hi>
will deny, but that in all Churches (even the
Catholique also) there are reasonable men;
it will follow that they must say, that indeed
there is but one Religion and one Church, and
so no choice at all. It follows, <hi>Or as you Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,
his Church first, and then his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:46209:162"/>
For my part; I know no Catholique
sayes so, nor any reason that should move
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> to put such words in their
mouths. For if we speak of one that is yet to
chuse Christianity, and is in pain to find a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
to joyn himself to, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
such a Director as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
and <hi>a Catholique</hi> would be this: Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
would tell him,<q> 
                     <hi>Search</hi> the Scriptures at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by universall Tradition, as will appear
if you peruse all the Records since Christs
time; there you will find in it all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed and practised, but which,
and how many such things there are, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell you: besides, they are dispersed up
and down in <hi>Gospells, Acts, Epistles,</hi> and
<hi>Revelation;</hi> so that it will cost you much
trouble to collect all that are of the substance
of the new Covenant in yours and our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but to make short work, be sure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all in grosse, and then you shall be sure
to believe all that is necessary, and then chuse
what Church you will, for there can be no
danger, since all cannot but agree in necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
only there is some danger in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church, for she will oblige you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
other things as well as Scripture for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Traditions sake; and besides <hi>she</hi> will
not permit you to think your own self wiser
then the whole world. Or if you have the
curiosity to live in the purest Church of all,
then you must study all the obscure unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
passages of Scripture likewise (for such only
can be controverted among reasonable men)
and examine what every party ha's to say for
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46209:163"/>
himself, and then descend from your tribunall
of judging, and associate your self with them
that you think the wisest, that is, those that
agree with you in all your opinions, if there
be any such, and there stay, till either they
or you change opinions. <hi>But as for
Catholiques,</hi> to such a man that was to
chuse both Christianity and a Church, they
would first tell him, that by his reason he
might most certainly judge that this Religion
was taught by Christ and his Apostles, since
(besides Records) the universall agreement of
the present age was, that they received it from
an universall Tradition of former ages,
(which is a testimony beyond all others most
irrefragable.) 2. <hi>They</hi> would by the same way
assure him, that this Religion was by the first
teachers confirm'd with miracles; and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
upon examination both of those miracles,
and the sanctity of this Religion in generall,
would most assuredly conclude, that the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were divine, and by consequence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
too, and therefore necessary to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
since it self said so. 3. <hi>They</hi> would
upon the same undeniable grounds of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Tradition assure him, that among others,
one necessary duty of this Religion was, to
live in the Communion and under the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of such a Church, as Christ had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
should be Catholique for place, and never
to fail untill his coming to judgement, which
Church was one body consisting of a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of parts, among which by consequence,
one must needs be supreme, and from which
to separate, was to be divided from Christ
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46209:163"/>
himself; in this Church therefore he was to
fix himself inseparably: And here is to be an
end of his judging and chusing. For 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this Church, his Reason had no more
to do but to submit it self to the beliefe and
practise of the speciall doctrines and precepts,
which this Church should teach him. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
indeed he might have to search out inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of Scripture, yet so as that he must
not contradict any traditionary doctrines.
And he might draw consequences from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
so that he would give leave to the
church to judge whether such consequences
were rationall and fit to be received, abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from others that would not assent to his
consequences.</q> And this is the method accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which a Catholike would advise such a
man to proceed: thus much liberty of judging
he would allow to his reason before he did make
choice of a church; and only so much afterward.</p>
               <p>8. To these discourses Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
adds some proofs out of Scripture to justifie
Private Reason's pretention to judge of the
sense of Scripture: as first, those words of
S. <hi>Paul, 1 Thes. 1. 5. v. 20, 21. Try all things,
hold fast that which is good.</hi> But I answer,
here is no mention either of Scripture or church,
much lesse of interpreting Scripture against the
church: the truth is, there were extant scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
books of the New Testament when S. <hi>Paul</hi>
wrote that Epistle. But the words before speak
of <hi>Prophecyings</hi> in the church, which perhaps
S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have to be tryed whether they
were consonant to the doctrine which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the church. Now who was to be the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46209:164"/>
Judge of Prophets he shews in another place,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32. where he sayes, <hi>The spirits of
the Prophets are subject to the Prophets,</hi> not
to the ignorant people. A second proof is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be of God or no, 1. Joh.</hi> 4. 1. To
which the former answer will suffice. A third,
<hi>Be ye ready to render a reason of the hope that
is in you, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I cannot imagine how
from this Text this conclusion can be infer'd,
<hi>Ergo</hi> it belongs to all Christians to judge of
the sense of Scripture, even against the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Church. A fourth, <hi>If the blind
lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</hi>
All the inference that I could possibly draw
from this Text would be, <hi>therefore</hi> if men will
not believe their teachers, but either will rush
forward themselves, or follow others, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have <hi>authority</hi> nor <hi>ability</hi> to teach, they are
likely to fall into the Ditch. For surely by
<hi>blind</hi> are not meant the lawfull Pastours of the
Church, which on the contrary are in the Old
Testament called <hi>Videntes,</hi> or <hi>Seers,</hi> and by
S. <hi>Paul, eyes:</hi> when speaking of such persons
as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> here gives the office of
judging to, he saith, <hi>If the ear shall say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is
it therefore not of the body? If all the body
were the eye, where were the hearing, 1 Cor.</hi>
12. 16. Whereby S. <hi>Paul</hi> shews expressely that
the hearers ought not to usurp the teachers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
expressely contrary to Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi>
Position.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>9. I will conclude this discourse of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
exalting private reason against Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46209:164"/>
authority, with those memorable words
of S.</hi> Augustine (Ep. <hi>56.</hi>) Those, <hi>saith he,</hi> who
not being in Catholique Unity and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet notwithstanding do boastingly usurp
the name of Christians, are constrained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the true Believers, and have the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to seduce as it were by reasons the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and unskilfull, although that our Lord is
come with this preservative to ordain faith
unto the people. But this they are constrained
to do, as I said, because they perceive well,
that without this there is nothing more vile
and base then they are, if their authority be
compared with Catholique authority. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
therefore, as it were, to surmount the
most firmly setled and most stable authority of
the most surely founded Church, by the name
and promising of Reason; for this is as it were
an uniform and universall temerity of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.
But the most clement Commander and

               <p>1. TO the seventh ground, viz. <hi>That a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
infallible Faith is not required,
since reason, which is the only agent, is falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the grounds not evidently certain,
such a probability will serve the turn, as can
produce in a mar obedience, &amp;c.</hi> For answer
hereto, I desire Protestants to consider. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the first planting of Christianity proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grounds of belief had been sufficient? if
not, as most certainly not, how come they to
be sufficient now? If it be replied, that we must
either be content with probable grounds, or
none; I answer there is no such necessity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
for all the substantiall points of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
we have <hi>universall Tradition,</hi> and that
with all advantages for assurance imaginable:
insomuch, as if all men would call him mad,
that should deny that there was such a man as
<hi>King William the Conqueror of England,</hi>
which is yet attested only or principally by a
Nationall <hi>Tradition</hi> there, that man would
deserve a title worse then the former, that
could doubt of the universall testimony of the
<hi>Catholique Church</hi> all the world over, that such
<hi>Traditions</hi> have come to them from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
&amp;c. 2. I desire them to consider, <hi>what
course</hi> they will take to convert the <hi>now Jewes,</hi>
and <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> to Christianity, if they
shall once tell them, that they can give them no
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46209:165"/>
better then probable motives of our Religion?
For <hi>they</hi> will doubtlesse reply, <hi>that</hi> they will
never quit their own Religion, in which they
and their ancestors have been bred, and of the
truth of which they likewise have (at least in
their own <hi>opinion</hi>) a probable Tradition, for a
new one not assured. 3. To consider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the <hi>antient Jewes:</hi> For if those very
persons, who were eye-witnesses of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
delivery of the Law, and by consequence
were most assured of the <hi>divinity</hi> of it, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
would not quit temporal pleasures
and allurements for the future rewards therein
promised; is it likely, that the Christians of
these times will upon confessedly only probable
grounds and promises, and those not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
till after death, renounce assured and
present delights, and embrace assured and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
miseries, mortifications, and abnegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>2. To the eighth and last ground, viz. <hi>That
since all Christians agree in necessary doctrines,
which are expresse, they ought not to deny Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
the one to the other, for other doctrines
contained obscurely in Scripture; and that
that is the only effectuall means of reducing
and preserving unity among Christians.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>that</hi> it is apparently contrary to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
what is here said; For neither do all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
agree in all necessary doctrines: nor in
all which themselves esteem necessary: neither
will they allow Communion to men differing
in points by their own Confession nor esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so much as substantiall. Yea let <hi>England</hi>
witnesse, if our <hi>Presbyterian Calvinists</hi> do not
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46209:166"/>
think many thousand <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of Christian
bloud, a fit sacrifice to prepare a tyrannicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of a few circumstantiall novelties:
Therefore to say men ought, and it were well
if they would do otherwise; and in the mean
time destroy all Ecclesiasticall authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them to what they ought to do, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all <hi>Christian Communion,</hi> indeed all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>society:</hi> For upon the same
grounds we may as reasonably contend for an
universall <hi>Anarchy,</hi> since all men ought by the
law of reason and nature to live in justice, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and peace; and therefore let lawes be
annulled, and Judges deposed. But <hi>God</hi> (whose
imprudence is wiser then the wisdome of men)
seeing our <hi>figmentum,</hi> our naturall perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
hath appointed <hi>Civill Governours</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verawe
Delinquents with the whip, and with
the sword; and <hi>Ecclesiasticall Magistrates</hi>
likewise, into whose hands <hi>he</hi> ha's likewise put
a spirituall scourge and sword too, to correct
or cut off putrified or mortified members: the
whole foundation of which <hi>Policy</hi> and order
would be undermined by such an allowance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to all sorts of <hi>Christians</hi> to become judges
and interpreters for themselves in matters of
Religion, upon a groundless and never-yet-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
hope, that they will all agree
to use this power with meeknesse and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>3. Besides, let all the world judge of the
extreme <hi>partiality</hi> of <hi>English Protestants,
they</hi> say that no man ought to refuse Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for differences in points in themselves not
necessary or fundamentall; and they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46209:166"/>
that Catholiques agree with them in all
points fundamentall; and yet they not only
refuse to communicate with them, but call
their Communion damnable and <hi>Idololatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call:</hi>
Yea moreover seek to justifie the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the most bloudy lawes against Catholike
Priests performing their duties, that ever any
<hi>Christian Nation heard of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> indeed maintains this
their partiality of refusing Communion with
Catholiques upon this ground, because no man
can be allowed by the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
into <hi>Catholique Communion</hi> that believes
not all doctrines of faith therein defined to be
of <hi>universall Tradition,</hi> many of which they
disbelieving ought not, or if they would, cannot
be received into Communion. Hereto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
1. That the <hi>Bull of Pius the fourth</hi>
requires subscription to the Councell only from
Priests, &amp;c. 2. Can any antient Church be
named that ha's not alwaies done the same?
3. Do not the <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> yea the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> both before and since the
writing of his book the same? 4. Does not the
omission of requiring an uniform profession
of Faith, evidently destroy all Ecclesiasticall
authority, and leave every one in a liberty (hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
unheard of in Gods Church) of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and believing, and judging, and saying,
and doing what he himself pleases? 5. The
unappealable authority of a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
being once destroyed, would not <hi>Babel</hi> it
self, and the seventy languages of it (as some
reckon them) be order and unity it self in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
with a <hi>Christian Church</hi> so confused
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46209:167"/>
and mangled, wherein not seventy, but seventy
thousand languages might be allowed? For as
for this <hi>phantasticall Utopian way of Unity</hi>
here first devised and proposed to the world by
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> let even the most ignorant
of his judges give sentence; whether as long
as men have passions, and as long as there is
pride in their hearts, and tentations in the
world, it be not utterly impossible to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed?
and if upon an impossible supposition
it were effected, whether such a kind of unity
would deserve the name of <hi>unity,</hi> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of an universall <hi>stupidity</hi> and <hi>Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie?</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>An answer to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
concerning difference among
Catholiques, about the Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. HAving thus far considered Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's</hi>
generall grounds concerning a
Judge of Controversies dispersed in severall
places through his book, I will proceed to take a
view of his principal objections against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
doctrine concerning the authority of the
Church; which objections are of severall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
for some proceed directly against it,
others only against some consequences from
it. I will therefore weigh first his objections
grounded upon the different opinions of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46209:167"/>
concerning that point. 2. His reasons
directly proving (as he believes, that no church
of one denomination can be infallible) and
therefore not the Catholique Church. 3. His
proofs that Catholiques in their resolution of
Faith are entangled in circles and, absurdities.
4. His arguments to demonstrate that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
can have no assurance, either of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the church, or the validity of any
acts performed by the Pastors thereof, &amp;c. But
before I attempt a discussion of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
I may in generall say of all his objections,
that since they proceed only against the word
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> and that word extended to the
utmost height and latitude that it can possibly
bear, Catholiques, as such, are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in them, seeing neither is that expression
to be found in any received Councell, nor did
ever the Church enlarge her authority to so vast
a widenesse as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
or at least, for his particular advantage
against his adversary, thought good to make
show, as if he conceived so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. But come we to consider his arguments
against Catholiques, grounded upon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
opinions among them in what subject this</hi>
Infallibility <hi>or authority is to be placed. The
most pressing and pertinent passage in his book
concerning this subject is this which follows,
viz.</hi> What shall we say now if you be not agreed
touching your pretended means of agreement?
How can you pretend to unity either actuall or
potentiall more then Protestants may? Some
of you say the Pope alone without a Councell
may determine all controversies, but others
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46209:168"/>
deny it. Some that a Generall Councell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Pope may do so, others deny this. Some,
both inconjunction are infallible determiners,
others againe deny this. Lastly, some among
you hold the acceptation of the decrees of
Councells by the universall Church to be the
only way to decide controversies, which others
deny by denying the Church to be infallible.
And indeed what way of ending controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
can this be, when either part may pretend
that they are part of the Church, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not the decree, therefore the whole
Church hath not received it? Mr. Chil. c. <hi>3.</hi>
parag. <hi>6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Hereto I answer. 1. That there is indeed
no need at all of an answer, since the very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
answers it self: for by saying there are
variety of opinions among Catholiques, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
for such even while they differ, it
follows that the objector is not obliged to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to that Judge which any Catholique refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
2. None of these will deny that <hi>decision</hi>
of the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> viz. <hi>Ecclesiae est judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

de vero sensu sacrae Scripturae,</hi> (that is,)
<hi>It belongs to the Church to judge of the true
sense of holy Scripture:</hi> And Protestants will
not be urged to submit to any more rigid or
higher expression. 3. Yea moreover, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
I am confident, will be granted them,
namely, That no man will endeavour to oblige
them further then to doctrines and practises
determined by one or more <hi>Councells univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
confirmed by the Pope,</hi> and actually recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and accepted by all Catholiques, <hi>that is as
much as to say,</hi> to believe that there is indeed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46209:168"/>
                  <hi>an obliging authority in the Catholike Church,</hi>
to impose upon her children a belief of all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
proposed in her <hi>Oecumenicall Councells,</hi>
let this authority be <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>streightned</hi>
with as many <hi>Proviso's,</hi> and the sense of these
doctrines enlarged and qualified with as many
mollifying interpretations, as any approved
Catholike Doctor hath thought good, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as any reasonable man remaining so can
desire; only upon <hi>condition,</hi> that they do not
prejudice nor grate upon the pure simple lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

<hi>Christians</hi> are at liberty what particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors

none at all, but will content themselves with the

to be infallible, answered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. <hi>IN the second place we will weigh his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to prove that no Church of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
is</hi> infallible, <hi>and by consequence
no Church at all. His words
are, after he had said that he</hi>
was willing upon courtesie to
grant that Christ made a
promise <hi>(absolute)</hi> of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibility
to his Church,<note place="margin">Mr. Chil. c. 2. parag. 139. &amp;c. 3. per tot. &amp;c.</note> but
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46209:169"/>
be interprets it only in this sense, <hi>viz.</hi> That
true Religion shall never be so far driven out
of the world, but that it shall alwaies have
some where or other some that believe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it in all things necessary to salvation, and
that such believers shall never erre in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls,
for if they did, they were not a
Church. But he denyes utterly that there is
any Church fit to be a guide in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
because no Church is fit to be a Guide
but onely a Church of some certaine denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as the Greek, the Roman, the Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine,
&amp;c. For, <hi>sayes he,</hi> otherwise no man can
possibly know which is the true Church but by a
pre-examination of the doctrine controverted,
and that were not to be guided by the Church
to the true doctrine, but by the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to the Church. Now, sayes he, that
there is not any Church of one denomination
infallible in fundamnntalls is evident: for
1. If it were an infallible guide in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls,
she would be infallible in all things
which she proposes and requires to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
2. That being a point of so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
certainly the Scripture would have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that Church. 3. Because Catholiques
themselves build the assurance of the churches
infallibility onely upon motives very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but not certain. Lastly, beeause it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and even to impudence it selfe undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that upon this ground of believing all
things taught by the present church as taught
by Christ, errour was held. For example, the
necessity of giving the Eucharist to Infants,
and that in S. <hi>Augustines</hi> time, and that by
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46209:169"/>
S. Augustine himself; and therefore without
controversie this is no certain ground for truth
which may support falshood as well as truth.
The same may be said of the doctrine of the
Chiliasts, which S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and S. <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
say was a traditionary doctrine from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. To answer this discourse by parcells:
And first concerning his exposition of <hi>Christ's
promise of indefectibility to his Church,</hi> it
ha's been answered in more then one place
already. 2. Where he sayes, that there is no
Church fit to be a guide in fundamentalls: I
desire to know whether those whom Christ ha's
appointed in his church to be <hi>Overseers</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>
&amp;c.)</hi> be not fit to be accounted guides, at least
in Fundamentalls? Againe, whether an
agreement of all these <hi>Governours</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Generall Councell be not the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premest
authority? Thirdly, whether that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which is indeed supreme, be not unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealable
from, and necessarily to be submitted
to by all particular subordinate persons? To
say such persons have no authority to be
Guides, is to contradict expresse Scripture:
And to say that there can be a subordination
of authority without one that is supreme:
Or that that which is indeed supreme, may
by particulars (persons, or churches) be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
or so much as appealed from, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
not onely what is assumed, but evident
reason, and all order. 3. Where it is said,
<hi>That no Church is fit to be a Guide in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46209:170"/>
but only a Church of one denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as Greek, Roman, Abyssine, &amp;c. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
no man can possibly know which is the
true Church, but only by a pre-examination of
the doctrines, and that were not to be guided
by the Church to the true doctrine, but by the
true doctrine to the Church.</hi> I answer, That
a Catholique Church there is (as we profess in
the Creed) and that this Catholique Church is
visible and easily to be designed, plainly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishable
from new Sects and innovating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations;
and that this body representatively
united is the supreme authority on earth, and
that every particular Church or member of this
Catholique Church, as such, is a sufficient guide
to those that live in her Communion. As
concerning his phrase, <hi>a Church of one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;</hi>
I grant that God ha's not apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged himself to confine his Promises to
any particular <hi>Dioecose, Province,</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi>
no not perhaps even to <hi>Rome</hi> it self: Only this
may certainly be affirmed, that the Catholique
Church shall by vertue of Christs promises
continue to the worlds end a visible Church,
teaching all substantiall doctrines of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
guided by a lawfull succession of Pastors,
under one visible Head, which visible Head ha's
hitherto for above sixteen Centuries been the
Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that is a fair presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that it will be so to Christs second coming:
for I know nothing but a generall earthquake
there and swallowing up of that place that is
likely to hinder such a succession, since it ha's
already abidden all variety of oppositions and
tempests, when the whole power of the Roman
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46209:170"/>
and infernall Empire sought to extinguish it,
and when all sorts of Heretiques and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
sought to undermine it. But I shall
speak more of this when I come to the last
conclusion, concerning the perpetuall visibility
of the Church.</p>
               <p>4. In the fourth place, to his first proofe,
<hi>that no Church of one denomination can be an
infallible guide in fundamentalls, because if
so, then she should be infallible in non-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls
also.</hi> I answer, that even by Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth's</hi>
own confession it does not follow
that if Christ hath promised to preserve his
church from all errour in fundamentalls, that
therefore by vertue of that promise she should be
exempted from all errour whatsoever, and the
reason given by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> is worth
the marking. <hi>The Church,</hi> sayes he, <hi>may erre,
and yet the gates of hell not prevaile against
her: for seeing you</hi> (Catholiques) <hi>do and must
grant that a particular Church may hold some
errour, and yet be still a true member of the
Church; Why may not the universall Church
bold the same errour, and yet remain the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Church, unlesse every the least errour
be one of the gates of hell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And indeed many Catholique <hi>Writers</hi>
there are, who, upon the same grounds with
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> extend the promise of the
holy Spirits assistance to the church, not to all
inconsiderable circumstantiall doctrines, but
substantiall and traditionary only; And for a
further proof we may add, that there are some
Fathers of great <hi>antiquity</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> who
hold (whether justly and truly or no, I debate
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46209:171"/>
not, but they hold) that there are reall differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
between the <hi>four Evangelists,</hi> in some cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of no considerable moment related
by them, and by consequence there must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<hi>in their opinion</hi> be an errour, such as it
is, in some one of them at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ast: The which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
differences, whether <hi>reall</hi> or <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,</hi>
there being an exact demonstrable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
amongst them all in points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
do rather in S. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> judgement
(<hi>in Mat. Hom.</hi> 1) establish then invalidate, or
any way prejudice the <hi>divine infallibility of
their writings;</hi> since thereby it is apparent
(sayes he) that they did not compose them by
consent and conspiracy; for then they would
have been scrupulously punctuall in all, even
the smallest circumstances, but in the <hi>ingenuous
simplicity</hi> and <hi>sincerity of their hearts.</hi> In like
manner S. <hi>Hierome</hi> tells us, that in his time
some learned <hi>Catholiques</hi> were of <hi>opinion,</hi> that
the Apostles and Evangelists in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
quoted some passages of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Septuagint meerly out of their
memory, not looking into the books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that by that means their memory
failing, their quotations were not exactly true,
yet notwithstanding those Fathers were far
from questioning the <hi>authority</hi> or <hi>infallibility</hi>
of any one of the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> as concerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
substantiall doctrine contained in any of
their Gospells, &amp;c. So likewise in the <hi>Latin</hi>
Translation of the <hi>Bible,</hi> there are not only
differences of senses from <hi>Originalls, Hebrew,</hi>
or <hi>Greek</hi> now extant, not only great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
variety of reading in the antient <hi>Latin
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46209:171"/>
Copies,</hi> but likewise, as the <hi>Protestants</hi> brag,
very great diversity between the <hi>Impressions</hi>
published by the <hi>Authority of Pope Sixtus
Quintus</hi> and <hi>Clemens Octavus,</hi> since the
<hi>Councell of Trent</hi> (wherein notwithstanding
they are mistaken, for though <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi>
had design'd an <hi>Impression,</hi> and prepared a <hi>Bull</hi>
for the authorizing of it, yet God took him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
before he effected his intent, thereby as it
were, signifying that it was his pleasure to take
away from <hi>Heretiques</hi> all seeming advantages
against his Church. But though this had been
as the <hi>Protestants imagine,</hi> surely a more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
reimpression does not imply that the
<hi>Church</hi> wanted the true Scripture, since none of
such differences are of such considerable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to cause any uncertainty in points of
Doctrine. For I conceive it was never heard
that any errour was grounded meerly upon a
various reading of any Text of Scripture.) But
to proceed, certain it is that there were much
greater differences between the antient <hi>Italica</hi>
and other <hi>Latin Translations</hi> of the antient
Church and this of S. <hi>Hierome;</hi> as likewise yet
greater between the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew;</hi>
and yet neither do the Apostles refuse to
quote some passages out of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>
wherein the Translation is manifestly faulty,
however in a matter inconsiderable: neither
will any Catholique affirm that the promise of
the holy Spirits assistance did fail the antient
Church, although it only made use of a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of the Scripture very imperfect, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with S. <hi>Hieromes;</hi> no not though upon
such differences of reading it were possible to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46209:172"/>
ground doctrines which might be circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
erroneous: It is true, such doctrines
would be of no considerable moment; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they might be erroneous, yet without any
prejudice to Christs promises to his Church.
So that the Church, even when she does upon
supposition erre, yet she does not even then lead
any man out of the way to heaven, or within
the danger of hell gates; seeing the promises of
Christ are <hi>infallible</hi> that his <hi>Spirit</hi> shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
or rather preserve his Church in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and profession of all truths, at least necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
and as for points supernumerary or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
neither unwilfull ignorance, nor una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
mistake shall be imputed as sinfull to
any man.</p>
               <p>6. To the second proof, viz. <hi>That if the
promise of infallibility had been made to any
Church of one denomination, certainly the
Scripture would have named that Church, and
have directed all Christians to have recourse
unto her, it being a point of so main impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
I answer, 1. The inference is not at all
concluding, as I shewed before in the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
2. The Scripture ha's expressely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
such promises made to the Church, and
if we will follow either reason or <hi>Catholique
Tradition</hi> interpreting Scripture, we must at
least apply those promises to the whole body
and succession of the Catholique Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under one Head; since no particular man
or Church, considered only as a distinct member
of the whole can pretend to these promises as
peculiarly applicable to themselves. Now this
whole body was as apparent and distinguishable
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46209:172"/>
from particular sects in the times of S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
and S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> as if it had been a Church of
one denomination, since they framed all their
arguments and discourses from the apparent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of it: and surely to any one that would
not shut his eyes, would have appeared as clear
and demonstrable in <hi>Luthers</hi> time also.</p>
               <p>7. To the third proof of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
viz. <hi>That Catholiques build their assurance of
the infallibility of the Church only upon falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and uncertain grounds and marks.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that I have made the contrary appear in
severall places before, demonstrating that it is
grounded upon the most firm unshaken foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
that reason can have, viz. <hi>Universall
Tradition,</hi> by which it is more effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
then any particular book of Scripture hath been.</p>
               <p>8. To his last proof against the Churches
<hi>infallibility</hi> from his two examples, wherein
the Church is said to have erred universally in
points pretended to be of <hi>Tradition,</hi> as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
about the giving the blessed Sacrament to
Infants, mentioned by S. <hi>Augustine;</hi> and the
doctrine of the <hi>Millenaries;</hi> by S. <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
and S. <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> For the first example, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my self to the satisfactory answer given by
<hi>Cardinall Perron</hi> to the same objection made
by King <hi>James. Perr. repl. l. 2. obs. 3. c.</hi> 11.
2. Concerning the <hi>other example of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Millenaries,</hi> &amp;c. I answer, that
S. <hi>Justin Martyr (dial. cum Trypho.)</hi> saith not
that it was a <hi>Catholique Tradition,</hi> nor received
by the whole Church, but only of himself, and
<hi>many other Christians;</hi> but withall, that there
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46209:173"/>
                  <hi>were many also who were of a pure and pious
Christian beliefe which did not acknowledge
it.</hi> And when all that could be alledged to
prove that doctrine to have been an <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Tradition,</hi> was said, the proof ended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the report of <hi>Papias,</hi> a very credulous man,
one that loved to tell stories, many of which
could not find belief in the Church, a man
meanely learned, and by consequence one
that might very probably mistake what
he sayes S. <hi>John</hi> told him concerning that
point.</p>

                  <p>An answer to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of circles and absurdities to
the resolution of Faith of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. A Third rank of arguments with which
Mr.</hi> Chillingworth <hi>combats the</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
<hi>of the Church, is grounded upon
the absurdities, Meanders and circles, which he
sayes most unavoidably follow the resolution of
the faith of Catholiques. Let us hear the sum
of his allegations in his own words,</hi> (cap. <hi>2. 118.
119.)</hi> For Gods sake (Sir) tell me plainly,
in those Texts of Scripture which you alledge
for the infallibility of your Church, do not you
allow what sense you think true, and disallow
the contrary? and do you not this by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of your private reason? if you do, why do
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46209:173"/>
you condemn it in others? If you do not, I
pray what direction do you follow? Or whether
you follow none at all? If none at all, this is
like drawing Lots, or throwing dice for the
choice of a Religion: If any other, I beseech
you tell me what it is. Perhaps you will say, the
churches authority; and that will be to dance
finely in a round thus; To believe the Churches
infallible authority, because the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch
it; and to believe that Scriptures say
and mean so, because they are so expounded by
the Church. Is not this for a Father to beget
his son, and the son to beget his Father? For a
foundation &amp;c. The Church you say is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible;
I am very doubtfull of it. How
shall I know it? The Scripture you say
affirmes it, as in the <hi>59.</hi> of <hi>Esay,</hi> My Spirit
that is in thee, &amp;c. Well I confesse I find
there these words, but I am still doubtfull
whether they be spoken of the Church of Christ:
and if they be, whether they meane as you
pretend. You say, the Church sayes so, which
is infallible. Yea but that is the question, and
therefore not to be begged, but proved: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it so evident as to need no proof; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
why brought you this Text to prove it?
Nor is it of such a strange quality above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Propositions, as to be able to prove it self.
What then remains, &amp;c. But Universal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(you say, and so do I too) is of it self credible,
and that ha's in all ages taught the churches
infallibility with full consent. But that it
ha's, I hope you would not have me take upon
your word; for that were to build my self upon
the Church, and the Church upon you. Let then
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46209:174"/>
the Tradition appear; for a secret Tradition is
somewhat like a silent Thunder. You will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
produce &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. For answer hereto: 1. If Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's
adversary</hi> had grounded the doctrine
of the Churches authority meerly and only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Texts of Scripture capable of contrary
senses, there might have been just ground for
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> to have pleased himself, as
he oft does, in insulting thus on him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling
him thus in his circles: But Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>
himself absolves him toward the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of the former passage, where he sayes;
<hi>But universall Tradition (you say, and so do
I too) is of it selfe credible, and that ha's
in all ages taught the Churches infallibility,
&amp;c.</hi> Whereby he shews clearly that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
though he serves himself, (as reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he may and ought) of some Texts of
Scripture to fortifie the Traditionary doctrine
of the Churches authority, yet makes not those
Texts understood in his own sense his onely
foundation, but <hi>universall Tradition,</hi> which is
the proper foundation even of the credibility
of Scripture it self; and therefore all Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth's</hi>
inferences and retortions do not,
even in his own <hi>opinion,</hi> in any degree wound,
nor so much as incommodate his adversary.</p>
               <p>3. Secondly I answer, that whatsoever argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have been or can be made by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
against the manner of <hi>Resolution of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Faith,</hi> do not touch the Church at all;
since she ha's not intermedled in that Scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
nicety of the Resolution of Faith: If par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men to exercise their wits, and to boast
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46209:174"/>
their subtilty, do busie themselves in this last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
age about such curiosities, undebated
and unheard of among the antient Doctors of
the church, what is that to the church her self,
or her Traditionary doctrines, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and believed before that new language of
the schools was invented?</p>
               <p>4. But thirdly to demonstrate that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
do vainly flatter themselves in supposed
advantages against Catholiques about this point
of <hi>Resolution of Faith,</hi> I will endeavour as
briefly and as perspiouously as I can to set down
the state of that controversie, which when I have
done, I believe that without any further trouble,
it will justifie it self not to be obnoxious to
those circles and absurdities which Protestants
charge upon it.</p>
               <p>5. Now for a preparation thereto, I will
lay down these grounds, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> That that is the
thing into which we say Faith is last resolved,
which is the prime motive or authority for
whose sake we believe. 2. In all kinds of
belief the prime authority which deserves Faith
must have two <hi>qualities,</hi> viz. <hi>Knowledge</hi> and
<hi>veracity.</hi> 3. In divine Faith the prime autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is alwaies the prime Verity, or God. 4. In
divine Revelations we are to distinguish the
faith or assent which we give to the truth reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the knowledge or assent to the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or act of revealing. 5. In immediate
<hi>divine Revelations</hi> we believe the truth it self
for the authority of the revealer or relator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which is God: and we assent to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
having a certain knowledge thereof,
either by the help of our senses externall and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46209:175"/>
internall, or without them immediately by our
understanding. 6. But if divine revelations
be conveyed to us by a second hand, that is, by
the report of others, yet then faith is not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the conveying authority, but into the
prime. 7. To make faith by vertue of the prime
authority certain or firm, I must have assurance
of the certitude of this conveying hand, that is,
not only that this conveying hand did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
those revealed truths, but the true
sense of them likewise, and withall was
not subject to errour in the propagating of
them.</p>
               <p>6. Having laid these grounds, we will make
application of them to the present purpose in a
few examples. The first shall be of a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made by God immediately either by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
language, or dreams, or visions, or the
Oracle of Urim, &amp;c.</hi> (for all these are of the
same nature, as much as concerns certainty)
as when God revealed to the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
the <hi>mystery of the Conception of the Messiah of
a pure Virgin:</hi> In this case the Prophet <hi>(it is</hi>
to be supposed) was assured by a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that this revelation was reall, and not
imaginary: so that he believed the truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
with a most firm faith for the authority
of God the prime verity, whom he knew to be
the revealer; for if he had not assuredly
known this, he could not have adhered firmly
to the mystery; though in it selfe never so
true and infallible. A second example shall
be of an immediate revelation also, but yet
somewhat of a different nature from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<hi>viz.</hi> Of our Saviour teaching the Jewes
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46209:175"/>
that he was <hi>the Messiah, the eternall Sonne of
God,</hi> and confirming this truth by <hi>divine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi>
In all outward appearance he seemed
to be but a man, and therefore what he taught
could not be the object of <hi>divine Faith,</hi> neither
could his hearers have assurance of his <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
unlesse they were assured of the truth of
his miracles. <hi>A third example</hi> shall be of the
same revealed truth, viz. <hi>That Christ was the
Messiah, &amp;c.</hi> but proposed to persons living in
the second or third ages after that time, by
those, who either were themselves eye-witnesses,
or received it from those that were. In this case
the persons, living in the second or third age, if
they had not certitude that those that told them
this did not lye, could not with a <hi>faith ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
firm and certaine,</hi> assent to those truths.
But certain they might be, and most undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
were: and the grounds of this certainty
were, as I have largely shewed before, a certain
knowledge both that they all heard these
and all other substantiall truths of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
from their Ancestors, as a <hi>Tradition Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall</hi>
(whether written or no, it matters not)
and that it was as impossible, that all their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
all the world over should conspire to
seduce them with a lie, as that their own eyes
and ears should deceive them In all these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
there is the same resolution of Faith; for both
the immediate witnesses of these revelations and
their successors do resolve their faith in these su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
truths finally and only into the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of the prime verity; For if any of them
should be asked, Why do you believe that
<hi>Christ is the eternall Son of God?</hi> They would
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46209:176"/>
all answer, because God ha's so revealed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could they proceed any further: But if they
were asked, how are you certain that there was
such a <hi>divine revelation?</hi> the immediate wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
would say, We saw and heard <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
publishing these truths, and with a world of
stupendious miracles confirming them: And
their successours would say, we receive the same
truth by an <hi>Universall Tradition,</hi> not only in
it self, and of it self credible, and in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
certain, but such an one as ha's more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to demonstrate its certainty, then any
other that ever was. Now what ha's been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third ages,</hi> may upon the
same grounds be verified of the <hi>fourth, fifth,</hi>
and all following to the worlds end. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
what hath been exemplified in one or two
supernaturall truths revealed, may be extended
to all the substantiall points of <hi>Christianity,</hi>
all which, as I before demonstrated, arrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us by the same conveying hand of <hi>Universall
Tradition</hi> by severall wayes, as writing, publike
profession and practise propagated.</p>
               <p>7. Now among these truths or doctrines
coming by <hi>Universall Tradition,</hi> (and for that
reason believed most assuredly by all <hi>Catholique
Christians,</hi> and by consequence most certaine
and indubitable) one principall one is <hi>the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the present Church,</hi> considered not
as a relator only, but as authorized by Christ
to teach this and all other doctrines, so as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
all men to belief and obedience: Which
speciall doctrine, though it were only testified
in Scripture (as it is evidently enough) were
sufficient against those that acknowledge only
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46209:176"/>
Scripture for their rule: yet we are certain of
the truth of this doctrine by the former Rule,
which can neither fail us, neither can we be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in it, <hi>viz.</hi> Because it is universally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in the present church, as a doctrine <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary;</hi>
and moreover it is attested by all
antient Records of the Fathers of the church,
<hi>nemine explicite contradicente,</hi> and it ha's
been practised by Councells in all ages, not one
Catholique renouncing his obedience; In so
much as to my understanding there is not one
Christian doctrine delivered with so full an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
nor in the sense and meaning whereof
it is lesse possible for a man to be mistaken.
Now by vertue of this speciall truth of the
churches authority <hi>Universall Tradition</hi> (which
of it self is most credible and certain) being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and attested by the present church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
most necessary to be believed by us, the
<hi>Church</hi> supplying the place not only of a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but of an <hi>Embassadour</hi> likewise instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and employed by Christ himself (as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
most effectually maintains) so that in
believing and obeying her, we believe and obey
Christ himself, according to Christs own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>He that heareth you heareth me,</hi> and,
<hi>If any one heareth not the Church, let him be to
thee as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they that believe Christian doctrines only,
because they think they find them in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and believe the Scripture only, because
their reason or fancy (which they miscall the
testimony of Gods <hi>Spirit</hi>) tells them that it is
the Word of God, though the doctrines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
believed by them be true, yet it is a hazard,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46209:177"/>
as to them whether they be so or no, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
whether that be the sense of them or no,
it being all one, as if a man by some casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had found a transcribed copy of some part
of an <hi>Embassadors Pattent</hi> or instructions:
Whereas Catholiques receive the commands
of their heavenly King and Master from his
Embassadours own hands, which not only will
not conceale any thing necessary or requisite
from them, but likewise will be able upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to cleare all manner of difficulties that
may arise about the sense of the said instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Patent, having received glorious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of continuall residence among us, and of
divine assistance to preserve him from any, at
least dangerous error.</p>
               <p>8. These things thus supposed, Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth's</hi>
pretended <hi>circles</hi> and <hi>absurdities</hi>
in the <hi>Resolution of Catholique Faith</hi> doe
clearly and evidently vanish: For a Catholique
does not only or chiefly believe <hi>the Churches
authority,</hi> because to his priva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e understanding
and reason the Scripture seems to say so: but
because he knows that the present Catholique
Church teacheth so, both by profession and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise;
and that she teacheth this as a Catholike
<hi>Tradition,</hi> believed and practised in all ages;
then which it is impossible there should be any
testimony more assured and <hi>infallible;</hi> so that
if a man can be sure of any thing done before
his own times (as all reasonable men do agree
that one may) he cannot avoid being most sure
of this, if his passion or interests do not hinder
him from searching into the grounds of it. I
need not therefore particularly give an answer
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46209:177"/>
to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> discourse before produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
since it wholly proceeds upon a mistake of
his adversaries, and other Catholiques grounds;
and since himself in the close of it seemes to
confesse, by objecting to himselfe <hi>Universall
Tradition,</hi> that if this doctrine of the Churches
authority could be made appear to be grounded
upon <hi>Catholike Tradition,</hi> it would be as much
credible, as if the Scripture had expresly testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it (since in his <hi>opinion</hi> the Scripture it selfe,
and nothing besides, enjoyes its authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is delivered by <hi>Universall Tradition</hi>)
and by consequence would not be lyable to any
<hi>circles</hi> or <hi>absurdities.</hi> So that truly I wonder
why (seeing Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> could not be
ignorant that Catholiques do generally pretend
that this doctrine comes from <hi>Tradition,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the proofs of it out of Scripture) he should

<hi>depended upon extreme uncertainties
and casualties, and by consequence that a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
could not give any assurance that his
faith was safely grounded. For thus he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
(c. <hi>2.</hi> parag. <hi>63.</hi> ad. <hi>68.</hi>) The salvation of
many millions of Papists (as they suppose and
teath) depends upon their having the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Penance duly administred to them:
This again upon the Ministers being a true
Priest, which is a thing that depends upon
many uncertain and very contingent supposalls,
As <hi>1.</hi> That he was baptized with due matter.
<hi>2.</hi> With due forme. <hi>3.</hi> With due intention.
<hi>4.</hi> That the Bishop which ordained him Priest,
ordained him likewise with due form, intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c. <hi>5.</hi> That that Bishop himselfe was a
person fitly qualified to give orders, that is,
was no Simoniake, &amp;c. <hi>6.</hi> That all that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Progenitors were fitly qualified: and so
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46209:178"/>
till he arrive to the fountain of Priesthood.
Now he that shall put together, and maturely
consider all the possible wayes of lapsing and
nullifying a Priesthood in the Church of Rome,
I believe, <hi>saith he,</hi> will be very inclinable to
believe, that in an hundred seeming Priests,
there is not one true one. But suppose this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
assoyled, yet still the difficulty will
remain whether he will pronounce the absolving
words with intent to absolve you; for perhaps
he may be a secret Jew, Moor, or Antitrinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;
which if he be, then his intention, which
is necessary to the validity of a Sacrament, will
be wanting, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Hereto I answer. 1 That such kind of
pretended uncertainties or nullities in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
do not prejudice the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of the church in generall, but that if it be
true, which ha's alwayes been believed in the
church, viz. That Christ ha's promised to
continue till the worlds end a church governed
by lawfull Pastors, and preserved in all truth,
he will engage his omnipotency to make good
<hi>his fidelity,</hi> and by consequence he will take
care to prevent or remedy all obstacles that
can be imagined to be otherwise able to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
such his promises: and I suppose two such
Attributes of Christ are a foundation strong
enough to build a faith not obnoxious to such a
world of casualties, as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
suspects. 2. That Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> whole
discourse proceeds upon a mistake of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
doctrine of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi>
which ha's not declared all those things to be
<hi>nullities,</hi> nor any of them in the sense that he
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46209:179"/>
alledges. It is true in the Canon law, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>suists there are mentioned many nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of Orders and other Sacraments, as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
or <hi>Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Schisme</hi> are said to nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Ordination of a Bishop or Priest:
But how to nullifie it, by taking away the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
wholly? No. But the Church to shew
her detestation of those sins suspends the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of exercising those Offices from any one
that is guilty of those sinnes; and likewise
from those that are ordained by such Simoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or Hereticall Bishops, till they have given
satisfaction to the Church: And therefore in
that moderate judgement of <hi>Pope Melchiades,</hi>
(so much commended by S. <hi>Augustine Ep.</hi>
162.) when he decreed, that if the <hi>Donatists</hi>
would return to the Catholique Communion,
their Bishops, if the more antient in any
City, should be acknowledged the lawfull
Bishops of such a City, or if the younger
should succeed upon the first vacancy, there
was no mention made of <hi>a reordination of such
Hereticall or Schismaticall Bishops,</hi> or of any
<hi>Priests</hi> made by them. 3. It is not true, that
the salvation of <hi>Catholiques</hi> doth absolutely
depend upon the Sacrament of Penance law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
administred: For though it be necessary
to the being of the Church in generall, that
that and all other Sacraments be lawfully admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
and by consequence we may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that Christ will in generall prevent all
reall wants and obstacles thereto: yet it is not
necessary that this should be affirmed of each
Catholique in particular: For to Christians
which are <hi>adulti,</hi> that is, capable of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46209:179"/>
of <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> even actuall
<hi>Baptisme</hi> lawfully administred is not absolutely
necessary, for in such persons the <hi>Votum Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismi</hi>
will supply all wants or defects impossible
to be avoided; and much more certainly will
the same <hi>Votum</hi> serve for other Sacraments, as
the <hi>Eucharist, Penance, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Concerning
<hi>intention,</hi> which the church in the <hi>Councell of
Florence</hi> (in Instr. Arm.) and in the <hi>Councell
of Trent (Sess. 7. ca. 11.)</hi> ha's indeed defined
to be a necessary requisite to denominate a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to be lawfully administred in these
words of the <hi>Councell of Florence; Sacraments
are perfected by three things, the Matter,
Form and Person of the Minister conferring
the Sacraments, with an intention of doing
what the church doth; of which if any one be
wanting, the Sacrament is not perfected.</hi> And
these of the Councell of Trent, <hi>If any man
shall say, That in Ministers when they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Sacraments there is not required an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
at least of doing what the church doth,
let him be Anathema.</hi> Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
might, and I am confident did know, that the
<hi>Intention</hi> required was such an one as might be
found even in <hi>Pagans, Heretiques, Jewes.
&amp;c.</hi> administring <hi>Baptisme,</hi> so they do it, as
executing the Office hypocritically intruded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by them in the due form, and with a right
pronunciation of the words of the church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the mean time in the secret of their
hearts they did renounce, deride and detest that
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> and all the efficacy ascribed to it, as
appears by the Decisions of antient <hi>Councells
against the Donatists,</hi> and the <hi>Rescripts of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46209:180"/>
Pope Nicholas the first,</hi> and
<hi>Alexander the third.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De consecr. d. 4: cap. à quodam.</note> And
hereupon S. <hi>Thomas</hi> treating
of this subject,<note place="margin">p. 3. q. 64. à. 8. ad. 2.</note> delivers his
sense in these words, <hi>Some
answer better,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that
the Minister of the Sacrament doth operate
in the person of the whole Church, whose Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
he is; and in the words of the church
which he pronounctth is expressed the churches
intention, the which sufficeth to the perfection
of a Sacrament, unlesse there be an outward
expression of the contrary on the part of the
Minister, or receiver of the Sacrament.</hi> Upon
which grounds I suppose it
was that <hi>Salmeron the Jesuite,</hi>
and <hi>Scribonius Marius</hi> a learned
<hi>Franciscan,</hi> highly esteemed by
<hi>Cardinall Perron,</hi> (besides some
antient Schoolmen) do after
this manner with a far greater
latitude then generally <hi>Controvertists</hi> or
<hi>Schoolmen</hi> doe allow,<note place="margin">Salm. in Ep. Paul. l. 1. p. 1. disp. 2. scrib. Mar. de Sacr. disp. 1.</note> endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
their sense of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the <hi>Decrees</hi>
of those two Councells, <hi>viz</hi> That in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi>
there may be a <hi>twofold</hi> intention.
1. <hi>Meerly speculative,</hi> inwrap'd in the secrets
of his heart, and of which no outward sign does
appear, nor indeed no sufficient one can; of
this intention the church judgeth not. 2. <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall,</hi>
which relates to the outward act; and is
thereby really accomplished: The former,
say these Authors (unlesse the church shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the contrary, as hitherto to their seeming
she ha's not) can neither profit nor prejudice
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:46209:180"/>
in conferring Sacraments: If it be an ill, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious
intention, it may help to damn the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but it will not hinder the validity of the
Sacrament, nor the efficacy of it. The later
<hi>practicall intention,</hi> is that which is only to be
considered here. As a servant that is sent by
his Master to deliver possession of a house, if
he really perform the legall ceremonies, and
pronounce the words requisite, whatsoever
thoughts of unwillingnesse, reluctancy or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
lurk in his breast, the <hi>delivery</hi> will
be valid. And truly it seems not intelligible,
how it can be possible for a <hi>Minister,</hi> as a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Church,</hi> not compell'd by force,
nor drawn by promises, that knows what he
does, and clearly shews that he will do what he
knows, should as the church commands him,
with all due formality perform a Sacrament,
and yet at the same time intend or resolve not
to do what he does: He may possibly have in
his wicked heart inward wishes that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might want effect, or a misbelief that the
Sacrament is nothing valuable, but a meer su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
vain or noxious ceremony. But as
for the thoughts by which performing a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he would endeavour to intend not to doe
that which he intends to do, such thoughts seem
to be meer aeriall fancies. Indeed if he shew his
contradiction or intention by any outward
sign by which it may be judged, that though he
observe all the requisite formalities, yet he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
them meerly in a mockery, as if an <hi>Actor
upon a Stage</hi> should personate the conferring a
Sacrament, and much more if he neglect the due
form of words. He will thereby declare that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46209:181"/>
really, that is not a Sacrament which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes,
but a meer mockery and malitious
scornfull <hi>Pageantry.</hi> Those learned, and as
yet uncensured Authors, therefore (whose <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
I do here relate only <hi>historically</hi>) do
conceive the meaning of the church in the
forementioned <hi>Decisions</hi> to be only this, <hi>viz.</hi>
That it is requisite to Sacraments that they
be onely this, <hi>viz.</hi> that they be not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
jestingly, histrionically and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously,
but after such a manner that it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
be judged, that he who administers
them intends to perform his duty and office
imposed on him by the church; that is, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and confer a Sacrament, and not to play
the fool: Not that the church ever intended
that the Sacraments should be valid or null,
according to the inward fancies of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strer,
or that it should be in the power of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisticall
or malitious Bishop or Priest to damn
all his Diocese and Parish. And for a further
proof of this, it is observeable, that even at the
very time when this <hi>Article</hi> concerning the
<hi>necessity of intention</hi> was debated and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Councell of Trent, <hi>Catharinus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Minori</hi> declared openly this sense of
that <hi>Article</hi> against certain disputing School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and during the sitting of the Councell,
published a book to the same effect, no man
censuring or condemning him; Although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his manner of expression was far more
unwary, and more approaching to the sense of
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Authors, <hi>Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Scribonius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi>
the further fitnesse of which <hi>opinion</hi> I
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46209:181"/>
leave to the judgement of the Catholique
Reader, my intention being only to make a
Narration of what I was told or did read in
others.</p>
               <p>3. And these are the principall arguments
produced by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> against the
<hi>infallibility</hi> (as he loves to call it) of the
Church; at least such of them as had the
greatest effect upon me, during my time of
Protestancy, to hinder me from submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my selfe to the authority of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church, or indeed to any authority at
all, as obliging in conscience; which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(when I came to examine them) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me in generall, not to touch the
established doctrine thereof at all. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were of greater force against his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
aduersary, it concerned not me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had I commission or authority to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>4. It is not my purpose in this <hi>Narration</hi>
to give particular answers<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>to all
his objections: Onely this I professe, that I
doe neither remember any one through his
whole book, which formerly had any
strong influence upon me, nor (since my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Catholique, after not a perfunctory
per-usuall of it) have I met with any, which
to mine own understanding, upon the grounds
by me formerly laid, doe not seeme to
me easily answerable. And I am confident,
that if any <hi>Protestant</hi> shall apply Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth's</hi>
discourses to the established do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and expressions of the Catholike Church,
he will acknowledge that, notwithstanding
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46209:182"/>
any thing said by <hi>him,</hi> this may remain true,
<hi>That the Catholique Church hath authority to
propose points of Faith, and to interpret Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
and that no particular Churches or
Christians may or ought to contradict or refuse
to submit to her determinations and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
Insomuch, as if Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
had been so fortunate as to have undertaken no
more then to examine the doctrine of the
church, he would scarce have made use of, and
much lesse would he have relyed so confidently
upon the strength of any of those arguments
which he ha's produced against his adversaries
Positions: He must have been forced either to
acknowledge the truth of the churches doctrine,
or have put himself to the trouble of inventing
other kind of arguments, then any I could yet
meet with, either in his, or any other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants writings.</p>

doctrine against the authority of the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. I Will at length put an end to this tedious
(but that it is so necessary) discourse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this second <hi>conclusion concerning the Judge
of Controversies, and authoritative interpreter
of Scripture,</hi> by shewing, among many, some
speciall enormous and unavoidable consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the doctrine of Protestants concerning
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46209:182"/>
this point, who refuse, yea oppose the consent of
the present and antient Catholique Church,
propounding doctrines of Faith, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Scripture, and submit to their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
reason, or <hi>private Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The first</hi> is an <hi>impossibility of Unity,</hi> yea
though reason were suffered to proceed simply
without mixture of passion and interest, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and reason it self shews, and it hath
been already proved.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The second,</hi> an <hi>evident contradiction to
Universall Antiquity,</hi> which will not afford
one example of any <hi>Catholique Writer,</hi> that
either hath affirmed, that in interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
every man is to follow the guidance of his
own reason or private Spirit, against the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the present church; or that hath himself
refused, or taught others to refuse upon any
pretence to submit to the determinations of the
present <hi>Catholique Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>The third</hi> is, that if the <hi>universall testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of the present church, either by her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
profession and practise, or in her decisions
in a Generall Councel do not indispensably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
all <hi>Christians</hi> to obedience upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
exception that no expresse mention is
made in Scripture of such an unlimited power
given to any church of one denomination; then
it will follow, that those churches and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
which have assumed to themselves this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to exact subscription to any decisions
of any doctrines, other then expresse quotations
of Scripture to be understood by every one,
according to his own fancy, and that hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
all gainsayers, are guilty of insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46209:183"/>
uncharitablenesse, injustice, and tyranny:
Upon which grounds all <hi>Protestants</hi> are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>to anathematize the four first Generall
Councells,</hi> as well as all the rest which follow,
yea <hi>above all other the Councell of Nice,</hi> since
therein were <hi>anathematized</hi> all those that did
not subscribe to an expression of one <hi>Article
of Faith,</hi> which notwithstanding those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
acknowledged to be so far from being
contained expressely in Scripture, that the
word<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>(which occasioned so many
Tragedies) was not so much as of <hi>Tradition,</hi>
but only invented by them, as proper to oppose
the Heresie of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and to expresse the
sense of the <hi>Traditionary doctrine</hi> of Christs
eternall <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>equality</hi> with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>The fourth</hi> is, that upon Protestants
grounds it is impossible they should rationally
call <hi>any doctrine Heresie,</hi> or <hi>any separation
Schisme,</hi> without condemning themselves:
For concerning Heresie, if they, following
the antient Church, define Heresie to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing
or opposing the belief of any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
generally professed in the Catholique
Church, or defined by a lawfull Couucell,
they will include themselves within the lists of
<hi>Heretiques,</hi> since if for severall ages before
<hi>Luther,</hi> there were either any Churches Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique,
or any authority to make a lawfull
assembly; they have done apparently the same.
But defining, as they do, Heresie to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of a Fundamentall Article of the
<hi>Christian Faith</hi> expressely contained in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;</hi>
and not naming, but rather <hi>explicitly</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:46209:183"/>
renouncing any visible Judge authorized to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
whether such or such an Article be to
be accounted to be expressely contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
against those who deny it, it is impossible to
come to an issue between parties contradicting
one the other.</p>
               <p>6. I will give only two instances <hi>in two
points</hi> acknowledged <hi>in England:</hi> the first in
that great <hi>point</hi> controverted between the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Protestants</hi> and the <hi>Socinians.</hi> The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Protestants</hi> call the <hi>Socinians Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi>
because they deny the eternall <hi>Divinity</hi>
of the <hi>second Person in the blessed Trinity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is, say they, a fundamentall <hi>Article</hi>
of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and expressely contained
in <hi>Scripture:</hi> But this the <hi>Socinians</hi> confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny, yea they professe that the contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is expressely contained in <hi>Scripture;</hi> for,
say they, <q>Neither the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> nor <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality,</hi>
nor <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> &amp;c. are to be
found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> neither can any Texts be
produced, which witnesse in formal words, that
the <hi>Son</hi> is equall to the Father, in respect of
the <hi>Godhead,</hi> yea many Texts expressely say,
that he is <hi>inferiour.</hi> But now what Texts are
there to be found so evidently expressing the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Divinity of the Son of God,</hi> as there
are for appropriating the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> to
the <hi>Father</hi> only? (<hi>Viz.</hi>) these two Texts, <hi>This
is eternall life to know thee, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi>
And, <hi>To us there is but one God, even the
Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>7. The truth is, if <hi>Tradition</hi> and the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Church be not admitted</hi> to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46209:184"/>
interpret Scripture, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and other
<hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> cannot by Protestants be
condemned as <hi>Heretiques</hi> upon the pretence of
denying expresse Scripture, since if reason alone
be judge, those Texts cannot be called express,
which may be confronted with others seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradicting, or which are capable of a
sense, it may be lesse probable, yet so as that
without much racking, the words will be able
to bear: a case which to have hap'ned in this
controversie, every reasonable man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that shall cast his eyes upon the severall
positive Texts alledged by <hi>Crellius</hi> in his book
<hi>De uno vere Deo.</hi> I may add further, that if
the <hi>universall Tradition</hi> of the <hi>present Church</hi>
in the time of the <hi>Councell of Nice</hi> had not
prevailed for the stating of that great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
against the <hi>Arians,</hi> so many objections
those Heretiques heaped together, not only out
of Scripture, but likewise out of the writings of
such Fathers as preceded that Councell, that
perhaps they might have endangered the cause,
as will appear to any one that shall cast his eyes
upon a world of passages quoted by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
out of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
S. <hi>Justin Martyr, Origen, Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. The <hi>Second instance</hi> is the Heresie of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization</hi>
renewed by the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of
these times, and in conformity to <hi>Antiquity</hi>
condemned by <hi>English Protestants:</hi> it is more
evident then the Sun, that expresse Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
being the Rule, and <hi>private reason</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
the Judge, the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> cannot upon
<hi>Protestants</hi> grounds be accused either to erre
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46209:184"/>
in a point fundamentall, or however in a point
fundamentall contained expressely in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>9. In the last place, that upon Protestants
grounds no separation among them can justly
be called <hi>Schisme</hi> (in the notion of Antiquity)
appears yet more evidently: For among those
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> now in England, which abhor
and renounce the Communion of one another,
1. There is not any one of them that ha's the
assurance to stile themselves the <hi>Catholique
Church</hi> with exclusion of all others not in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Communion with them: Now Schisme is
only a separation from the externall Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> at least, if <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
antiquity</hi> may be allowed to be the
judge. 2. There is not any one of them which
dares apply to themselves in particular those
words of Christ, <hi>Tell the Church, and if he
will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as
a Heathen and a Publican,</hi> or those Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of his, <hi>Upon this Rock will I build my
Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.</hi> And, <hi>I will send the Comforter
which shall lead you into all truth.</hi> And, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I am with you to the end of the world.</hi>
Now there is no Schisme, but from such a
church to which those elogies and promises
belong. 3. All the means and remedies left
them to deale with those they call <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi>
or <hi>Heretiques</hi> are, not to <hi>excommunicate</hi>
them in a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> as the Catholique
Church ha's continually upon occasion done;
for what a ridiculo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s affembly must that be,
to which they should presume to attribute the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46209:185"/>
name of a <hi>Generall Councell?</hi> And how more
ridiculously would an <hi>Anathema</hi> sound, being

cases, is to persecute, imprison, or perhaps burn
one another, as <hi>Calvin</hi> did <hi>Servetus;</hi> and by
this means the weaker and sufferer would be
the only Heretique and Schismatique. But of

                  <p>The third Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>The point of Shisme slightly considered
by Protestants: which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ought above all others to be chiefly
considered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE 3d. CONCLUSION, viz.</p>
               <p>That there is one only Church of Christ:
and that all Heretiques who believe
not all Christian doctrines taught in
her, and all Schismatiques, who, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bond of Charity, divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from her visible and externall
Communion, are separated from Christ
himself.</p>
               <p>1. IN my discourse upon this Conclusion I
need not separate <hi>Heresie</hi> from <hi>Schisme,</hi>
since I do not know any <hi>Sect</hi> in these times
precisely <hi>Schismaticall,</hi> that is, without any
mixture of Heresie, (as the <hi>Donatists</hi> were
in the beginning, who agreed in all doctrines
with Catholiques, but separated upon a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
grounded upon a matter of fact. Therefore
hereafter when I speak of <hi>Schisme,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
upon what party it is to be charged, it is
to be supposed that Heresie must accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it, seeing the foundation of all the present
separations among Christians is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>heir
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46209:186"/>
disagreeing in points of faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>2. Now though this divine truth, viz. <hi>That
the true Church of Christ is only one,</hi> and by
consequence, that an injustifiable separation
from it, is in a high degree damnable, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by all Christians that I know,
since it is an expresse article of our Creed,
<hi>Credo unam sanctam &amp; Catholicam Ecclesiam,</hi>
that is, I believe one holy Catholike Church;
and therefore there may seem to be no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to put ones selfe to the trouble of proving
it: Notwithstanding I will not refuse that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make a collection of quotations, both
out of Scripture and Fathers; to the end, both
to get a distinct notion of what was antiently
understood by this word, <hi>Schisme:</hi> and to set
forth (according to their conceptions) the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominablenesse
and extreme sinfulnesse of that
sin; and this the rather, because a sad medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon such passages enforced me to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in what a state I had formerly lived, and
likewise made me wonder, that <hi>heretofore</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other points I had not bent my
thoughts and studies to enquire and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
(since it is apparent that there is a Schism
in the church) upon which party the guilt
of so horrible and exterminating a sinne <hi>did
lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. But the truth is, my wonder decreased,
when I considered that hitherto I had not
met with any</hi> Protestant Writers <hi>that have
throughly considered this point of Schisme,
which yet above all others ought to have been
most exactly ventilated and examined, as S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46209:186"/>
(lib. 2. cont. lit. Petil.) <hi>saith, in the
case of Schisme against the Donatists;</hi> The
whole question therefore is, whether you do not
ill, you I say, to whom the whole world ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
the sacriledge of so geeat a Schisme? the
exact examination of which question whilest
you neglect; all that you say is superfluous:
and whereas you live like theeves, you boast
that you dye as Martyrs. <hi>And again,</hi> (Ep. 164.
ad Emer. Don.) Wherefore in the prime place
this is to be enquired, for what reason you made
a Schisme? <hi>To the same effect said</hi> Optatus
<hi>before him concerning the same</hi> Donatists,
(lib. 1.) The businesse in hand is concerning se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
In Africa, as in all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
likewise, there was but one church before
it was divided by those who ordained Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
in the Chair, upon which by succession
thou art set. The matter therefore to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
is, which of the two parties have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the root with the whole world?
which of them went out? which of them is set
upon a new Chair <hi>(Episcopall)</hi> which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was not in being? which of them ha's rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
an Altar against a <hi>(former)</hi> Altar? which
of them made an Ordination during the life
time of him who was before ordanied? Lastly
which of them is obnoxious to the sentence of
S. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle, who foretold that many
Antichrists would go out of the Church?</p>
               <p>4. The almost onely considerable Author
among Protestants, who seems to have written
largely and purposely upon this argument of
<hi>Schisme,</hi> was that unfortunate <hi>Apostate M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius
de Dominis, Arch-Bishop of Spalato,</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:46209:187"/>
who, as appears by the <hi>Index</hi> of the heads of
his books and Sections, allowed an entire book
to this subject: but by what means it came to
passe, whether through guilt, or what other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
I know not, but in the publication of the
three volumes of his works, that book which he
intended, or had written <hi>de Schismate</hi> appears
not, there is an <hi>hiatus</hi> in that place not yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.

this pollution is not washed away, no not with

by death it self. That man cannot be a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr

he ha's not received a crown. And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was separated from the peace of the

Thou shalt not go after strange Gods, and (<hi>in

body. Witnesse the fourth Councell of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,
(Can 1.) out of the Catholique Church
there is no salvation.</p>
               <p>3. Witnesse S. <hi>Augustine (de Symb. ad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. l.
4. c. 10.)</hi> For this cause the conclusion of
this Sacrament (<hi>he means the creed</hi>) is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in the Article concerning the holy
Church: and the reason is, because if any man
be found separated from her, he shall be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the number of children; neither shall
he have God for his Father, that would not
have the Church for his Mother: and it will
nothing avail him to have rightly believed, or
to have done never so many good works, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this conclusion of the soveraign good. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
(in Psa. 21.) Whosoever ha's charity is
assured. But as for charity, no man transports
it out of the Church. <hi>Againe, (de Bap. con.
Don. l. 1. c. 8.)</hi> Those whom the Donatists heale
of the wound of I dolatry and infidelity, they
themselves wound more dangerously with the
wound of Schisme. <hi>Again, (sup. gest. Emar.)</hi>
Out of the Catholique Church a Heretique may
have all things but salvation. He may have the
Sacraments, He may sing Allelujah, He may
answer, Amen. He may keep the Gospell, He
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46209:189"/>
may have the Faith and preach it, only salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he cannot have. <hi>Again,</hi> (l. 3. cont. Petil. c.
5.) No man preaching the name of Christ, and
carrying or ministring the Sacrament of Christ
is to be followed against the Unity of Christ.
<hi>Again,</hi> (cont. adv. Le. &amp; Proph. l. 1. 6. 17.) If he
hear not the Church, let him be to thee as a
Heathen and a Publican; which is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
then if he was strucken through with a
sword, consumed by flames, exposed to wilde
beasts. <hi>Again</hi> (l. de Past. c. 12.) The Divel saith
not, let them be Donatists and not Arians, for
whether they be here or there they belong to
him that gathers without making a difference:
Let him adore Idolls, saith the Divell, he is
mine: Let him remain in the superstition of
the Jewes, he is mine: Let him quit Unity,
and passe over to this or that, or any Heresie,
he is mine.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Witnesse likewise S.</hi> Fulgentius, (de
rem. pec. cap. 22.) Out of this Church nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the title of Christian secures any man,
neither doth Baptisme conferre salvation,
neither doth any man offer a sacrifice agreeable
to God, neither doth any man receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes, neither doth any man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to eternall life, for there is one onely
Church, one onely Dove, one onely well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
one only Spouse. <hi>Again,</hi> (de Fid. ad. Pet.
D. c. 39.) Hold this most firmly, and doubt
not of it in any wise, that every Heretique and
Schismatique whatsoever baptized in the name
of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost;
if before the end of his life he be not reunited
to the Catholike Church, let him bestow never
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46209:189"/>
so many almes, yea though he should shed his
bloud for the name of Christ, he cannot obtain
salvation. <hi>Witnesse lastly S.</hi> Prosper, He who
does not communicate with the Universall
Church is a Heretique and Antichrist. (de
prom. &amp; praed. Dei p. 4. c. 5.)</p>
               <p>5. Surely no man can justly blame, if a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
consideration of such <hi>testimonies of
Scripture,</hi> such a conspiracy of all the Saints
almost of the antient Church agreeing to
condemne Schisme, <hi>as the most heinous inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseable
sin that a Christian was capable of
committing,</hi> not to be redeemed with <hi>Faith,
Sacraments, Almes, Miracles,</hi> no nor <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome</hi> it selfe, awakened me from the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy
I was in, and from the presumption
which I had, <hi>viz.</hi> that since I my selfe had
no influence upon the beginnings of the
Separation, but on the contrary approached
as neere in my beliefe to the Catholique
Church, as Truth in my opinion would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me; and lastly, since I judged charitably
of the state of Cutholiques, that therefore
the guilt of Schisme should never be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me. Not content therefore to rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these imaginations in a matter, upon
which my eternall happinesse inseparably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
if the expresse words of Scripture,
and unanimous consent of Antiquity were
to be believed, I proceeded to examine the
present state of <hi>Protestant &amp;c. Churches in
separation</hi> from the <hi>Romane,</hi> by the markes
which the antient Fathers afforded me to
judge by, whether of the two parties were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to which of them this so heynous
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46209:190"/>
low, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. They all agreed that <hi>Schisme was a
thing of it self evident,</hi> &amp; whereof the most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
understandings might inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
For this being the foundation of all their
disputes of the Catholike Church, that it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
so visible and illustrious, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be hidden from the eys of any man that does
not willingly shut them, it does necessarily follow,
that they who are not in visible communion with
that visible church are apparently Schismatikes.</p>
               <p>5. Secondly, and by consequence, <hi>that the
mark of Schisme and Heresie</hi> was not a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the true faith simply; but from that
faith which is openly professed by the Church:
For otherwise, if they had defined Schisme with
respect onely to the true Faith, all the evidence
of Schisme would be utterly taken away, since
it would be alwayes ambiguous and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
which of the parties in a Schisme held
the true doctrine; of which ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could not be Judges; and the learned would
never acknowledge themselves guilty. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the parties evidently in Schisme would
be sure, either not at all to acknowledge, or at
least to excuse and extenuate their fault, by
saying, that though they were in some sort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from the (Catholique) Church, yet
this was not so unpardonable, since they left
the Church only in points not fundamentall,
for in such they agree with Catholiques, and
by consequence remain the same church still in
substantialls. This is at this day the plea of
many Protestants, as it was anciently of the
Pelagians, according to that of S. <hi>Augustine,
(de Pec. Orig. l. 2. c. 22.) Pelagius and Goelestius</hi>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:46209:190"/>
saith he, <hi>desirous cunningly to avoid the odious
name of Heresie, affirme that the question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Originall finne may be disputed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
endangering Faith.</hi> But this assertion of
theirs he confuted particularly in his fourteenth
<hi>Sermon, De Verbis Apostoli;</hi> and in generall
against both Heretiques and Schismatiques
proves, that whatsoever in particular their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are, yet since they professe otherwise then
the church does, and requires of them to doe,
they are in a damnable estate, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they vertually renounce one fundamentall
Article of faith, viz. <hi>of the authority and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Catholique Church;</hi> and therefore
if they break communion, though but for one
doctrine, and that of it self of no great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
their orthodoxnesse in all other points
will not avail them wanting truth, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
renouncing charity and obedience to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
Church. Hereupon the same Father
(in <hi>Psal.</hi> 54.) saith of the <hi>Donatists, We have
each of us one Baptisme; in this they were
with me: We celebrated the Feasts of the
Martyrs, in this they were with me: We fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
the solemnity of Easter, in this they
were with me: But they were not in all
things with me: In Schisme they were not
with me: In Heresie they were not with
me: In many things they were with me,
and in some few things they were not with
me: But in those few things in which they
were not with me, those many things do not
profit them in which they were with me.</hi> So
again the <hi>same Father (Ep. 48.)</hi> Speaking to
the same Donatists, You are with us in Baptism,

in the Creed, in other Sacraments of the Lord:
but in the Spirit of unity, in the bond of peace,
and finally in the Catholike Church you are not
with us.</p>
               <p>6. Thirdly, <hi>that the proper (to all eys visible)
and essentiall</hi> mark of Schisme <hi>(for what cause
soever it matters not) is a wilfull</hi> separation
from the externall Communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church. <hi>So</hi> S. <hi>Augustine (de unit. c. 4.)</hi>
Those who do so dissent from the body of Christ,
which is the Church, that their Communion is
not with the whole wheresoever it is spread,
but are fouud in some party separated, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that they are not in the Catholike Church.
<hi>And again</hi> (de util. cred. c. 2.) There is one
Church, if you cast your eyes upon the surface
of the earth, more abundant in multitude, and
likewise as those who know by experience af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
more sincere in truth then all others: but
concerning truth that is another dispute. <hi>And
again (cont. Pet. l. 2. c. 95.)</hi> Division and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention
makes you Heretiques, and peace and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
make us Catholiques. <hi>And</hi> Uincentius Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinensis
(<hi>cap. 9.</hi>) O admirable change! the first
Authors of the same opinions are called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques;
and the Sectators, Heretiques, <hi>(name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they separated for them.) And S.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
(<hi>de prom. &amp; ben. Dei p. 2. l. 5.</hi>) He who
communicates with the Universall Church is a
Christian and a Catholique: and he who doth
not communicate with it, is a Heretique and
Antichrist: <hi>Hereupon it is that the Fathers
understand and interpret the word</hi> C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tholique,
<hi>not with respect to doctrine or belief, but</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
externall. <hi>So S.</hi> Augustine <hi>(collat. car.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46209:191"/>
d. 3.)</hi> We shew by the testimony of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that we have the Catholique Church. <hi>And
again</hi> (brevic. coll. l. 3.) The Donatists <hi>(saith
he)</hi> answered that the word Catholique <hi>(or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall)</hi>
was not derived from the universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Nations, but from the plenitude of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<hi>that is, from the integrity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And again,</hi> (Ep. 48. ad Vinc. Reg.) Thou
thinkest that thou hast spoken subtilly when
thou interpretest the name Catholique not of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
Communion, but of observation of
all precepts and divine Sacraments, or Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>7. And to the end to demonstrate to Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques
that they could not pretend to any
portion in the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> the Fathers
ordinarily silenced them from any claim there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
by asking them whether they could addresse
<hi>communicatory letters</hi> unto, or receive such
letters from all <hi>Catholique Bishops,</hi> which they
not being able to do, were supposed to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
convicted. So S. <hi>Augustine</hi> (<hi>ep.</hi> 163.)
speaking of <hi>Fortunatus the Donatist, I asked
him if he could send communicatory Letters
(which we call</hi> Formatas) <hi>whither I would
name &amp;c. But because the thing was manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, they quitted that discourse with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of language.</hi> Hence it was that the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Schismatiques,</hi> not being able with any the
least pretence to challenge the title of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi>
were forced to repaire themselves, by
laying an aspersion or diminution on that name,
as when <hi>Sympronian</hi> told S. <hi>Pacian, (ep. 1.)
That none under the Apostles were called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques:</hi>
and when <hi>Gaudentius</hi> the <hi>Donatist</hi>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:46209:192"/>
affirmed <hi>that the word Catholique was a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
fiction, which S.</hi> Augustine <hi>calls, Verba
blasphemia, Blasphemous words. lib. 1. con.
Gaudent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>8. Notwithstanding in some cases the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
allow, that a man may possibly be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the externall communion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church without imputation of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
according to this discourse which I have
found quoted out of S.</hi> Augustine. Often
times also it happens, <hi>saith he,</hi> that the divine
Providence permits that some good men should
be cast out of the Christian Congregation by
some over-turbulent sedition of carnall men,
which injury done unto such men, when
they shall bear it patiently, for the peace of the
Church, and shall not attempt any innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Schismes or Heresies, they will instruct
men with what true affection, and with how
great sincerity and charity we ought to serve
God. The designe and resolution therefore of
such men is, either to returne when the tempest
is calmed, or if that be not permitted them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by reason that the tempest yet continues, or
out of fear lest by their returne another tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
should be raised more violent then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
they preserve a will and affection to
serve even those, to the violence and commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of whom they have given place, defending
to the death (without making any separated
conventicles) and maintaining by their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
the faith which they know is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the Catholique Church: Such as these
the Father who sees in secret crownes in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:46209:192"/>9. I remember that <hi>Monsienr Grotius,</hi>
from this speech of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
action (I think) of S. <hi>Chrysostomes,</hi>
defends the non-association to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church of himselfe, and such peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Protestants as himselfe: But surely in
vain, for first this discourse of S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
supposes that such persons doe not hold any
doctrines condemned by the Catholique
Church. 2. That whensoever leave or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
shall be given, they will readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
her Communion. 3. That they doe not
communicate with any Sects manifestly in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from it: None of which supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
can he applied to <hi>Monsieur Grotius,</hi> &amp;c.
and therefore such a Communion <hi>in voto,</hi> or
desire cannot in the judgement of Antiquity
availe them; since if it could, no Heretique
nor Schismatique could be culpable; or
that in such a sense doth not communicate
with the Catholique Church: for there is not
any of them but would willingly communicate
with her upon these termes, <hi>viz.</hi> That she
would change the clauses and conditions of her
Communion, and reform her selfe according
to the patternes of their particular respective
Sects.</p>
               <p>10. A fourth mark of Heresie and Schisme
is, when the first Authors of them can
be named, and by consequence can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be in time posteriour to Catholique
Unity: And particularly for doctrines, such
were esteemed Hereticall, which could not
be maintained to be <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> that is,
(not which the Authours did not pretend
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46209:193"/>
to be deducible out of Apostolicall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
for all Heretiques generally alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Scripture for all their blasphemies: but)
which they could not prove to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in the church, and deduced successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from Age to Age since the Apostles
times: Thus S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> (in Dec. Syn.
Nic. cont. Arian.) <hi>Behold we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the succession of our doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
from hand to hand, from Father to
Sonne: But as for you</hi> (Arians) <hi>new-Jewes
and children of</hi> Caiaphas, <hi>what
Progenitours can you show of your spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi>
So likewise S. <hi>Pacian</hi> (Epist. 3.)
<hi>For my selfe, holding my selfe assured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the succession of the Church, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my selfe with the peace of the antient
Congregation, I have not learned any stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

               <argument>
                  <p>An Application of the former marks
of Schisms to the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
and a demonstration
that they doe not suit to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
but onely Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. HAving thus informed my selfe of the
mind of <hi>Antiquity</hi> concerning <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and marks of Schisme and Heresie,</hi> and
applying them to the controversie in hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Protestant &amp;c. Churches,</hi>
it appeared as clear to me as the Sun at noone
day, that if the same Fathers and Bishops meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the antient <hi>Councells</hi> to condemn the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Nestorians, Eutychians, Novatians,</hi>
and <hi>Donatists &amp;c.</hi> had lived in these times,
they must of necessity upon the same grounds
have condemned the <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists,
English-Protestants, Socinians &amp;c.</hi> For it
being apparent, that there is really a Schisme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Western <hi>Christians</hi> since <hi>Luthers</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,
in as much as so many Sects doe not
onely actually separate from the communion of
that church, which before that separation they
all called the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> but likewise
impute superstition, idolatry, and other crimes
unto it, thereby to justifie such their separation,
by which means not a Schisme only, and that
most properly so called, is happened, but Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
likewise is to be imputed to one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46209:194"/>
divided: That neither of these titles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> and therefore
that both of them are justly and necessarily to
be charged upon the <hi>Church of England</hi> (and
by consequence, much more upon all other
Sects of Protestants, as being much more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and uncharitable against the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church) may to my understanding be
demonstrated most evidently after this manner,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. First with respect to separation from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
communion: In a manifest Schisme (as
this is apparently) those who are but a part,
who are new beginners, whose prime au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
may be named, who have introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians novelties, not heard of in
the world, even by their own confession, for
above a thousand years, and have actively
separated themselves from the externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the whole, in which they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
remaine, those and those onely are
Schismatiques; and such are Protestants, as
is evident. For 1. The English church is at
the best but a particular church, which in the
beginning of the raigne of <hi>King Henry the</hi>
VIII. did live in externall communion with
the then whole Catholique Church, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the same Kings dayes divided it self
from the same externall communion, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
obedience to the Pope, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they acknowledged the <hi>visible Head of the
Catholique Church.</hi> 2. The same <hi>English
Church</hi> in the dayes of his Son King <hi>Edward
the</hi> VI. but especially to his Daughter Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
to the former Schisme added an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46209:194"/>
of severall other points of doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
for very many ages universally embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by all Catholiques, and conspicuous in the
publique profession and practise of the church:
and in this double division both from the Faith
and externall communion of the Catholique
Church ha's the English Nation continued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since. Therefore according to the notion
of Schisme, which we have from Antiquity,
and plain expresse reason, the English-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant-Church
is properly Schismaticall and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall.</p>
               <p>3. On the contrary, the <hi>Romane Church</hi>
(acknowledged by all Englishmen to have been
the Catholique Church; and even since the
separation allowed by English Protestants
themselves to be at least a true member of the
Catholique Church) ha's continued to this day
in the same forme of externall communion that
she had before, ha's not actually nor actively se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from any church pre-existent, much
lesse from the whole body; ha's changed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of doctrine &amp;c. therefore if she was the
Catholique Church before, she is so still: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
she cannot in any the least shew of reason be
called Schismaticall.</p>
               <p>4. For further proof of this, let us consider
the first beginners of separation, <hi>Luther, Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglius,</hi>
or (to apply this discourse to the <hi>Church
of England) Tindall.</hi> I desire to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when <hi>Tindall</hi> alone, of his owne head,
without any authority, either civill or ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
yea in open desiance of both, began to
disperse doctrines unheard of among his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen,
all Catholiques, dividing himselfe
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46209:195"/>
from the externall communion of the whole
world, whether, I say, <hi>Tindall</hi> thus standing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
as supposed, as yet not to have gained
<hi>Proselites,</hi> was properly and truly a <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,</hi>
or no? If he was, I would fain know by
what right he or his followers came to lose that
name, when he had perverted a company, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Parish, or Diocess, or Province, yea that
whole Kingdome, is it become a meritorious
thing to gain Proselites to Schisme or Heresie?
Is one single person when he is out of company
a child of hell, and being joyned with seven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as wicked, or perhaps more wicked then
himself, does he thereby become a child of God?
Then certainly all Pharisaicall Sectaries have
good reason to do what our Saviour sayes of the
Pharisees, namely, <hi>to travell Sea and Land to
make Proselites,</hi> since ill company, it seemes,
may bring them to heaven, whereas if they had
been alone they could not avoid sinking into
helll. But if <hi>Tindall</hi> so standing alone in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
separation from all other <hi>Christians,</hi> was
no Schismatique; then, since by confession on
all sides the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> cannot fail, it
will follow, that <hi>Tindall</hi> in his own single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> and the whole
body of <hi>Christians</hi> divided from him were
Schismatiques.</p>
               <p>5. If this way of arguing be not demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
concluding, both out of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
grounds of the Fathers and evident reason,
yea even palpable sense, it will be impossible to
make a <hi>Syll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from any principles whatsoever; we must alter
Dictionaries and all formes of language, and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46209:195"/>
affirm that there is no means left to understand
one another, though we endeavour to speak ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so plainly: For if he be not a <hi>Separ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

who doth by his own confession actually <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
and he an <hi>Innovator,</hi> who doth actually
<hi>innovate:</hi> And if that church which in <hi>An. D.</hi>
1516. was confessed not to have been Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
because then all things were peaceable, no
Schisme was yet begun, if the same church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
without any alteration in doctrine or
practise till the year following, that <hi>Luther</hi>
taught and divided against it, and so ever since
be to be called Schismaticall, because others
would stay no longer in it, then to change is to
be constant, and to be constant, to change; to
run away is to stand still, and to stand still to
run away.</p>
               <p>6. If Protestants reply, that though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the then present state of the church,
<hi>Luther, Tindall, &amp;c.</hi> did make alterations,
in regard of some precedent ages before <hi>Luther,</hi>
in which the church had been wholly drowned
in errour and superstition, they did indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novate;
Yet since they sought to reduce the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
distempered church to the form and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the antient Apostolicall church, they
were neither alterers nor innovators, but rather
took away all alterations and innovations. <hi>I
answer,</hi> that if <hi>Luthers or Tindalls</hi> judgement
alone deserved to be ballanced with the whole
world, and if there were any suspition that
<hi>Christ</hi> had forgot his promises, or were become
unable to perform them, there might be some
pretence for such a plea; otherwise such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
doth augment their guilt, in as much as they

               <argument>

and Heresie cannot with the least

               </argument>
               <p>1. A Further proof as evident as the former,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the imputation of compleat
Schisme with Heresie annexed, is onely to be
charged upon Protestants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not with
the least shew of reason upon the Roman church,
and that <hi>with respect of doctrine innovated,</hi> is
this.</p>
               <p>2. It is first confessed that all the doctrines,
which the Protestants call errours, and those
in themselves damnable (unlesse where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
ignorance shall perhaps excuse) and
therefore obliging all Christian people after
having received a new light by the preaching
of <hi>Luther, Tindall, &amp;c.</hi> to forsake them, and
the communion of all those that persisted in
the maintaining of them: I say it is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that all such pretended errours were spread
through the whole Catholique Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46209:196"/>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> began his <hi>Apostacy, nemine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiceute.</hi>
(Now by the way, how this
can agree with that sense which they give to
the promises of Christ, <hi>that he would preserve
his Church in all truth, so that the gates of
hell should not prevail against it,</hi> I confesse I
cannot comprehend: For if all <hi>Heresies</hi> be the
gates of hell, as the Fathers say; then much
more Heresies in themselves damnable, although
the church had not condemned them, because
against essentiall truths. Besides they will not
deny, but that invincible ignorance may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
excuse <hi>Pelagianisme, Photinianisme, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme,
&amp;c.</hi> so that upon their grounds, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the promises of Christ, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
for above a thousand years together might
as well have been infected with these Heresies
also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. It is secondly confessed, that excepting
two or three, and those not of the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
opinions, all the rest (now condemned
by Protestants, were publiquely and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embraced and professed for severall ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

Churches, in a word, the remaining chaos <hi>(as
they call it)</hi> of Popish superstition.</p>
               <p>4. It is thirdly evident that within that time
in severall <hi>Councells</hi> (Provinciall at least) most
of the points in debate between Protestants and
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> have been either deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or the belief of them supposed, and all the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46209:197"/>
practises (which Protestants condemne) justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and commanded: no better proofe of which
assertion need be sought for, then that <hi>Tome of
English Synods</hi> published by Sir <hi>Henry Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
And on the contrary that it does not
appear in any Synod that any of those doctrines
or practises have been condemned, nor in the
least degree censured: so that if there were any
authority in the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> for above
one thousand years together, if she could chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
either belief, or but non-contradiction to
her decisions, they cannot be excused, who not
only not receive, but oppose, yea condemn, yea
blasphemously calumniate her both for doctrines
and practises so unanimously professed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced;
and all this even then when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
her to be the object of that Article
of the creed, <hi>Credo unam, sanctam, Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,
Apostolicam Ecclesiam:</hi> But how (<hi>unam</hi>)
if they may, yea ought to divide and tear her in
pieces? How (<hi>sanctam</hi>) if defiled with so much
prophanenesse, superstition, and Idolatry, and
all this not only permitted, but commanded by
her? How (<hi>Catholicam</hi>) if contradicting the
antient universall church? Lastly, how <hi>(Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicam)</hi>
if so evidently condemnable by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique
writings, as is pretended?</p>
               <p>5. In the fourth place, it was to me an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable
testimony of a strange watchfulnesse of
divine providence over the church to preserve it
from the gates of hell (that is, established and
dangerous errors) that during those worst times
thereof, when ignorance, worldlinesse, pride, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
&amp;c. raigned with so much scope, I mean
during the time of about six ages before <hi>Luther;</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:46209:198"/>
when the Popes, so wicked, so abominable in
their lives, enjoyed so unlimited a power even
over secular Princes themselves, and much
more over the <hi>Clergy;</hi> yet notwithstanding we
do not find that there was any innovation at all
in any points that concern doctrine, defined by
<hi>Councells;</hi> nor particularly that the Popes,
though in practise they assumed to themselves
a vast exercise of externall Jurisdiction, yet that
they ever attempted, much lesse effected the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
any decision, as <hi>de Fide,</hi> of their
power above that which was universally belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
not only in the former ages after S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
times, but in times immemoriall before
that.</p>
               <p>6. In the fifth place, concerning the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the first <hi>Councell of Nice</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory</hi>
it appeared to me evidently that many points
now in controversie have been defined expresly
against Protestants: That many have been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
reputed Heteriques for maintaining the
very same <hi>opinions</hi> now again innovated by
Protestants, as <hi>Aërius, Vigilantius, Iovinian,
&amp;c.</hi> That scarce any point of doctrine of the
Roman church, but is expressely maintained by
the Fathers generally. That whatsoever passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
seemingly contradicting to Roman do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are out of the Fathers produced by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
do at the most onely argue want of
memory in the Fathers, opposing that in one
obscure place, which they had plainly affirmed
in twenty: That those Fathers, who were so
quick-sighted to take notice of, and so zealous
to condemn any innovation in doctrine or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
yet neither have observed nor opposed
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46209:198"/>
any one point, either of doctrine or practise, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in S. <hi>Gregories</hi> time, and continued to
these, as an innovation: That the generall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Fathers when they spoke <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso</hi>
concerning <hi>Prayer for the Dead, Purgae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
the blessed Sacrament, the Primacy of the
Pope &amp;c. was like those of these times; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
outward form of the church like that of the
present; And on the contrary, all these, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and Liturgies, and outward face of
the antient Church much more unlike to the
Temples of the <hi>Calvinists</hi> or <hi>Lutherans &amp;c.</hi> yea
or English Protestants, in things wherein they
differ from the Roman, when they were from
the Congregations of antient Heretiques.</p>
               <p>7. In the last place, that the pretended proofs
out of Scripture alledged by Protestants, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
either because no mention is made of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
of such points, (a way of arguing general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renounced by the Fathers, who condemn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Heretiques by Tradition alone without Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:)
or because they, by drawing consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of Texts of Scripture, say they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
such doctrines of the Roman Church, which
yet upon their own grounds will not suffice to
call the contrary opinions so pretended to be
confuted hereticall, and much lesse will they be
a sufficient warrant to make such mortall divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the church, as are in these dayes.</p>
               <p>8. From all which considerations it seemed
likewise to my weak understanding, that this
plea made use of by Protestants to excuse their
Schisme upon pretence of so many dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and heresies crept into the Catholique
Church, necessary to be reformed, was a plea of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46209:199"/>
all others the most unreasonable, the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
that ever was, a plea so far from excusing
them, that above all other things it will make
them most unpardonable before God and man;
a plea formally evacuating the promises of
Christ, inevitably ruining all Ecclesiasticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
rendring uselesse and ridiculous all the
marks that Antiquity gives us, whereby to judge
of Schisme and Heresie. Lastly, a plea which
English Protestants, by the just judgement of
God, have to their owne ruine put into the
mouths of <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and all other Sects, for
as they served the Catholiques, so have the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists</hi>
used them, upon pretence of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Scripture, and the antient Apostolique
Church, they see themselves rob'd of their
church, of their faith, of their liberty, of their
livings, and many thousands of their lives; and
yet they that were the destroyers of all lawfull
authority, and exercisers of too much unlawfull,
complain of injustice; they that pluck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>A continuation of the former arguments,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the guilt of Schisme lies only
and wholly upon Protestants.</p>
                  <p>Catholiques not uncharitable, for saying.
That Protestancy unrepented is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THese Principles laid by the Fathers, with
unanimous consent of the execrable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and extremest dangerousnesse of the crime
of Schisme; together with the severall descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and marks which they give to understand it
by, seemed to me so reasonable; and these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
which I made from the aforesaid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
together with the application of those
marks to the present state of controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Roman and Protestant churches see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
so unrefutable: Lastly, the conclusion and
result of the whole matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the crime
of heresie and Schism cannot with the least shew
of reason be imputed to the Roman Catholike
Church, nor with the least shew of reason avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Protestant Churches, since the Fathers
being Judges, there is not one mark of Schisme
which can be found in the Romane, nor one
mark but is evidently found in Protestant chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
All this seemed to me so unanswerable,
that unlesse I did resolve to put out mine owne
eyes, I could not but see that I had all my life
hitherto continued in this fearful state of Schism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
And (unlesse I did resolve to proceed to that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46209:200"/>
desperate contempt of Scripture, of consent of
Antiquity, and of all Ecclesiasticall authority,
as to think Heresie and Schisme to be no other
then counterfeit<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>or bugbeares invented
to fright such foolish <hi>Christians</hi> as would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to any authority <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall)</hi>
I could not but think it more then time to avoid
the <hi>precipice</hi> into which I was ready to fall, and
and for that purpose, to range my selfe to that
<hi>Communion,</hi> which both by testimony of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and all Antiquity, and by visible experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
could demonstrate that a full effect of all
<hi>Christs promises</hi> had been accomplished in her,
which priviledge not any other congregation
(in our Western parts at least) did pretend to,
any other way then by calling themselves a part
of her, whom yet at the same time they called
an <hi>Idolatresse,</hi> and a <hi>Strumpet divorced from
her coelestiall Bridegroom,</hi> or at least commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with them that were guilty of such blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</p>
               <p>2. I do professe in the presence of God, and
all his blessed Saints and Angells, that I could
could not my self imagine, nor find in any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
writer any exception or objection that
came home to the point: this one essentiall mark
of Schisme viz. <hi>forsaking the externall publike
Communion of the Catholike Church,</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be avoided by them, since both all
the world sees it, and they themselves confesse
it, though indeed under another and more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
name.</p>
               <p>3. I may therefore spare my pains of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
particularly what Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> and
other Protestants alledge for their excuse, all
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:46209:200"/>
which are evidently answered with applying to
them that one saying of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his first
book to <hi>Petilian</hi> the <hi>Donatist, I object to you the
crime of Schism which you wil deny: And I wil
presently prove, because you do not communicate
with all Nations.</hi> I may add, speaking to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
<hi>Not with any one Nation or church
pre-existent to Luther. Calvin</hi> confesseth that
he divided <hi>à toto orbe terrarum,</hi> from the whole
world, and so do other <hi>Protestants:</hi> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
it self cannot deny, but that in respect
of externall communion they have to this day
relinquished the whole world; attempts have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
beene made to get an entrance into the
Greek church, but in vain, for they have beene
rejected, and remitted to the obedience of their
own Patriarch, as appears by the letter of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remias
Patriarcha &amp;c.</hi> And therefore for a
proof unanswerable, that the Schisme of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
is a separation not from a particular
church (as they call the Roman) but from all
<hi>Christian Churches</hi> all the world over, let them
suppose the same question proposed to them,
which the Emperor <hi>Basilius</hi> made to <hi>Photius,</hi>
the <hi>Pseudo-Patriarch of Constantinople, With
which of the four Patriarchs do you communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate?</hi> So that as the same S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith in
the same book, <hi>Hoc scelus &amp; maximum, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestum,
&amp; omnium vestrum est.</hi> i. e. <hi>This
crime</hi> (of forsaking Universall communion) <hi>is
both of all other the greatest, and a manifest
one, and belongs to all the sorts of you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. If they say they preserve the bond of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
allowing a possibility of salvation to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
onely they separate from Catholique
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46209:201"/>
errors which would be damnable to them being
so perswaded. What is this to <hi>Externall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</hi>
Adde hereto, that though English
Protestants, for their own interests, to justifie
the lawfulnesse of their Succession, doe allow
such a degree of charity to Catholiques; yet it
is manifest that they renounce not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Calvinists, &amp;c. who deny that there was
any true church in the world when <hi>Luther</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his sacrilegious Apostacy, and so involve
themselves in the same uncharitablenesse. <hi>Some
there are that say (saith S.</hi> Augustine Ep. 48.)

               <p>
                  <hi>5. If they say, we left only the abuses practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Catholique church, which no man
can justly blame another for reforming; What
is this still to an absolute forsaking of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

coat. Gaud, l.</hi> 1. c. 7.) whether the church
at that time when you say she entertained those

Answer, whether did the church perish, or not?
Make choice of what you think good. If she then
perished, what church brought forth <hi>Donatus?</hi>
But if she could not perish, because so many
were incorporated into her without Baptisme;

answer me I pray you; What madnesse did move
the Sect of <hi>Donatus</hi> to separate themselves from
her upon the pretence of avoiding the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of bad men?</p>
               <p>6. Therefore Protestants do in vaine please
themselves with this word of Reformation: and
with telling the world that many, even good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,
both in antient and later times, have
earnestly called for a Reformation. For no man
denies but that there ha's been great need of it,
and is to this day, <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of doctrines
and practises of particulars, and those too too
many. But can any one Catholique in any age
be produced that called for a change of any one
point of doctrine established in the church, or a
reformation of any practise authoritatively set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
there as unlawfull? not one such as yet hath
been produced, and I am confident not one can;
and much lesse any one that upon such pretences
hath either counselled or execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed a division in
the church. To what purpose then a separation
from the externall communion of the whole
church upon this ground of reforming particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
abuses, which may lawfully and without any
blame be done by an inward Schisme, or
mentall separation from errours and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7. Therefore when Protestants beast so much
of their purifications and reformations, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
may desire S.</hi> Augustine <hi>(cont. Gaud. l.
1.) to tell them for them,</hi> You have indeed great
matters which you may flourish among your
righteousnesses, <hi>(and reformations:)</hi> namely, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
division of Christ, an annulling of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:46209:202"/>
of Christ, a forsaking of the peace of
Christ, warre against the members of Christ,
calumnious accusations against the Spouse of
Christ, and a denying of the promises of Christ.
<hi>The same Father</hi> (de unit. Eccles.) <hi>likewise
will tell them, that if they would have thought
good to follow our Saviours example, they
would not upon such pretences have forsaken
the externall communion of the church:</hi> For
<hi>(sayes he)</hi> when he was to be circumcised was
<hi>John</hi> sought after? for that thing was used to be
performed by the Jewes. And when a legall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was to be offered for him, was there any
scruple made of that Temple, which was by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
called a den of thieves? For the Lord
which said, Be ye holy because I am holy, doth
make his servants to converse among wicked
men so unspottedly, if they preserve that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which they receive, as the Lord Jesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was not defiled with the least contagion of
wickedness during the time that he lived among
the Jewish Nation: neither when be being made
under the law, underwent those first Sacraments
according to that most perfect way of humility,
neither afterward when having chosen his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
he lived in the company of his own Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
even till the last (<hi>parting</hi>) kiss. For by his
example not only those who do no wicked things,
but those likewise who consent not to any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
are wheat securely remaining among
chaffe because they neither do such things, nor
consent with them that do them; although being
themselves good, they patiently suffer the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
continning in the same field, untill the
harvest, in the same floore untill the winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46209:202"/>
within the same nets, untill the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which shall be made upon the shore <hi>(i. e. at
the end of the world.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>8. And this doctrine the same Father presseth
so constantly, so zealously, that he</hi> professeth
that any separation that is made in the Church
upon what pretence soever before the day of
judgment, is a sacriledge inexcuseable. <hi>Let them
therefore study what excuses they please, and
conjure up as many objections as they think
good,</hi> truth it self (<hi>speaking by S.</hi> Augustines
<hi>mouth</hi> Ep. <hi>48.) will or ought to silence them for
ever,</hi> Certi sumus neminem se à communione
omnium Gentium justè separare potuisse. <hi>i. e.</hi>
We are assured that no man can justly separate
himself from the communion of all Nations.
<hi>And again saith the same</hi> Oracle (Cont. ep. Parm.
l. <hi>2.</hi>) Praecedendae unitatis nulla est necessitas. <hi>i.
e.</hi> There is no necessity to cut Unity asunder. <hi>And
again</hi> (l. 2. cont. Gaud.) Aute tempus littoris
damnabiliter separant. <hi>i. e.</hi> Before the time come
that the net is to be drawn ashore, the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which men make are damnable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>9. Which speeches of S.</hi> Augustine <hi>will be
true till the end of the world being built upon
the promises of</hi> Christ, that his church should
continue for ever in all truth, secure against the
gates of hell; <hi>and upon the command of</hi> Christ,
<hi>that no separation should be made of the tares
from the wheat til the last day of harvest, in which</hi>
Exibunt Angeli &amp; separabunt, <hi>i. e.</hi> Angels <hi>(not
men)</hi> shall go forth and separate: <hi>By occasion of
which text the same Father annexes these pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
words, speaking to the Donatists, (con. ep.
Par. l. 2.)</hi> Let them chuse <hi>(saith he)</hi> whether of the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46209:203"/>
two they will rather believe; Jesus Christ, that
is, Truth it self saith, The field is the world;
and <hi>Donatus</hi> saith, that Gods field is Africa
alone. Let them chuse whether of these two
they had rather believe. Jesus Christ, that is
Truth it selfe saith, In the time of harvest I
will say to the reapers, gather first the tares;
and interprets it, saying, the harvest is the end
of the world; And <hi>Donatus</hi> saith, that by the
separation of his party, the tares are separated
from the wheat before the harvest. Jesus Christ,
that is Truth it self saith, the reapers are the
Angells; and <hi>Donatus</hi> saith, that himself and
his associates have done that before the harvest,
which Jesus Christ saith that the Angells are
to do at the harvest. Let them chuse whether of
these two they had rather believe. They call
themselves Christians, we propose to them Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

will become of them, if they bestow only words
upon Jesus Christ, and their bearts upon <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus?

               <p>10. Therefore to shew the extreme in justice
of English Protestants against the Catholique
Church, and the just judgement of God upon
<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>for it, we may desire them to consider,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46209:203"/>
that in their owne congregations they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to connive at both errours in doctrine,
and abuses in practise to support a Schismaticall
Unity, which they would not suffer for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Unity. So S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes to the
Donatists (lib. 2.) <hi>Why do they,</hi> saith he, <hi>perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
suffer such kind of men in the crime of
a Sacrilegious Schisme, which they might</hi> (and
ought) <hi>to have tolerated profitably in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of</hi> (Catholique) <hi>Unity?</hi> Again, let them
consider with what justice they can condemne
the other Sects, Presbyterians and Separatists,
if they seek the same destructive way of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, which themselves practised upon the
Catholiques: For the Presbyterians will alledge
Scripture, as well as they; they will pretend er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and superstitions, as well as they: And
the Separatists beyond this will alledge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that which it will be impossible for them
to reply reasonably to, for they will say, <q>Since
you your selves have taken away all obliging
humane authority in points of Religion, give
us leave to enjoy that liberty for our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
which you have purchased us: we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
not to tyrannize over other men, only we
would not suffer that you should pretend by a
shew of liberty to introduce tyranny.</q> If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
shall oppose secular power or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to such allegations, that will be to confesse
that their reformation was a meere worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
If they shall say that it is not fit that a smal
conventicle of Sectaries should prevail against
a Nationall Synod of the English Clergy; then
they must not take it ill to have those efficacious
words of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> applyed unto them, <hi>Is
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:46209:204"/>
the just weighing of matters come to this passe,
that a Councell of the Maximianenses, who are
an under-segment of your Sect, shall have no
force or consideration against you, because in
comparison of your numbers they are but a very
few, and shall a Councell of your own prevaile
against Nations, against the heritage of Christ,
and the ends of the earth his possession? I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if that man have any bloud left in his body,
that should not blush at the mentioning of such
a thing as this.</hi> Aug. Ep. 154. ad Emer. Don.</p>
               <p>11. I will conclude this conclusion with a
brief consideration of an accusation which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
lay against Catholiques, whom they
charge with extreme uncharitablenesse, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
<hi>that Protestants dying in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
without repentance cannot be saved.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it is answered, that Catholiques do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to judge of the salvation or damnation
of Protestants in particular, yea they will not
doubt to say that to many thousands of them
neither their Heresie nor Schisme shall prove <hi>de
facto</hi> damnable, but that supposing they dye
with an intention to renounce whatsoever their
opinions should appear to them to have been er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
their invincible ignorance caused by
education, misinformation of Catholique do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
&amp;c. may probably find pardon from
our mercifull Judge, in case they be truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for all other faults committed by them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
supposition that any such have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
But surely it is no
uncharitable judgement to
say in generall,<note place="margin">V. Lugo de fid. Disp. 12. Sect. 2.</note>
                  <hi>That it is
damnable to dye in a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:46209:204"/>
or mortall sinne without repentance:</hi>
And therefore since even by <hi>Protestants</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
Heresie and Schisme are in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
damnable sins, and since Catholiques are
verily perswaded that Protestants are guilty of
these two crimes, it may be called in them a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
but it cannot be called uncharitablenesse
in Catholiques upon such a supposition to make
such a judgement. Yea on the contrary I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how the English Protestants, &amp;c. who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that Catholiques are guilty of these two
crimes, can notwithstanding contrary to the
doctrine of all Antiquity, affirm that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are not in a damable estate; surely it is self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilt,
and not charity that makes them so chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>

it may seem to be done with great exactnesse and

of his body, insomuch as be suffers us not

               <argument>
                  <p>Application of these proofes, to the
advantage of the Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

&amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THe cause therefore is clear in the generall
<hi>Thesis,</hi> that the Fathers opinion was, that
by vertue of Christs expresse promises, his
church was to continue visible and distinguisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from all other unlawfull congregations to
the worlds end. This I do not find denied by
the <hi>English Protestants,</hi> I mean neither that
this was the sense of the Fathers, nor that this
sense was ture.</p>
               <p>2. The great controversie therefore is in the
<hi>Hypothesis,</hi> or application of the generall <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
viz. whether that such conclusions as the
Fathers deduce from the visibility of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
church in their dayes, may rationally
be inferred from the Roman Catholique church
visible in these dayes. For example, that it is
unlawfull upon any pretence of errors or abuses
in practise, to separate from the externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of that church, which now calls it selfe
the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> (which is only the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
for the Grecian churches, though they
challenge the title of <hi>Catholique Churches,</hi> that
is, true members of the <hi>Catholique,</hi> yet I doe
not find that they make an association to their
externall communion, a necessary condition to
all <hi>Christians.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:46209:207"/>3. The English Protestants say no, against all
Roman Catholiques, who unanimously affirm,
that since such discourses of the Fathers were
grounded upon Christs promises to his church,
which were to be effectuall to the end of the
world, that therefore they are as fitly and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
to be applied to the present, as to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Catholike church, and that no other church,
but that in communion with the Roman, can
make any valuable or legitimate pretentions to
that title. Though the truth is, if it be to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that there is any visible Catholique church at
all, whose externall communion is necessary, the
Protestants are inexcuseably culpable, since they
neither would nor could upon their grounds
communicate with any church in the world that
was in being, when <hi>Luther</hi> began his Apostacy.</p>
               <p>4. In this controversie therefore, upon these
following considerations and grounds. I fully
satisfied my self, that the plea of Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
was just and reasonable. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Though
English Protestants deny the Roman church to
be the Catholique church (<hi>cum Emphase;</hi>) yet
they acknowledge her to be a true member at
least of the Catholique church; being forced
hereto for their own interest to justifie the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of their Ordinations, &amp;c. And this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
alone is sufficient to condemne
them for their separation as guilty of Schisme,
since he who separates from an acknowledged
true member of the Catholique church, doth
consequently separate from the Catholique
church.</p>
               <p>5. Secondly they acknowledge that the whole
body of the present Catholique church enjoyes
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:46209:207"/>
the same priviledges and authority, that it did
in the times of the antient Fathers: that a
Schisme from it is as pernicious as antiently:
that a truly Generall Councell now is as obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and unappealable from as heretofore: And
upon these grounds they will condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
since it is apparent, that if the Easterne
churches were assumed together with the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
to make up the full body of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
most of the opinions and pretended er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
upon which they ground the lawfulnesse
and necessity of their separation, will appear to
be the doctrines of the church called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
even in their sense, as e. g. acknowledging
the <hi>blessed Sacrament to be a proper Sacrifice
propitiatory for quick and dead, the Reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
(per modum transmutationis) Prayer for
Dead and Purgatory, Invocation of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ines,
Veneration of Images, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore if
all the four Patriarches had met at the Councell
of Trent, they had Infallibly concur'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the Protestants as Heretiques in these
points, and their separation upon such grounds
is Schisme, properly so called.</p>
               <p>6. Thirdly it appeared evidently to me, that
those communions and congregations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
which acknowledge subjection to the
Pope, could only rightfully challenge the name
of the Catholique church, For 1. I took it for
granted that that which was called the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
church after the times of the four first Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councells, when the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ans, Photinians,
Macedonians, Nestorians, Eurychians &amp;c. were
anathematized, was indeed the onely tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
church; by which account the Abyssine
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:46209:208"/>
churches, as being (at least, antiently) Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and severall Eastern churches, as Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Jacobi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, &amp;c. were and are to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from that denomination; which yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
now, although they dare not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with them, would admit into the body of
the church; but most unreasonably; for if the
Abyssines continue yet Eutychians, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
of England (who receive the foure first
Generall Councells) do thereby acknowledge
them to be Heretiques; if they have quitted Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychianisme,
and really adjoyned themselves to
the Roman church (according to severall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassies
mentioned by <hi>Damianus à Goes &amp;c.</hi>)
then Protestants will find it so much more to
their disadvantage to argue any thing from the
Abyssine churches. 2. I could observe nothing,
which could make me doubt that that which
was called the Catholique church from the four
first Generall Councells to <hi>S. Gregories</hi> the
<hi>Greats</hi> dayes <hi>inclusivè,</hi> was indeed so. For if
in S. <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes there was a Catholique
church (is Protestants grant there was) then
that which was in communion and subjection
to him was only it, since none that I know pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to allow that title to any congregation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from him. Now in the church of S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi>
time it is apparent that in a manner all
points of Doctrine (now by Protestants called
errours and causes of their separation) were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally
acknowledged as Catholique do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
as I shewed before by a joynt confession
of the most learned Protestant writers, by which
they vertually confesse, that if they had lived in
S. <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes they would as well have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:46209:208"/>
from him. Besides it appeares by
S. <hi>Gregories</hi> Epistles that he as Pope en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a supereminent authority, and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citously
exercised a care over all Christian
churches: As for his Jurisdiction, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,</hi>
and the extension thereof, that I
took not here into consideration, since it
is not a point pretended to be an Article
of Faith. 3. From S. <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes,
till the separation of the East from the
externall jurisdiction, rather then the Faith
of the Pope and Western churches, the
whole body of the church under one visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Head remained, as it did before, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
the title of the Catholique church,
no other pretending thereto. 4. Since the
Division of the East from the Westerne
churches (caused as I conceive, upon a quarrell
about the Popes Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction,
and not any point of Doctrine) the limits of
the Catholique church seem to be much streit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Concerning which Schisme (if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Schisme properly so called) I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no necessity to be very curious to inform my
self, being perswaded during the time of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Protestant, that, as for that one point of
belief, concerning the <hi>Procession of the Holy
Ghost,</hi> wherein the Greek church expresseth
her self otherwise then the Roman, if in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and sense there be a reall difference, that
the Roman church was Orthodox. And besides
that, I know not any point of doctrine wherein
the Greek church agrees with Protestants to
condemn the Roman church. It is true they
communicate in both kinds, but I could never
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:46209:209"/>
find that the Greeks made that point any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of their division from the Roman, neither
indeed can they, since <hi>they also give the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist
to the sick onely in one kind,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
withall, that such communicants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the whole effect of the Sacrament. As for
the story of the Schisme, it was begun by <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
the <hi>Pseudo-Patriarch of Constantinople</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ambition and interest, because the Pope
would not confirm his illegall intrusion into
that Chair; which generally ha's been a fatall
occasion of almost all Schismes, as long since
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath observed. Lastly it is manifest
that those rights of Jurisdiction also, which
(since that Schisme) have been denied by the
Greeks to the Pope, were not then begun to be
demanded, but had been possessed by him for
severall ages; so that there was at least injustice,
if not error, on the Grecians part.</p>
               <p>7. Fourthly, that the <hi>Pope, as successor of
S. Peter, Prince</hi> of the Apostles, ha's a prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and superiority over all <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi>
yea an authority over the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
church, so that he may truly be called the
<hi>Head of the Church,</hi> ha's been delivered by so
constant and universal a Tradition, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without extreme impudence be denied.
Now how far this superiority and authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
I thought it needlesse curiously to inform
my self, since, as far as I can learn, all that the
church requires in this point even from ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
persons, is a subscription to this professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mentioned in the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius IV</hi>
annexed to the Councell of Trent, and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
out of the same, viz. <hi>Romano Pontifici
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:46209:209"/>
Beati Petri Apostolorum Principis successori,
ac Jesu Christi. Uicario, veram obedientiam
spondeo ae juro.</hi> i. e. <hi>I do promise and sweare
true obedience to the Pope of Rome, successor
of blessed S. Peter Prince of the Apostles, and
Vicar of Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Now that thus much is of universall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
what greater proof can be desired then
may be afforded us in a late book entituled <hi>Les
Grandeurs dell' Eglise Romaine,</hi> where such a
world of testimonies out of <hi>Councells Occume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
and Provinciall, Popes, Fathers,</hi> both
<hi>Eastern and Westerne Histories Ecclesiasticall
&amp;c.</hi> are produced to maintain the <hi>Co-union</hi> of
S. <hi>Paul</hi> with S. <hi>Peter</hi> in at least <hi>some degree</hi> of
his universall authority, which not withstanding
are not an hundredth part of that which may be

learned French controvertist that ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
their common quarrell against the Pope,
in that large volume which is spent in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
particular extravagant opinions concerning
that subject, as touching the <hi>infallibility and

(which is very remarkable) he

that of Florence nor Trent it
self ever adventured to define
any thing concerning such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
titles and power as the Popes Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans
do attribute to him.</hi>
But on the contrary,
<hi>that the titles of the Apostle S.</hi> Peter <hi>ought not
to be put in debate, since that the Grecians and
Protestants also do confesse that it hath beone
believed, and that it might be indeed that he
was the President and Head or Chiefe (Chef)
of the Apostles, the foundation of the Church,
and possessor of the Keys of the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
Yea moreover, <hi>That Rome, as being a
Church consecrated by the residence and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome
of S. Peter, whom antiquity hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be the Head (Chef) of the
College Apostolique, having been honored with
the title of the Seat of the Apostle S.</hi> Peter,
<hi>might without difficulty be considered by one of
the most renowned Councells (viz. that of
Chalcedon as Head (Chef) of the Church:</hi>
Which is in effect to acknowledge that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
doctrine of the Roman church concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:46209:210"/>
the Popes Primacy and Authority is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.</p>
               <p>9. Upon which grounds, since it appeares to
have been an universall Tradition of the church
(besides expresse words of Scripture) that
the Catholique Church was to remaine visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the end of the world, that is, a church
possessed of all substantiall Christian doctrines,
preserved in all truth, governed by lawfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours,
as one body consisting of ruling and
ruled members under one visible head, (which
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes the foundation of Unity Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall)
I concluded (as I thought, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally)
that that part of the Christian world,
which continued in Communion with, and
obedience to this so acknowledged Supreme
Authority, might and ought most justly
to challenge <hi>the title of the Catholique
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Therefore though the priviledge of an
independent Patriarchall church (which the
English Protestants of late begin to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
to the end to excuse their church from
the title of Schisme, for withdrawing it selfe
from the Popes Jurisdiction) were just and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;
yet they will never be able to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for disbelieving what they together with
all the other Western churches so many ages
agreed to have been true, or for denying the
title of Oecumenicall Head to the Pope. Let
it be supposed therefore, what some of them
alledge, that it is in the power of such a <hi>King
of England,</hi> as <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
consent of his Clergy, to erect the English
church into a Patriarchate, as <hi>Justinian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:46209:211"/>
did <hi>Justinianaea Prima:</hi> Or that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
being an Island like <hi>Cyprus,</hi> might have the
priviledge to be independent of any Patriarch;
all that will follow thereon, will be only, that
the Pope as <hi>Patriarch of the West</hi> shall by
this meanes be deprived of some <hi>Patriarchall
Jurisdictions, Investitures, Rights of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,
&amp;c.</hi> which have antiently been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to be withdrawn from him by the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Churches,</hi> &amp;c. Yet what is this to his title
of S. <hi>Peters Successor,</hi> and <hi>Head of the Church?</hi>
Or was <hi>Justinianaea</hi> or the <hi>Isle of Cyprus</hi> so
independent in matters of point of Faith or
publique practise on the <hi>Pope</hi> or other <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi>
or however, on a Generall Councell,
as that they could <hi>dejure</hi> alter any thing esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by <hi>Universall Authority?</hi> Could they
renverse decisions of Oecumenicall Councells?
Or did they ever usurp such an authority to
themselves, as to impute superstition, idolatry,
prophaneness, heresies, &amp;c. to all other churches,
under a shew of Reformation, ruining the whole
order of Discipline and Belief, confessedly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the whole church for above a thousand
years? Till they can produce examples of an
authority of Reformation of such a nature assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by any Catholique Prince or particular
Kingdome, the other pretended right of exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Jurisdiction will be so far from excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them, that it will make it apparent to the
world, that it was meerly their Princes lusts,
ambition and unquenchable thirst after ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
revenewes, that first put the thought of
Reformation into their heads, and that upon
as just grounds they may expect from others a
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:46209:211"/>
Reformation of their Reformation, which will
perhaps prove more durable, when those baits
shall be utterly taken away, which first whetned
their wits to contrive that project of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>11. For my own part therefore, seeing these
severall conclusions concerning <hi>the Catholique
Churches indefectibility, authority, unity, and
Visibility,</hi> so unanimously attested, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and made use of by all Antiquity, with so

no such method practised by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants

with one another, yea to the utter despair there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:

               </argument>
               <p>1. AFter that Almighty God had changed
that, which was to me a stone of offence,
into a rock of foundation, making me to find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of mind in submitting to the authority of
his church, which by reason of my former mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehensions
I carefully avoided; as if the
greatest danger that a Christian could be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of had beene to be a member of <hi>Christs
mysticall body, which is his Church,</hi> or as if
the hearkning to the <hi>Church</hi> had been the way
to make a man worse then a <hi>Heathen and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi>
I then found an experimentall knowledge
of the truth of that speech of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
(cont. Lucifer.) viz. <hi>that the Sun of the
Church presently dryes up all rivelets of errors,</hi>
and dispells all the mists of naturall reason:
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:46209:213"/>
as likewise of that of the <hi>Prophet, Quicredit,
intelliget,</hi> i. e. <hi>He that believes shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand:</hi>
For being arrived to the top of that
mountaine, upon which God had built his
church, I found clear weather on all hands, I
found that there remained nothing for me to do
afterwards, but to hearken to, and obey her,
that both Scripture and Fathers, and now mine
own reason taught me was only worthy to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.
And therefore the truth is, here should
be an end of my <hi>Exomologesis,</hi> or account of
my inward disputes about controversies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Religion, which quickly ceased, after
that I left off to be mine own Guide and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
               <p>2. Notwithstanding among the particular
controversies in debate between the Romane
Catholiques and other Sects, I will select espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
six of the most principall, on purpose to
shew, that if any regard had been had either to
the authority or peace of Gods church, there
would never have been any differences about
them, and that in the judgement even of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Protestants, the differences are indeed of
so small weight, that if there had been amongst
them but the least measure of charity, or if
Schisme had not been esteemed by them a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
they would never have made such fatall
and deadly divisions upon pretences so unconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>3. They indeed lay to the charge of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
church novelties in doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises:
and yet Catholiques, even out of those
few that remain, of the most antient Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
Authors, shew clear proofes of these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:46209:213"/>
and practises, and desire no more of
them, then that they would speak in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the antient church: They accuse her
of impieties, and idolatries, and superstitions,
yet Catholiques shew them that the most
holy, learned Saints and Martyrs that ever were
in Gods church practised and maintained such
pretended superstitions, &amp;c. They accuse her of
Schisme, for not separating from her selfe and
and the whole world, and for not being able to
hinder them from committing that most sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious
crime; and they impute Heresie to her,
for being constant in maintaining the decisions
of all Councells, and the profession of all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and ages.</p>
               <p>4. But before I examine the vanity of these
imputations by stating those six particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
I shall desire our English Protestants
to meditate sadly upon two subjects especially.
The first is, Which way they can imagine it to
be possible that an errour should imperceptibly
creep into the belief and practise of the whole
church, even setting aside the security we have
against any such mischiefe by the meanes of
Christs promises? For was it not true, which
antiquity testifies, yea and S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely,
that the Apostles and Apostolicall men
were instant in season, and out of season, to
make known to the primitive Christians, and
to inculcate diligently and laboriously into their
minds the whole sum of Christian doctrine, not
<hi>forbearing both publiquely, and from house to
house to reveal to them the whole will of God,
not suppressing any thing that was profitable,
(Act, 20. 20. 27.)</hi> And this so fully and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46209:214"/>
as that if an <hi>Angell from heaven could</hi>
be supposed to <hi>teach any thing,</hi> not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
but<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>i. e. <hi>besides that which they
had taught, he was to be accursed, Galat.</hi> 1. 8.
Then do not the Fathers tell us (and what
proof can Protestants produce to make them
appear to be lyars, when they tell us) that at least
for five hundred years all caution imagineable
was used to prevent and exclude any novelties,
that any Heretiques, yea or any Christians,
though as learned as <hi>Origen,</hi> or as holy as
S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> should attempt to introduce? May
we not adde hereto, that whatsoever novelties
of the least moment should be obtruded by any,
would discover themselves to be novelties, by
thwarting the publique profession and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
devotions of the church? as S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
Rebaptization would oblige all men to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
that which they had alwayes forborne:
and the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Pelagian &amp;c.</hi> impieties
would constrain the church to alter the formes
of prayers to the Sonne of God, and for Gods
Grace to cure the impotence and perversenesse
of nature, acknowledged in the daily pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
confessions. Upon which grounds,
S. <hi>Cyril</hi> against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and S. <hi>Leo</hi> against
<hi>Eutyches,</hi> disprove the errours and impieties
of their Heresies, by producing the profession
and practise of the church in administring the
holy Eucharist, whereby she restified her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of a reall presence of the very body and
bloud of Christ there, which could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with their Novelties. So that upon the
same ground, if <hi>Invocation of Saints, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and offering the most holy Sacrifice for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46209:214"/>
of sinnes to the dead, Veneration of
Images, &amp;c.</hi> had been novelties, would not
such practises have more directly thwarted the
publique devotions of the church, then the
Heresies of <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches:</hi> How was
it possible then that such doctrines should have
been taught by any particular Father, (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
they have been) and not any one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that should discover and protest against
such innovations? what charme was there in
these doctrines above all others, to cast the
church into a sleep, that she should not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, or to silence the Fathers, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their custome in all other innovations
they should not open their mouths against them?
And much more, how was it possible that the
publique Liturgies and devotions of the church
should come to be changed by admitting such
pretended novelties and superstitions, and yet
no signes or footsteps be left that such a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
change ha's been made, not one writer
to be found that can tell us of any one that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it.</p>
               <p>5. The second thing that I desire them to
consider is, That since it is at this day, and ha's
been for many ages the universall belief of the
church, that all such pretended Novelties were
indeed Catholique and Apostolique Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
what arguments Protestants can reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
esteeme sufficient to disprove this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
and to dispossesse the church of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure?
Will the silence of one or two Fathers,
think they, be of force enough to such a
purpose? If so, I doubt whether the church
would then be able to maintaine any one
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46209:215"/>
Article of Faith. Would a few seeming diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and obscure, seemingly opposite quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
out of some writings of a few Fathers
serve their turn? It did not so in the cause of
the <hi>Arians,</hi> of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> of the <hi>Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
&amp;c. and why only in the present controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies?
Will quotations of Scripture decide the
questions against the present church? Indeed if
it could be imagineable, that the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
church could at the same time, and with
the same hand, deliver us Scripture and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
contrary to expresse Scripture, if she
could be supposed either so foolish as not to see
that which no body could be ignorant of, or so
wicked, as (clearly seeing what God said) to
command us not to believe him, but rather the
quite contrary, then she might deserve to be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Schismaticall, because she continues in such
a wicked unity; and Hereticall, because she
would not submit her judgement and aushority
to the passions and lust of an Apostate Monke.
But even Protestants themselves will absolve her
from such a high degree of guilt, as to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
expresse and formall Scripture. And as for
Texts of Scripture, either obscure or ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ationally admitting severall interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though to some prejudicate ears they may
seem to sound otherwise then the church teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
in all reason and honesty the churches inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of them ought to prevail against any
private mans: I am sure all sorts of Sects will
either submit their judgements to the sense of
their particular churches, or at least will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their opinions, when they cannot submit
them; this civility and duty teaches all men.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46209:215"/>
But as for the children of the Catholike church,
they have an obligation binding them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to trust the same church for the sense of
Scripture (especially in points which she sayes
are of <hi>Universall Tradition</hi>) which they have
trusted for the Scripture it selfe; and therefore
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> said well, and like a perfectly
good <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Catholique, The words of
Scripture are so to be understood, as the world
hath believed them, which that it should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripture hath foretold.</hi> And surely
he that will duely consider of what weight the
universal testimony of a whole age of the church
is to prove a Tradition, will never think that a
few objections, or obscure passages either in
Scriptures, or two or three Fathers, who are apt
to speak unwarily, when the matter is not in
controversie; should decide the cause against it,
especially considering that it is almost impossible
to receive absolute satisfaction of the doctrine
of former ages any other way, or at least any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way so well, as by the universall agreement
of the present age, that so the former ages deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to her, What shall we say then, when to
the evident testimony of the present age for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
verities may be added a world of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
both of Scripture and antient writers,
beyond all comparison far more then for her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
contradictory assertions, even those ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
themselves being judges, as will appeare
undeniably to any man that will consult that
one book of <hi>Brercley's Apology of Protestants
for the Catholique church.</hi>

under one Species.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THe six speciall controversies which I
shall briefly consider, shall be; 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Eucharist, and therein of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Presence of Christs body by way of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation:</hi>
as likewise, <hi>Of the Adoration
of our Lord present in the Sacrament; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

Saints. 3. Of Veneration of Images. 4. Of
Prayer for the Dead, and Purgatory. 5. Of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences.
6. Of the Publike Service in Latin.</hi>
The reason why I make choice of these is, both
because these are the especiall controversies,
wherein there is a reall and manifest difference
between Catholiques and Protestants, who
make these points the principall causes of their
separation: For as concerning the debates about
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Free-will, Predestination</hi> and <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
as likewise the <hi>merits of good works,</hi>
though ignorant-popular-preaching Protestants
make a great clamour about them, yet I was
most assured, that there was indeed a reall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
when they came to explaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sensibly about them. As for the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
concerning the Pope, I have spoken suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
in the 52. chapter, at the latter end of
the <hi>fourth conclusion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:46209:216"/>2. First therefore concerning the Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christs body in the Eucharist, and
that by way of Transubstantiation: In dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
upon which, because my designe is
not to write the controversie in generall, but
only in reference to the doctrine, which, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the church of England, I was taught
there; it will be sufficient for me to signifie,
that by that church I was taught that in the
blessed Sacrament the body and bloud of our
Lord were really present, exhibited and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Communicants, really I say, not
onely as the objects of Faith, or not onely
as really exhibiting the effects of Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;
but as truly and properly as the Roman
church professeth, onely I was forbidden to
say that there was any reall change made in
the bread and Wine, which remained after
Consecration, as they were before: In a word,
I was taught to say, what neither I nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was able to expresse, save onely that the
Romish doctrine was false, which taught that
that presence was made by a presence of Christs
body under the Species (which only remained)
of the visible elements.</p>
               <p>3. Now when, I say, that I was taught to
expresse my belief thus by the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
my intention is not that that church obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
every one to believe thus; For the truth is,
so a man will but renounce the two words of
<hi>Transubstantion,</hi> and <hi>Consubstantiation,</hi> he
may, preserving the terme really, interpret him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
as if really signified only figuratively, or
as the object of the understanding, as we see
a world of writers allowed there to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:46209:217"/>
themselves: Yea in the 28. and 29.
<hi>Articles of that Church</hi> there are certain clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which require only a figurative sense to be
understood, as when it is said, <hi>The body of
Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
only after an heavenly and spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and the mean whereby the body of Christ is
received and eaten in the supper, is Faith.</hi> And
again, <hi>The wicked &amp;c. are in no wise partakers
of Christ, but rather to their condemnation do
eat and drink the sign or Sacrament of so great a
thing.</hi> Which clauses being allowed, those <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
do admit, yea require not only the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistical,</hi>
but even the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> sense concerning
that point. Yet notwithstanding this, whether the
<hi>Calvinisticall party</hi> there had with their usuall
importunity extorted the inserting of those
clauses into the <hi>Articles, I know not,</hi> yet those
that followed the <hi>Prelaticall Governing Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
never considered those expressions, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>Calvinisticall hyps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie</hi>
professed that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the <hi>Reall Presence</hi> as
truly and really and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the <hi>Catholiques</hi> did:<note place="margin">See the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Poissy.</note> And so King <hi>James</hi>
commanded <hi>Monsieur Casaubon</hi> to signifie his
sense to <hi>Cardinall Perron</hi> in the words of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Andrews, then Bishop of Ely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Now what other reason can be imagined
should move the most learned and prudent part
of the English Clergy to expresse themselves so
neer the Catholique sense, but only a convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that besides the formall words of Scripture,
the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Tradition</hi> and generall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Fathers enforced such a sense? But
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46209:217"/>
by what mystery it came to passe that they should
dispense with themselves for following <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
no further; but that under a pretence that
the Sacrament was a mystery inexplicable, they
should forsake the same <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi>
who generally professe, that <hi>that presence is
made by a reall transmutation of the visible ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into the very Body and Blood of Christ,</hi>
this I confesse I could never comprehend.</p>
               <p>5. Now that such was the <hi>Traditionary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of the Catholique church, (besides the
testimony of the present age, which will be of
infinite weight to any one that duly considers
it) and to omit a world of quotations out of
Councells and Fathers, wherein expressions to
prove the same are as full, yea perhaps more <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid</hi>
then the <hi>Decision</hi> of the Councell of Trent
it selfe, I became convinced from these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. Because in all the antient <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi>
that ever I saw, there are expresse mention
of the verity and reality of this change, and not
any the least intimation of a figurative sense:
there are expresse prayers that God would by
his omnipotent power cause the Bread and Wine
to become the Body and Bloud of our Lord,
and not the least intimation, that the way of
<hi>communicating</hi> of these <hi>mysteries</hi> should be only
by Faith, or by the operation of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
2. Because in the form of <hi>communicating</hi>
both in the Easterne and Westerne churches,
(which form or Canon, S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> S. <hi>Basile, &amp;c.</hi> attribute to
the Apostles themselves as authors) there was
required from the communicants a confession
of their beliefe of the reality of this change; or
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:46209:218"/>
to expresse it in S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his language, (<hi>de
Sacr. l. 4. c.</hi> 3.) <hi>The Priest (viz.</hi> presenting
to thee that which before consecration was
bread) <hi>saith unto thee, This is the body of
Christ, and thou answerest, Amen, that is to
say, it is true; That which the tongue confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
let the heart believe.</hi> 3. Because generally
the Fathers when they speak of
this argument, have recourse to
the omnipotence of the Word of
Christ,<note place="margin">Vid. Iren. l. 4. c. 34. S. Cyril. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

credibility, as the cause of
this change, thereby leaving no
doubt that they understood a
conversion (not significative,
but) reall, true and substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
4. Because the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to make their auditours
more capable of the mystery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie
in other kinds of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
or conversions, as of the
change of the Bread which
Christ did eat, into his owne
flesh; of the miraculous conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of water into wine; of <hi>Moyses</hi>
rod into a serpent; and the
waters of Nile into blood. Which language would
be extremely ridiculous, if they intended not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and substantial change. 5. To prove that they
understood not only a presence of Christ in the
action of the Sacrament (as some English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
explain themselves) or a presence consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with a Lutheranical coëxistence of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of bread and wine, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> will satisfie
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:46209:218"/>
us, who answering that very objection that the
difficulties would be less if it were affirmed that
the substance of bread and wine remained toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the body and blood of Christ after the
consecration, hath these words, <hi>de Sacr. l. 4. To the
first objection we must thus answer, That in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of faith a man ought not to make choice of
that which is accompanied with less difficulties,
for otherwise we should affirm that in God there
is one only hypostasis &amp;c. But he ought to affirm
that which is most conformable to the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the holy Fathers, and to the Tradition of
the Church, although never so many difficulties
present themselves, seeing that he ought to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
his understanding under the obedience of
Faith.</hi> So likewise S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> quoted by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret
in Dialog.</hi> 3. speaks of certain <hi>Heretikes
who received not the Oblations and Eucharists;
because they believed not that the Eucharist was
the flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Which is a
proof undeniable, that the most primitive church
taught this Catholike dgctrine of the reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
for if there had beene onely a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
presence, what pretence
could those Heretikes have
to resuse them.<note place="margin">Vid. Aug. Psal. 98. Ambros. de sp. 5. l. 3. Chrysost. in 1. Cor. Hom. 24: Nazian. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. Gorg. Theod. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 2.</note> 6. Because both
the antient Liturgies and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the church do testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the generall custome of
Gods people to adore Christ
present upon the Altar af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Consecration: and
this not onely in the time
of administration, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
also, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46209:219"/>
that that which remained, was and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
truly the body of Christ, according to
those words of S. <hi>Cyrill</hi>
of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyril. Al. Ep. ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losyr.</note> 
                  <hi>I know what they
say, namely, That the mysticall
benediction, if any reliques re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
of it to the next day, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to sanctification. But they that say
thus are mad: For there is not another Christ
made, neither can his holy body be changed,
but the vertue of the benediction and the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Grace remains perpetually in it. 7. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
because by this argument of the reall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
of the visible elements into the body of
Christ the <hi>third Generall Councell of Ephesus,</hi>
and severall antient Fathers, confuted the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
about the two natures of
our Saviour,<note place="margin">Concil. Ephes. anath. 11. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. Alexan. S. Leo P.</note>
as I mentioned oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
before. So that such
a world of testimonies of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
concurring, the <hi>Tradition</hi>
being so constant and uniform, S. <hi>Leo the Great
had just cause to say</hi> (Ep. 23.) <hi>In the church
of God this is so consonantly witnessed by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
mouth, that the truth of the body and
bloud of Christ is not even by the tongues of
infants concealed among the Sacraments (or,
Mysteries) of the common Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. An <hi>Universall Tradition</hi> therefore of the
<hi>Reall Presence</hi> hath been so forcible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable,
as that it constrained even the
English Protestants themselves to acknowledge
it, and that simply and unhypocritically: How
could I then defend my self from submitting
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46209:219"/>
and captivating my understanding to the same
Tradition, as constant for a reall change and
conversion? I must professe ingenuously, that
during the time of my being a Protestant, the
only, or I am sure principall hinderance from
an entire conformity to the Faith of Catholikes
in this point, was the inextricablenesse of those
arguments which my reason suggested to me
out of naturall Philosophy against it, as, how
it could be possible that the same body could be
in heaven and upon the Altar at the same time?
how accidents could remain without their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
subjects &amp;c. considering with all the small,
or rather no satisfaction which the <hi>Scholasticall
subtilties</hi> gave me.</p>
               <p>7. But now if it be demanded, what new Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
I have learned, since I learned that the
Catholique church was to be believed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
and what preservative I have found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those former arguments of naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
I must answer freely and ingenuously, that
I have not learned to answer such arguments,
but to despise them; and to say, God forbid
that vain Philosophy should (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
make a prey of me, defrauding me of the most
necessary communion with the church of
Christ, and most essentiall vertue of captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my understanding to the obedience of all
<hi>Evangelicall Mysteries.</hi> I do therefore freely
confesse my ignorance, and <hi>inability</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
how this particular Mystery can
consist even with those rules of Philosphy
which I my self receive; But withall, I must not
conceale that when I was a Protestant also, I
did the same for other points, as the Mystery of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:46209:220"/>
the blessed Trinity, the Incarnation of the Son
of God, &amp;c. And I did not find any scruple in
those mysteries, because I could not reconcile
them with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any other <hi>Patriarch
of Heretiques,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. I will further add, that that which gave me
entire satisfaction, and obliged me in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to silence, and not to answer my reason,
when it would raise objections against Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
was, that the same authority,
for whose sake I believed it, taught me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be a mystery inexplicable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
and that it was not lawfull so
to examine it, as that it should stand or fall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the dictates of naturall reason. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> (called the <hi>Divine</hi>)
spoke like one that deserved that surname, in
the <hi>second Generall Councell of</hi> Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>That it was not permitted to the Mao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites
and Ammonites to enter into the church
of God, that is</hi> (saith he)<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>i. e. <hi>to Logicall and
vainly curious and subtill discourses.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Reader to an abundant collection of the

of examining the possibility of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
upon the grounds of naturall reason, which
are to be found in Cardinall <hi>Perrons Reply</hi> to
<hi>King James. (Repl. lib. 4. cap. 1. 2. &amp;c.)</hi>
Therefore far be it from me to determine this
Mystery, by the subtill and too too curious
disputations of the Schoolmen: I do not
envy them their leasure to employ their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
about such matters within their owne
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:46209:220"/>
walls; but if they begin to passe for competent
Judges of this Mystery, I must prosesse that I
disclaim them, and I cannot without grief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what dangerous use Protestants make
of their vaine and sometimes ridiculous Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall
Questions about this Mystery,
who satisfie themselves that the Mystery it
self is not true, because they find no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the discourses and answers, which
the Schoole-writers endeavour to give to a
thousand foolish objections, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jute
up out of <hi>Aristotles Philosophy</hi> against
this Mystery, to be adored and trembled at.

truth of the Reality of Christs presence,
by way of conversion in the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the confusion of all Novelties and
all Blasphemies of Heretiques. The antient,
both <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Grecian Fathers,</hi> who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
were of wits as subtill and pierceing,
as any that have succeeded them, yet never
thought upon such nice enquiries, as now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

therefore I professe, since I am far from find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any obligation at all lying upon me to the
contrary, yea since the Councell of Trent
(<hi>Sess. 13. c.</hi> I.) hath defined this point in
the language of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and not of the

reall presence is added to the former, though I
acknowledge this later presence to be as reall
as the former, I must be forbidden to expresse
that I acknowledge and believe it any other way

then deny unto him (in that place, at his owne

church and all Christians call Sacraments, they
scoffe at the Reall Presence, and abominate the
adoration of Christ in his Mysteries: Let S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose
(de Sp. 5. l.</hi> 3.) say, <hi>By his footstool is meant
the earth, and by the earth the body of Christ,
which every day we adore in the mysteries, and
which the Apostles adored in our Lord Jesus.</hi>
Let S. <hi>Augustine</hi> (in Psa. 48.) say, <hi>For he took
earth from earth, both because be conversed here
in very flesh, and gave us likewise very flesh to
eat for our salvation. Now no man eats that
flesh, but that he adores it first: And thus a
way is found how the Lords footstoole is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
And again (Epist 120.) expounding that of
<hi>the Psalmist, All the rich of the earth have
eaten and worshipped, And they also</hi> (saith he)
<hi>are brought to the table of Christ, and partake

they are not satisfied, because they doe not
imitate him.</hi> Let S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> (in 1. <hi>Cor.)
say, This body the wise men worshipped in the

Thou seest him not in a manger, but upon
the Altar; not a woman holding him in her

say, <hi>The mysticall Symbolls are understood,
which are celebrated and believed, and adored
likewise, as being the very things which they
are believed to be.</hi> What is all this to a Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
though all antiquity agree in the like lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and not one Father explicitly dissent
from it? But as for Protestants, not having
the confidence to renounce the Fathers autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
they make it their task to prove out of such
places, that the Fathers intended by such speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
that it was Idolatry to worship Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
on the Altar. But-<hi>Nobis non licet esse tam

                  <head>Of Communion under one Species.</head>
                  <p>11. This is not a matter of doctrine; but
meer practise: The church sayes not, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to take it in both kinds; but onely that
upon reasons sufficiently prevailing with her, she
thinks fit in the ordinary practise it should be so

their private opinion think it were better it
should be administred in both kinds, yet ought
not upon pretence thereof to break forth into
a sacrilegious separation, I will only recommend
these few considerations to our English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
viz. 1. That there is no explicit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:46209:223"/>
in Scripture, that the Sacrament should
be communicated under both Species. If they
urge the example of our Saviour, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how he administred it; they know that they
themselves allow authority to the church to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
formes not essentiall to the Sacraments; and
accordingly practise both the form in Baptism,
and the holy Eucharist, otherwise then they were
first instituted. 2. That it is evident, and no
ingenuous Protestant will deny it, but that even
in the Primitive churches it was an ordinary
practise in severall occasions to receive it only
in one kind. 3. That not one proof can be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the sick ever received the cup. 4. That
notwithstanding in the opinion of Antiquity,
those who received it so were believed to have
enjoyed the whole benefit and vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
5. That the Greek church, though
she gives it ordinarily in publique in both Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
yet neither in private, nor to the sick, no
nor (as it is said) in Lent. Neither doth she
make that difference any ground of her separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Roman church. 6. That Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
confesse, that those who have a naturall
antipathy against wine, may receive the body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and may notwithstanding assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they want no fruit or effect of the
holy Eucharist. Upon which grounds, if they
would duely consider what a horrible crime
Schisme is; they would no doubt believe
that this were not a sufficient excuse for
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>12. The only proof that I will give of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
and allowed practise of antiquity in this
point, shall be to set down here in English, the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:46209:224"/>
289. Epistle of S.</hi> Basile, ad Caesariam Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triciam,
<hi>a memorable monument of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of private communicating of the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
and that only under</hi> one Species <hi>among
the antient Christians, His words are these,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>&amp;c. that is,</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
every day to communicate and participate the
holy body and blood of Christ, is a good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
thing, seeing he himself hath said in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
words, He that shall eat my flesh, and
drink my blood hath eternall life. Now who
does doubt but that daily to participate of life,
is no other thing but daily to live? Therefore it
is that we our selues do communicate four times
every week, to wit, on our Lords day, on the
fourth day, on the sixth day, and on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day. And moreover upon other dayes, if
the memory of any Martyr be celebrated. Now
it would be superfluous for me to demonstrate
that that custome is not to be condemned, by
which Christians were necessitated in the times
of persecution, in the absence of the Priest or
Ministsr, to receive the Communion (privately)
with his own hands, since an inveterate practise
hath effectually confirmed it. For all those who
lived Monastically in the Deserts, where there
was no Priest, reserving the Communion in
their Cells, received it of themselves. In A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria
likewise, and in AEgypt, each one
of the common sort of people, for the most part,
hath the Commnnion reserved in his own house.
For the Priest having once offered the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and distributed it, he that receives it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
all together, and afterward daily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
of it, ought to believe that he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:46209:224"/>
and receives the very same which the
Priest gave him. For likewise in the Church
it self the Priest delivers a part (of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice)
and the Communicant receives it, with
an entire power to dispose of it, and so with
his own hands lists it to his own mouth. Now
it is the very same in power <hi>(or vertue)</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any one shall receive one only portion from
the Priest, or many portions together. <hi>Hithert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(l. 8. de Martyr.)</hi> gives the very sense
of the present church in this point, <hi>We do not
adore the Saints as Gods, but we pray unto

Jewish church also, as those words of <hi>Josophus</hi>

<hi>who doubts but that the

of S. <hi>Basile</hi> &amp;c. have the same prayers to Saints,
in the same form as they are found in the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
and Breviaries at this day. And, that not
any Father condemns the practise of it, either
as a novelty or supersticion, which in all other
cases upon all occasions they have done.</p>
               <p>13. To shew the innocence of the church, far
from deserving such behaviour from her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as she ha's found in this regard. Consider
first, that all that the church decides in this point
is, that they may be pray'd to. 2. That by the
church no man is obliged or constrained to
pray to them, or to any but to God. 3. That
this is onely that they would intercede for us, a
thing which we sinners desire at the hands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinners greater perhaps then our selves.
4. That (excepting only the Litanies which are
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:46209:225"/>
rather ejaculations and wishes, then formed
prayers; and excepting some few Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Hymnes, to which a greater license
hath alwayes beene allowed) the Church,
both in the <hi>Missall</hi> and <hi>Breviary</hi> directs the
prayers, which she makes with re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pect to Saints,
immediately to God himself, desiring him to
hearken to the intercession which his Saints
make for us, and by their ministery to aid us.
And therefore whereas Protestants make their
chief difficulty in this matter to be their uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
whether our prayers can arrive to the
Saints hearing; though it may be resolved out
of expresse Scripture even out of those words,
<hi>There is joy in heaven over one sinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peurs;</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot certainly, when the prayers are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
immediately to God, as the church does,
no man will doubt but they may arrive thither.
I cannot chuse but on this occasion to publish
the ingenuity of the <hi>Socinians</hi> once more, who
deal with Religion as they would do with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomicall
Hypothesis, framing and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heaven and earth according to their <hi>phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nema;</hi>
And therefore they, to take away the
trouble of examining either Scripture of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
dissolve the whole controversie, with fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a new point of Philosophy, viz. that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
souls have no apprehension, nor parcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at all, but are indeed as sencelesse as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
contrary to millions of stories, which are
surely not every one false, contrary to expresse
<hi>Scripture, This day shalt thou be with me in

                  <p>3. Concerning Images, we may consider,
1. That they had them in the antient church,
<hi>Tertullian</hi> puts it out of all
doubt,<note place="margin">Tert. de Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. c. 7. Ambr. de invent. corp. Gerv. &amp; Prot.</note> who makes mention of

upon the Chalices: And S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
saith, <hi>That a person appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, which seemed like to
S.</hi> Paul, <hi>the features of whose
countenance I had learned,</hi> sayes
he, <hi>from his picture.</hi> The profession and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> is so clear in this behalfe
and so confessed by Protestants, that it is lost
labour to quote him. 2. No man can deny but
that the sight of holy stories in picture, do both
more easily represent to weak capacities, and put
even the best men in mind of good things, then
the reading them in a book. 3. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Trent (<hi>Sess.</hi> 25.) expressely professeth,
that the ground of Catholiques Veneration of
them is not that it is believed that there is any
divinity or vertue in them, for which they ought
to be venerated: So that all occasion of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
is evidently cut off. 4. That things which
have any regard to Religion are to be respected
and treated with reverence, this nature teaches,
and the Calvinists acknowledge, as I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
before out of <hi>Monsieur Daillé.</hi> 5. That by
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:46209:226"/>
reason we have not words enough to expresse
all our conceptions, nor variety enough of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
actions and postures to expresse our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
intentions and notions, hence all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and contradiction among Christians in this
point hath proceeded. And therefore as the
antient Jewes applied the word<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>and the
posture thereby represented, viz. <hi>prostration</hi>
both to the supreme degree of adoration due
only to God, and to the reverence of honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
persons: So likewise the second Councell
of Nice, for want of words applying the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>(which imports the same) to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
therefore it was, that till the misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
was cleared, the Westerne Church in
the Councell of <hi>Francford</hi> rejected their deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
But those who love Schisme will needs
most unjustly reassume a voluntary misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the churches intention in this point,
which clearly distinguishes and makes an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
distance betweene the respect, which
they give to Images, and that which they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to God, and gives little more to Images,
then Protestants themselves confesse to be
due to all holy things pertaining to Religion.
The Jewes at this day (the greatest enemies
certainly of Idolatry that ever were) yet will
not unfold the volume of their law til after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
humble declinations of their bodies, and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of their hands; neither will any sober
Christian enter into a church (though he do
not pray) without uncovering his head, to shew
that he makes a difference between that place,
and an ordinary prophane house. The ground
of the lawfulnesse and fitnesse of these outward
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:46209:227"/>
expressions is this, because since we cannot
chuse but in our minds and thoughts make a
a difference betweene holy and prophane
objects, it is as fitting to expresse that
difference by outward shews. So that if <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
be to be suspected of <hi>superstition</hi> and <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi>
in this behalf; certainly the <hi>Calvinists</hi>
are much more guilty, for <hi>exhibiting</hi> an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
reverence to the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine in
their Cene,</hi> seeing they will not allow a <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
between the severall respects which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
acknowledge. 6. That the church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
no man (<hi>hîc &amp; nunc</hi>) to <hi>exhibit</hi> any <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
to <hi>Images,</hi> &amp;c. Only they must not

                  <p>5. That which the church commands to be
believed as <hi>Catholique Traditionary doctrine,</hi>
touching this matter of Indulgences, is briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained in the Bull of <hi>Plus IV.</hi> (relating
to the 25. <hi>Session</hi> of the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi>) in
these words, <hi>I believe that power of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
hath been given and left in the Church by
Jesus Christ; and that the use of them is very
healthfull to Christian people.</hi> The ground of
which doctrine, according to the position of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
of Hales, Durand, Paludanus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
quoted at the end of this discourse, is the
practise of that severe discipline and correction,
which in the most <hi>primitive times</hi> was exercised
against (especially publike and scandalous) sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
those severe <hi>penitential Canons</hi> then execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

weepings, covering themselves with ashes,
rigorous fasts, but principally those long absten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and banishings from the most holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
yea even from entring any further then
into the porch of the church, which the primitive
zeal imposed upon Delinquents, which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the most <hi>antient Ecclesiastical writers,</hi>

An example of which severity more rigorous
then all before mentioned, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath left us
in that censure of his upon the incestuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi>
whom <hi>he delivered over to Satan,</hi> to be

to shew that Ecclesiasticall. Governors
ought to mix <hi>Christian charity</hi> and meeknesse
with <hi>their severity,</hi> especially when they see great
signs of compunction and amendment in the
Penitents, the same Apostle hath left an example
likewise of Indulgence and favour to the same
person, which he expresseth by the two verbs

rule, the <hi>Primitive Churches,</hi> as upon occasion
they used great <hi>severity,</hi> so likewise great <hi>benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
also to <hi>Penitents,</hi> which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls the
<hi>giving of Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. But in succeeding times zeal and servor of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
growing cold, and generally <hi>Christians</hi>
not being able to support so great a rigor, the
church in wisdome thought fit to qualifie both
the severity of penalties imposed, to shorten the
times of <hi>abstention</hi> from the holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and
to grant remission and Indulgence, especially <hi>in
Articulo mortis</hi> generally unto all Penitents:
<hi>hence</hi> came it that the <hi>intercessions of Confessors
and Martyrs</hi> in behalf of <hi>Delinquents</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as we read frequently in
S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> hence the two favourable <hi>Canons</hi> of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:46209:229"/>
Indulgence (<hi>viz.</hi> the 10, and 12.) of the first
<hi>Councell of Nice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. In these last and most wicked times,
wherein the antient Ecclesiasticall Discipline is
almost wholly lost, not through any fault of the
church, (which enjoynes all Priests to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes the antient penitentiall Canons,
and by them to regulate their penances) but
through the generall overflowing of coldnesse
in devotion, prophanenesse, and impatience of
suffering, and likewise through the impudence,
covetousnesse, and partiality of Priests: no man
can yet deny, but that as the power of inflicting
censures remains in the church, so likewise doth
the power of <hi>Indulgences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>8. Concerning which</hi> Indulgences, <hi>all</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
<hi>do unanimously agree to these two
points. 1.</hi> That they are profitable: <hi>and 2. That</hi>
the Church hath power to grant them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Decision of the Councell of Trent.
<hi>But as for the extent of the vertue of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and as touching the</hi> conditions <hi>required to
the receiving them fruitfully,</hi> Catholike Divines
<hi>are</hi> divided <hi>in their</hi> opinions. <hi>For 1. concerning
the</hi> extent of their vertue, Bellarmine (l. 1 de
Indulg. c. 7.) <hi>sets down this as an opinion
maintained by Catholiques, viz.</hi> That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
are no other then relaxations of
Penalties enjoyned by Confessarii, or which
ought to have been enjoyned according to the
Canons. <hi>Which</hi> opinion, <hi>saith he, is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by</hi> grave Authors, Alexander of Hales,
sum. Theolog. p. 4. q. 23. memb. 2. Durand and
Paludanus, Pope Adrian 6. in 4. Sent. q. de
Indulg. <hi>And likewise</hi> by Soto the Dominican,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:46209:229"/>
                     <hi>and</hi> Card. Cajetan, <hi>both which teach,</hi> that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
are never granted but for Penalties
injoyned. <hi>Now both these were appointed by
the church to maintain the</hi> Doctrine <hi>concerning</hi>
Indulgences <hi>against the late</hi> Heretiques. <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
Maldonate <hi>the learned Jesuite (in his book</hi>
de Sacram. c. 2. de Indulg. q. 1. 2. p.) <hi>saith, that</hi>
the opinion, That Indulgences are only relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Penalty either enjoyned in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Penance, or ordained by Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Law, seems to him to be the most true
opinion, because it is held by good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and seemes to be demonstrated by unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
arguments. <hi>And in pursuance hereof
the same Author produceth eleven reasons; the
substance of the three first of which, is this,</hi>
Because we ought to believe, that the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
now in use in the church, are the same
that were antiently practised, as the Councell
of Trent expressely sayes: <hi>Now, saith he,</hi> we
find no other Indulgences in the antient church
and Councells, but such as we have mentioned.
<hi>Again,</hi> It was the custome of the church to add
this Particle to the Indulgences given, De
Pooeitentiis injunctis; since therefore, <hi>saith
he,</hi> the church hath so warily expressed her self,
it would be temerarious to interpret her mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwise. <hi>The same doctrine is strongly
maintained likewise by</hi> Estius <hi>in 4.</hi> Sent. dist.
20. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>9. In the next place, concerning the</hi> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>required to receive benefit by Indulgences,
all Catholiques agree that these three are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</hi>
1. Authority in him that grants them.
2. A just reason for the granting them. 3. Due
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:46209:230"/>
dispositions in the party receiving them. <hi>Now
for this last point,</hi> Card. Cajetan (<hi>as he is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by</hi> Bellarmine l. 1. de Indulg. c. 12.) <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
That besides the conditions of being in
the state of Grace, and of accomplishing the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
ordained for the gaining of Indulgences,
there is a third condition necessary to him that
would receive fruit by them, which is, that he
have a will to satisfie God by his own labours,
as much as he can; and that Indulgences are of
no profit to those who will not satisfie for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
when they can. <hi>From whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,</hi>
That in such an infinite number of
persons that visit the churches in the times of
the solemn Stations, and the like Indulgences,
there are but very few that reap the profit of
them iudeed. <hi>This</hi> opinion, <hi>saith</hi> Bellarmine,
is profitable and pious, though perhaps it is not
true. <hi>But since Card</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>the learned</hi>
Estius Chancellor of Doway, <hi>professes his belief,
that this</hi> opinion <hi>is not only</hi> profitable and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but very true. <hi>See his Comment. in 2. Ep.
ad Cor. cap. 2. v. 11. as likewise in 4. Sent. dist.
20. Sect. 10. The like is strongly maintained
by</hi> Comitolus a learned Jesuit, <hi>in Resp. Moral.</hi>
q. 36. <hi>who confirmes his opinion by the</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<hi>of</hi> Antisiodorensis, Henricus à Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,
Adrian VI. Boniface VIII. Sylvester,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the aforesaid Authors, who teach that</hi>
Indulgences <hi>are onely relaxations from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
enjoyned,</hi> vel ab homine, vel à. Canone,
<hi>do not therefore believe that they are satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
only to the Church, and not to God;
for</hi> Maldonate <hi>expressely declares the contrary
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:46209:230"/>
in these words, in the forecited place,</hi> Cùm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jungitur
poenitentia ab Ecclesia, &amp;c. when the
Church enjoynes any Penance, she enjoynes it
not only to the end that by such a Penance we
should satisfie the Church, but God also.
Now the Indulgence is answerable unto the
Penance enjoyned, and by consequence it is
granted us, not onely to the end that this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
should be remitted us before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
of the Church, but before Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
likewise. <hi>And from thence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that though</hi> Indulgences <hi>do regard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
onely Penances, which are enjoyned
to be accomplished in this world, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they do consequently deliver from the
paines of Purgatory likewise.</hi> For <hi>(saith he)</hi>
since God does not punish the same fault twice,
and since the penalty which men pay in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is the same with that which they ought to
have paid in this world, if the Church, by the
means of Indulgences, does remit the penalty,
which in this life is due to the Justice of God,
it follows, that she remits likewise that which
shall be due in Purgatory, that is to say, that
which those living persons, to whom such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
are granted, ought otherwise to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in Purgatory. <hi>Now whether this</hi> Doctrine
<hi>deserve a</hi> separation, <hi>let all reasonable, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Christians judge.</hi>

                  <head>Of Publique service in the Latin

                  <p>8. This is a matter which concerns only the
outward order and <hi>decorum</hi> of the church, an
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:46209:231"/>
whereof Ecclesiasticall Governours are only to
be judges and disposers, so that if there be any
excesse or inconvenience, they only are answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
before Almighty God, particular persons
are not at all concerned in it. Indeed if the
Church had appointed her service in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin

not understand it: Or if she had decreed that
it was a thing unlawfull that any body should
praise God with the understanding, but onely
Priests, and Bishops, and learned men, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
might have some pretence for their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
in this regard. But 1. since the Church
found her <hi>Liturgies</hi> in the same tongue through
all the Westerne world from the beginning
of <hi>Christianity.</hi> 2. Since no example can be
found in any antient churches, <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
Eastern or Westerne, that the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Publique Service have beene altered,
though those of the Countryes have beene;
insomuch as in our Saviours time the Jewish
Devotions were performed in Hebrew, when
the people only understood the Syrian tongue;
so the <hi>Cophtites,</hi> so the <hi>AEthiopians,</hi> and so the
<hi>Jewes</hi> to this day. 3. Since it is apparently, both
of great comelinesse and benefit, that there
should be an uniformity in Gods publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
so as that wheresoever a Christian travels,
he may as well joyne himself with other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in the service of God, as when he
staid at home. 4. Since particularly for the
Masse, the greatest part of it from all <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
was performed in a low voice by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
or Priest, the people neither hearing, nor
in the antient Church seeing him, by reason
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:46209:231"/>
of a vail or curtain, which was drawn between the
Altar &amp; the people, excepting only at some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
peculiar times, as at the Elevation, &amp;c. 5. Since
the church permits the translating and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her <hi>Liturgies,</hi> since she commands the
Priests to explain and inculcate unto the people
the meaning of all mysteries; and since she fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
even the most ignorant persons with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
suitable to their capacities, and far more
beneficiall to them then the hearing the Psalms
and other parts of Scripture read, so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and abstruse, that even the most learned
must confesse their inability to comprehend
them. Lastly, since an indiscreet promiscuous
exposing of Scriptures hath beene the occasions
of so many inconveniences, a better though sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
proof whereof cannot be given then in the
present state of <hi>England,</hi> where every one read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scripture, and all visible authority of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
it (so as to oblige others to receive such
<hi>interpretations</hi>) being <hi>disclaimed,</hi> every one of
those <hi>infinite</hi> numbers of Sects believe that they
find in Scripture sufficient warrant for all such
horrible seditions and murders as have lately
been committed there: Therefore the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
church hath esteemed it a thing befitting
her wisdome to continue an <hi>uniformity</hi> in her
publike worship received from our Fathers, and
her care and charity to appoint respectively to
every <hi>condition</hi> and state of <hi>Christians</hi> their
proper allowance and <hi>dimensum</hi> of spirituall
food, and to imitate our Saviour, who would
not reveale even to his Apostles themselves all
the mysteries of the Kingdome of God, during
the times of their infirmity, when <hi>they were not

between Catholiques and Protestants,
I judged fit to signifie how (when I considered
what the church had declared to be her sense of
them, separating them from <hi>private opinions,</hi>
to which no man is obliged) they appeared so
reasonable, and so consonant to <hi>antiquity,</hi> that
if I should have continued in a separation from
her for their cause, I must at the same time have
professed to have renounced all interest in the
most glorious Saints and Martyrs that ever the
church enjoyed. And if it were Gods good
pleasure that all other Protestants, lovers of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
would think fit not to judge of the Catholike
church by the character given of her by Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist
Controvertists, who lay to her charge what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
imprudent or erroneous positions they
find in any particular Catholike author, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as I am confident not one objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
twenty in their writings proceeds directly
against the church, but that, if they would be
perswaded to hear her testifying of her self in
her publike doctrine, they would find that they
have been cousened into the guilt of this <hi>perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

enemies to Gods church for telling them the

which was to give a narration what effect
the eminent rules of holinesse and true solid

found in the Catholike Church, had upon me,
and that not onely to incline my will to love
them, and desire the practise of them, but to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:46209:233"/>
my understanding also to be more doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and more easily perswaded of the truth
of speculative points, which were professed
in a Church so enriched, and by persons
whose whole employment was to love, serve,
glorifie, and admire the goodnesse, wisdome,
and all other perfections of Almighty God,
to meditate day and night upon the holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of our Salvation, and to mortifie all
manner of vice, passions, and lusts, farre more
intrinsecally, spiritually, and perfectly, then any
thing that I had seen or read before could give
me a notion of. I hope I need not be ashamed
to professe this, and however I will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to publish mine own shame, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing,
that the life and Councells of S. <hi>Charles

and <hi>meeknesse shining in</hi> the <hi>writings</hi> of

came directly contrary to my expectation; for
I must professe I had in former times a far
stronger aversion from the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi>
considered by me as an enemy to Holinesse,
then as an enemy to truth. I had observed,
1. In generall, that most of the points in

controversie betweene Catholiques and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
were such as contributed either to <hi>avarice</hi>

our Saviour said it was impossible that they
should enter into the Kingdome of heaven)</hi> were
the easiliest admitted of all others by the <hi>prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
of pardons and Indulgences. 3. I saw
that many Casuists had handled the sins of great
men, Usury and Simony, so tenderly and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably,
allowing so many <hi>qualifications,</hi> that
it was become almost impossible to deprehend
them. 4. I saw the <hi>antient discipline</hi> of the

given upon a small penance for such sins (adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
blasphemy, and that <hi>most horrible and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisticall
gallantry of Duelling</hi>) which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
church would scarce have pardoned after
ten years macerating of the body and soule with

saw (me thought) that <hi>absolutions</hi> were given
as of course; and that persons, though habitually
addicted to mortall sins, yet upon an outward
profession of sorrow expected and challenged
pardon and admission to the blessed Sacrament,
and all this <hi>toties quoties.</hi> 6. I saw that <hi>attrition</hi>
i. e. sorrow for sin, meerly out of fear of being
damned, with the Sacrament, was counted a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
qualification to remission of sins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in my <hi>opinion, charity</hi> it self became unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
Such prejudices as these was I possessed
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:46209:234"/>
withall, all which I imputed to the church her
self; insomuch as though I suspected that my
understanding might be over-reached by subtill
Disputants to excuse the errours, which I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be in the Roman church, yet I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that it was impossible my will should be
seduced so far as to approve such enormous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises.</p>
               <p>3. Now the occasion and manner how I came
to be satisfied of the <hi>eminent sanctity</hi> taught and
practised in the Catholique Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those practises, not that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseable,
but that they were not to be imputed
to the church (which was most innocent of
them) was as follows. It hap'ned not long after
my arrivall at <hi>Paris,</hi> that my curiosity led me
among other places to visit the Monastery of the
Carthusians, whom we deprehended in their
ordinary employment of prayers, and in the
place of their almost continuall residence, the
church: A sight that was, which made a strange
impression upon my mind, being at that time
also in some unquietnesse, by reason of certaine
scruples already entertained concerning <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
For there I saw persons so utterly secluded
from the world, that they never visited other
men, and rarely and with unwillingnesse admit-other
mens visits, yea excepting a few houres
weekly, renounced the conversation and sight
of one another, but only in the church, where
their conversation was only with God: Persons
so mortified in their looks, so immoveable in
their postures, with countenances so intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their present devotions, as if they onely lived
with their rationall faculties, and so far from
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:46209:234"/>
observing, that they were observed by others,
that truly I believe they knew it not: persons (as
after enquiry I was informed) that through the
whole course of their lives practise a strict ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence,
and for a greater part, a rigorous fast;
persons that every day allow neer eight houres
to vocall prayers, and laborious singing in the
church, and almost all the hours besides in their
private cells to <hi>meditation</hi> and <hi>contemplation:</hi>
persons that no <hi>incommodity</hi> of weather hinders
from <hi>their midnight watches,</hi> and devotions
in the church for severall hours together; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whose inseparable cloathing is <hi>hair-cloth,</hi>
and whose other more <hi>private mortifications</hi>
and <hi>austerities</hi> they do most <hi>sollicitously</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>al
from the world, and account it of all other
the most rude <hi>mortification,</hi> if they should come
to be discovered: persons, who are so far from
desiring the esteem of the world, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
would publish any <hi>miracles done in their
solitude,</hi> nor seek the <hi>canonization</hi> of any of
<hi>their Saints,</hi> no not their <hi>Founder</hi> S. <hi>Brun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself: persons who notwithstanding all these
<hi>austerities,</hi> expresse <hi>in their conversation</hi> the
greatest repose, and contentment, and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>mind imagineable,</hi> the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
toward others, that would seem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
them, and protestations, that if there
were no happinesse to be expected in another
world, yet that the <hi>inward ravishings</hi> of soule;
the <hi>spirituall embraces,</hi> which <hi>their coelestiall
Bridegroom affords them many times,</hi> deserve
to be purchased with far greater worldly losses,
and with far greater <hi>austerities,</hi> then any that
they have or can suffer. Lastly, persons whose
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:46209:235"/>
order ha's continued now without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for about six hundred years, without the
least scandall, without the least need of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
growing the more perfect according
to the declination of the rest of mankind, as if
God intended it, in an especiall manner, to be
the defence and security, <hi>the chariots and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Israel: An order</hi> whose encrease of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
are perceived not by themselves, but the
poor only, who are accordingly more amply and
frequently sustained; insomuch, as that which
ha's been the corruption of other orders, is the
purifier and refiner of this; and I may add this
observation with respect to <hi>England, an order</hi>
that Almighty God did principally chuse, by
which to condemn Schisme at it's first entrance
there, viz. by suffering them, that is, piety and
innocence it self, to be the first victimes and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
offered to it.</p>
               <p>4. I must confesse, that as I could not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these things without astonishment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
so I could not free my self from some
degree of envy and indignation, that I could not
find any thing in any of our Churches to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to such a spectacle: I was willing enough
to suspect that there might be some mixture
of a secret hypocrisie, and pride, and ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
even in such renouncings of pride and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation:
But then I confuted my own sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
by this most sure observation, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God did not usually of all other vices
suffer hypocrisie even in a single person to be
long undiscovered, much less in a whole order,
and for six hundred years together. Therefore
I began to discourse thus within my self; <q>Is it
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:46209:235"/>
possible if the Roman church be so deeply guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so intolerably depraved, as I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
believed, that Almighty God should
suffer such servants of his to lye in those dregs
and pollutions, exposed to <hi>eternall perdition</hi>
so many years together? Ha's their continuall
<hi>meditation</hi> been in the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> and
yet never one beam of <hi>divine light</hi> be sent
from heaven to <hi>irradiate</hi> any of <hi>their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,</hi>
and to convince them, that their
whole <hi>Religion</hi> is apparently contradictory
to the same <hi>Scriptures?</hi> Is it likely, that if the
Faith of the Church was of necessity to be
changed, and the practises to be reformed,
that God should make choice of such <hi>Apostles</hi>
as a <hi>debauched, perjured, sacrilegious, Apostate
Monk of Germany;</hi> or a <hi>seditious, uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
malicious Picard,</hi> or a <hi>furious Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of Switzerland,</hi> and in the mean time
leave such persons enflamed with his love, still
lying <hi>in their deadly ignorances and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
never suffering one of that order to be
converted, yea leaving <hi>Heresie</hi> more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them now, then ever before that such a
pretended new <hi>Evangelicall light</hi> discovered
it self?</q>
               </p>
               <p>5. Some time I spent in such meditations,
which I could neither hinder nor satisfie my
self in; yet because it seemed dangerous to me
to build resolutions upon the manner and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Gods Providence, which is inscrutable;
therefore I thought it as necessary for me to
examine (not the outward shewes, but) <hi>the
Rules of Holinesse</hi> practised in the Romane
church, as the doctrines therein professed; for
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:46209:236"/>
if the former appeared to be according to the
<hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> they would strongly argue for
the truth of the later. Having this designe, I
provided my self of the best <hi>Methods of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Spirituality</hi> that I could meet with,
and upon all occasions I made conversation
with such <hi>Religious persons,</hi> as were in <hi>opinion</hi>
eminent for a <hi>spirituall life;</hi> The successe
whereof was strange and incredible: For
whereas I had alwayes been of <hi>opinion,</hi> that
that which in the Roman church was called <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
Theology,</hi> was, if compar'd with the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Practicall Divinity,</hi> as I took the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Philosophy of the Platonists</hi> to have been,
compared with that of other <hi>Philosophers, viz.</hi>
the same <hi>ordinary doctrines</hi> and precepts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
but only cloathed in abstruse, <hi>sublime,</hi> and
<hi>Metaphoricall termes,</hi> rendring the professors
thereof not more vertuous then other men, but
more <hi>phantasticall</hi> and <hi>self conceited:</hi> But I
found that the notion I had of it had no affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the thing it self; <hi>Mysticall Theology</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing else in generall, but certain Rules,
by the practise whereof a vertuous <hi>Christian</hi>
might attain to a <hi>neerer,</hi> a more <hi>familiar,</hi>
and beyond all expression comfortable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
with God, by arriving unto, not only a
belief, but also an experimentall knowledge and
perception of his <hi>divine presence,</hi> after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
manner in the soul; wherein he is
taught first to purge himself of all <hi>pollutions</hi> of
sin and worldly lusts, to possesse himself of all
<hi>Christian vertues,</hi> and by such meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himself for an union with the heavenly
Majesty; the generall instrument of all these
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:46209:236"/>
blessings being a constant exercise of <hi>Mentall
Prayer,</hi> that is, meditating with the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon heavenly mysteries, but especially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>ejaculations, aspirations,</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi>
acts of the <hi>will, loving, praising, adoring,</hi> and
perfectly resigning it selfe to the most perfect
will of God, by which in time there is made a
perfect denudation, mortification, and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of a mans own private will, and a suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ones self to be <hi>inacted</hi> and moved immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by Almighty God, and at last a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the <hi>divine essence</hi> without any <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
without all help of grosser <hi>imaginary forms,</hi>
an absorption of all operations (called by them
<hi>a divine idlenesse</hi>) whereby the soul reposeth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely,
and with unspeakable pleasure in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of her heavenly Bridegroom. I speak not
now of strange effects, outward and respecting
the body, as <hi>Elevations, Extasies, &amp;c.</hi> which
though admired at by others, yet are neglected,
and even pray'd against by spirituall persons
themselves.</p>
               <p>6. Now to prove that these are neither
dreams of ignorant souls, nor sublime extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances
of soaring <hi>spirits,</hi> we may consider that.
1. The greatest understandings that many of the
last ages have brought forth (as S. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> S. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> and <hi>I. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Count of Mirandula &amp;c.</hi>) have all written
uniformly upon the same subject, and have
shewed clearly, that what they wrote was not
meer speculation, but comprehended, practised,
and felt by them. 2. That even the meanest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
have arrived to the perfection of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
as S. <hi>Isidore</hi> a plain husband-man
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:46209:237"/>
in Spain, S. <hi>Teresa,</hi> S. <hi>Catherine of Siena,</hi> and of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> (silly ignorant women) &amp; that unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
young <hi>Heremite, Gregorio Lopez.</hi> Insomuch
as whosoever shal with a true resignation &amp; pure
intention enter into this <hi>life of the Spirit,</hi> though
his understanding be not able to give him enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
for meditation, yea though he be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to help himself with reading others, yet if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
informed of the necessary points of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Faith, he humbly &amp; constantly move his wil
to frame cordially acts of love and resignation,
&amp;c. to God, even such a man or woman shall
not fail to arrive, it may be, to a higher degree
of union, then the most learned and skilfull
Doctors, even to that perfection of which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Crucifigor cum Christo: &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,
jaem non ego, sed vivit in me Christus.</hi> i. e.
<hi>I am crucified with Christ: and I live, yet not
I, but Christ liveth in me.</hi> 3. To the end to be
secure of delusions it is observeable, that whereas
in other Sects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>re are certain <hi>counterfeitings</hi>
of such a <hi>mysticall familiarity</hi> with God, joyned
with strange motions and effects, as awong the
<hi>Anabaptists, Famulists, Quakers, Ranvers,
&amp;c.</hi> (strange examples whereof (in the last age)
we may read in <hi>Florimundus Raemundus,</hi>
yet now daily out-done by those Sects in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
as at <hi>Malton</hi> in Yorkshire, <hi>London,</hi>
and other places, where they abound)
yet such <hi>illuminations</hi> discover their black
Author, in that the persons are far from
being cleansed of their carnall lusts, pride, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
&amp;c. and the design appeares commonly
to be the troubling the world with some new
pretended Revelation and Reformation &amp;c.
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:46209:237"/>
Whereas among spirituall persons in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church,</hi> the inseparable qualification
for contemplation is a deep humility, a most
tender charity and love of Catholique unity.
4. Lest a suspition should arise that this mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Theology and doctrine of contemplation
should be an <hi>invention</hi> of <hi>Religious Orders</hi> to
magnifie themselves in the worlds <hi>opinion,</hi> as
having means to a neerer approach to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, then the rest of the world: We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
both that the same rules for substance are
found in the <hi>writings</hi> of the antient Fathers, as
S. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onisius Aroopagita,</hi> S, <hi>Augustine,</hi> S. <hi>Basil,
Joannes, Cassianus,</hi> S. <hi>Hierome, &amp;c.</hi> and that
even those most active Fathers and Bishops of
the church have notwithstanding attained to a
great perfection of contemplation; yea that in
this last age there have not appeared any more
perfect therein, then those two famous Bishops,
viz. <hi>B. Francis de Sales, Bishop of Geneva,</hi>
and S. <hi>Charles Barromée,</hi> that most unwearied
sollicitous Arch-Bishop of <hi>Milan</hi> and Cardinal,
and <hi>Antonio de Roias</hi> a Spanish secular Priest:
Though withall it cannot be denyed, but that a
retreat and disengagement from the world, soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
silence, and other <hi>austerities</hi> be very
powerfull and effectuall dispositions thereto.
But concerning Mysticall Theology I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
those that desire further information, to the
writings of <hi>Thaulerus, Harphius, Rusbrochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
the Bishop of Geneva, S. Teresa,</hi> and many
others: Particularly the severall <hi>Treatises,</hi> as
yet <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> of that late <hi>very sublime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue,
F. Augustine Baker, a Monke of
our English Congregation of the Holy Order of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:46209:238"/>
S. BENET;</hi> The yet imperfect sum of whose
methodicall instructions concerning <hi>Internall
Prayer,</hi> having happily met withall at <hi>Rome,</hi>
I found my self pressed to hasten my reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Church, because I thirsted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
capable of practising those heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.
And afterward in <hi>France,</hi> but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in my passage through <hi>Cambray,</hi> having
seen many more of the same Authors writings,
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of which did eminently shew it selfe
in the lives of those excellently devout and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>religious Benedictine Dames</hi> there; and
being by them informed (which within a few
dayes mine own eyes assured me of) that the
same doctrine was received and practised by
their <hi>Fathers at Doway.</hi> I presently, contrary
to all my former resolutions, to dispose my selfe
only among strangers in a <hi>religious life,</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to fix my self at <hi>Doway.</hi> I forbore in the
former <hi>Impression</hi> to mention this Author a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest, because I thought his books were
confin'd to <hi>Cambray,</hi> where they were written,
or to his <hi>own Convent at Dowvy:</hi> But being
since assured, that they were largely dispersed,
even among the secular Clergy, I could not
without ingratitude now omit his name, and I
hope that e're long a ful account of his <hi>spiritual
instructions</hi> concerning the <hi>severall Degrees of
Internall Prayer,</hi> shal be happily communicated
to the world, methodically digested, &amp; authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
published, to the glory of God, &amp; great
advancement of devout souls in his divine love.</p>
               <p>7. For my present purpose it will suffice that
by that short enquiry I made, I satisfied my
self, that in no other Congregation, but the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:46209:238"/>
Catholique Church only, were to be found ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rules in writing, or living directors for a
true spirituall life in any comparison approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those before named. Insomuch as I
have often wondred why <hi>Protestants</hi> would
not at least borrow and transcribe such wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
for their own use and practise; and all that
I could say for answer to my self was. 1. That
according to that saying of the Fathers, <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
sanctus non est extra Ecclesiam.</hi> i. e. <hi>The
Holy Spirit resides not any where out of the
Church,</hi> that is, disperses not his extraordinary
favours, and sublimer gifts any where else.
2. Because Protestant Religion, &amp;c. renouncing
all Evangelicall Counsells of perfection, as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
poverty, chastity &amp;c. and their avarice
having swallowed all the revenews, which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
men in a solitary life of meditation and
contemplation, they both want such effectuall
helps thereto, and dare not for fear of being
censured as half-Catholiques, commend or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the means proper and conducing to it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as the very name of <hi>Contemplation</hi> is
unknown among them, I mean in the mysticall
sense: for all that is understood among them in
their Treatises of devotion by that word, is only
the descanting upon any mystery of divinity, or
passage of Scripture.</p>
               <p>8. Finding therefore not only beyond, but
contrary to my expectation, such a trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure in
the Catholique Church as true Devotion, an
union with, and participation of the Divine
Nature, and the means to purchase this treasure
being so obvious there, and so unknown all the
world over besides; could I do lesse then say,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:46209:239"/>
                  <hi>Quis dabit mibi pennas ficut Columba? Who
will give me wings like a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve, that I may fly
into the wildernesse,</hi> retired out of the world,
<hi>and be at rest?</hi> that wildernesse into which God
ha's promised that he will bring his chosen ones,
in which <hi>loquetur ad cor corum,</hi> i. e. He will
communicate himself familiarly unto them: I
do freely confesse my partiality, I could not
chuse but wish that truth might appear to me to
be the companion of Holinesse, and that that
church which could give such admirable directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to love God, might not deceive us when she
would instruct us to know him. In a word, I
was the easilier perswaded to believe and submit
to the churches authority, because thereby I was
sure to evacuate pride, and an esteem of mine
own sufficiency to be mine own directour, and
by consequence to exercise at least an act of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and obedience, if not of faith.</p>
               <p>9. As for the prejudices and accusations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, which I once imputed to the
<hi>Catholike Church,</hi> the clearing of them is not at
all difficult; for as for the first, the whole force
of it lyes in this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that Christ is accused to have
taken care both for the subsistence and honour
of his servants and Ministers; a fault that no
sect can forgive, as if they intended to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon their seducing Ministers, by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to beggery and dishonor. But this
was never the disposition of Catholiques, they
have alwayes willingly afforded this double
honour to the Clergy, and yet never any
Church upon earth laid so heavy censures upon
avarice, Usury and Simony, as the Catholique
Church both done. Concerning the 2. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:46209:239"/>
of Indulgences and Pardons is in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
words condemned by the Councell of
Trent: So that it is not the Church, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
Paradice so freely to rich men, but only
particular avaricious Priests, who I fear do by
such vain promises shut it both against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and such customers. To the 3. the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
onely concernes two or three private
Casuists, so far from being justified by the
church, that the Pope hath expressely censured
and condemned them. Concerning the 4. I
fear indeed the scandall of prostituting absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the greatest crimes upon ridiculous
penances is but too common; but yet without
any fault of the church; yea we may reasonably
judge of the mind of the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> in
that respect, by the zealous practises of S. <hi>Charls
Barromée</hi> (then whom no man had a greater
influence upon that Councell) who <hi>immediatly</hi>
after its <hi>dissolution</hi> spent himself wholly in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to restore the <hi>antient discipline,</hi> as
far as this wicked age could bear it, according
to the mind of that Councell. For the 5. as the
rest, it only reflect; upon particular persons,
and touches not the church at all. The like may
be said of the last, which speaks of <hi>Attrition,</hi>
and the <hi>sufficiency thereof with the Sacrament
of Penance to qualifie a person guilty of sin for
Remission:</hi> Upon better enquiry I found that
all <hi>Catholique Authors,</hi> though they assent to
that doctrine in grosse, yet they do not all agree
in their explication of the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Attrition.</hi>
For in direct opposition to my pre-conceived
prejudice, I find, that (not to speak of <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
and his followers, who professe to embrace
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:46209:240"/>
S. <hi>Augustines Doctrine</hi> therein) the learned
<hi>Estius</hi> and <hi>Sylvius</hi> (the former in l. 4. <hi>sentent,
dist.</hi> 16. 9. and the latter in <hi>suppl. D. Tho. ad</hi>
3. <hi>p. a. 1. q.</hi> 1.) do thus expresse themselves,
that there are foure acceptions of the word
<hi>Attrition,</hi> according to <hi>four Motives</hi> unto
sorrow for sin. 1. Out of meer naturall and
humane motives, as losse of goods, fame, health,
&amp;c. 2. Out of fear of hell, and not at all the
love of God. 3. For the offence indeed commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against God, but yet this out of an in-effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious,
suspended, and meer optative will.
Now none of these three, say they, are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
even with the Sacrament, to qualifie a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for the remission of his sins: But only the
fourth, which is indeed <hi>essentially Contrition,</hi>
but an imperfect one, according to the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> being a <hi>Grief for
sin,</hi> because God is offended, joyn'd with an
absolute purpose no more to offend him, and
proceeding from a will to please him, as deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to be loved above all things, though this
will be as yet feeble, remisse, and imperfect.
This they say is the lowest qualification that
with the Sacrament can suffice to remission of
sins. And this they resolutely contend to be the
<hi>sense of the Councell of Trent;</hi> grounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon this, to their seeming firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
viz. <hi>That it is against Scriptures, and the
Doctrine of the antient Church, to say, that a
man without any degree of true charity can be
capable of the remission of his sins, or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God.</hi> But very many dissent from the

there <hi>imperfect Contrition) excluding a will of
sinning, and joyn'd with a hope of pardon, but
arising from a consideration of the filthinesse of
sin, and fear of punishment for it, although
without the Sacrament of Penance it cannot of
it selfe bring a sinner to justification, yet it
disposes him to the obteining the Grace of God
in that Sacrament: And that it does not</hi> (as
<hi>Calvin</hi> affirmes) <hi>make a man a hypocrite, or
more a sinner then before; but on the contraery,
that it is a gift of God, and an impulse of the

Then which what could be spoken
more moderately, cantelously, and piously? To
conclude this argument, Scandalls there will
and must be in the church to the end of the
world, as our Saviour foretold; and withall, as
he foretold a grievous woe to the authors of
them; and a blessing proportionable to those
that would not be scandalized, that is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would joyne in heart to consent to such
scandalls, nor out of hatred of them to usurp
the Angells office (who only are deputed to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
and pluck up all scandalls at the end of
the world) or to rent the mysticall body of
Christ.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Conclusion: wherein the imputation
of inconstancy charged upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
is answered: as likewise of
forsaking a Religion, because it was
persecuted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. BEfore I wholly take off my pen from
this paper, I will, though not without
some indignation and grief, answer two impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which have been charged upon me since
my declaring my self a Catholique; the first of
which is inconstancy: That which raises these
passions in me, in regard of this, is only my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and charity to the authors of such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
which I fear preceeds from a poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
root of bitternesse, I mean a contempt of
Religion in generall: They that would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a fault for a man that had found out a
new mystery or trade of thriving, to embrace
that, and forsake another in which he had spent
the whole former part of his life: They that
would not impute this as a fault to a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
one sect of Philosophy, and to embrace
another, either for the greater probability of it,
or even the gracefulnesse of being new, or a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox:
Yea they that would impute it as a folly
and morosity, if a man did not conform himself
to any fashionable novelty in cloaths, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
or opinion: Such men as these, who
think that profit, or fancy, or vanity may excuse
inconstancy, and make it commendable; esteem
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:46209:241"/>
it a vice only, when conscience and the glory of
God, and eternity is in question. Religion is
the only thing that must be left to the hazard,
whether good or bad it must not be changed,
and it is dishonorable for a man that is in the
way to hell to avoid it, or to accept of heaven,
unlesse he was born with a right to it. So that
the Jews, who, to keep themselves to their old
<hi>Rabbins;</hi> and the Pagans, who, to maintaine
their old even in their own <hi>opinion ridiculous
Idols,</hi> rejected <hi>our Saviour,</hi> shall in such mens
<hi>opinions</hi> deserve the commendation of constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the Apostles for hearkning to him, <hi>who
only had the words of eternall life,</hi> shall not
escape their censure. For my part I professe,
though I had not believed the Fathers, who with
one mouth protest that Schisme and Heresie are
most mortall and almost unpardonable sins;
if I had only esteemed them as lesse good to my
soul, I would have done that right to my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as both to have rejected them, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
likewise the rejecting them. The Apostle
commands us to <hi>try all things,</hi> and thus far I
suppose that such objectors, if it were only for
<hi>curiosities</hi> sake, would agree with him; but he
adds further, <hi>hold fast that which is good:</hi>
but here they would leave him, and say, Hold
fast that which you held before, whether it be
good or bad, let your reason judge of good
things, but withall let it reject even the best,
rather then be unconstant. Indeed if by being a
Catholique I had relinquished any good thing
whereof I was possessed being a Protestant; if
my fidelity to temporall Superiours, my love to
my Countrey and friends, &amp;c. were not even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:46209:242"/>
by this change, I should blush to hear
such an objection for mine own sake; whereas
now I both blush and grieve only for their
sakes; and my only revenge on them, shall be to
beseech God to blesse them, with bestowing on
them this very fault of inconstancy, that they
may live to change at least this little lesse then
Atheisticall opinion. To conclude, I desire
them first to meditate well whether they be not
concerned in that character which S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
(<hi>de Bapt, cont. Don. l.</hi> 2.) gives certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in his time, <hi>who</hi> (saith he) <hi>whilst they are
afraid to be reprehended for a small time here
for inconstancy, are not afraid to be damned
for eternity.</hi> And next, whether I be not absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in another speech of the same Father, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(<hi>cont. Cresc. lib.</hi> 3.) <hi>As it is a landable
thing not to be removed from a true opinion, so
it is a blameable thing to persist in a false one;
which never to have held is the prime commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion,
but the second, to change it; that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which is true may remain from the
beginning, or at least by rejecting the false one,
the true one may succeed:</hi> And likewise in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parallell one of S. <hi>Ambrose, (Ep. 31. ad
Valent. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mp.) I am not ashamed to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the whole old aged world; seeing no
age is too late to learne that which is good:
Let that old age blush which cannot amend it
selfe, &amp;c. it is no shame to change for the
better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This objection only reflects upon my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;
but the next wounds me in the point
of honesty; for I am charged with ingratitude
for leaving a church, (wherein I had been bred,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:46209:242"/>
and received more then ordinary favours) in
the time of her affliction and persecution.
Whereto I answer. 1. That if God was pleased
to make affliction an occasion of illumination
to me, who was I that I should wilfully shut
mine eys against his light? 2. If I had, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the example of many, passed over from the
persecuted party to the persecutors, there might
have been some ground of an ill suspition. But
it was so far from that; that I made choice of a
Church, whose only portion both in war and
peace was persecution, and this to be expected by
her whether party soever prevailed; if the King
was restored, all that her members could hope for,
was to return to their antient pressures, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon their goods, but lives also. This was
the portion of that church which I embraced,
if that party had been victorious. But on the
other side, if the bloudy designes of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
(who only then appeared) had succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
what a cup of bitternesse and terror was
prepared for the poor Catholiques? what lesse
then utter desolation even to sowing with salt
was to be expected from persons, who professe
a tyranny even upon the souls of all men, that
dissent from them in the sleightest opinions;
from persons, who were the contrivers of those
bloudy laws against Catholiques, not so much
out of conscience, or out of hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to them, as
for their worldly designes, and against the
Kings interests, yea to be a snare unto him; for
what disadvantage could it be to his Majesty,
that his Subjects should enjoy the liberty of
their consciences? and what more fatall engine
did they make use of to ruine the late King
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:46209:243"/>
withall, then by calumniating him with suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Popery, either when any new ceremony
was instituted, or when the rigour of the law
was mollified against an innocent Priest? from
persons lastly, who could not forbear to threaten
ruine even to their best friends; who, whereas
they had been sollicited by them to expose their
lives to free their souls from tyranny, saw
themselves ready to be a prey to the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
prodigious tyranny that ever was. It
is true, of late God ha's been pleased most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously
to <hi>break the jaw bones of those Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and to commit his people to more mercifull
hands; they may be permitted to hope for some
ease from Governors, whose profession is to
leave mens consciences to God, to whom only
they are naked and in the light; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that they themselves have by Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
goodnesse escaped that danger, whereby
Gods purpose seems to have been to teach them
<hi>mercy in the School of Experience.</hi> But these
were things almost above my wishes, much
more above my hopes, when I first embraced
<hi>Catholique Religion.</hi> I was then so far from
forsaking a church, because it was persecuted,
that it was <hi>persecution</hi> I fled to, <hi>persecution</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
with most admirable patience and joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
it was <hi>persecution</hi> that invited me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Catholique;</hi> for this I relinquished pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
fortunes, and all hopes of future; this made
me esteem the losse of my naturall Country,
hindred, and most dear friends a great gain and
preferment. Lastly, for this I can without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
hear my self stiled a desertor of my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
because it was persecuted, even when I
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:46209:243"/>
embrac'd a Religion, which was persecuted by
that very church that complained of the injustice
of persecution, and when she complained so, yet
persecuted <hi>Catholiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. Therefore rejoycing and glorying in such
a happy crime as inconstancy, and in so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
an imputation, as forsaking truth for
persecution, and neglecting such unreasonable
accusers, I will as I ought, turn my self to the

to whom the account therein is given;
yet since not only it, but whatsoever shall be
said by others to its prejudice (as it can scarce
be avoided, but that writings of such a nature
will find either <hi>Contradictors,</hi> or at least severe

to the authors person, but his cause, which is
thine also, as thou art a <hi>Catholique</hi>) the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of such candour and charity, thou art ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
entreated to take into thy consideration
that the Authors design was not to publish
<hi>a book of Controversies,</hi> nor to venditate any
particular opinion of his own in any point, now
in debate between <hi>Catholikes</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi>
but to perform an act of obedience; And being
in his own intention then ready to take his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
of the world, (in conformity to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of others,) to leave as it were a <hi>Yestamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
legacy</hi> to all <hi>Christians,</hi> therein satisfying
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> that his Union with them was
not an effect of interest, or any suddain humor
of discontent, or inconstancy, but the fruit of
as much advisednesse and reason as he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of; and tacitly inviting <hi>Protestants,</hi> if
his proceedings could approve themselves to
them, by his example and Method to get a
vievv of truth, disintangled and unclouded from
preconceived, unjust prejudices, and out of
love to that truth and most necessary care of
their own safety, in heart at least to forsake the
dwelling, which they might feel begin to shake
and tremble under their feet.</p>
               <p>3. Whosoever therefore shall vouchsafe to
read this Book, if he will give a right judgment
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:46209:245"/>
of it, must let the Authors meaning be the
spirit of it; and then he will look upon it and
consider it, as <hi>Tabulam Votivam,</hi> in which is
represented the <hi>Authors</hi> safety and happinesse
procured by a ship wrack, and his liberty effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a captivity, and by suffering his hands and
feet to be restrained by chaines never, by Gods
grace, to be cast off. In a word, he will there
for the time, be a witnesse and Auditor to one
that ha's been perswaded simply and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to tell a homely, but most true story of
the fortunes, which happened to him in a
strange countrey, discovering by what unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
means, and with what unseen snares, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Catholique Truth</hi> (Gods mercifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
so disposing it) did unawares most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
entangle, arrest and fasten him in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church,</hi> at a time, when of all others he
least apprehended a captivity from that Coast.</p>
               <p>4. The instruments employed by God to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this Captivity, were especially these two.
1. The conversation of a worthy, prudent and
learned friend, namely <hi>Doctor H. Holden,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of the faculty of <hi>Paris.</hi> And 2. the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall
of a little book, entituled, <hi>Reigle Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
de la foy Catholique,</hi> written in French by
<hi>Mons. Francois Veron,</hi> Doctor of Divinity, and
Pastor of the <hi>Catholike Congregation at Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton.</hi>
These two proceeding in all points almost
upon the same grounds, and in the same order,
in a short time effected that <hi>Conviction</hi> in me,
which many volumes of <hi>Catholique Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
formerly used, and a world of <hi>Verball
disputes</hi> had in vain attempted.</p>
               <p>5. In brief, the method and proceeding, by
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:46209:246"/>
which these two successefully effected their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
designs upon me, was this. I was at that
time, (more then in their opinion, for they said
it was in their certain knowledge) out of the
Church; and according to mine own perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in at least a <hi>faileable</hi> and <hi>fallible Church,</hi>
a <hi>Church</hi> that could pretend to no authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my conscience, as a Christian, but meerly
over my externall actions and profession, as an
Englishman; And withall, such a Church as in
the then present circumstances was become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
languishing, and in a very doubtfull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for subsistence. Herupon I became sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
(upon an imagined supposition of her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
defaillance) how to make the least impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
choice, among all other separated Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
and Sects, in case I should really be put
upon such a necessity.</p>
               <p>6. Being full of these thoughts, and vexed
to the heart, both at my self, and all other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctartes,
that I was become so hard to be pleased,
and that none of them could represent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to me with any qualities fit to invite me
to joyn with them, neither could I induce my
self to overlook or pardon a world of defects
and deformities, which I could not but observe
in each of them: In these circumstances, being
obliged by many occasions and businesses to
frequent the conversation of the foresaid wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
friend, then my neighbour, and not being
able to conceal the agitation of my thoughts;
he before-hand knowing that, whether the
<hi>Church of England</hi> failed or no, I stood in
absolute need of a <hi>Church</hi> for my Soul, &amp; now
perceiving that I was in quest after a treasure,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:46209:246"/>
in places where it was not to be found, he gave

               <p>7. By this means I found that all the furniture,
with which I had for so many years provided
my self to combat against <hi>Catholikes,</hi> or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
my self from them, was taken out of my
hands: I perceived that in the depth and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of my spirit, I was really, though unknown
to my self, a <hi>very Catholike,</hi> before I was a
<hi>Catholique:</hi> For all the necessary declared do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of <hi>Catholike Religion,</hi> (as they are
expressed in the language of the Church) I
found I had never rejected: and as for those
points, which I could not digest, and for vvhich
I had been averted from the <hi>Church,</hi> I found
that they were particular dogme's either of
some popular controvertists or Schoolmen, or
affixed to certain <hi>Orders,</hi> and as freely renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:46209:247"/>
from the notion of necessary <hi>Catholike Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
by other unsuspected <hi>Catholikes,</hi> as
they had been by my self.</p>
               <p>8. Hereupon that inward satisfaction of
mind (which attended this discovery) <hi>love of
unity</hi> and a complacence in the security of an
established state of mind, made me hasten to
professe my self <hi>our Lords</hi> and his <hi>Churches
Captive.</hi> I was quickly weary of that former

obliged, if not more, (supposing that I would
enjoy the priviledges of that Congregation) to
change the outward profession of my <hi>Creed,</hi> as
my habits or fashion of life. Having an <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

faith,</hi> to enrich it with; a <hi>Faith</hi> not fashioned
according to the humor and garb of <hi>Nations,
Cities</hi> and <hi>Villages;</hi> a <hi>Faith,</hi> the very same

a <hi>Faith,</hi> upon which neither the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               </argument>
               <p>1. WHen I was employed about the
first publishing of this Book, the
hast of the <hi>Printer,</hi> and my thoughts
then busie about a matter of much greater
importance to me, then the <hi>printing</hi> or
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:46209:248"/>
                  <hi>publishing</hi> of books, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>solliciting</hi> an
admission and unchangeable abode among the
<hi>French Carthusians,</hi> made me that I could not

did almost suspect, might, as it hath proved,

beneficiall to me, though I had no <hi>Obligation</hi>
nor <hi>intention</hi> to assent to them. However this
neglect of naming them, derived upon my selfe
the censures of those, that having been taught
otherwise, judged every thing to be <hi>Heterodox</hi>
and <hi>unsound,</hi> that was not favoured by their
particular <hi>Masters,</hi> or that was delivered in
such <hi>Phrases</hi> and expressions as their ears had

               <p>2. Had it not been for these (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>igorous
imputations and censures, which (as I have been
informed) certain, questionlesse, well meaning
<hi>Catholiques</hi> have given of this inconsiderable
<hi>Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God forbid I should condemn the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
of such censures, since I am confident the
ground of them was not any passion against me
(a stranger to them, and only known by the
happinesse befallen me of being a <hi>Catholique</hi>)
but a <hi>zeale to the Purity of Catholique truth.</hi>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:46209:248"/>
The <hi>Method</hi> of the book, and the <hi>manner of
stating controversies</hi> in it, was indeed somwhat
new in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore no wonder if
some were startled at it. Besides, if I had had
the <hi>Providence</hi> or leasure to have softend some
expressions, and to have made it appear, that
that latitude in <hi>Disputes,</hi> which in <hi>England</hi>
will not passe so freely, yet in <hi>France</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Catholique Countryes</hi> is very receiveable,
they would have seen, that it was not my fault,
but my fortune only to displease them.</p>
               <p>4. In this <hi>Review</hi> of <hi>my Book,</hi> I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to give them all the satisfaction pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
I have added the explanation of severall
phrases, which were before hard of <hi>Digestion,</hi>
I have quoted the severall <hi>Authors,</hi> whose
<hi>larger Opinions</hi> I had occasionally made use
of; I have protested my disengagement from
particular <hi>Dogmes;</hi> Nay I have not refused to
retract and cancell, what I judged fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
and more I could not do with a good
<hi>Conscience.</hi> For the generall argument of the
book, being a story of what was pass'd, it was
not possible for me to alter any thing in the
Narration; for God himself cannot make that
which ha's been, not to have been: Or if I
should publish my self so palpable a lyar; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some passages do displease some persons,
therefore to say that such things were not such,
what good or convenience would proceed from
a lye? God is my witnesse, in matters of this
nature, I despise credit: Nay more, I know
not how, but I find a gust in making a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation,</hi>
whensoever I can conceive it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
For I count it no vertue to write plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:46209:249"/>
or eloquently, or learnedly: But I esteem
it a great vertue not to persist in an errour,
nor because I haue said a thing once, therefore
ever after to maintain it, for a false or vain
credits sake. If I have not given sufficient proof
of this in this second <hi>Edition</hi> of my book, I
do beg of every charitable <hi>Catholique Reader</hi>
to suggest to me what they yet shall judge fit to
be altered, and to give me <hi>convincing reasons</hi>
for it, and I promise them a very cheerfull rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
to content them, and not great resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
against being <hi>convinced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Only this one thing I must professe to
them, that it is not a <hi>convincing argument</hi>
to me to hear any say, <hi>Other Controvertist's
have inwrapped within their treatises many
Thoologicall Doctrines beyond what Catholike
Religion obliges them to, as concerning the
Popes Infallibility, &amp;c. therefore you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to follow their example.</hi> For I must
needs tell them, that besides it is in it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to spend time in <hi>disputing</hi> with
<hi>Protestants</hi> upon <hi>Questions</hi> in which some <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi>
will be of their side: I cannot but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the unsuccessefulnesse in such disputes, and
the paucity of <hi>Converts,</hi> to such a way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
<hi>Controversies,</hi> when <hi>Catholiques</hi> shew
what a number of <hi>Doctrines</hi> they are able to
<hi>maintain</hi> more then is necessary, and more
then concern <hi>Protestants</hi> to hear of. So that
it is to be feared the design of such <hi>Catholique
writers</hi> is not so much to seek the <hi>Conversion</hi>
of <hi>Protestants,</hi> as to shew their zealous adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the particular <hi>Doctrines</hi> of their <hi>Order
or Party.</hi> For mine own part, truly I am no
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:46209:249"/>
tyed to any <hi>peculiar Dogmes;</hi> that holy <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi>
to which by Gods providence, I am
inserted an unworthy Member, does not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
that violence over <hi>spirits,</hi> subject to them,
as to force a belief of any unnecessary distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<hi>Doctrines</hi> upon <hi>them,</hi> or a profession of
doctrines, which they do not believe, or would
not, if they lived any where else; Conscience
and not faction or partiality is the director of
our assent, and it is from the <hi>Church</hi> only, that
we receive the <hi>Rule</hi> of that assent. Now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
this liberty, and having, I thank God,
neither hopes nor fears from the world, I will
not captivate my own understanding to any but
God and his Church, nor my tongue or pen to
any particular Schoolman or Controvertist.
Now my meaning is, not hereby to imply that
I condemn any of these Doctrines, but onely
that I desire leave, being to deal with <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
to be silent, and take no notice of such
questions, wherein they are not concerned,
but are (whil'st troubled with those disputes)
so much the longer detained from entring into
<hi>Catholique Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Having made this profession of my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to offend none, and yet withall of being
subject to none, but the <hi>Church,</hi> to which only,
and not any Faction in the <hi>Church,</hi> my desires
and endeavours shall be to invite Protestants;
and to which, if by Gods blessing they adjoyn
themselves, they shall be equally welcome to me,
to whatsoever party in it they shal range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
If hereafter any Catholique will not
content himself with that satisfaction, which I
have, and will, as far as reason and conscience
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:46209:250"/>
will permit, give him: If he be unlearned, I
must desire him to dispense with me for taking
Rules from him how to manage <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies:</hi>
If he be learned, and especially if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
be imployed in the <hi>Conversion of souls,</hi>
then I desire him to give me leave with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and humility to ask him, is there any such
priviledge given to any <hi>Rank of English Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,</hi>
as that souls may not be suffered to be
converted, unlesse it be upon the grounds of
<hi>Suarez,</hi> or <hi>Scotus,</hi> or <hi>Becanus,</hi> &amp;c.? Is it
lawfull in <hi>France</hi> to propose the churches do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
pure and unmixed with privat opinions,
and is that unlawfull in <hi>England?</hi> Is the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Trent</hi> a suspected Rule, without such or
such a <hi>Doctours interpretation?</hi> I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that severall persons, and I have known
some that have reaped good by so despiseable a
Treatise as this; God, whose power is made
perfect in weaknesse, giving his blessing to so
imperfect, but well meaning work: Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
charitable Catholique envy this, or be
sorry that <hi>Protestants</hi> should be delivered
by any from their errours and Schisme, unlesse
the <hi>instrument of their conversion</hi> devote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to all your particular <hi>distinctive Tenets?</hi>
Truly for my part, if, since my being a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi>
I have entertained any particular <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi>
though they should be never so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to yours, yet since with all that
difference, we remain both of us firmly united
in the beliefe and profession of all <hi>Doctrines
truly Catholique,</hi> I should willingly and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
encourage any <hi>Protestant</hi> to believe you,
and condemn me, upon condition that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:46209:250"/>
of you, and prejudice against me,
might be an inducement to him the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to entertaine a good <hi>opinion</hi> and <hi>liking
of Catholique Religion</hi> it self. If in this
Book there be mentioned any <hi>opinions</hi> in your
<hi>opinion</hi> too large, yet doubtlesse you cannot
but know, that they are publiquely and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulably
asserted by unquestioned <hi>Catholique
Authors:</hi> Or however the Quotations will now
inform you so much, and direct you to their
<hi>particular Treatises.</hi> And the principall of
these Authors are <hi>Salmeron, Bacon, Molina,
&amp;c.</hi> learned Fathers of the <hi>Society;</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Salmanticensis, Monsieur Veron, Estius,
&amp;c.</hi> Out of such Authors as these I do quote
many passages and opinions, accounted indeed
generally of the largest allowance, but yet not
condemned by any: On the contrary, their
books have been in the highest manner appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
These opinions I quote, not as mine own,
for I professe against espousing any in this
Book; but as doctrines and interpretations,
though not so generally embraced, yet univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
uncondemned. Now shall these men
passe untouched, who asserted, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
such opinions, and must I be traduced,
as an unsound <hi>Catholique,</hi> for transcribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, and for only saying that they
said so.</p>
               <p>7. Experience of what is past, obliges
me to prevent misconstructions for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
for which purpose this little that hath
beene said, shall suffice. And now <hi>dear Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Reader,</hi> I once more addresse my
selfe to thee, and to give thee assurance that
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:46209:251"/>
thou maist freely and without suspition read
this Book, the <hi>Authenticall Approbations</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed

unto thee, that in my heart I do find a
great aversenesse from admitting any noveltyes
in opinion, or any suspitious questionable
dogmes: and to shew my self a true son of the
<hi>Catholique church.</hi> I do here with an humble
clear confidence pronounce, that <hi>I do submit,
not only my self, but all my writings and
words, yea my very thoughts (as far as
thoughts can be judged by a humane Tribunal)
to the judgement of the holy Catholique Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
church, of his Holinesse, the Head of the

seduce us, and <hi>happinesse</hi> it self will be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our ruine. The experience that we see
every day of this (me thinks) should make us
even feel and acknowledge, that <hi>Faith is the
pure gift of God,</hi> and by consequence that those,
who rely upon the conduct of their own uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Reason, are almost certain to be mislead
by it.</p>
               <p>2. When I wrote this Book, I did expect no
other, but that it (proceeding from a very weak
and imperfect judgment) should be obnoxious
to contempt and censures of both <hi>Catholikes</hi>
and others, from whom it could not conceal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
imperfections that were in it, so that I was
not much surprised to hear it severely judged.
But I had little suspition, that <hi>Protestants</hi> could
extract from it arguments to confirm them in
their errors: yet even this ha's happened. And
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:46209:252"/>
this (I confesse) pierces me to the heart; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and compassion to souls (so in love with
their errors, that the confutation of them makes
them more in love with, and better perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them) swallows up all the anger and
resentment, that nature would fain raise in me,
to see my <hi>conceptions</hi> so unjustly pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>verted, and
urges me, for the good of their souls, and not
for mine own credit, to let such <hi>Chymicall</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors
of errors from truth see that their art
ha's failed them.</p>
               <p>3. I heare there have appeared severall books
written by <hi>Protestants,</hi> in which the Authors
have taken advantage from some misunderstood
passages in my EXOMOLOGESIS. Onely
one such book is come to my sight, or rather
only a Preface to my L. <hi>Falklands</hi> discourse of
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> written by a person unknown to
me, but onely by these two letters <hi>J. P.</hi> and an
extract out of another book, which I have not
seen. By answering of which <hi>Preface,</hi> as far as
it touches me, I conceive grounds will be laid,
upon which any other Objections made by
<hi>Protestants</hi> may find and answer, if the <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
will please to make application.</p>
               <p>4. It will not be needfull to transcribe the
whole <hi>Preface</hi> at large here, but I shall set down
very faithfully and candidly the substance of it
in severall particulars in order, and adjoyn unto
them as distinct and satisfactory an Answer, as
I can at the present, considering the great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Paris,</hi> where this is written, and my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providednesse
of Papers and Books. <hi>And that
being done</hi> (if I be permitted) I will take that
boldnesse, which my most <hi>deare Lord,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:46209:252"/>
of the following Discourse of <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
would (if he were living, I am sure) have
given me, to shew the invalidity of it against
<hi>Catholike Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. As for the Preface of <hi>J. P.</hi> in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon the most deserved praises of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Lord,</hi> excellently represented in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Dedication.</hi> I acknowledge my self [I
cannot say his convert: for many years before
him I was a witnesse of the merits, that might
challenge them, but] one that does entirely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with him in that point; And if my most
<hi>worthily lov'd</hi> and <hi>honoured Friend,</hi> M. <hi>Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi>
the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Dedication,</hi> will onely
give me leave to except out of the severall heads
of his praises, this one, of having (as he thinks)
efficaciously and meritoriously written against
the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> (and woe is me for my
<hi>dearest Lords</hi> sake, that this must needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
I would willingly subscribe my name
under his: he knows I have enjoyed an equall
happinesse with him, to be a witnesse of all those
his admirable qualities. He knowes, that though
with lesse deserts, yet with (perhaps) equall
good fortune, I have had my share in that unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
friendship of his; the memory of which
is the pleasing est image that the world ha's left
in my mind, since I made a resolution to quit
the world. Indeed it is an image too pleasant
to be look'd upon, considering my present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and profession; were it not that it can
never offer it self but accompanied with a most
piercing compassion, that those stupendious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and abilities were not crownd with
<hi>Catholike Belief;</hi> yea, which is most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:46209:253"/>
were employed against it. In one thing
I must needs yeeld to M. <hi>Triplet,</hi> which
is, that I cannot pretend to the ability to
erect so beautifull a monument to the memory
of that <hi>honoured Lord,</hi> nor with so delicate a
touch draw his <hi>picture,</hi> as he ha's done in his
<hi>Dedication,</hi> for which expression both of his
gratitude and skill, I think my self obliged
to pay him my most humble thanks: And I
will take the permission with him to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to the imitation of my <hi>Lord, his now one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sonne,</hi> all those admirable qualities of his
<hi>deceased Father,</hi> onely beseeching him, that he
would not (and beseeching God, that, neither
he nor any of his friends may) account among
such qualities, the writing of such Discourses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Catholike truth,</hi> which occasioned the
publishing of an Elogy of him equally very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall and very naturall.</p>
               <p>6. Thus much of the <hi>Preface</hi> therefore
being acknowledged to be unanswerable,
the designe of all that follows is. 1. To shew
that the doctrine of the churches <hi>Infallibility</hi>
is of all others most generall and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and which, if it could be demonstrated,
would immediately decide all other controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
2. That therefore none can seriously think
<hi>Protestants</hi> so unreasonable, but that if they
were perswaded of the truth of this, they would
presently submit, and leave all disputing. 3. But
yet since it seems evident to them, that some
<hi>Decisions of the Church</hi> are contradictory to
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which <hi>Catholiques</hi> propound as
infallibly true; Therefore it is necessary, that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
ought to be demonstrated at least to
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:46209:253"/>
a higher degree of evidence then they have of the
<hi>contradiction</hi> of the <hi>Churches Decisions</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Rule of Gods Word. 4. That no such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
hath been made by Catholiques, the
<hi>great Defenders of the Church of England</hi> have
very excellently and fully demonstrated. 5. And
this with such successe, that the very name of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
begins to be burthensome even to the
maintainers of it, in so much that one of their <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and ablest Proselytes, Hugh Paulin de Cressy,</hi>
(as the author stiles him) which is a title that the
same <hi>Serenus Cressy,</hi> (for that is henceforth his
name assumed in Religion) utterly renounces &amp; is
most certain the Author can never justifie against
such a world of much more able Proselytes) <hi>hath
acknowledged the same word</hi> Infallibility <hi>to be
an unfortunate word, and too advantagious to
Protestants, and therefore fit to be forgotten, and
laid by.</hi> Wherupon the Author gives scope to a fit
of triumphing at the strength of reason and power
of truth, that a <hi>Catholique is forced or renounce so
fundamentall a doctrine, which yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not found in any Councell, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Now lest
it should be thought to be only the <hi>word (Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>)
but not the notion of it intended by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,</hi>
and understood by <hi>Protestants,</hi> that
is deserted by <hi>Mr. Cressy,</hi> the Author sayes, that
<hi>Protestants</hi> never impugned it by <hi>Nominall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>
producing a passage out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to
justifie the acknowledged sense of that word.
7. Hereupon the Author imputes to Mr. <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy</hi>
unreasonablenesse in answering <hi>Arguments</hi>
made against that which himself confesses cannot
be maintained. 8. And yet greater unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the manner of his answer, because desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46209:254"/>
                  <hi>Infallibility,</hi> he answers only for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church, and so makes this <hi>authority</hi>
answer for that <hi>Infallibility.</hi> From this last he
draws three consequent absurdities (which shall be
set down when their place comes to be answered)
9. Hereupon he profesles that, having considered
the inconsiderablenesse of M. <hi>Cressy's</hi> whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
he changed his resolution to answer it, as
judging it not to deserve an answer. 10. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he concludes the invinciblenesse of my L. <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
discourse of Infallibility</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. This is the mind and whole importance of
the <hi>Preface,</hi> which, whether rationall or no, shall
be examined; but it is confess'd to be orderly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and therefore shall be endeavoured to be
answered according to its order, and the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs</hi>
and divisions made by <hi>me,</hi> not himself.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">

               <argument>
                  <p>An Answer to the four first Paragraphs of the
Preface.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THat which the Author of the Preface sayes
in his first Paragraph (viz. <hi>That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the churhes Infallibility is of all other
most generall and comprehensive, and which, if
it could be demonstrated, would immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
all other controversies</hi>) is so conformable to
evident reason, that it cannot be denied. And that
which reason requires of me to acknowledge in the
first Paragraph, charity would invite me to grant
universally in the second. [viz. <hi>That if Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
were perswaded of the truth of this, they
would presently submit, and leave all disputing.</hi>]
Were it not that <hi>I. P.</hi> himself discourages me. I
doubt not but both himself and many others, (if
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:46209:254"/>
they were absolutely convinced of the <hi>churches
Infallibility</hi>) would not wilfully <hi>detain the truth
in unrighteousness,</hi> by continuing in an obstinate,
and then an acknowledged disobedience to the
church. But they behave themselves in the search
of the truth, as if they were afraid to find it. They
come with extreme prejudice and partiality to the
examination of the controversie, and if they can
find but any small advantage against any passage
in Catholike writers, though the churches doctrine
be not at all concerned in it, they presently give
the cause decided according to their own minds
and interests, which partiality of theirs seems much
more intense, and withal heightned with f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> greater
Passion, since the downfall of their Church then
ever it was before for indignation to see the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
weaknesse of their cause, imbitters them
much more in their disputes against Catholikes,
and encreases their obstinacy against the authority
of Gods church, as if they would be revenged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God for giving such an advantage to his
Church. Proofs of this (given by too many others)
will appear in the whole contexture of this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
as I shall demonstrate.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> J. P. <hi>sayes,</hi> That since it seems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to them, that some decisions of the Church
are contradictory to the Word of God, which
Catholiques propound as infallibly true; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is necessary that Infallibility ought to be
demonstrated at least to a higher degree of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
then they have of the contradiction of the
Churches decision to the infallible Rule of the
Scriptures. <hi>Truly this is not altogether unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
therefore to give him satisfaction, I
will fix a good while upon this point, though I
shall be forced to say over somewhat said already.</hi>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:46209:255"/>
Therefore according to the grounds of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Book, I will endeavor to clear the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as it is there handled, from the
mistakes of <hi>J. P.</hi> and to effect this more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously,
I will peruse this supposition.</p>
               <p>3. Let it be supposed, that the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did pretend to an <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or if you
will, to an <hi>authority</hi> of obliging all Christians
under pain of Damnation to submit to her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions.
This being supposed, and that I, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to enquire into the grounds of this pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
should betake my selfe to a meeting of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
learned <hi>Protestants,</hi> and say to them, since it
is so necessary that all Christians should receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in Christian Doctrine from you, <hi>Pray
let me know where I shall find it.</hi> This request
would presently raise a murmure amongst them,
and there is onely one answer in which they would
all agree, which is this; That that only is to be
accounted the doctrine of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which ha's been determined by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>English Bishops,</hi> ratified by the secular
head of the Church, the <hi>King,</hi> yet with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and embraced by all the
children and Subjects of the <hi>English Church.</hi> But
when they would descend more particularly to
signifie the speciall repositories of this Doctrine,
there would be great variety of answers; For the
most moderate of them would say confidently, it
is all to be found comprised sufficiently in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Catechisme made for Infants, others would
add the <hi>Common-Prayer book,</hi> others the book of
<hi>Homilyes,</hi> others would yet thrust in the book of
<hi>Ordination,</hi> others the 39. <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Canons;</hi>
others besides would have the <hi>four first Generall
Councells</hi> not to be forgotten; and lastly, some
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:46209:255"/>
few of those, who are pure <hi>Protestants</hi> indeed,
would say, the whole Canon Law, in as much as
concerns doctrine especially, and as far as it is
not revoked by <hi>Acts of Parliament:</hi> All this,
with all that went before, is the entire Rule of
<hi>English-Catholique Doctrine.</hi> And all those for
their severall answers would produce English Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Doctors, whose books have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and approved without contradiction in the
Church of England.</p>
               <p>4. To save the blushing of an <hi>English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi>
I would not suffer Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> nor
my Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> to put in their votes; for they
would have renounced all these, and protested,
that neither the <hi>Catechisme,</hi> nor <hi>Common-prayer-Book,</hi>
nor <hi>Homilies, &amp;c.</hi> nor all these together,
contain that doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
to which all are obliged to submit, but only <hi>the
Bible, the Bible, and nothing but the Bible,</hi> and
this not interpreted by any Bishop or Synod of
Divines, but by every good mans reason, let him
shift as he can: An answer, which it admitted,
not only totally destroyes the spirituall Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the English Clergy, but all authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
even of the civill Magistrate, in matters of
Religion; yet to shew the great impartiality of
<hi>English Protestants</hi> towards <hi>Catholike Faith,</hi>
because they fancied, that by such a position <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi>
might receive some damage, they not
only admitted this position of M. <hi>Chillingworths,</hi>
and saw it approved by their <hi>Doctor of the Chair,</hi>
but triumphed in it, as the great Master-piece <hi>of
the wit of this Age;</hi> whereas if they had but half
an eye open, they might have seen in it the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ruine of their whole Fabrick, So that <hi>J. P.</hi>
did not well consider what poor service he ha's
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:46209:256"/>
done, and what small refreshment he ha's given,
or rather what a dishonorable <hi>Epitaph</hi> he ha's fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the monument of his deceased Church,
by giving his Testimony of applause to this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of my Lo. <hi>Falklands,</hi> as one <hi>of the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of the Doctrine of the English</hi> Church,
which is more ruinous to it, then all the spitefull
writings and plots of <hi>Cartwright, Knox, Hender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
or all the rabble <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Geneva</hi> joyn'd with them.
But to return.</p>
               <p>5. A Supposition being made of the foresaid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and it being granted, that all these answers
have been published, or without contradiction or
censure admitted in the church of <hi>England,</hi> should
not that man be very negligent of his souls good;
that being to examine the truth of its doctrine,
should trouble himself any further then with the
little Catechism of half a sheet of paper, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and as simply written as is possible, as if the
children that are to learne it, had composed it;
since all say, it is at least part of the Rule of the
English Faith, and some, without censure of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
say it is all; what a while must the poore
mans soul be held in suspense, if he were to stay
till he had search'd into the <hi>Common-prayer-Book,
Homilies, Canons, Acts of Parliament, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the King, Antient Councels, Canon-Law,</hi>
&amp;c. his soul perhaps might be disposed by
death, God knows where, before he had examined
the hundredth part of what was necessary.</p>
               <p>6. Now to apply this to the present subject, it
is agreed by all Catholiques, that the church is an
infallible witness and guide; &amp; Protestants profess,
that if this could be made evidently appear, they
would hold out in no controversie at all, for
<hi>they would never dispute perpetually with them,</hi>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:46209:256"/>
whom onely to hear, were to be satisfied;
this therefore is to be made evident unto
Protestants; yea, more evident then that
any particular decisions of the Church do
seem to them evidently contradictory to
Scripture: This is the task of <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
especially <hi>Catholick Missionaries.</hi> Now,
though when it is said, <hi>The Church is infallible,</hi>
This be commonly understood of all the
whole Church in general; yet, when we say,
<hi>She is an infallible Guide;</hi> it is most ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood of the Church, speaking by
some authorised person or persons, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the whole body.</p>
               <p>7. About this Representative there is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of opinions among Catholicks: some
say the Pope alone does sufficiently represent
the Church, as a Guide infallible; Others, a
Generall Councell, though without the
Pope; Others, a Generall Councell convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
presided in, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Pope;<note place="margin">Annal. fidei, nu. 111. Syste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma fidei, ca. 22. This was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Gerson.</hi>
                  </note> And lastly
others (as learned <hi>Fa: Bacon</hi>
acknowledges) add further
this condition, that the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of such a Councell bee
accepted and submitted to
by the whole Church: All that hold any of
these opinions, are universally esteemed
good Catholiques, and I would to God all
Protestants had so much humility, as to
subdue their own private Reason to the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
of them; and for Catholiques, this I
may confidently say, That they, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
betraying the Truth, make the way to
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:46209:257"/>
the Church easiest and plainest, have most
charity and Faith enough; the others may
have more Faith, I would they had more
Charity too. Truly, to my understanding
there is some inhumanity in urging Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
to more then Catholiques will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to: or to think that to <hi>Protestants</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
with passion and partiality, that
can be made evident, which is so far from
being evident to some <hi>Catholiques,</hi> that they
renounce it. Since all changes therefore
proceed by degrees, in the name of God let
it not be expected from <hi>Protestants,</hi> that they
should with one leap mount to the utmost
verge and extent of all Doctrines, held by
<hi>Catholiques?</hi> That they should at one gulpe
swallow both all <hi>Catholique Doctrines,</hi> and all
<hi>Theologicall Dogmes.</hi> Be it granted therefore
that it is true, that the <hi>Pope is infallible:</hi> I will
beleeve it, as a <hi>Theological truth,</hi> but since nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Church</hi> nor the <hi>Pope</hi> himself has told
us so, I cannot, if I would, beleeve it, as a
<hi>Catholick Doctrine:</hi> what therefore have I to
do to dispute of it to Protestants, whom my
duty is onely to perswade to the belief of the
<hi>Churches Doctrine?</hi> What pitty is it that they
must be delayed, and as it were kept out
of the Church, till all objections that they
can make, and be furnished even from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
themselves to make against this posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
be answered, or all advantages that
they can advise against any <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Decretals</hi>
be cleared to their satisfaction.</p>
               <p>8. Therefore I being ingaged to make good
to <hi>I. P.</hi> That the <hi>Church</hi> (speaking by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:46209:257"/>
is an <hi>infallible Guide</hi>) would fain
choose that <hi>Representative,</hi> which is qualified
with all the conditions allowed by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censured
Catholicks, to make it most easie
and most acceptable to Protestants, which is a
<hi>general Councel Confirmed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by the Pope and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by the Church.</hi> But yet I wil abstract from
this last clause <hi>of being ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>epted by the Church,</hi>
(though there is not any one point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
in debate between us and them, for
which we have not all this authority) as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proved <hi>ex superabundanti</hi> in what I shall
say hereafter.</p>
               <p>9. That therefore which I undertake to
make evident to <hi>I. P.</hi> is, <hi>That the Church
speaking by a general Councel, confirmed by the
Pope, is an infallible Guide,</hi> (and that with
greater evidence, then he can bring for any
contradiction pretended betwixt any decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such a <hi>Councel,</hi> and the <hi>Scripture;</hi> yea,
with more evidence then he can produce for
the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self, which he owns for his
Guide.) which truly to an impartial hearer
is no difficult matter, even going upon his
own grounds: For if I should ask I. P. <hi>Why
do you acknowledge the Scripture to be an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rule, as far as it is a Rule?</hi> He would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me; <hi>Because it is delivered unto us, as
such, by an infallible Catholick Tradition:</hi> for
if he talks of any other proof, as a <hi>private
spirit,</hi> or <hi>natural reason,</hi> it will be ridiculous;
He may as well say he can judge and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
it to be such by smelling with his nose.
If I should further ask him, how it appears
evident to him, that the Scriptures have
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:46209:258"/>
been delivered by an <hi>infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ible Catholick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</hi>
He could not deny, but that many
<hi>Hereticks</hi> have denied many books of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
yea, that there is not any one book in
the <hi>Old or New Testament,</hi> but has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by some <hi>Hereticks</hi> and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
yet because some <hi>Councels</hi> have decided,
and <hi>Fathers</hi> witnessed, and the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> in all ages since have received them
as such; therefore it is evident, that they
have been delivered by the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Tradition.</hi> And this is most rational and
convincing. Upon these grounds therefore
I proceed; and ask any discreet indifferent
man, Whether an authority that shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner propose any doctrine, <hi>This
we have received from Christ and his Apostles,
that such and such a doctrine proposed, is a divine
infallible truth; and we command all Christians
whatsoever, under the pain of anathema and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
damnation, to beleeve it for such:</hi> whether
I say, such an authority does not assume to
it self the office of a <hi>Guide,</hi> and of an <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Guide?</hi> Certainly, he that should
speak in this stile, and yet have a guilt, or
be in a possibility of seducing, were the most
impious abhorred tyrant in the world. What
an attentat, an usurpation upon Gods Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Throne would this be, if God had
not derived this authority upon the Church
represented in a <hi>Councel?</hi> What a cruelty to
souls? What a blaspheming of the <hi>Holy-Ghost?</hi>
Now that this hath been the
stile of all <hi>General Councels</hi> is evident:
and that <hi>Councels</hi> speaking in that stile, have
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:46209:258"/>
been submitted to by the <hi>Fathers</hi> and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Church</hi> with all veneration, as the
<hi>Oracles of God,</hi> is equally apparent: nay, I
do not know that ever any <hi>Heretick</hi> (before
these daies) did expresly contradict this in
the <hi>Thesis;</hi> though <hi>in Hypothesi</hi> they have
renounced such <hi>particular Councels</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were <hi>Anathematized</hi> by. Therefore
not onely all <hi>Councels,</hi> but every <hi>Decision</hi> of
every <hi>Councel</hi> to which an <hi>Anathema</hi> is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
decides this question, and proclaims to
all the ends of the world this truth, <hi>That the
Church speaking in General approved Councels, is
an infallible Guide to all Christians.</hi> Against
this not a passage or word in any Father can
be produced, but infinite passages for it:
Hence it is that the <hi>Fathers</hi> unanimously
profess; That <hi>out of the Church there is no
possible salvation,</hi> because there is no Guide to
Heaven but in the <hi>Church.</hi> If therefore it
be a proof evident enough to I. P. of an
universal <hi>infallible tradition</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that
one or two not <hi>General Councels,</hi> did with
some variety set down the number and names
of the books, and that generally speaking,
the <hi>Fathers</hi> have amongst them given attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them, some to some books, and some to
others, few to all; and that the Church in
after ages hath universally accepted them, as
such; How short comes that <hi>tradition</hi> of this,
concerning <hi>the infallible Guidance of the
Church,</hi> that is vertually decided in all
Councels, and every decision of all attested
by all Fathers, not one in one passage contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
or condemning that stile; but una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:46209:259"/>
in all ages since Councels were
accepted by the Church, approved and
submitted to: how opposite is this truth to
the main design of his following discourse,
which attempts to prove, that there is in the
Church no infallible Guide at all? And how
contradictory to that <hi>Article of his Church,</hi>
concerning not onely the <hi>fallibility,</hi> but <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
erring of Councels?</hi> And again, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
is this way of proceeding to the
authority given upon Record, in Scripture
by our blessed Saviour to his Church? I say
<hi>to his Church;</hi> for the Fathers assembled in
Councel speak not thus in their own persons,
nor as so many learned men, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the whole Church, which they <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
and do no more but subsume <hi>particulars</hi>
under that <hi>General Anathema,</hi> pronounced by
our blessed Saviour, when he said, <hi>If he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to here the Church, let him be unto thee, as
a Heathen and a Publican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. I conjure therefore I. P. and all his
and my friends, that he and they would
produce, or at least set before their own eyes
those <hi>Decisions of Councels,</hi> which seem to
them evidently false, because clearly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and compare his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a seeming contradiction, with this
evidence, that it is impossible there should
be such a contradiction; and if they do this
with a serious minde, and desire to finde the
truth, that they may embrace it, and with
hearts lifted up to God, to free them from
all respects of the world, and to enlighten
their souls with the love of his truth, then
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:46209:259"/>
perhaps they may see that, which as yet it
seems is invisible to them; it is most certain,
there is not one express <hi>formal text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
contradictory to any <hi>Catholick Doctrine;</hi>
this they confess themselves. And indeed,
even abstracting from the promises made by
Christ to his Church, it is morally impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that so many wise and vertuous men,
should with the one hand give the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
as <hi>Gods word,</hi> and with the other present
Doctrines expresly and directly contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to it, and none be able to observe the
contradiction, though their daily study was
to meditate upon, and interpret the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Now whether any consequence from
obscure texts can be more forcible, then
that which I have named from the stile of
<hi>General Councels,</hi> I leave not to their wits,
but consciences to judge.</p>
               <p>12. Matters therefore being impartially
weighed, that triumphing <hi>Epiphonema</hi> of his,
in the fourth and fifth Sections vanishes; in
which himself with admiration exposeth to
the admiration of others, those <hi>great conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
defenders of the doctrine of the</hi> (late)
<hi>Church of</hi> England, <hi>that with such excellent
conduct and valour, and such admirable success
have combated and defeated this our Darling, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility:</hi>
he did ill, and even enviously to
their glory, that he did not name those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies;
for my part, besides the <hi>noble Author</hi>
of the following Discourse, (whom certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he means for one) and by consequence
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> I cannot remember that
ever I heard any great <hi>Elogium</hi> in this respect
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:46209:260"/>
given to any <hi>English writer:</hi> Yet it may be
he might have an eye upon the last <hi>Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Canterbury,</hi> and his late enlarged <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue:</hi>
which if he did, then I conjure I. P.
that he would once more peruse the said
<hi>Arch-bishop</hi>'s <hi>Discourse,</hi> and single from it
whatsoever is impertinent to the main essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<hi>controversie;</hi> that is, whatsoever touches
particular debates of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> about the
<hi>Popes infallibility,</hi> and the exceptions that
may be found against certain <hi>Councels,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
about the several qualities and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
required to an acknowledged <hi>obliging
Councel</hi> (all which things are nothing to the
purpose.) And lastly, that laying aside all
these unnecessary velitations, he would apply
the <hi>Arch-bishops most</hi> efficatious arguments to
an <hi>Oecumenical confirmed Councel</hi> (especially if
he will add the condition too of <hi>being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
received</hi> by the Church) and my life for
his, he will see reason to acknowledge, that
all that discourse is of no force at all against
the <hi>Church,</hi> yea, that the <hi>Archbishop</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
never intended it should. However the
<hi>Calvinists,</hi> or fantastical private Spiritists,
or exalters of humane reason, might deal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the universal authority of <hi>Gods Church:</hi>
the <hi>Prelates</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were too wise to
judge, that people would be so blinde, as
to think any obedience could be due out of
conscience to a <hi>National Church,</hi> begun and
continued upon secular and indeed unlawful
intrests, if that <hi>Church</hi> should build its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
upon a profession of renouncing all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And therfore, though they were very
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:46209:260"/>
earnest in the controversie about <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Authority,</hi> when they were to write or
proceed juridically against <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or
<hi>Separatists,</hi> yet they loved not to talk of it
against the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> yea, it was
from the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> onely, that they
borrowed their Arguments against their
<hi>Schismaticks;</hi> as may in a good measure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the printed Reasons of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Oxford</hi> against the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<hi>Oath,</hi> and Ordinances concerning
Discipline and Worship, approved by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
consent in a full Convocation, <hi>June</hi> 1.
1647,) and it was under the shadow of their
pretence to be still a member of the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> and to have received their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Succession from it, that they obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
good easie <hi>Protestants</hi> to continue their
subjects. But this is but a guesse that <hi>I. P.</hi>
in this passage reflected upon the late <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi>
or any other <hi>English</hi> Prelaticall
Writer.</p>
               <p>13. Certain it is he must intend my Lord
<hi>Falkland,</hi> as one <hi>of the great Defenders of the
Doctrine of the Church of England,</hi> since he
speaks this in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his Discourse of
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> and with an evident design
thereby to recommend both the Author and
his work. This being so, <hi>I. P.</hi> will give me
leave to use his own words. <hi>O the strength of
Reason rightly managed! O the power of Truth
clearly declared!</hi> Yea, O the force of a guilty
conscience! For what else but the irresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power of truth, and evidence of reason,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:46209:261"/>
and acknowledgement of guilt, could move
him so publickly to condemn his own <hi>Church,</hi>
and to confess its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>surpation impossible to be
justified? Behold (O Protestants) how
your <hi>Church</hi> is defended! here is a discourse
that undertakes to demonstrate, (and if you
will believe, your brother <hi>I. P.</hi> has admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and unanswerably performed it) that
upon earth there neither is, nor ever was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Guide,</hi> that could oblige any other to
follow his direction; and that every mans
conscience is to be guided by his own single
naturall Reason, chusing that Faith which is
most agreeable to Nature, and holding it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so long as Nature likes it, and then chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
it for another: In fine, a <hi>Discourse</hi> that
gives you leave, yea, almost invites you, to
return to the <hi>Religion of the old Philosophers,
those Epoptes and Priests of Nature.</hi> If there be
any force in this your <hi>Defenders</hi> discourse,
what becomes of your <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi>
your <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Convocations,</hi> your <hi>Infallible
Acts of Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Proclamations?</hi> It is
evident he might as well, yea more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
have said, That the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> is a
<hi>great defender of the Church of England,</hi> for
that indeed justifies <hi>Ecclesiasticall Authority;</hi>
whereas this discourse directly and purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and universally destroyes it: But the
meaning, or that which should be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>I. P.</hi> is this, That the <hi>Authority of
the Church of England</hi> is impossible to be
maintained: for if (as the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
avows) there be in the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Christ's</hi>
appointment, any <hi>Authority Ecclesiasticall,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:46209:261"/>
in conscience; it is certain it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
but yesterday (and is not now at
all) and when it began, it began by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of all visible authority. Again, if
as this discourse pretends, there be no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
authority (that is, no infallible one;
for surely none can be obliged to an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that confesses it self questionable) then
both the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> and the <hi>Church of
England</hi> are meer names, and verbal sounds,
that signifie nothing. This is so evident,
that it is pitty to insist longer upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
of good I. P. that here publishes
his conviction and confession, and must either
tear out this Preface before such a discourse,
or abjure his <hi>Church of England,</hi> if ever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
again.</p>
               <p>14. By what hath been said it is apparent,
that the doctrine of the <hi>Infallibility of the
Church,</hi> speaking by a <hi>lawful Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,</hi>
is delivered by as full a <hi>Tradition,</hi> as it is
possible for a doctrine to be delivered. And
therefore <hi>Protestants</hi> are inexcusable and
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>since, receiving such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<hi>Books of Scripture</hi> upon no other
grounds, but <hi>Tradition,</hi> they yet renounce
the <hi>Churches authority,</hi> which is more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
and authoritatively delivered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
The same <hi>Truth</hi> is unanswerably,
grounded upon what hath formerly been
proved in this <hi>Book, viz. That it is impossible,
that that which any one àge agrees in, as Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
should not be so, because that would argue,
that some former wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le Age hath agreed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their posterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:46209:262"/>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 15. But perhaps I. P. or his friends
will say, <hi>That</hi> though what hath been asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
may be effectual to demonstrate the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Authority of the universal Church,</hi> yet
not so to demonstrate, that the <hi>Roman</hi> is that
<hi>Infallible Catholick Church,</hi> since the <hi>Greeks</hi>
may put in their plea, at least to be a very
considerable part. That they are not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to submit to the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> though
she should condemn them: For though the
importunate restless malice of som <hi>Calvinisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
spirits</hi> among them hath procured some
uncivil, and indeed unchristian Clauses to be
put into the <hi>English Articles,</hi> derogating from
the <hi>Authority of General Councels;</hi> yet the true
<hi>English Protestant</hi> hath alwaies been ready to
protest submission to the <hi>Universal Church.</hi>
But they are not satisfied, that they ow that
submission to the <hi>Roman;</hi> and if not to the
<hi>Roman,</hi> they know not to what Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 16. To say somthing for the clearing this
difficulty, I shall desire them to consider, 1.
That whilst the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches</hi>
were joyned in one <hi>External communion,</hi> it is
apparent that that <hi>Body</hi> was the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> to which the Promises of <hi>Christ</hi> were
made, and to which <hi>Protestants</hi> themselves
would not have refused submission. 2. That a
breach hapning between these Churches, is
not mortal to the whole <hi>Body,</hi> but onely to
that <hi>Member</hi> that did unlawfully separate. 3.
By consequence, that both the <hi>Title</hi> and real
<hi>Authority of the Catholick Church</hi> remains in
the innocent <hi>Part,</hi> that is, either in the <hi>Roman
or Eastern Church.</hi> 4. That whethersoever
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:46209:262"/>
of these two be the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Protestants</hi> are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> since they are
divided from both, and the pretended
grounds of their <hi>Divisions</hi> are <hi>Doctrines</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by them both. 5. That in case <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Protestants</hi> would now take into debate,
to whether of these two parties they should
re-adjoyn themselves, by that means to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Catholicks again, they must be forced
to quit both a greater number of their <hi>Topical
Doctrines,</hi> and more <hi>fundamental</hi> ones, to fit
themselves to an union with the <hi>Eastern,</hi> then
with the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> 6. That if they
will needs out of <hi>Passion</hi> prefer the <hi>Eastern,</hi>
their <hi>Passion</hi> will be evident, since that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
either remorse of conscience, or
the approaches of death made them see their
unsafe condition, thousands of them have fled
to the <hi>Roman Church</hi> for shelter, but never any
to the <hi>Grecian,</hi> or any other, but the <hi>Roman.</hi>
7. That as long as they are out of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> they are in a <hi>headless trunck,</hi> divided
from the <hi>successor of St. Pèter,</hi> whom St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
St. <hi>Hierome, Optatus,</hi> &amp;c. acknowledged to
be the foundation of <hi>Unity, Order,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 17. Now if among <hi>Protestants,</hi> any out of
a perverse condescendence shal grant that the
grounds alledged for the <hi>separation</hi> of the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
&amp; Western Churches,</hi> are not in themselves
of such main importance, as to hinder them
from being really one <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> And
therefore that before the present controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
can be decided, a general Assembly of
them all must be expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 18. to this they must give me leave
to say. 1. That they make the <hi>Promises of
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:46209:263"/>
Christ</hi> to be casual, temporary and obnoxious
to <hi>critical daies and seasons,</hi> if they think,
that the changes of Kingdoms, or that the
humors of an earthly <hi>Tyrant</hi> can either evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
or suspend the force of those promises by
which <hi>our Lord</hi> hath obliged himself to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
that the <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi> that is, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
<hi>shall not prevail against his Church;</hi> The
effect of which promise, in the opinion of
such <hi>Objectors</hi> must be delayed, till the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> will allow the <hi>Grecian Bishops</hi> to meet
with the <hi>Western,</hi> to consult of, and procure
the peace and union of Christendom. 2. In
case they should be permitted to meet, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
may without the spirit of prophesie
foretel their own most solemn <hi>condemnation:</hi>
For since both the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi>
Churches do already agree in most doctrines
renounced by Protestants. [viz. <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
Adoration of the blessed Sacrament,
Prayer for the Dead, and by consequence a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
(in which souls are capable of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by such Prayers) Veneration of Images,
Relicks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Invocation of Saints, Indulgences,
Merit of good works,</hi> &amp;c.] In which <hi>Doctrines</hi>
they do agree as acknowledging them to be
<hi>Traditionary:</hi> It is impossible they should
ever be perswaded to revoke any of them,
being met in an <hi>Assembly,</hi> unless they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all order and manner of proceeding
in former <hi>General Councels;</hi> which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Method of Protestants. Viz.</hi>
Endlessly to dispute every controverted
Point by Texts of Scripture, but to judge
of the <hi>Truth</hi> of Points, and the <hi>sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                  <pb n="515" facs="tcp:46209:263"/>
by <hi>Traditien?</hi> In such <hi>Assemblies</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Bishops</hi> will ask one another, <hi>Have your
Fathers delivered to you, that Bread, after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
becomes the Body of Christ? That this
body in the Sacrament is to be adored? That we
ought to pray for Souls departed in the Faith of
Christ,</hi> &amp;c.? If so, <hi>Servetur quod traditum est.</hi>
Now it being apparent, that at the present all
agree, that such <hi>Doctrines</hi> both in the <hi>East</hi>
and <hi>West</hi> have been delivered by <hi>Tradition;</hi>
and that their meeting together in a <hi>Councel</hi>
will not help to make a <hi>contrary Tradition pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:</hi>
It will follow, that whether divided or
united, whether alone, or in Assembly, they
are, and ever will be at least so far united,
as to joyn in the condemnation of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</hi>

               <p>1. THe rest of the Preface of I. P. touches
my self onely, and pretends to shew
what success the writings of those great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of the Church of England</hi> have had
against me in particular, forcing me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
That <hi>Infallibility is an unfortunate word:
That Mr. Chillingworth hath combated it with
too great success; so that I would wish the word
were forgotten, or at least laid by,</hi> &amp;c. Now since
the Church is not at all concern'd in this,
but my self onely, who am charged with
writing an incongruous impertinent Book,
a Book that deserves no answer, but answers
it self, since it maintains that which its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
did not combat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Truly, were it
not for I. P. and his friends sake more then
mine own, I would not answer for my self:
But since I perceive, that the word <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is as unfortunate a word to them</hi> as it was to
me, I will endeavour to take order that it
shall be so no more.</p>
               <p>2. First therfore I say with Mr. <hi>Veron,</hi> that the word
<hi>Infallibility</hi> has been found out by the Schools, that
love to find out as short waies to express their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as possibly can be. And the world finds very great
convenience by it: Therefore with reference to the
<hi>Church, Schoolmen,</hi> and from them <hi>Controvertists,</hi> (desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to express the great <hi>veracity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as a <hi>Judge,</hi> or <hi>witness</hi> of <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> deposed
by God with her, and withal the utmost obligation,
that all Christians have to beleeve truths so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
and witnessed by her) found out this
single word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> to express both these
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:46209:264"/>
by: But yet the Church her self hath not as
yet assumed or borrowed this word in any of
her <hi>Decisions</hi> from the Schools: and therefore
being none of the <hi>Churches word,</hi> we are not
oblig'd to make her to speak it: and the truth
is, though it comprehends al that they intend
by it; yet it is no <hi>adaequate measure</hi> of those
conceptions, because <hi>Infallibility</hi> may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
a great deal more; for truth and
our obligation to beleeve it, is yet in a
higher degree in <hi>Scripture,</hi> then in the <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
For the Scripture in all points, both
of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Story,</hi> and all circumstances is
infallibly true: not so the <hi>Decisions</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> in which the simple conclusion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
is onely accounted infallibly true;
not so the principles upon which it depends,
or reasons by which it is proved, and much
less are orders made by <hi>Councels,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon <hi>information;</hi> yet notwithstanding
we cannot finde a more <hi>energetical word</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the unquestionable, and unappealable
authority of the Church, then <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
We may proceed further, and say, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truths,</hi> revealed internally after a <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
manner to the <hi>Prophets, Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. and
by <hi>intellectual images,</hi> are yet more infallible,
then the same truths revealed by words;
becaus words being but the <hi>Images of Images,</hi>
are further removed from that <hi>prime Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar
of truth,</hi> which is God; and besides are
in themselves unavoidably ambiguous, and so
do not convey truth so <hi>infallibly,</hi> as <hi>Internal il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrations,</hi>
yet what can we say more of these,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:46209:265"/>
then that they are <hi>Infallible?</hi> Lastly, there is
no <hi>Image</hi> so perfect, but in as much as it is an
Image, it comes short of the <hi>Exemplar,</hi>
which is truth it self, that is <hi>God;</hi> and by
consequence differs from it: yet the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
title that we can give to God himself,
in this regard, is <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to instance more familiar examples of
the several degrees of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> I am <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly</hi>
assured, that I cannot repeat all the
words I have spoken this last year; and yet
I am more <hi>infallibly</hi> assured, that I cannot
say over again, all I have spoken in my
whole life. I am <hi>infallibly</hi> assured, that if I
threw a thousand dice, they will not be all
sixes; and yet I am more <hi>infallibly</hi> assured,
that the same cast upon so many dice cannot
be a thousand times successively repeated:
Of all these impossibilities I have several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of assurance, and every degree in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sense infallible, but in a severe accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that word, the very highest is not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
<hi>infallible,</hi> because none of the cases
alledged are absolutely impossible, if we
speak of the highest degree of impossibility;
for such imply a flat contradiction, as that a
part should be equal to its whole, or any
thing be and not be at once, a kinde of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
that is appliable even to very few
Demonstrations: we are not so sure that the
light of the Moon is borrowed from the Sun,
or her Eclips by the interposition of the
Earth, yet these are reckoned amongst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
in Astronomy, and no man in
his wits ever doubted of either. Methinks,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:46209:265"/>
if God have furnisht his divine and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
truth, with evidence equal to this,
that the Sun will shine to morrow, or that
there will be a spring and harvest next year,
we are infinitely obliged to bless his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and justly condemned, if we refuse
to beleeve the least of such truths, as shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
less affection to save our souls, then the
dull Plowmen to sow their corn, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
have far less evidence for their harvest,
then <hi>Catholicks</hi> for their faith, they insist not
peevishly upon every caprichious objection,
nor exact an infallible security of a plentiful
reaping next Summer, but notwithstanding
all difficulties and contingencies proceed
chearfully in their painful husbandry; and
here I shall beg leave to ask the Reader this
serious question, supposing (not granting)
that the greatest assurance the Church can
give, (abstracting from the promises of
Christ) be of no higher <hi>infallibility,</hi> then the
lowest degree we have mentioned: would
you venture your soul, that a thousand dice,
being thrown out of a box would come forth
all sixes? Do you not see by this argument,
that it is a thousand to one the <hi>Catholick</hi> is
in the right, and consequently a thousand to
one the <hi>Protestant</hi> is in the wrong, and this
will necessarily follow; for in Religion we
cannot stand by and look on, but we must
absolutely engage on one side, and therefore
it is a desperate shift of such <hi>Protestants,</hi> as
think, that because they see not a clear
demonstration of the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> in
the severest importance of that word, they
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:46209:266"/>
may therefore safely continue in their
schism, unless they be hardy enough to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their souls in a way, where it is at least a
thousand to one they lose them. So that,
though humane wit should by captious obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
seem to trouble the clearness of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (which is in
it self really impossible to be endangered) yet
are the motives of adherence to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
so highly credible (even in a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
&amp; natural consideration) that it were an
absolute madness, to prefer any other separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Church or Congregation, which cannot
pretend to the least credibility to support it.</p>
               <p>3. These things being thus premis'd, since
there are so many degrees of truth, or vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and yet the same word
<hi>Infallibility</hi> applied to them all, it may be
very reasonable, that great <hi>Caution</hi> should be
used in the application of it, that is, that it
should be expressed in what sense and degree
the word is taken before it be urged or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed
upon So that if it be advanced to a
more sublime degree then the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
no wonder if there be misunderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
between Disputants, and not only a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
of <hi>Disputations,</hi> but also an impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of ending them: Now whether it is the
fault of <hi>Catholick Controvertists</hi> for want of
explication and clearing of the sense of this
word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> that hath given an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to <hi>Protestants,</hi> I examine not; but sure I
am <hi>Protestants</hi> have taken advantage from the
ambiguousness of this word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> to
embroile the controversie of the Churches
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:46209:266"/>
authority, and to spin it out endlessly: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
as there is not one <hi>Author</hi> of them I
ever met with, that (treating of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy)
disputes to the point, or so much as
aimes to combat against the <hi>Churches Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
but against an image of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
onely by their own fancies.</p>
               <p>4. For proof of this, (to omit the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Polemical writings</hi> of <hi>Protestants,</hi> who
wast paper and time onely in combating par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
unnecessary points controverted by
<hi>Catholicks</hi> themselves) I shall desire any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
<hi>Protestant</hi> to examine the proceedings
of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and even my <hi>noble Lord</hi>
too, in this little Treatise, and he wil acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
what I say to be true; yet certainly
no English writers ever professed to come
closer to the point, then they.</p>
               <p>5. First for Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> what a brand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> shing
and flourishing doth he keep with his pen, and what
a great proportion of his book is spent in Discourses,
by which he would p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etend to enervate the Churches
Infallibility, which do not so much as approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it? For suppose a <hi>Pope</hi> were <hi>Simoniacally</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or a Bishop unlawfully consecrated, or a
Priest not baptized, or that any of these had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
intention in administring the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> would
the <hi>Church</hi> for all this fail in being an <hi>Infallible Guide?</hi>
or would all Christians be turned out of their way to
salvation? Did not, or might not he easily have been
informed, that excepting in Infants, even <hi>Baptism</hi> it
self, and much less any other <hi>Sacrament</hi> unlawfully
and invalidly administred, do not to such a degree
prejudice the persons, but that the <hi>Votum Baptismi</hi>
will suffice them? And <hi>Simony</hi> does not wipe out the
<hi>Character,</hi> though the Church in detestation of that
crime does in validate the <hi>Popes acts,</hi> and destine him,
when the crime is proved, to a <hi>Deposition.</hi>
                  <pb n="522" facs="tcp:46209:267"/>
And as for my <hi>Lord Falkland,</hi> upon what a
mistaken notion of <hi>Infallibility</hi> he proceeds
in this discourse, let the 27th. and 28th. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphs</hi>
of that Treatise (according to a
more exact impression, 1646) witness, where
enveighing against <hi>Catholicks</hi> for putting <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>
to death; and preventing a Recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for <hi>Calvin's</hi> burning of <hi>Servetus.</hi> And
the <hi>Church of England</hi> executing <hi>Catholick
Priests:</hi> He concludes that passage with
these words. <hi>The Church of</hi> England, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
she may erre, is not so chargeable with any
fault, as those which pretend they cannot, and so wil
be sure never to mend it: And besides, I will be
bound to defend no more then I have undertaken;
which is to give reason, why the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>is not Infallible.</hi> Whereby his Lordship
shews clearly, that in his opinion, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from any, supposed, erronious opinion,
or faulty practice in the Church, was of force
to disprove the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
such an errour or ill practice was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
authorised by any decision of a General
Councel, nor universally spred through the
whole Church, as this example, mentioned
by him, apparently never was.</p>
               <p>6. It was from the like disapprehension
that my self formerly had of the notion of
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> and misapplication of it to
points controverted by <hi>Catholicks,</hi> in which
the <hi>Church</hi> it self is entirely untouch'd, that
I conceived Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s book unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable,
and by consequence was so long
kept at a distance, and disheartned from so
much as taking into debate, whether the
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:46209:267"/>
                  <hi>Catholick Church</hi> was to be considered by me,
when <hi>I</hi> was in quest of a new one; had I
not reason then to say, that <hi>the word Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
was</hi> (not as I. P. quotes me simply,
<hi>an unfortunate word,</hi> but) <hi>to me an unfortunate
word:</hi> not for any fault that was in the word
it self, but for my misinformation and mistake
of the true sense and inportance of the word?
and was it a betraying of the cause or a
confession of guilt, when I said, that Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth had combatted against that word
with too great success?</hi> Success, I mean, not
against the <hi>Church,</hi> but against his own soul,
and the souls of his <hi>fellow-English-Protestants,</hi>
(if I may lawfully call them his fellows)
who conspiring with him in the mistake of
the word, were, and are, God knows, with
him frighted from the <hi>Church,</hi> which is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of the reach of all the shot and noise
that he makes against it. It was therefore
not without cause that <hi>I wished that the word
might be forgotten, or at least laid by,</hi> that is, as
long as <hi>Protestants</hi> do, and will persist in a
wilful mistaking of its sense and notion.
And that this was my meaning, and no
thought of finding fault with the word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
it self, which I acknowledged to be
as fit a word to express the <hi>Authority of the
Church by,</hi> as could be found in one single
tearm, does evidently appear in many passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of my book: and therefore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that wish of mine, and seeming ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to others; yet I my self unawares in all
this discourse till I came to this point, made
use of the same word, but it was with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:46209:268"/>
to say, what I have now said, to
prevent any more mistaking of it. I. P.
therfore, if he well consider it, will finde
little ground to please himself with those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
words of mine, <hi>That Protestants have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very much to say for themselves, when they
are press'd unnecessarily with it;</hi> and therefore
<hi>I desired that they might never be invited to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
the Church under that Notion.</hi> It was pure
pitty to them that I said thus, and not the
least apprehension for <hi>Catholicks.</hi> They have
indeed much to say for themselves, when
they are press'd unnecessarily with it, and
the occasions of their mistaking it not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away; for they will run into endless di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
and such disputes, as <hi>Catholicks</hi> will
furnish them with armes to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
whereas, if they be urg'd to produce
what they have to say for themselves, when
the <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi> speaking in a
lawful <hi>Oecumenical Councel</hi> is objected to
them, they are dumb and ashamed to name
the new, and quickly decrepite <hi>Church of
England,</hi> and its Authority, which vanishes
at the very sight of the Authority of the
<hi>Universal Church;</hi> yea, and as silent will
they be, when they are invited to combat
the <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi> under the notion of
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> so that that notion be first clear'd,
and warning given them to abstain from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying
it to questions, in which onely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> and not the Church it self
is concerned: but indeed, I should not have
said, <hi>They have much to say for themselves,</hi> for,
alas, it is miserably against themselves, in the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:46209:268"/>
highest degree, when they either unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
or wilfully shroud themselves under
ambiguities of words, or when they change
the state of that question, which should
end all questions, either devising or catching
at all advantages to keep them out of Gods
Church.</p>
               <p>7. Upon these considerations, if I said,
that <hi>Infallibility was</hi> (to me) <hi>an unfortunate
word,</hi> had not I reason to say so, since it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
my loss, and caused my delay of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the fundamental happiness of this
and the next world, which is to become a
member of the Church of Christ? This
might have been spoken without any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
or disparagement to the word it self:
as it may be truly said, that <hi>Homousion</hi> (the
Churches own word) was an unfortunate
word to the <hi>Arians,</hi> as likewise that <hi>Theotokos</hi>
was an unfortunate word to the <hi>Nestorians,</hi>
since they would not accept heaven, unless
they might have it without being oblig'd to
receive those words. Therefore I. P. must
pardon me, and give me leave to say more,
that is, that <hi>Infallibility</hi> was an unfortunate
word, not to me onely, but to Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
likewise, and to my <hi>lord Falkland,</hi> and
to I. P. himself, and indeed to all <hi>Protestants,</hi>
since they will needs, to their own great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
make advantage of it, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil
<hi>Controversies,</hi> to multiply objections,
and to exclude themselves from the Church:
and this they do, because they will neither
use nor accept of any other word; And this
word which is in it self, and confined to the
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:46209:269"/>
present acception, very expressive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
they will needs understand in a far
more sublime and comprehensive <hi>Notion,</hi>
then <hi>Catholicks</hi> intend, thinking, that if they
could shew that any particular personal opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> or any practise in the
<hi>Church</hi> did swerve from that rectitude, which
they imagine to be imported by that word
that they had reason to renounce the
<hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> and authority, though
(by being in the <hi>Church</hi>) they would have no
obligation to joyn in such opinions or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises.
What <hi>Protestant</hi> would have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to say, that it doth not belong to the
<hi>Church</hi> to be the <hi>interpreter of Scripture,</hi> or
that acknowledged lawful <hi>General Councels</hi>
are not obliging under the penalty of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<hi>Schism,</hi> that is, damnation? And again,
on the otherside, what one Protestant is
there, who will not protest against the <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of the Church:</hi> and yet this <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in the meaning of the <hi>Church,</hi> neither
dose nor must comprehend more then
is imported by the other expressions? Is it
not apparent therefore, <hi>Since no such word as</hi>
Infallibility <hi>is to be found in any Councel, and
since the Church did never enlarge her authority
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> so vast a wideness, as Protestants will needs
hither to collect from the word Infallibility; but
rather that she does deliver the victory into our
hands, when we urge her Decisions,</hi> that any
<hi>Catholick,</hi> that had any <hi>charity</hi> in disputing
with <hi>Protestants,</hi> would either wholly abstain
from the word it self, or since it is become so
common, and with all so convenient (for no
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:46209:269"/>
other single word can be imagined so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
would, in using of it confine it to its
necessary acception in the present matter,
and so prevent <hi>Protestants,</hi> that they should
not, if they would, make use of it to their
most disadvantagious advantage; And this
latter expedient I have in this review made
use of, keeping the word <hi>Infallibility</hi> (in it
self good and innocent;) yet withal
using caution, that it should not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.</p>
               <p>8. What is now become of your excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
my good unknown friend, I. P.
how impertinent are they, and how harshly
and inharmoniously do they sound? <hi>O the
strength of reason rightly managed</hi> by the Great
Defendors of the English Church! <hi>O the
power of truth clearly declared! That it should
force an eminent member of the Church of Rome</hi>
(alas, eminent in nothing but in miserable
imperfections) <hi>to retract so necessary, so funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
a doctrine, to desert all their Schools, and
contradict all their controvertists?</hi> For is it not
apparent, even from the first impression of
my Book, that it was so far from being true,
that the strength of reason rightly managed
by you, or the power of truth clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by you, compelled me to use such
expressions; that on the contrary, it was
your manifest unreasonableness, and your
wilful mistake of <hi>Truth,</hi> that forced me out
of compassion and <hi>charity</hi> to you [not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
any doctrine of the Church, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
any community in it, but] to temper
what the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Schooles,</hi> and
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:46209:270"/>
                  <hi>Controvertists,</hi> likewise say, to your too much
depraved palats.</p>
               <p>9: Having been so large hitherto, I may the
better dispence with my self to be brief in
what follows. Therefore, whereas in the
sixth <hi>Paragraph</hi> I. P. says, That <hi>it is not the
name or word (Infallibility) that is deserted by
Mr.</hi> Cressy, <hi>but the whole importance and sum
of it; since he does not except against the word,
but to receive it in the sense of Cardinal Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;</hi>
that is, <hi>Infallibilis est qui nullo casu er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
potest,</hi> &amp;c. To this I must needs say,
that truly I. P. is mistaken, for it is onely
the word <hi>Infallibility</hi> that is in controversie,
and that protestants (I do now except Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth,</hi> &amp;c. who are far from being
truly <hi>English Protestants</hi>) do make meer
nominal controversie of this great fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
one: for no argument that ever I saw, is
so much as intended by them to disprove
this truth, <hi>That it belongs to the Church to be
the interpreter of Scripture,</hi> and not to any
private spirit, or natural reason, or this, That
<hi>the Decisions of the Catholick Church in lawful
approved General Councels are not obliging under
pain of Anathema,</hi> incurring of schism, and
by consequence damnation: and it is this, I
say principally this, that the Church under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
by the notion of <hi>Infallibility:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is in your own sense onely, and not
<hi>Bellarmines,</hi> that you will understand those
words of his, <hi>Infallibilis est qui nullo casu erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>e
potest:</hi> for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself, as I have
shewed in my book, acknowledges a <hi>General
Councel to be infallible,</hi> yet not Infallible, as
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:46209:270"/>
the Scripture, that is, <hi>Quod in nullo casu er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
potest,</hi> for the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>Infallible,</hi> not
onely in <hi>Essential Doctrines,</hi> but even in all
<hi>circumstantial, historical passages, phrases</hi> and
and words: whereas <hi>Councels</hi> are onely <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>
in the substance of their Decisions,
the which Decisions, as <hi>Salmanticensis</hi> saith,
are likewise to be extended no further, then
the latitude of the <hi>Heresies,</hi> which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to condemn: but as for other passages

its <hi>conclusive Decisions,</hi> &amp;c. In those it
may be deceived, and much more in orders
and reformations, which depend upon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

great apparent mistake, when you say, that
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> retracts (either the word <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
it self, which he often makes use of, or
or much less) the full importance and sense
of that word, unless you will mean, that he
will not use it in your full importance and
sense; for that he acknowledges he will not;
he is too charitable to you, to justifie or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
you in your mistakes. As for Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth,</hi> my <hi>lord Falkland,</hi> and if there
be any other that proceed upon their
grounds, whom you ought to have called,
not the <hi>Great Defenders,</hi> but <hi>the great Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Church of England</hi>) though they
do indeed mistake the word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it to too comprehensive a sense, yet,
that does not hinder them in their way, for
by making every ones personal reason to
be <hi>judge</hi> and interpreters of <hi>Scripture,</hi> they
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:46209:271"/>
do thereby destroy all obliging authority,
whether fallible or infallible.</p>
               <p>10. In the seventh <hi>Paragraph</hi> the <hi>Author,</hi>
I. P. very rationally, that is, very conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to his most irrational mistaking me.
First imputes unreasonableness to me, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any answer to the arguments, made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that which he confesses himself cannot
be maintained. Hereto, I answer, That 1.
Since it was Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s book, and
not any Prelatical Protestants argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Catholick Churches</hi> authority, that
perplexed and entangled me. And 2. since
I knew that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> beleeved his
arguments unanswerable, not onely by his
Adversary, and such as proceeded upon his
<hi>Adversarie</hi>'s. special grounds, but by any <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
upon what grounds soever; and that
the onely grounds upon which <hi>Catholick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
could be destroyed, were not such as
my <hi>Lord of Canterbury,</hi> &amp;c. proceeded on. <hi>viz.</hi>
To set up a little authority, and seemingly
to contradict an universal one; but onely
such as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> used, <hi>viz.</hi> To dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
every Christian from all authority
whatsoever, as obliging the conscience to the
beleeving of any thing, and making <hi>private
reason</hi> the judge: where was this unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of mine, when I attempted to shew
the world how I came to be undeceived, and
upon what grounds I ceased to think, what
before not I onely, but very many <hi>Protestants</hi>
besides my self, thought; namely, that Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworths</hi>
book did wholly destroy, not only
his mistaken <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but the true real
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:46209:271"/>
                  <hi>Infallibility</hi> or <hi>Authority of the</hi> Church. I am
most assured, if the reasons given by me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
M. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> be indeed concluding,
and my answers to his objections satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that if Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> had been alive
to read my book, and had thought so too,
he would not have made that poor shift that
I. P. hath done, and have said that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
did unreasonably to impugne him.</p>
               <p>11. In the next place forasmuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the manner of my <hi>Answer,</hi> which I. P.
in the eighth <hi>Paragraph,</hi> says is yet more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
In <hi>that I, deserting the Infallibility,
answer onely to the authority of the Church, so
making this authority answer for that Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
I answer, that it was onely a mistaken
notion, that both <hi>I</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
and all <hi>Protestants</hi> have of the word <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
that I deserted, and desire I. P. likewise
to desert with me, but as for the true <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
which is in effect al one with the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the Church, it could never enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my thoughts to desert it, and it proving
to be the very same thing with the <hi>Authority</hi>
of the Church, obliging under damnation,
it is very reasonable, that this <hi>Authority</hi>
should answer for that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and that
<hi>Infallibility</hi> for this <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. As to the <hi>three Absurdities</hi> in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of I. P. following from the unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of my answer; of which the 1. is,
That <hi>after all I have said to Mr.</hi> Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's
<hi>arguments, I must still acknowledge them
unanswerable, as they were intended by him
that made them. 2. That my Answer must be to
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:46209:272"/>
no purpose, because I pretend to answer his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as against the Authority of the Church,
simply considered, without Relation to such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibity,
which were never made against an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
so qualified.</hi> And 3. <hi>That if I intend to
refute all opposition made to the Infallibility of
the Church, by an assertion of its bare authority,
then must I assert that authority which is fallible,
to be as great and as convincing, as that which is
Infallible,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here I answer, that there is no need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further answer, for that which is already
said, demonstrates all these consequences to
be meer mistakes, grounded upon mistakes
Yet, because for good I. P. sake, I am
content to take the pains to say more then
absolute necessity requires; therefore that
which is already said, being presupposed; to
the first pretended Absurdity, I answer.
1. That Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> did esteem
both the Rhetorick and Logick of his Book
prevalent, not onely against Dr. <hi>Potters</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<hi>Adversary</hi> and his grounds, but against
the very foundations of all <hi>Catholick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
insomuch, as he challenges all <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
whatsoever, protesting, that if they be
able to answer, but a very few leaves of his
Book, he will submit and go to <hi>Mass</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
And 2. The truth is, if his posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
grounds of <hi>The Bible, and nothing but the
Bible,</hi> interpreted casually by private reason,
be the onely Rule, not <hi>Infallibility</hi> onely, but
all <hi>Authority</hi> is destroyed: Therefore his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was, that his arguments should have
heir force, not onely against that notion,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:46209:272"/>
which he thought his <hi>Adversary</hi> had of <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi>
but against the thing it self, whether
you will call it <hi>Authority or Infallibility.</hi> And
by consequence, 3. I have no obligation to
think still (for it never concerned me to
think) his arguments to be unanswerable,
as they were intended by himself.</p>
               <p>13. To the second pretended <hi>Absurdity,</hi> I
further answer, that it is true, Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
very often mistakes, even his <hi>Adversary</hi>
in his acception of the word <hi>Infallibility:</hi>
And this I said in general in the Book, and
much more that he mistakes in his applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this mistaken notion to the <hi>Churches
Authority,</hi> or <hi>qualified Infallibility.</hi> But though
I said this in general, you will finde, that
when I come to a particular answer of passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and grounds quoted out of him, they
are such as concern the positive fundamental
grounds of his whole book, and destroy not
onely all Infallibility, but all Authority,
yea, the very being of a Church, whether
<hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Schismatick.</hi> And where I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
particular objections against the <hi>Church,</hi>
I have no recourse to his mistake of <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;</hi>
Therefore my answer is to some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
though many of his objections be to
none, as to <hi>Catholicks</hi> in general.</p>
               <p>14. To the third supposed <hi>Absurdity,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that I had rather think I. P. did read
my Book negligently, then that he would
censure it malitiously, and against his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
if he did read it with care. For it
is evident through my whole book, that my
own thoughts were, &amp;c I have clearly signified
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:46209:273"/>
those thoughts to have been, that <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Authority are in effect all one,</hi> as applyed
to the <hi>Church:</hi> For to say that the <hi>Church</hi>
has authority in a <hi>General Councel</hi> to propose
<hi>Doctrines of Faith,</hi> and to oblige all <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
under penalty of damnation to receive
and beleeve the said <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and withal to
say that she is fallible, and may deceive and
propose falsities for truths, and so propose
them, as that there can be no appeal from
her, would be the extremity of injustice,
and the exalting of a Tyranny more grievous
then <hi>Sicily</hi> ever felt, a Tyranny upon Souls.
I wonder therefore what art it was that I. P.
used, when he extracted out of my book, that
because of the ill use that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
&amp;c. made of the Scholastical word <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi>
exalting it to the supremest degree
that the word could import, that is, to a
degree not at all pretended to by the <hi>Church,</hi>
no nor scarce by the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self, and
therefore I declared my willingness, not to
serve my self of that word, which was none
of the Churches own, and desired others also,
either to abstain from it, or at least to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
such necessary qualifications to it, as
were allowed by the Church, to the end, that
Protestants might see, what it is that they
combat, and ought to submit to. <hi>viz.</hi> The
just and <hi>lawful Authority of the Church,</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
of <hi>Scriptures Authoritatively,</hi> and
proposing of <hi>Doctrines</hi> with absolute obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of beleeving: I wonder, I say, by what
new art he extracted this consequence, that
<hi>I must assert, that that Authority is as great, and
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:46209:273"/>
convincing, which is fallible, as that which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi>
Did I ever deny, or give the least
ground of suspition, that it was in my heart
to deny, the <hi>Authority of the Church</hi> to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in Decisions</hi> propounded by her, as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary?
Is it to say the Church is fallible,
or a Guide that may lead a soul out of the
way, or a Judge capable of mistaking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there may be spread in some places of
the Church some <hi>Opinions (no Decisions)</hi> or
some <hi>practises,</hi> which <hi>Protestants</hi> may account
unwarrantable? No, no, it is meer guilt in I.
P. that made him draw such an inference; he
is loath to see the truth appearing out of
clouds. I may more truly call the word <hi>(In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility)
the Darling of Protestants,</hi> then, as
he does, of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> a Darling to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they can (under the ambiguousness of
it) shelter themselves from truth, obedience,
and salvation.</p>
               <p>15. Now, whereas I. P. in his ninth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph</hi>
professes, that, <hi>having considered the
inconsiderableness of Mr.</hi> Cressy's <hi>answers, and
indeed whole discourse; he changed his resolution
to answer it, as judging it not to deserve an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:</hi>
I have nothing to say but this, that
truly I neither did, nor can commend the
Book to him, as a writing considerable, or that
might deserve his labour to consure it; but
yet if I thought there were no other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to make it inconsiderable, besides
those that he hath taken notice of in his
<hi>Preface,</hi> I fear I should be tempted to think
well of it. However, this I can say confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:46209:274"/>
that notwithstanding any objections
as yet made by him against it, he may, if he
please, resume his resolution to answer it,
without apprehending any guilt, but onely
the choosing so weak an Adversary. But yet
insteed of that, I would rather advise and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
him to read such a <hi>Fundamental Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,</hi>
as this, concerning the <hi>Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
with other eyes and heart then he
has done mine; that is, with a minde dis-in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teressed
and willing to finde the truth by
whomsoever proposed. It is impossible but
that education must needs have given a great
<hi>Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> one way: therefore when he reads any
thing, upon the truth or falsehood whereof
his souls depends, he should rather strain
himself to give a weight to objections made
against any of his settled preconceived opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
then catch at circumstantial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to elude them: if there be any reasons
weakly urged by me, he ought to exercise
his own wit to press them more efficatiously
against himself: but above all things he
ought to pray to God (as God willing, I
shall not fail to do both for him, and all his,
and my friends) that he would increase in his
heart a diffidence of his own judgement, and
an humble pliableness to submit to truth and
authority.</p>
               <p>16. Lastly, Where he concludes with
his testimony of the <hi>invincibleness of my
Lord</hi> Falkland's <hi>Discourses,</hi> especially the
Reply: <hi>I</hi> have no more to say, then what
I said in the beginning, excepting this,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:46209:274"/>
that for the <hi>Reply,</hi> he to whom is was
made is concerned in it: and as for the
Discouse of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> if the noble Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
were alive, I would have presumed
to have had his leave to have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it.</p>

                  <p>The Fundamental ground of my
Lord <hi>Falkland</hi>'s Discourse
Examined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. HAving said thus much to the preface
of I. P. (if these <hi>additional papers</hi> had
not been hastily called for to the <hi>Press) I had
perhaps finished a begun</hi> Discourse <hi>in opposition
to my most dear lord</hi> Falkland's <hi>Theses</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Infallibility; to</hi> each of which I had
determined to have adjoyned an <hi>Antithesis.</hi>
But (so much leasure not being permitted
me) I will content my self at present to
single out the eleaventh Paragraph, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to a former Edition, <hi>An. D.</hi> 1646.)
and to oppose a brief <hi>Answer;</hi> and by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I shall give a vertual satisfaction to the
whole <hi>Discourse;</hi> Because in that one <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi>)
and in scarce any one besides) <hi>is
clearly contained the state of the main Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.
viz. The ground upon which is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
the necessity of an infallible authority in
Gods</hi> Church, and the onely seeming rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
and possible way to avoid and defeat
that authority.</p>
               <p>2. The words of the Paragraph are these,
<hi>The chiefest reason, why Catholicks disallow of
the Scripture for a Judge, is, because when dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
arise about the interpretation, there is no
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:46209:275"/>
way to end them: And that it will not stand with
the goodness of God to damn men, for not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his will: if he had assigned no infallible way
how to finde it.</hi> This is the Allegation of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
in which mention likewise might
have been made of the <hi>writing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
and any thing but the testimony of the
present Church, because reason and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shews that differences will arise about
the interpretation of them likewise, and no
possible way to end them neither, but by a
<hi>present infallible Authority.</hi> To this Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> his lordships answer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
in these words. <hi>I confess, this to be
wonderful true</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>and let them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>cuse themselves that think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
Yet this will be no argument against him,
who beleeves, that to all, who follow their reason
in the interpretation of the Scriptures, and search
for Tradition, God will either give his Grace for
assistance to finde the Truth, or his pardon if they
miss it: and then this supposed necessity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
Guide, with this supposed damnation for
want of it, fall together to the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The fundamental ground upon which
<hi>Catholicks</hi> build the necessity of an <hi>infallible
Authority,</hi> is that Article of the <hi>Creed, Credo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m
Sanctam, Catholicam, &amp; Apostolicam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam,
1. I beleeve one Holy Catholick and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick
Church. I beleeve the Church to be
one, one Body</hi> consisting of many members,
subordinately joyned, and united under <hi>one
Head:</hi> which <hi>Unity</hi> is, especially, in regard
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:46209:276"/>
of <hi>one faith</hi> professed by all, and <hi>one Charity</hi>
chaining all hearts together: Now <hi>one Church</hi>
there cannot be, without <hi>one Faith;</hi> and
<hi>one Faith</hi> cannot be, where differences are
impossible to be reconciled; and no possible
way to reconcile differences, but by <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
and no <hi>Authority</hi> sufficiently efficacious
to this end, but <hi>an infallible one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>I confess this to be wonderful true,</hi> (says
his lordship) <hi>for I am not such a wretch.</hi> &amp;c.
what is it that his lordship confesses? That the
<hi>Church is one Body,</hi> professing one faith? No,
alas! That was no <hi>Article</hi> in his <hi>Creed.</hi> What
then did he so ingenionsly confess? That it
was necessary that differences and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
should be decided? No nor that neither.
The thing that he confesseth with an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled
ingenuity, is, <hi>That, if it be necessary
that differences should be decided and ended, and
that errors should be abolished; God is obliged by
his infinite goodness to make his truth known some
infallible way, by some infallible Guide.</hi> So
that by his lordships acknowledgment, and
by the evidence of reason, if the Church
must have <hi>one faith,</hi> it must have <hi>one infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Guide.</hi> It is therefore this <hi>Unity of the
Church,</hi> that his <hi>lordship</hi> denies to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
yet he would not have denied the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of such an <hi>Unity,</hi> if he could have found an
<hi>infallible Guide;</hi> without which he knew there
could be no unity; but missing of that, and
despising to think of such a blinde, and lame
<hi>Guide as a Church of England or Geneva,</hi> &amp;c.
[none of which could ever end one contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie]
He concludes that there is no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:46209:276"/>
that controversies should be concluded,
Nor damnation for not following the will of
God, since he left no infallible Guide to
lead us to the knowledge of it. A doctrine
so horrid, that it is much more derogatory
to the honour of Christ, then <hi>Arianism</hi> it
self, which though it robs him of his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
yet places him above all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But this denies him even that degree
of common sens, which men of mean capacity
enjoy: for it makes him establish a law with
his own blood, which is neither necessary to
be kept, nor indeed possible to be known;
then which, what can be more absurd &amp; ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous?
The perspicacity of my honored lords
judgment was so imployed in opposition of
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> that I am confident, he never refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon these sad inevitable consequences.</p>
               <p>5. But surely no salvation is to be had
without this unity in divine truth, (as I
have shown at large in my <hi>Exomologesis</hi>)
and onely Christians have <hi>the Depositum of
Divine Truth</hi> entrusted to them: Where then
shall they finde it? In his lordships foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Answer</hi> it is implied, That it is onely
to be found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Traditionary
writings.</hi> But all such writings are obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to variety of senses, and interpretations:
What must be done in that case to finde out
the true Interpretation? for that every body
(says his lordship) must shift as well as he
can; he is to do his best, following the
dictamen of his own <hi>private Reason,</hi> to
finde out the true sense of <hi>Scripture.</hi> And
for his comfort he is to beleeve, that if his
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:46209:277"/>
                  <hi>private Reason</hi> should chance to mis-lead him,
[as ten thousand to one it will] yet there is
no danger at all, let but private Reason do its
best, and he may assure himself all wil be Well:
<hi>Gods infinite goodness would fail, if a Soul, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
so reasonably, should miscarry.</hi> But how
is this confidence of security in following
private Reason grounded? That does not
at all appear, neither in <hi>Scripture</hi> nor <hi>Tradition,</hi>
neither did his lordship seem to imploy the
admirable sharpness of his own <hi>private Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
to search grounds for that, upon which the
Eternal disposal of his soul depended.</p>
               <p>6. That which drove his lordship upon
the rock of <hi>private Reason,</hi> was meerly a
mistake, us may appear to any one that shall
carefully read this small Treatise of his. If
he could have found an <hi>infallible Authority</hi>
[for one less then <hi>infallible,</hi> was to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a ridiculons thing] he would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hord
the though of relying on <hi>private Reason
interpreting Scripture.</hi> He sought after this
<hi>infallible Authority,</hi> but he sought onely there,
where either it was not, or at least it would
require very sharp eyes, and a very unprepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
minde to discover it; Therefore he
streins his <hi>Reason</hi> to prove, that this <hi>infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
is not to be found in the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor in a
<hi>Councel,</hi> at least, not so evident to him, as
to countervail the seeming evidence of the
force of some objections, that he had against
some decisions of Councels, and such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
he must needs have or none; To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
this, he makes use of all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
difficulties and <hi>mullities</hi> that could be
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:46209:277"/>
found against the <hi>legitimation of</hi> a Pope and
<hi>Councel,</hi> and of any erronious opinions, or
unlawful, or questionable practises in the
Church, though never decided, nor warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Church</hi> it self. But there is not
one word in all his <hi>Discourse</hi> against the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
of the <hi>Universal Church</hi> it self, or
of a <hi>general Councel approved of, and received by
the Church.</hi> It seems in his <hi>Disputes,</hi> it had
been his misfortune, chiefly to treat with
those that would urge the <hi>Dogme</hi> of the
<hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> not onely as a <hi>Catholick
Truth,</hi> but also, as a necessary fundamental
established point of <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and not
being fully cleared in the evidence of their
pretentions [a thing not very strange, since
many learned <hi>Catholicks</hi> would furnish him
with doubts, and <hi>Objections</hi> to encrease the
mist and obscurity] he concluded, that
no <hi>Infallibility could any where be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Being thus unfortunately perswaded,
that there was no evidence of an <hi>Infallible
Universal Authority,</hi> plain evident <hi>Reason</hi>
taught him, that there could nor possibly be
any other <hi>Guide,</hi> but <hi>private Reason</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its own light; for this <hi>private Reason</hi>
would never lead him to submit his <hi>Reason to
a Church of England,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> or <hi>Racovia,</hi>
&amp;c. For why to any one of these, rather then to
another? And if to all of them indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then to contradictions, because in many
things they contradict each other.</p>
               <p>8. In this case and circumstances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
his <hi>lordship</hi> argued as reasonably as it
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:46209:278"/>
was possible for one to do, that had mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the first principle; and with the clear
ingenuity of a <hi>truly noble spirit</hi> [not imitated
hitherto by any <hi>Protestant</hi>] he acknowledged
that upon any other grounds but his, the Plea
of <hi>Catholicks</hi> was unanswerable &amp; unavoidable,
that is, unless <hi>private Reason</hi> (following its
own light in the <hi>Interpretation of Scriptures</hi>)
were to be every ones <hi>Guide;</hi> and this being
apparently a most fallible Guide (unless it
were certain, that God would <hi>give his grace,</hi>
that is, good fortune, to assist <hi>private Reason</hi>
in finding the <hi>Truth,</hi> or his pardon in case
it missed of finding it) the pretentions of
<hi>Catholicks</hi> are unanswerable.</p>
               <p>9. Now instead of searching reason to
combat this usurpation of <hi>private Reason,</hi> I
shall beg of all reasonable ingenious <hi>Persons,</hi>
to consider with me, what deplorable case
this was; that he who saw evidently, that if
the <hi>Catholick Churches Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
were opposed, all other <hi>Churches</hi> must
expire; The <hi>Authority of the English Church</hi>
would be an airy fantosm; the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
an abomination; <hi>Amsterdam</hi> a meer
<hi>Bedlam; Racovia</hi> an execration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Should
notwitstanding think, that any one could be
safe in no <hi>Church</hi> at all, and thereupon (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all authority, both name and thing)
should betake himself to the casual conduct
of blinde, humane, <hi>natural Reason;</hi> but <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

Domini abyssus multa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Well; but this conduct of <hi>Reason,</hi> and
this indifferency, as to the point of danger,
Whether <hi>Reason</hi> be a true ar false Guide, must
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:46209:278"/>
be disproved by some infallible way (says his
<hi>lordship</hi> in the beginning of the twelfth Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph)
otherwise none can be condemned,
if they follow it.</p>
               <p>11. For Gods sake, what more infallble
proof can be imagined against it, then this,
That such a <hi>Guide,</hi> such an arbitrary, incertain,
incapable, blinde Guide and interpreter was
never heard of in Christs <hi>Church</hi> till this age,
that it appeared out of the mists of <hi>Polonia.</hi>
Tis true, it has been actually, really follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all sorts of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
though they were asham'd to cal it by his own
name of <hi>private Reason,</hi> for they pretended it
was the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Primative Apostolick Church</hi>
that they followed: but never till this later
Age <hi>private Reason</hi> (as <hi>private Reason</hi>) shew'd
it self in the <hi>Chair of Judicature. A Guide,</hi>
that will lead them (that follow) through
Rivers and Fens, through Woods and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
through Mountaines and Precipices, to
the right hand and to the left, backwards
and forwards, and in a Circle: A <hi>Guide,</hi>
that must never repose, but be continually
travelling, which way it matters not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as secure in Falsehood, as in Truth:
<hi>A Guide,</hi> that can never be confident, much
less secure of the right way, yea, obliged
to be doubtful, that he is wrong: A Guide,
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> never mentioned, and the
<hi>Church</hi> never heard of, but supposed, (by
being called a <hi>Chruch</hi>) that it never should
be hearkned to: so that whether <hi>Scripture,</hi>
or <hi>Tradition,</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> or all of them be
followed, such a Guide ought to be deserted
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:46209:279"/>
and renounced: A <hi>Guide,</hi> that two persons
cannot possibly follow together, because no
two persons (that ever followed any other
<hi>Guide,</hi> beside <hi>Authority</hi>) did, or could think all
things to be reasonable; that any other
thought so: And lastly, by consequence
such a <hi>Guide,</hi> that, as long as he continues
in the office, there cannot possibly be any
<hi>Church</hi> any where. And is not this an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Eviction, that this is an imaginary sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Guide,</hi> since it is impossible, that that
should be a <hi>Guide</hi> appointed for any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
which neither Christ, nor his Apostles,
nor any of their followers ever mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yea, which does formally destroy

               </p>

this is a less unreasonable, and less unsafe

that salvation cannot belong to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that are estranged from our <hi>Catholick
Communion;</hi> we could not be <hi>Catholicks,</hi> if we
said not so: Thereby we approve our selves
to be the lawful children of the <hi>Ancient

protested damnation to all out of their

               <p>4. More particularly addressing my self to
my most dear friends the <hi>English Protestants,</hi>
(of whose communion I once was a seduced
Member) consider, I beseech you, that that
which at the first composing of this Book,
I onely suspected might possibly happen, is
now abundantly effected: God has in part
visited on you the persecution and injustice
you laid upon us: Now do you not see, that
<hi>your Church</hi> was the meer creature of State-Policy?
If it had had the power of Religion;
the decay of your <hi>Ecclestical estates,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
of your <hi>Bishops</hi> would not have
destroyed <hi>Authority</hi> among you: The cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of a <hi>captive Pope,</hi> or <hi>Excommunication</hi> of
<hi>a Synod meeting in a Grot</hi> were as terrible to
irregular, disobedient Catholicks, as if they
had thundred from the <hi>Capitol,</hi> or the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Pallace</hi> in <hi>Constantinople:</hi> Where are
the proofs now of your <hi>Spiritual Power?</hi> Why
do not you thunder out your Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
against the Subverters of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or against your own daily revolting
subjects? Alas, who would be frighted with
such Anathema's? Or what subjects have you
now, after the loss of your temporal <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships?</hi>
And which way shall those Lordships
be regained, that you may become a <hi>Church</hi>
again? Those that were once content you
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:46209:281"/>
should enjoy them, will not adventure their
own estates to recover them for you; the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> are too far off, and the <hi>Calvinists</hi>
too neer; you may comfort your selves with
your <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and perhaps your <hi>Surplices</hi>
worne in private <hi>Conventicles;</hi> But as for a
<hi>succession of Priests</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> that is not to
be hoped, much less a restauration of
your Religion, which is now quite out of
date.</p>
               <p>5. To what <hi>Church</hi> will you now apply
your selves? To the Scotish Kirk, or your
own Presbyterians (the first incendiaries of
all these troubles, the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> that cried
<hi>Exinanite, Exinanite us<expan>
                        <am>

Or to their successors of a thousand names
and shapes, and all of them frighrful? What is
it that holds you from returning to <hi>Catholick
Communion?</hi> What other injuries have we
done you, except that we have forced you
to blush, to see how patiently we suffred your
injustices, oppressions and persecutions? But
the Truth is, <hi>you</hi> were not so much our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors</hi>
as that <hi>poysonous generation of Calvinists</hi>
among you; they were those who instill'd
fury into our Kings and Parliaments, and
poison into the laws against us; Which very
lawes are still kept in force against <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
and the present Governors (who profess <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency</hi>
&amp; an absolute <hi>freedom of Conscience</hi>)
are yet (by a secret transition of some dregs
of <hi>Calvinistical</hi> pollution) become severe
Executioners of their cruelty against us;
By that means destroying the foundation of
their own Religion, and rendring themselves
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:46209:281"/>
obnoxions to be censured by neighbouring
Princes and States, as persons of no faith or
constancy even to their own Principles. But
however it is to be hoped that care will be
taken, that the <hi>Presbyterian banner</hi> shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be displayed amongst you, lest their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fingers prove hereafter more heavy to all
their opposors, then the Prelatical loynes
were formerly. And I cannot but congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
unto <hi>Scotland</hi> their late procured li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
from this more then <hi>Scilician Tyranny</hi> of
<hi>Kirkism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. If those now exauctorated, now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
Presbiterian <hi>Spirits</hi> would hearken
to the advise of one that truly wishes so
well to their souls, that he would willingly
sacrifice his life for their good, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
them to consider how palpably beyond
all other Sects their condition is most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and evidently accursed both by God
and man. For their Dominion and Tyranny
never lasts longer, then during the times
of sedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions, and secret rebellious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Then indeed secular ambitious spirits
(having great use and need of them to
whisper treasons, sow discontents, inflame
revenge, and (under a shew of zeal) root
all charity, obedience, and peacefulness out
of the consciences of the people) do suffer
them to rage; Whilst these plots are agira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
so long they have leave given them to
domineer over the souls of men, and to set
up their abhorrid Tribunals: But when once
their <hi>secular lords</hi> see themselves settled by
their practises; then nothing is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:46209:282"/>
as a <hi>Calvinistical Minister,</hi> witness
<hi>Geneva,</hi> where they have no influence upon
the State; and witness <hi>Holland,</hi> where the
whole Body of their wretched Ministery are
not allowed one single voice in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
nor the meanest Artisan scarce
willing to cast away a daughter upon
them.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Filii hominum usquequo gravi corde, ut quid
diligitis vanitatem, &amp; quaeritis mendatium?</hi> O
my beloved <hi>Countrymen,</hi> How long will you
remain of such stupified, insensible, blinde
hearts? Do not you perceive that it is meer
emptiness that you graspe, and a palpable lie
that you so busily seek; whilst (renouncing
<hi>Christs Authority</hi>) you follow the conduct of
your own <hi>Reason and Spirit?</hi> Are you not
now become like the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> struck
with blindness, yet perswaded that you are
the onely Seers? You cross and justle one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in the way, knocking at all doors,
but the right? How impossible is it that
this blindness, this eternal wandring should
be cured, but by the <hi>Opobalsamum</hi> of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the only spouse of
<hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Church?</hi> Your eyes are not the
onely Organs, but your ears must be used
for the learning of the true way; <hi>Faith comes
by hearing,</hi> not studying or disputing, and
the persons to be heard are those <hi>that are sent,</hi>
that have a <hi>Mission</hi> sealed by <hi>Christ,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
successively from his <hi>Apostles</hi> and by
their Successors. If you would hear, you
would beleeve; And if you would beleeve,
you could not be divided. But you will
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:46209:282"/>
read, and study, and dispute, and the fruit
thereof is not faith, but <hi>science falsely so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
which puffs you up with a vain opinion
of knowledge, and tempts you to study and
dispute without end. Now if you really
beleev'd the Scriptures which you read, you
would hear the Church, that is the onely
safe Interpreter of them. <hi>He that hears you,
hears me,</hi> sayes our <hi>Saviour</hi> to, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his <hi>Apostles</hi> and their <hi>Successors: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
must be <hi>hearers</hi> of their Teachers to the
end of the world: What infinite numbers of
mis-lead souls have continually deceived
themselves into eternal perdition, and all of
them with the <hi>Bible</hi> in their hands, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in their heads and memories? And this
not for want of reading, or disputing, but
of hearing and beleeving.</p>
               <p>8. This is the true and proper Difference
indeed between a <hi>Catholick</hi> and a <hi>Mis-belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi>
The <hi>Bible is a Rule to them both:</hi> but
the sense of the <hi>Bible</hi> is conveyed several
ways to them: <hi>Hereticks</hi> receive it by the
eyes, they deliver it themselves to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:46209:283"/>
greater certainty cannot be given, even <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
themselvs being <hi>Judges.</hi> By this means it
comes to pass, that as it is impossible, that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>
should agree any other way, then in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
So it is impossible, that <hi>Catholicks</hi> should
differ in points of belief; &amp; as it is impossible,
that <hi>Protestants</hi> should be humble, who trust
none, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r rely on any but their own wit and
judgment, (they being their own only Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)
So it is impossible that <hi>Catholicks</hi> should
in this regard be proud, whose wit and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to renounce their own judgment, and
to depose their own wit, and to captivate both
to the obedience of <hi>Faith,</hi> which comes by
<hi>hearing Christ</hi> speak to them by his <hi>Church:</hi>
Lastly, as it is impossible that <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who
follow <hi>private Reason</hi> (which of all others
by a general acknowledgment is the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Guide) should not with their blind Guide
fall into the Pit; so it is impossible, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
(if their works be answerable to their
faith) should not with the Church that
teaches them, attain the glory, which Christ
has purchased for his Elect.</p>
               <p>9. Do not (I beseech you, my dear
friends) look upon this <hi>Characteristical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Catholicks and Hereticks,</hi> as a
new device of our own brain, but as an
<hi>Ensigne</hi> set up by the <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi>
yea, by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> himself, speaking by
his <hi>Choisest Organ St. John the Evangelist.</hi>
(Ep. 1 Chap. 4.) <hi>Ipsi de mundo sunt ideo de
mundo loquuntur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They are of the World,
therefore they speak of the World, and the World
hears them, we are of God: He that hath
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:46209:283"/>
known God, heareth us: Hereby know we the
Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Error.</hi> The
<hi>Apostle</hi> (in the beginning of the Chapter)
had warned the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the multitude of
<hi>Antichrists,</hi> that is, <hi>Hereticks</hi> that were
shortly to infest the <hi>Church,</hi> and to preserve
themselves from their poyson, he advises them
to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> that they might discern the
true from the false. Now to enable them
for this Tryal, he gives this mark of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction:
They, saith he, that is, the <hi>false
Spirits</hi> are <hi>of the world, and they speak of
the world, and the world heareth them:</hi> Their
great <hi>Master,</hi> and <hi>Arch-Apostle</hi> is the <hi>world,</hi>
that is, worldly lust, which (as he said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
were, <hi>The lusts of the flesh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he lusts of
the eye, and the pride of life,</hi> these were the
great <hi>Masters</hi> that taught them their new
Doctrine, and made them renounce the old.
The weariness of an unmarried, or of a
chast life, ambition after great estates, and
scorn to submit themselves to obedience,
these taught new lessons to the <hi>Arch-Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:</hi>
and these lessons they preach to others,
and those that are of the world, and love such
censual conveniences, hear them. Thus is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
begun and continued in the world.</p>
               <p>10. On the contrary, (saith he) <hi>We are of
God, who have conquered the world,</hi> and by
that means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rample on these things; we have
a far more noble ambition: For the reward
that we pretend to, is no less then <hi>God
himself;</hi> And all that <hi>know God,</hi> and know
how to set a value on him, <hi>hear,</hi> and obey us.
Hence he concludes, <hi>Hereby know we the
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:46209:284"/>
Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Error.</hi> But
it may be replyed, That as there are many
true Beleevers much immers'd in the lusts of
the world, so there may be some Hereticks,
that in appearance at least, are in a good
measure free from the same lusts. 'Tis true:
yet those Hereticks do not <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>Ministers</hi>
of Christ; They receive their writings,
they study them, and dispute out of them,
but do not <hi>hear</hi> the true Pastors interpreting
them: Hereby indeed is <hi>known the Spirit of
Truth and the Spirit of Error.</hi> For if they
<hi>without mission</hi> would not pretend to be
<hi>Apostles,</hi> nor deliver their own doctrines out
of the Apostles writings, but have humility
to hear the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their <hi>Successors,</hi> and
Faith to beleeve them, they would never be
obnoxious to this Spirit of Error.</p>
               <p>11. To conclude, (my dearly beloved
Friends) instead of examining those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>marks</hi> of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false Churches,</hi> and <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
extant in Books of controversies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
your selves with this <hi>Catholick mark</hi>
given by the <hi>Apostle</hi> in his <hi>Catholick Epistle</hi>
to all Christians to the worlds end; Would
you know where the <hi>Spirit of Truth is?</hi> It is
not among them that accept, and read, and
study the Scriptures; for then what would
be <hi>Heresie?</hi> Do they not in all their wandrings
and mazes carry the <hi>Bible</hi> with them? And
the <hi>Bible it self</hi> (as they use it) leads them to
destruction; For Lust, Ambition, Curiosity,
Covetousness, or Pride, (either blinding
them or staining their eyes) makes them
think they see in Scripture that which
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:46209:284"/>
foments, and encreases those Passions;
Whereas if (having their <hi>eyes</hi> open to read
the <hi>Bible</hi>) they would keep their <hi>ears</hi> open
likewise to hear the Church interpreting it,
it is not possible they should erre, or be at
variance about the mysteries of Faith. God
Almighty, of his infinite goodness, clear
your eyes, and open your ears, that you
may see and hear, and live for ever.</p>
