         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

them selues bold vpon the successe of
some mightie treason, the bottome
whereof hath not yet bene throughly
searched. Of late hath bene published
out of Scotland, a treatise detectyng
the foule doynges of some that haue

by which detection is induced a very

chaunge Quéenes or no, and therwith

man to pray hartely for the long

discredit the same detectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as vntrue.
Some of them, whyle they lyke good
sincere men forsoth, would fayne seme
very indifferent iudges, say they will
credit nothyng till they heare both
parties, not remembryng that in the
same one booke are both parties to be

both in the declaration and oration
of euidence: the other in the latter
part, in the parties owne contractes,
songes, letters, iudiciall procedynges
protestations, examinations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.
Some other more open fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
say flatly that all is false, the
booke hath no credit, the authour is
vnknowne, obscure, the matter coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite,
and all is nothyng. If any
such rumors come to your eare, first
I thinke verely in truth you may be
bold to say to the partie <hi>Et tu ex illis

for the matter I haue thought good to
enforme you of so much as I know
for profe of the same treatise to be of
credite, wherwith you may aunswere
and stoppe the mouthes of such ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor

spreaders.</p>
            <p>The booke if selfe, with the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of euidence, is written in Latine
by a learned man of Scotland M.
George Buchanan, one priuie to the
procedynges of the Lordes of the
Kynges secret Counsell there, well
able to vnderstand and disclose the
truth, hauyng easie accesse also to all
the recordes of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey that might
helpe hym. Besides that the booke
was written by hym, not as of hym
selfe, nor in hys owne name, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
to the instructions to hym
geuen by common conference of the
Lordes of the priuie Counsel of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
by him onely for hys learnyng
penned, but by them the mater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
the booke ouerséen &amp; allowed,
and exhibited by them as mater that
they haue offred and do continue in
offeryng to stand to and iustifie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our soueraigne Ladie or her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
Commissioners in that behalfe
apointed. And what profe they haue
made of it already, when they were
here for that purpose, and the sayd au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

<pb facs="tcp:22828:4"/>
them, when both parties or their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

indifferently to be heard, and so were

easely gather by our sayd soueraigne
Ladyes procedyng sins the sayd hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng

neuer haue so stayed her request, but
rather would haue added enforcement
by ministring of aide to the Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

in such good amitie with the yong
kyng of Scotland, the Regentes, &amp; the

if these haynous offenses alleged on
that part had not ben prouable, or if
the yong Kyng had ben an vsurper, or
hys Regentes and other Lordes of
that faction traytors, as they must
haue ben if all be false that is obiected
<pb facs="tcp:22828:4"/>
agaynst the sayd Ladie Marie. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
not what subscriptions &amp; assentes
haue ben to confirme the booke and the
maters in it conteined, Byside that I
do you to wyte that one written copie
thereof in Latine was now vpon hys
late apprehension found in one of the
Duke of Norfolkes mens houses, and
thether sent by his commaundement
a litle before his apprehension to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie
kept there, with diuers other
pamphelets and writynges. Whiche
thyng not onely addeth credit to this
booke that it was not counterfait, but
also geueth shrewed suspicions that
the Duke could not so well lyke the
woman beyng such a woman, as for
her persons sake to venture the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of such a florishyng state wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he stode before, but that some other
greater thyng it might be that he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
the gredynesse whereof myght
temper his abhorryng of so foule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
&amp; of so great a danger to hym
selfe to be sent after his predecessours.
The Byshop of Rosse lykewise doth
both knowe that the Duke had this
booke, and can tell how the Duke
<pb facs="tcp:22828:5"/>
came by it.</p>
            <p>The other mater of the contractes,
letters, songes &amp;c. haue, among other,
these proues. Liuely witnesses of great
honor and credit can tell that the very
casket there described was here in
England shewed, the letters &amp; other
monumentes opened and exhibited,
and so much as is there sayd to haue
ben written or subscribed by the sayd
Ladie Marie, the Erle Bothwell, or
other, hath béen by testimonies and
othes of men of honor &amp; credit of that
contrey, testified and auowed in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of persones of most honorable
state and authoritie to haue ben writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
&amp; subscribed as is there alleged, &amp;
so deliuered without rasure, diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
addition, falsifieng or alteration
in any point. And a number there
be in England, of very good and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shypfull
callyng byside the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
thereto apoynted, that haue
séene the originals them selues of the
same handes whoes this booke doth
say them to be. Whiche thinges haue
been heard and vnderstoode by these
that can tell, and those whoes truth
<pb facs="tcp:22828:5"/>
in reportyng is aboue all exception.</p>
            <p>Wherefore sithe the Scottishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
haue, for satisfaction of vs their
good neyghbours, among whom the
sayd Ladie Marie remayneth to the
perill of both Princes as the Scottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

the intent that the impudencie of the

diuertyng of affections to vndue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and to the great perill of both
Realmes, which the aduersaries call
beneficiall vnityng, but is in déede
most maleficiall confoundyng, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to ioyne the Realmes in other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones,

of the other side haue banded them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

            <p>This I haue thought good to write
<pb facs="tcp:22828:6"/>
to you for your satisfaction in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the case, whom I know alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

hollow hartes, or rather God graunt
her Maiestie, and those that be in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
vnder her, an earnest will to
sée them, for they will disclose them
selues fast enough. And God send her
Maiestie so to remoue the groundes of
her perill, that not onely we which
by open thrustyng our selues agaynst
her enemyes haue set vp our rest vpon
our Quéene Elizabeth, and shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be admitted to fauour on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may know that it shalbe safe to be
true, &amp; daungerous to be false. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the mischief is euident. For men
in nature and in policie will seke for
their own safeties, which if they may
not finde in truth, it is a great auaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement
of falsehode. God long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
our good &amp; gracious Quene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
and make her enemyes know

Iames, sometime Earle of Bothwell,
yeid about by indirect and coloured
meanes, to colour, and hold backe the
knowlege of the truth of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

their hartes were fully perswaded, of
the authors &amp; deuisers of that mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous,
and vnworthie fact, awaityng
while God should moue the hartes of
some to enter in the quarell, for reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng
